Campaign money critic Mike McCabe says cash-strapped Wisconsin towns ""tearing up” paved roads and replacing them with gravel
","
Folks aren’t afraid to speak their mind at Fighting Bob Fest, an annual political gathering in Madison, Wis.

The event is named for Robert LaFollette, a fighter of corporate power and political corruption who served as governor, congressman and U.S. senator from Wisconsin in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Among those who spoke at the festival on Sept. 17, 2011, was Mike McCabe, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in state politics and advocates for campaign finance reform. The nonprofit Madison group is affiliated with left-leaning organizations such as public employee unions.

During one portion of McCabe’s fiery, 22-minute speech, it wasn’t a question of whether he made a statement worth fact checking, but which one to look at.

In rapid-fire approach, he likened campaign contributions to legalized bribery; called the state’s new voter photo ID law a ""poll tax""; and branded as ""protection money"" campaign contributions from David Koch to the Republican Governors Association and from the RGA to GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.  

McCabe also made a factual claim that was, if less explosive, still intriguing.

The state’s 2011-2013 budget, he said, includes a ""15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel because the money is steered to private contractors instead, not to the local road crews that work for the townships and for the county.""

Towns tearing up paved roads and turning them into gravel?

McCabe’s statement -- which was picked up by the liberal Daily Kos, a national website that does political analysis -- includes two pieces, the increase and the shift to gravel roads:

15 percent highway increase

McCabe cited a document produced by Walker’s office on his 2011-2013 budget proposal. It shows that Walker proposed increasing spending on state highways by $410.5 million, or 14.7 percent, ""over base amounts."" And he pointed out that state money spent on highways goes to private contractors as opposed to local governments.

That figure, however, shows just one piece of a much larger pie. The full pie includes not only general tax money -- the ""base amounts"" -- but also cash the state borrows for highway improvements.

Department of Transportation budget director Paul Hammer cited a different DOT document that was also provided to us by Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie.

It shows the 2011-2013 budget spends $3.23 billion on highways. That is actually less than what was spent in the previous budget, under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, which was $3.27 billion -- although that figure included $91 million in one-time federal stimulus funds.

So, McCabe cited a figure that the Walker administration used to suggest it was increasing spending on highways. But the total highway spending isn’t a 15 percent increase, but actually a decrease, so McCabe’s first claim is wrong.

Converting paved roads to gravel

In telling his audience ""we’ve got towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel,"" McCabe waved a copy of the Sept. 8, 2011, edition of Isthmus, a weekly Madison newspaper. It carried an article about state budget cuts to villages in the Madison-area.

McCabe cited a portion of the article about Rick Stadelman, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association, which said: ""Stadelman says he knows of several townships with blacktop roads in need of repair that have opted to dig out the blacktop and go back to gravel.""

We asked Stadelman which towns were converting paved roads to gravel. Noting that 40 percent of Wisconsin’s 62,000 miles of town roads already are gravel, he said he has heard towns talking about doing such conversions, but could recall only one that had: Mukwa in Waupaca County in east-central Wisconsin.

You can probably see where this road is leading.

Jim Curns, Mukwa’s town chairman, told us the town did convert a quarter-mile section of one little-used road from blacktop to gravel. But not as a result of Walker’s budget. He said it was done three to five years ago -- while Doyle was governor -- because the town couldn’t afford to repave it.

To see whether other communities are converting paved roads to gravel, we checked with Dan Thompson, executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, and John Reinemann, the Wisconsin Counties Association’s legislative director.

Both said they heard of isolated cases in recent years in which towns converted small sections of roads to gravel, but saw no evidence of a trend and nothing related to the 2011-2013 state budget.

We looked some more and found that the Town of Saukville in suburban Milwaukee and the Town of Verona in suburban Madison are considering converting paved roads to gravel.

But they haven’t done any yet.

On that score, Wisconsin appears different than some of its neighbors.

The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2010 that paved roads were being torn up across rural America and ""replaced with gravel or other rough surfaces as counties struggle with tight budgets and dwindling state and federal revenue."" And in March 2011, the Minneapolis Star Tribune described how financial issues led Michigan to change more than 100 miles of paved road to gravel and that an estimated 120 miles of pavement have been ground up or left to crumble back to gravel in North Dakota.

Larry Galehouse, director of Michigan State University’s National Center for Pavement Preservation, which advocates for maintaining highways in order to reduce the need for reconstruction, told us: ""This trend has been happening in many states, but primarily on very low volume roads and streets.""

He had no examples of roads being converted to gravel in Wisconsin.

Our conclusion

McCabe claimed the state budget includes a ""15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel because the money is steered to private contractors instead.""

McCabe relied on a budget proposal document that didn’t spell out the full amounts spent on highways. State spending on highways in the new budget is actually down slightly from the previous one.

McCabe also relied on a statement by a towns association official who could cite only one example of a paved road being converted to gravel -- and that occurred years before Walker was elected governor. The other experts we consulted said there is no trend in communities tearing up pavement and putting gravel in its place.

Head of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement says federal law prohibits granting in-state tuition to undocumented students
","
The Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education’s unanimous vote Monday night to extend in-state tuition rates to undocumented students is drawing fire from the leader of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, who says it violates federal law.

RIILE’s executive director, William T. ""Terry"" Gorman, made the claim Sept. 21 in an interview on Channel 10, and repeated it to the Board of Governors and some 400 people who crowded into the gymnasium at the Community College of Rhode Island before the board’s vote.

Granting in-state tuition rates to undocumented students violates federal law, Gorman said on Channel 10,  ""because the law says that you can't give in-state tuition to an illegal alien . . . unless you first offer it to any other student regardless of their state of residence.""

If Gorman is right, a high school graduate from New Jersey would have to be granted in-state tuition in Rhode Island before the public colleges could offer the same tuition break to a Rhode Island high school graduate who is undocumented.

We decided to check it out.

First, some background.

The Rhode Island policy

Out-of-state students who enroll at one of Rhode Island's three public colleges -- the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College or the Community College of Rhode Island -- pay more than double the in-state rates.

At URI, for example, Rhode Island students pay just under $11,400 in tuition and fees, compared with about $27,400 for out-of-state residents.

A study conducted by the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University showed that 74 undocumented students were attending one of the three public institutions of higher education in Rhode Island in 2009. The study predicts that number will grow by 24 with the in-state tuition policy.

Federal law prohibits undocumented students from receiving federal funds for college, such as Guaranteed Student Loans and Pell Grants. To qualify for those funds, students must be either U.S. citizens or immigrants granted permanent residency.

The policy the board approved Monday allows undocumented students who have attended a Rhode Island high school for at least three years, and continue to live in the state, to be eligible to pay the in-state rate.

The students are required to file an affidavit with the college or university stating that they have applied to legalize their immigration status or will apply as soon as they become eligible to do so.   

The state Board of Governors’ eligibility criteria are very similar to those in a California law, enacted in 2001, which allows illegal or undocumented students who meet the eligibility requirements to pay in-state tuition.

In Rhode Island, legislation to extend in-state tuition to undocumented students has failed in the General Assembly every year since 2004, but the Board of Governors took up the issue as a matter of policy.

The board has amended its in-state tuition policy six times since 1971. One of those changes, in 2003, allowed certain classes of refugees who have lived in Rhode Island for at least one year to be eligible for in-state tuition rates.

The federal law

Gorman contends that the only way public colleges can allow undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates and still comply with federal law would be to offer the in-state rate to all students who are citizens, regardless of whether or not they live in that state.

That’s essentially the same argument made by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that seeks to stop illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration, and which unsuccessfully challenged in-state tuition laws in Kansas and California. (More on those later.)

The federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Reconciliation Act of 1996 -- codified in Title 8, chapter 14 of the federal code -- sets out the conditions for granting  post-secondary education benefits to illegal immigrants based on residence in sections 1621 and 1623.

Section 1623, which Gorman cited, states that someone who is not lawfully in the United States ""shall not be eligible on the basis of residence . . . for any post-secondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.""

The section goes on to say that states can grant undocumented immigrants public benefits that they otherwise would not qualify for if the state enacts a law to do so.

To date, 12 states, including Connecticut, have enacted laws to allow undocumented students to be eligible to pay in-state tuition. The others are California, Texas, Utah, New York, Washington, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Maryland.

(A similar law in Wisconsin enacted in 2009 was repealed this year.)

Legal challenges

The Federation for American Immigration Reform filed suit in federal district court in Kansas contending that Kansas’ in-state tuition law discriminated against U.S. citizens who lived outside of Kansas.  

A federal district court judge in 2005 denied the plaintiffs’ claims without ruling on the merits of the case. Rather, the judge said the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue in federal court.

The following year, the group filed suit on the same grounds in California. The case eventually wound up in the California Supreme Court, where the judges ruled in 2010 that the California law was not discriminatory and did not violate federal law.

The judges based their ruling on section 1623 of the federal law, which states that someone who is in the country illegally cannot be eligible for any post-secondary benefit on the basis of residence. 
In their decision, the California judges concluded that the basis upon which California granted the in-state tuition exemption -- which includes having attended a California high school for at least three years and obtaining a high school diploma or GED from California -- constituted criteria other than residency.  Therefore, the judges wrote,  ""it does not violate section 1623.""

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case on appeal.

The California court did not, however, rule on whether granting in-state tuition for undocumented students amounted to a ""benefit"" as defined in the federal law. That remains an open question.

Legislation to either restrict or permit access to public education for undocumented immigrants is currently pending in several states.

And groups on both sides of the issue are mounting more legal challenges.

Judicial Watch, a Washington-based conservative legal group, challenged Maryland’s in-state tuition law. A state court dismissed the suit for lack of standing; the group is appealing.

A Rhode Island wrinkle?

One aspect of Rhode Island’s situation that could complicate matters if the policy is challenged in court is that Rhode Island -- unlike the other 12 states -- never passed a state law.

The 1996 federal law (Title 8, section 1621) says that a state can provide someone who is in the country illegally with state or local ""benefit"" for which they would otherwise be ineligible -- but only if the state enacts legislation to do so.

The question not yet answered by the courts: Is in-state tuition a ""benefit"" under the law the same as welfare or unemployment compensation?  And if so, does Rhode Island need to enact a state law to grant it to undocumented students?

Our ruling

The practice of offering in-state tuition to undocumented students promises to be the subject of more court battles. For now, though, Gorman’s statement that granting in-state tuition violates federal law should be evaluated in light of three key facts:

* The only court which has directly addressed whether granting in-state tuition to undocumented students conforms with federal law is the California Supreme Court. And that court ruled there was no violation of federal law.

* The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the California decision, so the decision stands.

* A dozen states have enacted state laws to support tuition policies similar to the one approved in Rhode Island. In two states -- California and Texas -- the laws have been in effect for a decade. None has been successfully challenged.

While we reserve the right to reconsider the issue if further court challenges yield different results, for now we rule Gorman’s statement Mostly False.

Update: On Oct. 2, 2011, we revised the wording of one of the key facts in our ruling to make it clear that a dozen states have enacted state laws to make undocumented students eligible for in-state tuition at public colleges.

Should Mary Nolan get credit for curbside recycling in Portland?
","
Before Mary Nolan was a state legislator running for Portland City Council, she worked many years for the city of Portland. While there, she was in charge of two departments: sewers and public works maintenance.

Nolan is not shy about bringing up the municipal part of her resume. The following is listed on her campaign website and on her Facebook campaign page:
  
""As the head of the Bureau of Environmental Services and earlier as Director of Public Works Maintenance, she helped lead landmark improvements in protecting the Willamette River and environment, launching curbside recycling, repairing Portland roads and bridges, and managing public resources to save millions of dollars while bringing projects in on-time and on-budget."" 

That’s a lot of landmark public deeds to absorb. So we’ll focus on just one of her cited accomplishments: Did Nolan help lead the launch of curbside recycling?

Portland residents started recycling from their homes in the late 1980s, back before Nolan entered the recycling scene. In 1983, the state mandated that cities offer the service to residential customers. Portland adopted a system effective June 1, 1987. But it was a free-market system with multiple haulers servicing the same blocks and recycling results were scattered. The companies picked up newspapers weekly and metal, glass and cardboard monthly.

In short, the initial system wasn’t very effective. In February 1992, the city rolled out a new residential recycling program. Households received two bins for recyclables. Milk jugs and magazines were added to mix. But here’s the critical difference: Haulers were allocated their own section of the city, and they were required to collect recycling every week, the same day as trash collection.

""The overhaul that was instituted in 1992, it was game changing. It was a fundamental shift,"" says Bruce Walker, the city’s solid waste and recycling manager who was back then part of a small team charged with making the change happen.

His boss at the Bureau of Environmental Services, which managed recycling at the time, was Sue Keil. Keil said she had been tapped by then-Commissioner Earl Blumenauer to oversee the new recycling system. Nolan, tapped to lead the bureau in mid-1990, was Keil’s boss.

""Certainly Mary was not, as you say, involved in the day-to-day decision making, but I was talking to her about it, and it was on her watch,"" Keil said. ""It’s entirely fair to say this happened on her watch and with her support."" 

In a similar PolitiFact, we gave Portland mayoral candidate Charlie Hales a True for saying that he led on the issue of racially diversifying the Fire Bureau in the early 1990s. As the elected commissioner in charge of the bureau, Hales hired a new fire chief to come to Portland and shake up the bureau. We found that Hales was correct to claim credit.

Nolan, on the other hand, was not a commissioner in charge. She was a bureau director carrying out the order of a commissioner and city council. And on the flip side, Nolan wasn’t even the person directly responsible for revamping the recycling system. That person was Sue Keil.

It’s hard for us to let Nolan take credit when she was neither an elected official or civic body giving the order, nor the person handling day-to-day duties.

Let’s also remember that Portland had a curbside recycling system before Nolan. We know it was clumsy and disorganized and hardly resembled what we have today, but the word ""launch"" makes it sound as if she initiated curbside recycling.

Nolan says she ""helped lead landmark improvements in … launching curbside recycling."" We find this statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/oct/01/mary-nolan/should-mary-nolan-get-credit-curbside-recycling-po/
"['Jobs', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says private sector in Texas created 1 million jobs
","
On the CNBC morning show Squawk Box, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry made a claim on Texas job growth that sounded a lot like something we’ve checked before, with a twist. 
Noting that Perry has said on the campaign trail that government doesn't create jobs, interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin told the Texas governor that over Perry's 10-plus years as governor, his state's total number of government jobs had increased 19 percent, while the private sector saw only a 9 percent bump. 
""How do you square that circle?"" Sorkin asked. 
Perry responded: ""Well, our teachers in Texas are public employees, so we've had a huge influx of people into the state of Texas, so you have to have more teachers obviously to do that as well. But the private sector job creation over the last … 10 years has been 1 million jobs created, while this country lost 2.5 million. So we square that rather well with the rest of the country."" 
Perry made a similar claim about Texas job gains during the Sept 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Reagan presidential library in California, although he didn't say he was talking specifically about the private sector. ""When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas,"" Perry said. ""At the same time, America lost 2.5 million."" 
We rated that Perry claim Half True. His figures — on the change in job numbers between December 2000, when Perry took office, and July 2011 — basically held up, but his statement had weaknesses. 
For instance, more than 20 states enjoyed net job gains over the same period, so the governor of any one of them could make a similar boast, leaving the misimpression that only his or her state gained jobs while the rest of the country lost jobs. For example, using the Perry campaign's methodology, Alaska created 43,700 jobs during Perry's time in the governor's office while the rest of America lost 1.4 million. 
Also, the Texas economy was rocking before Perry became governor. And, generally, many are skeptical about how much influence governors have over their state's economy. 
For this article, we wondered whether the roughly 1 million net increase in jobs in Texas during Perry's tenure all occurred in the private sector, as Perry told Sorkin. 
Precisely, the number of jobs in Texas increased by nearly 1.1 million between December 2000 and July 2011. In the period, government sector employment grew by 286,000, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data and agency economist Cheryl Abbot. The BLS data on government workers contains federal, state and local employees, including postal workers but excluding military personnel. 
The Texas breakdown: 
Federal government: Increase of 19,900 jobs
State government: Increase of 51,000
Local government: Increase of 215,100 
Private industry was responsible for the rest of the state's net increase in jobs, or about 790,000 positions, 73 percent of the total. 
According to the BLS data, the private sectors that experienced job increases during the 128-month period were education and health services (404,900 increase), categories that do not sweep in jobs in public schools or hospitals; leisure and hospitality (215,200); professional and business services (196,800); trade, transportation and utilities (107,300); mining and logging (99,200); financial activities (57,500); construction (17,600); and other (18,400). 
Two sectors saw job decreases: manufacturing (233,400 drop) and information (91,100). 
Our ruling 
Perry cited a figure for private-sector jobs that he's previously used to describe total employment gains. That could lead close followers of his campaign with the misimpression that nearly all the job gains were in the private sector. To the contrary, government jobs represented about 27 percent of the total. 
But even though Perry was off by 200,000, he was in the neighborhood on his million-jobs statement. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-private-sector-texas-created-1-mil/

Chain e-mail claims Florida is the first state to require drug testing for welfare
","
""Hooray for Florida !!!!""

A recent chain e-mail cheers on the Gov. Rick Scott policy that may need it least — drug-testing needy Floridians who apply for cash aid.

The new law, signed by the governor May 31, 2011, got a thumbs-up from 71 percent of Floridians in a September 2011 poll, including 90 percent of Republicans.

The viral e-mail message lays it on thick, beginning: 

""Great going, Florida. You set the stage for the other 49 States to join! Kudos to Republican Governor Rick Scott for having the correctness and guts to move forward on this critical issue !

""Hooray for Florida ! !

""I-95 will be jammed for the next month or so........Druggies and deadbeats heading North out of Florida ..

""Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!""

Our eyes lit upon the message's first factual claim: ""Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!""  
Is this true?

We asked some experts, but not before doing a quick Web search to see if we might find some of the message's genesis. At least three sentences of the chain e-mail, it turns out, appear to be lifted directly from a June New York Daily News article. But that article doesn't address the claim we're checking, that Florida ""is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare.""

For that, we turned to the Florida Senate's final analysis, the National Conference of State Legislatures and the American Civil Liberties Union.

Florida's law deals with part of what used to be known as welfare: It's a cash assistance program funded by federal block grants called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Back in 1996, as part of federal welfare reform, the government told states they could use drug testing as part of eligibility for the block grant programs. (On the other hand, they weren't allowed to add new hurdles for collecting food.) Florida's law requires applicants for cash aid to pay for their own drug tests. If they pass, the cost of the testing is added to their benefits. If they fail, they're disqualified from cash aid for a year, though with drug abuse treatment they can reapply in six months. The caseload is now down 11 percent from September 2010.

Was Florida the first to try such testing, more than a decade after welfare reform?

The answer is no. Michigan instituted mandatory drug tests for all welfare applicants — in 1999. 
But that kind of ""suspicionless"" testing, without any reason to believe people were using drugs in the first place, was struck down in 2003 by a Michigan appeals court. That discouraged other states. So while many have considered more drug-testing since the '90s, very few have passed laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that represents state lawmakers. A 2002 survey, for example, showed that a handful of states — such as Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and Wisconsin — tested only people who have been convicted of a drug felony.

Still, the proposals, sometimes pitched as a cost-saving measure, are popular. In 2009, more than 20 states proposed requiring drug tests as a condition of eligibility for public assistance, according to NCSL. In 2010, at least 12 did. No laws emerged. But this year, with at least 36 states considering drug-testing proposals, three are now law. In addition to Florida's mandatory suspicionless testing, Arizona and Missouri now screen applicants they have reasonable cause to believe are taking illegal drugs, though Arizona's requirement is temporary.

Meanwhile, Florida's law — the first requiring testing regardless of suspicion since Michigan's program was struck down — is under legal challenge. The ACLU has sued Florida to stop what it considers ""unreasonable and suspicionless searches"" that violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
Our ruling

In 1996, Congress said states could test welfare recipients for illegal drug use. In 1999, Michigan was the first state to require all applicants to take drug tests, regardless of suspicion. But that law was struck down as unconstitutional, discouraging other states from requiring similar testing. This year, Florida became the first state to try mandatory drug screening of all applicants after Michigan's legal loss, while Arizona and Missouri enacted laws to test applicants they suspect might use drugs. A chain e-mail claims, ""Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!"" It is the first one — since the last one, which was Michigan. Meanwhile, other states also require drug-testing for some applicants. We rule this e-mail's claim False. ",/factchecks/2011/sep/30/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-florida-first-state-require-d/

President Barack Obama has declared disasters in how many states?
","
To hear Harry Reid talk about the Federal Emergency Management Agency, you'd think the entire nation is one big disaster area.

The Senate Democratic leader spoke on the Senate floor on Sept. 26, 2011, arguing for House Republicans to break a deadlock and approve a bill funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The standoff was part of another fight that threatened, briefly, to shut down the federal government. That has been averted for now with an emergency spending bill.

In arguing for passage of the FEMA funding, though, Reid insisted the money was necessary, given how many disasters have plagued the country this year:

""The legislation also includes $3.65 billion in funding for FEMA, which will give American communities ravaged by floods, wildfires and tornadoes the help they need. We know House Republicans support that funding level as well, since they voted for it last week. Democrats would have given FEMA more, since President Obama has declared disasters in 48 of 50 states this year.""

Forty-eight of 50 is, well, a heck of a lot of disasters. Has the nation suffered that much?

FEMA’s website tracks all disaster declarations, listing them by state, by year and even by type of disaster.

The federal declaration is a formal process, usually on the heels of a state's own emergency declaration, that triggers federal money to repair things such as hospitals, schools and city halls. It also pays for small business loans and provides assistance to individual households in the form of crisis counseling, legal services and even rent money for people who have been displaced.

According to FEMA’s website, 42 states had federally declared disasters in 2011. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Irene alone accounted for disaster declarations in 11 states in August and September. Oregon saw mudslides and landslides in February and a tsunami wave surge in March. Tornadoes struck Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia in April. Wildfires first triggered federal help in Texas in July.

Another four states -- Florida, Arizona, Colorado and Reid’s home state of Nevada -- received a Fire Assistance Management declaration to deal with wildfires, and Delaware had one emergency declaration for Hurricane Irene. The emergency declaration also takes a president’s pen, but it doesn’t give federal money directly to individuals.

FEMA lists three states -- Michigan, South Carolina and West Virginia -- with no declarations of any type.

Our ruling

Reid said, ""President Obama has declared disasters in 48 of 50 states this year.""

He's right that a large majority of states have had those declarations, but he overstates the number.

We counted 42 states with presidential federal disaster declarations, plus one with the lesser emergency declaration and four that received only help for fires. But the fire aid isn’t a presidential declaration and Delaware was an emergency, not a disaster, so they shouldn’t count in Reid's tally.

That means the number is 42 -- not 48 as Reid said. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/30/harry-reid/president-obama-has-declared-disasters-how-many-st/

One Wisconsin Now says Gov. Scott Walker is charging the public $50 to hear his views on jobs
","
Gov. Scott Walker tried to take the edge off the latest dreary employment report -- issued on Sept. 16, 2011 -- by announcing a series of ""job creation forums"" around the state.

Small, invitation-only forums were held in September in La Crosse, Milwaukee and in Green Bay.

The highest profile one is a second Green Bay one, a day-long event Nov. 1 at Lambeau Field. The agenda features welcoming remarks from Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and a keynote speech at noon from the governor. The panels are made up of more than a dozen Walker Administration cabinet secretaries and appointees. Two business people -- both winners of awards from Walker’s administration -- are given slots on a panel at the end of the day.

When that event was announced, some people got the impression it was an opportunity for thousands of unemployed state residents to connect with hiring employers. (When discussing unemployment, Walker frequently mentions a state web site listing thousands of job openings.)

But the event isn’t aimed at helping individual unemployed people find work. It’s not a job fair.

And that caught the attention of the liberal One Wisconsin Now group, which criticized the event  and the admission fee. Walker is charging ""the public $50 to attend a state-sponsored ‘jobs summit,’"" the group said in a news release.

Such pay-for-access claims have become familiar in the recent months.

We looked into a similar complaint raised by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that said three Republican members of Congress were shutting down town hall meetings and charging constituents for access. we rated that claim Pants on Fire, in part because the fees in question were for Rotary lunches and other routine civic meetings and there were many other opportunities to meet with them.

So, is One Wisconsin Now right about the governor’s office and the Lambeau event?

Asked to support the claim, Scot Ross, executive director of the group, cited the announcements themselves. He said it looked like the public was being forced to pay for access to state officials: ""They’re going to charge people to hear their ideas. How is that going to help us?""

The event was characterized differently by the governor’s and lieutenant governor’s offices. Walker’s news release labeled the events ""Job Creation Forums,"" including in Green Bay. Four days later, Kleefisch’s office announced greater detail about the Lambeau event and called it a ""Small Business Summit.""

The Lambeau event is an opportunity for the administration to meet with business people, said Jeanne Taratino, Kleefisch’s chief of staff.

She said the liberal group ""misconstrued"" the press releases announcing the events.

""It’s not a jobs summit. It’s a small business summit,"" she said. ""We’re not asking unemployed people to pay $50 to come to a jobs summit.""

She noted that there were expenses related to holding the event in meeting rooms at Lambeau (not in the stadium itself) and that breakfast and lunch were included.

Tarantino said the administration hopes about 200 people will attend.

The Lambeau event is open to all and those interested in attending can register on the web site of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority.

""We’ll take all comers,"" Tarantino said. ""But it’s like every conference -- there’s a targeted audience.""

The breakout sessions will include comments from each cabinet secretary and than a chance for attendees to ask questions ""about issues of importance to small businesses,"" she said.
For example, a business owner might ""have a problem with an audit,"" and want to know ""how you can get an answer in a timely fashion,"" she said.

Walker held smaller scale ""jobs forums"" in La Crosse on Sept. 22, 2011 and Milwaukee Sept. 27, and Green Bay Sept. 29. Those were two-hour, invitation only events, with no charge. In the case of the Milwaukee and Green Bay events they were announced one day in advance and did not appear to break much new ground.

At the La Crosse forum, Walker was told that improvement to the local job market hinges on ""limiting regulations and developing a skilled workforce,"" according to the La Crosse Tribune. Two employers -- the owner of a screen printing shop and a builder -- said that younger workers often lacked proper training and motivation.

Our conclusion

One Wisconsin Now claimed the Walker administration is charging people to hear elected and appointed officials talk about jobs and the economy in a day-long event in Green Bay.

They are. But you also get to visit Lambeau (at least the meeting rooms) have two meals and listen to a lot of speeches. Then again, you could get yourself invited to one of the smaller events. Or you could  send an email or make a call to the state’s jobs ""hotline"" (1-855-854-JOBS) -- for free.

How dangerous is it to breathe Atlanta air?
","
For many Atlanta-area residents, 2011 will be remembered as the long, hot -- no, veryhot -- summer.

The high temperature climbed past 90 degrees on 66 days this summer, according to the National Weather Service. Officials warned it was dangerously hot on some days.

How dangerous was it to be outside, you ask?

""We have had over 40 days this summer where it was unsafe to breathe the air,"" said Jennette Gayer, staff advocate for Georgia Environment, a group with goals of protecting the state’s air, water and natural resources.

The claim surprised us since we’ve seen no widespread reports of Georgians being hospitalized or claiming harm from breathing. We thought we’d check this out.

Gayer made the statement during a recent meeting at Atlanta City Hall. She was there to speak out about the proposed 1 percent sales tax to pay for about 150 transportation projects in the Atlanta region. A referendum is scheduled for July 2012.

Gayer’s remarks to the packed audience of about 200 people in the City Council chamber were focused on her desire to see more projects she thinks may improve air quality, such as a commuter rail line between Atlanta and Griffin.

""[W]e need ... more alternatives to cars,"" Gayer told us in an email.

Gayer based her comments on the state Department of Natural Resources, which monitors air quality in the Atlanta region from 10 different locations. The state uses federal guidelines to measure the level of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (at ground level) and sulfur dioxide. The state sets a ratings scale, green for ""good"" to purple for ""very unhealthy."" Some observers contend the ratings are based on flawed conclusions about the impact of pollutants on the environment.

Susan Zimmer-Dauphinee, who is in charge of running the state’s monitoring system, said there have been 38 days this year where air quality levels were labeled as ""unhealthy"" or ""code orange."" The unhealthy rating is primarily for groups such as young children, the elderly and those with asthma or other respiratory conditions.

So is it stretching the truth to say there have been 40 days this summer when it was ""unsafe"" to breathe the air because the code orange doesn’t include all groups?

""The young, the elderly and people with existing respiratory problems would definitely be most impacted, but more and more research is pointing to even healthy adults experiencing problems,"" Gayer said. 
Gayer believes the current air quality standards should be strengthened, pointing to arguments from some scientists who lobbied the federal Environmental Protection Agency on that point. The Obama administration earlier this month reversed course on some clean air regulations aimed at reducing smog. Some congressional leaders worried the tougher air quality standards would hurt businesses in the struggling economy.

Arthur Winer, former director of UCLA’s Environmental Science and Engineering Program, said Gayer could have been more precise.

""In general, the air quality standards and health alerts are focused on the most vulnerable populations, rather than the general public,"" said Winer, who says he has written more than 200 journal articles and book chapters on air pollution and related topics over the past 30 years. ""However, to be rigorous, it would probably have been better if this person had said ‘there were 40 days this summer in which it was unsafe to breathe the air for small children, the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses like asthma.’ ""

To be more technical, the state’s chart shows 18 of those days were in May and early June, before the official start of summer. Gayer said she based her comments at the meeting on Atlanta’s smog season, which begins May 1 and ends Sept. 30.

Gayer’s comment was generally accurate -- with an emphasis on generally.  But it also leaves out some key details.

Josh Mandel says Sherrod Brown promised Ohio River bridge's replacement as a stimulus project
","
Everyone, it seems, wants to sell you a bridge.

Don’t buy their promises.

One particular bridge spanning the Ohio River comes with a claim of a broken promise that Josh Mandel’s camp is pressing as an election issue.

""Sherrod Brown promised that the first stimulus bill would fund the Brent Spence Bridge … and now he is embarrassed to stand there with the president after both of  them broke their promise,"" Mandel’s campaign said in a news release.

Mandel, currently Ohio’s treasurer, is a Republican who wants to oust Brown, a Democrat, from his U.S. Senate seat in the 2012 election. The news release, distributed Sept. 28,2011, by Mandel campaign spokesman Joe Aquilino, criticized Brown on several fronts.

The reference to the Brent Spence Bridge, which carries traffic for Interstates 71 and 75 across the Ohio River, refers both the federal stimulus package Congress approved two years ago and to a recent visit President Barack Obama made to promote a second stimulus bill. Brown was not present, saying he had congressional business to attend to in Washington.

Before Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known simply as the stimulus act, lawmakers across the country were discussing whether the federal government should funnel billions of dollars into bridge, road and sewer projects. Brown believed so, saying that by funding ""shovel-ready projects,"" the government could begin filling the country’s extensive infrastructure needs while putting Americans back to work.

Among Browns comments then was one that referred to the Brent Spence Bridge. Transportation planners say the 48-year-old bridge needs to be replaced. It is cramped, has poor visibility and carries more than twice the 80,000 vehicles a day it was designed for, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. But coming up with the estimated $2.4 billion is a problem that has has dogged local and state governments in Ohio and Kentucky.

Enter Brown. In an appearance on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" program on Jan. 28, 2009, Brown said that ""we do need to do direct spending on job creation. That means shovel-ready projects for water and sewer systems, whether it's the Brent Spence Bridge in Cincinnati that will put a lot of people to work and help with economic development, or whether it's a water and sewer system in Defiance, Ohio or in Nashville. It's pretty clear to me that we need direct spending on projects that are ready to go, particularly, green projects that put people to work immediately but also help longer term and economic development.""

Did you hear a promise in there? Mandel did.

It is beyond question that Brown cited the Brent Spence Bridge in 2009 as an example of a project the first stimulus bill could fund, just as Obama used it as an example recently. Obama went further than Brown, using his speech to also send a message to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker John Boehner of southwest Ohio. ""Mr. Boehner, Mr. McConnell, help us rebuild this bridge,"" Obama said, standing in the bridge’s shadow on Sept. 22.

It is also beyond question that this is not a shovel-ready project. Had PolitiFact Ohio been around then, Brown’s inclusion of the Brent Spence Bridge as a shovel-ready project might have rated False on the Truth-O-Meter.  

While there have been preliminary studies, more extensive engineering and planning are required. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported recently that ""in a best case scenario, the earliest that workers would be hired would be in 2013, but more likely 2015.""

Facing questions about the bridge, a White House spokesman stressed the same day as Obama’s speech that the Brent Spence project is merely ""an example"" of the kind of project that could get funding in Obama’s new $447 billion stimulus proposal.

Many details remain to be worked out, including how a particular component, a $10 billion infrastructure bank, would work. It is not clear whether this -- or a bigger infrastructure bank that Brown proposes -- could be used toward the eventual Brent Spence project.

So let’s stipulate: Brown said in 2009 that the Brent Spence Bridge was the kind of project the first stimulus could pay for, using it as an example of a shovel-ready project. He clearly suggested that the bridge could be built with stimulus money.

It didn’t happen. And the project was not shovel-ready.

Does this make it a broken promise? PolitiFact Ohio discussed this with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, whose spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, says that Brown certainly made a strong suggestion that a casual listener might equate to a promise.

We agree. That’s an element of truth that that factors into why we are not ruling Mandel’s claim about a broken promise to be entirely False.  

But Mandel used a strong word: promise. He did not say Brown broke his suggestion. He said Brown broke a promise. Brown never made a promise, which is a critical difference. It is why Mandel’s claim gets a rating of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-promised-ohio-river/
"['New Jersey', 'Gambling', 'Jim Whelan']","
Former Atlantic City Mayor Jim Whelan says his record includes the first decade of population growth since the 1920s
","
Following the years when political boss Nucky Johnson ruled the Prohibition-era boardwalk, Atlantic City saw its population drop decade after decade through the greater part of the 20th Century.

That is, until Jim Whelan came along.

Seeking re-election to his State Senate seat, Whelan, a Democrat, has pointed to Atlantic City’s population growth during the 1990s as one of his achievements as city mayor. Whelan served as mayor from 1990 to 2001.

In a Sept. 15 debate against his Republican opponent, Assemblyman Vince Polistina, Whelan said the following about his record: ""John Adams told us years ago facts are stubborn things. Here are some facts. The 1990s are the only decade since the 1920s when the population of Atlantic City actually went up.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Whelan’s statistics on population growth are accurate, but he may be taking too much credit. The increase in Atlantic City’s population was part of a larger trend involving other American cities, and coincided with the growth of the city’s casino industry.

First, let’s explain the population figures.

Starting in 1860, the population of Atlantic City rose for seven consecutive decades, from 687 residents in 1860 to 66,198 in 1930, according to U.S. census data. But then, the numbers started to fall.

Between 1930 and 1990, the city’s population declined every decade for a total loss of nearly 43 percent, according to census data. In Whelan’s first year as mayor, the city’s population was 37,986.

Ten years later, Atlantic City’s population had increased by about 6.7 percent to 40,517 residents. However, by 2010, the city’s population had fallen slightly to 39,558.

So, Whelan is correct that his tenure included the only decade of population growth since the 1920s -- but how much did he have to do with that?

Whelan acknowledged he is not solely responsible for the population growth, but said his administration put an emphasis on basic services and providing ""safe, clean streets."" Whelan noted that his administration hired more police and demolished blighted buildings.

Gwendolyn Harris, executive director of the Senator Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs at Rutgers University, said a mayor and city government can receive credit for population growth. City officials are involved in making quality-of-life improvements and facilitating development, she said.

But a significant factor in the city’s population growth was the growth of the casino industry, which was put in motion more than a decade before Whelan became mayor. In his first year in office, Atlantic City was home to 12 casinos.

Keith Mills, director of Atlantic City’s Department of Planning and Development, who has worked in the department since 1988, attributed the population growth, in large part, to the demand for casino workers.

In fact, the number of casino employees increased during Whelan’s tenure and peaked in 1997 at 49,123 workers.

Another contributing factor was the development of new housing stock through the reinvestment of casino dollars, as required by state law -- a process that involved both city officials and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, Mills said.

As for Whelan’s role, Mills said a mayor still needs the cooperation of the city council, just as President Barack Obama needs Congress to support his initiatives.

""It takes a lot to move anything along. … It’s no different here in Atlantic City,"" Mills said.

Population studies experts also pointed out that Atlantic City’s growth in the 1990s was part of a national trend of urban population increases in certain cities, a movement partly driven by the influx of immigrants.

""This is not a unique experience,"" said Janice Madden, a professor in the Population Studies Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

Census data show that Atlantic City’s immigrant population sharply increased during Whelan’s mayoralty. By 2000, the number of foreign-born residents had increased by 166 percent since 1990, and represented nearly a quarter of the city’s population.

But, Madden said, city governments still need to have policies that attract new people and keep existing residents in town.

Our ruling

Whelan’s statistics about Atlantic City’s population changes are on target, but the population growth came from a variety of factors.

As the city’s political leader, Whelan obviously played a role in new development and other improvements, but he also inherited a booming casino industry and served at a time when more immigrants were moving to urban areas across the country.

Ad from Save America's Postal Service claims rule from Congress is causing USPS's financial problems
","
The U.S. Postal Service is having financial problems, but ""not for the reason you might think,"" says a new ad from unions representing postal workers.

""The Postal Service is critical to our economy – delivering mail, medicine and packages,"" the ad says. ""Yet they’re closing thousands of offices, slashing service, and want to lay off over 100,000 workers. The Postal Service is reporting financial losses but not for reasons you might think. The problem: a burden no other agency or company bears, a 2006 law that drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts. Congress created this problem, and Congress can fix it."" 
The ad makes it sound so simple -- if only Congress would fix the unfair law making the post office pay the federal government. But our research showed the post office had more problems than just the financial requirements of a 2006 law.  
To begin with, the U.S. Postal Service is a unique agency. It's meant to be self-sustaining, paying for itself from the money it makes off postage and other mail services. But unlike a private business, it has to follow rules set by Congress that result in higher costs, such as universal delivery. 
In recent years, as Internet communication has increased, the number of pieces mailed has been in decline. For a few years, postal revenues were nevertheless stable, but then they too started to decline. Patrick Donahoe, the U.S. Postmaster, said recently that first-class mail is dropping at a rate of 7.5 percent a year. While the post office has made up for some losses through productivity increases, it hasn't been able to make up enough. 
That has the post office looking for ways to save money and increase revenues, and for most significant changes, it has to get permission from Congress. Just as the ad says, the post office has floated the idea of closing smaller post offices, cutting Saturday service and laying off workers. Others have suggested that the post office get into new lines of business, but again, the Postal Service would need permission from Congress. 

The ad is also largely correct that a 2006 law, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, requires the post office to make payments ""into federal accounts."" What the ad doesn't mention is the payments are meant to fund health benefits for future Postal Service retirees. The law requires that the Postal Service pay about $5 billion a year toward future health benefits for 10 years, until 2017. A 2009 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service determined that the payments were having a ""considerable"" impact on the post office's profitability.   
The ad also mentions ""billions"" that the Postal Service is ""forced to overpay"" into federal accounts. This claim has to do with whether the Postal Service is required to pay more than needed for future pension benefits, and there's a lively debate over the issue. Inspectors general -- one from the U.S. Postal Service and another from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management -- have issued conflicting reports over the obligations and how they should be handled.  
Finally, we found widespread agreement that the Postal Service's problems are greater than just the retirement rules. Here's what Donahoe, the postmaster general, told the PBS NewsHour on Sept. 6, 2011: ""The problem is, when you start to look forward, even with the pre-funding money given back to us -- which there's not a lot of people coming forward telling us that they're going to give us that money -- the problem is, when you start to go forward, the volume and revenues continue to go down. We are losing first-class mail at the rate of 7.5 percent a year. That's not going to change."" 
The postal unions themselves acknowledge in their press materials for the ad that changes to the retirement rules alone would not solve the Postal Service's financial problems. But changing the rules would buy time to come up with other ideas and solutions. ""This cannot be done in the current panic mode, with congressional inaction forcing management to throw every possible cut against the wall to see what sticks, while anti-government ideologues exploit the situation,"" said the unions in a written statement. 
The postal unions' ad blames financial problems on ""a 2006 law that drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts."" The ad is right that the law did require payments of approximately that amount and that those payments have had a significant effect on the post office's bottom line. The additional overpayments are subject to debate. Even so, the law is hardly the only challenge the post office faces; it's also facing continuing declines in first-class mail.

Gary Johnson says executions cost more than life imprisonment
","
Opposition to the death penalty is one of those issues where the libertarian wing of the Republican party sometimes loops around to meet left leaning Democrats. Gary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico and contender for the GOP nomination, enjoys stirring the pot within his party, and on a visit in New Hampshire he said, ""It costs more money to put a person on death row than it does to lock them up for the rest of their lives because of attorney fees.""

Set aside for a moment that capital punishment is mainly up to the states. Beyond the federal death penalty, presidents don't have much to do with the matter. Johnson is making a fiscal argument -- the death penalty costs too much -- and he's making it at a moment when state budgets face huge pressures. Elected officials and taxpayers in every state might be curious to know if he's right.

The Johnson campaign cites the Death Penalty Information Center as the source of its claim.  The website of this anti-death penalty group lists 18 studies that examine costs. All of them conclude that as soon as a prosecutor decides to go for capital punishment,  the price tag just for the legal work itself goes up. How much depends on the state. A 2008 study in Maryland found it was three-times more expensive; an analysis from Indiana in 2002 said it costs five- times more.

No one on either side of the issue disputes these higher costs. Remember, we’re only talking about the legal process, not the cost of keeping someone behind bars or paying for the executions themselves. DPIC Executive Director, Richard Dieter, says when the death penalty is on the table, the constitutional scrutiny is intense with more lawyers and more hearings. ""People are more skeptical,"" Dieter said. ""There are more tests -- DNA, mental illness, retardation, experts are brought in.""

To get at the full picture, the legal costs, plus everything else, arguably the most useful report is one that doesn’t appear on the DPIC web site, although it is cited by several that do. It comes from George Mason University and sizes up what it called three of the best studies with an eye on the big question, does a sentence of life without parole cost less than the death penalty?

The results tend to support the idea that imprisonment is cheaper but not across all three states examined. In North Carolina, researchers said a life sentence would save $163,000 per case; Indiana pegged the number a bit lower at $116,000. But in Tennessee, analysts concluded that executions were cheaper by a lot -- some $773,000.

The value of the George Mason study is it picks apart the data behind those numbers. It has high praise for the Indiana work, calling it the gold standard for assessing costs. It gives a nod to the North Carolina team but notes that the work was done in the early 1990’s and is dated because the rules for death penalty cases have changed. As for the Tennessee research, it notes that it relied on very limited data, something that the authors in Tennessee acknowledged. Not the least of the problems was that Tennessee had executed just one person during the period the study analyzed.

The main problem Gov. Johnson might  have in supporting his claim is that the death penalty plays out differently from state to state. States apply the death penalty to different crimes. Some put more money into giving the accused a strong defense and find their convictions upheld. Others cut corners on the front end and wind up paying for two trials. The court systems in some states get bogged down administering the cases of hundreds of people on death row; others work with ten or fewer.

All of these factors affect how quickly a state processes a death penalty case and speed has big implications for a key piece of Johnson’s argument, that it’s the legal fees that make the death penalty more expensive.

The common belief is that appeals are where most of the dollars go. That too depends on the state. A detailed study of more than two decades of murder prosecutions in Maryland found that 70% of the costs come in the pre-trial and trial phases. But the author of that study, John Roman, says in other states, lengthy appeals eventually can add up. In 2008 alone, California set aside $42 million just for the appeals process, or about $68,000 per inmate on death row.

As with every other step in these cases, the government generally pays for both the prosecution and the defense during appeals.

To some people, the solution lies in making the death penalty swifter. Michael Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a group that supports the death penalty, says states like Virginia have built a process that is fair and, in capital punishment terms, speedy. From conviction to execution takes about seven years in Virginia. In California, it runs closer to 20 years. The average is over 10 years.

""You get more bang for your criminal justice buck in Virginia,"" Rushford said. ""Johnson can make that speech in California. He couldn't make it in Virginia or Delaware.""

At the end of the day, it’s difficult to make broad statements about the cost of the death penalty that hold true in every state. The dollars spent depend on many factors, including how many people the government tries to put on death row, how it handles appeals and the fraction of death row inmates that ultimately are executed. The author of the Maryland study, John Roman, has a rough rule of thumb for determining which is cheaper, life imprisonment and death. It's not one that the death penalty opponents would like.  

""If you don't execute lots of people,"" Roman said, ""the death sentence is more expensive.""  Because the costs of appeals add up over time. On the other hand, Roman continues,"" If you execute lots of people, then life imprisonment probably turns out to be more expensive."" And that's because, the shorter the time between sentencing and execution, the less the government spends on appeals and imprisonment.

Our Ruling

Johnson said life imprisonment is cheaper than the death penalty because of attorney fees. If we define attorney fees broadly, there is ample evidence that as soon as a prosecutor decides to seek capital punishment, it dramatically increases the price tag for taxpayers, who are paying for the defense as well as the prosecution.

The meter continues to run during the appeals process. The shorter that process, the greater the cost effectiveness of an execution. But as a practical matter, for reasons rooted in both state and federal procedure, the process often lasts close to a decade or more.

That means that the costs in some states don't support Johnson's claim that life imprisonment is cheaper because of attorney's fees. So we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/29/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-executions-cost-more-life-impris/
"['New Jersey', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says Barack Obama failed to support solutions of deficit reduction commission
","With Republicans across the country clamoring for Gov. Chris Christie to run for president, the governor on Tuesday cited various reasons why the administration of President Barack Obama has been a failure.

One example is how the president failed to back up the recommendations of his own deficit reduction commission, Christie said in a high-profile speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.

""Because each and every time the president lets a moment to act pass him by, his failure is our failure too,"" Christie said. ""The failure to stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission, a report the president asked for himself.""

PolitiFact New Jersey investigated whether Obama failed to ""stand up for the bipartisan debt solutions of the Simpson-Bowles Commission,"" and found that Christie is not entirely right.

The president did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations at the outset, but Obama later outlined deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission.

Even the commission’s co-chairs -- former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles under President Bill Clinton, and former Republican U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson -- have said so.

""We are encouraged that the President has embraced a balanced, comprehensive approach to deficit reduction similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Commission report,"" Bowles and Simpson said in an April 13 press release.

Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts argued that the statement from Bowles and Simpson show ""that they praise a similar approach – which isn’t the same as saying he has supported their recommendations.""

""To date, the President has not endorsed the recommendations as proposed by his own commission,"" Roberts said in an email.

Now, let’s explain the commission’s history and Obama’s responses to its proposals.

Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in February 2010. The president asked the bipartisan panel to recommend measures that would address the nation’s debt problem.

In December, the commission released its final report, which included dozens of proposals to cut discretionary spending, reform the tax code and Social Security and rein in health care costs, among other measures.

According to a previous ruling from PolitiFact National, Obama later proposed deficit reduction measures similar to those recommended by the commission.

Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us Obama’s deficit reduction plan from April incorporated many of the broad principles of the commission’s recommendations, but was mostly devoid of specifics.

Obama has fleshed out some of those broad principles in a deficit reduction plan unveiled earlier this month, according to Peuquet.

Referring to Christie’s statement, Peuquet said: ""It seems to not quite give the president enough credit for things he’s done recently.""

Alice Rivlin, a member of the commission and former director of the Office of Management and Budget under Clinton, said she was disappointed that the president didn't endorse the commission's recommendations immediately, but agreed that Obama later embraced some of its proposals.

A former policy adviser to Clinton said Obama has ""approached the report very carefully.""

""He’s kept it at arms’ length,"" said Bill Galston, now a senior fellow at Brookings.

Obama is ""not exactly rejecting it,"" Galston said, but  ""not exactly embracing it either.""

During negotiations over raising the debt ceiling, Obama didn't offer exactly the proposals in the commission's report, but ""he went much of the way there,"" said Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Chris Edwards, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s a fair assessment that Obama did nothing with the commission’s report, but said the president has another opportunity to implement recommendations when introducing the federal budget in February.

Edwards noted that the commission’s report contained some politically unpopular moves that might explain why Obama didn’t pursue some of the recommendations, such as raising the Social Security retirement age.

Our ruling

Christie claimed Obama has failed to stand up for the solutions proposed by his own deficit reduction commission. It is true that the president did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations in the immediate months following its December report.

But since then, Obama has outlined deficit reduction measures similar to the commission’s recommendations. That’s why the governor is wrong to imply that Obama has done nothing with the commission’s proposals.

American Rescue Plan has $4 billion for food distribution, relief for producers
","President Biden signed into law The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, or the ARP for short, on March 11 after a party-line vote in the U.S. Senate and with no Republican support to go along with two ""no"" Democrat votes in the U.S. House. The act provides U.S. citizens with financial support during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many people are familiar with the third round of stimulus checks that came from the legislation, but the ARP includes additional provisions for economic relief, including emergency funding for states, homeowner assistance, and small business credit. Given the act’s partisan vote, we noted that one of the Iowa Democratic Party’s leaders, state Senate Minority Leader Zach Wahls, promoted the act when writing in one of his weekly newsletters: ""The federal American Rescue Plan will purchase more food from farmers for distribution through food banks, nonprofits and restaurants, helping to feed families in need and support farmers’ bottom lines."" In an email exchange with The Daily Iowan, Wahls referenced a March 10 U.S. Department of Agriculture fact sheet as the primary source for his claim, which matched his newsletter almost word for word. But, does that mean more is being spent on farmers?  The answer is yes, although allocated money in this program also goes to non-farmers. U.S. Department of Agriculture performance manager Chris Nelson said in a phone interview with the DI that $4 billion is being added to the USDA’s budget for spending in 2021 and in upcoming years. Subsection A of the ARP’s Section 1001 states that $4 billion will be appropriated to the USDA to fund the legislation’s agriculture relief effort. However, Nelson said the USDA still must determine where, specifically, to spend the $4 billion. Nelson said the USDA annually releases a budget report for the following year. He said the budget for fiscal 2022, which normally would have been published two months ago, was delayed because of the presidential transition and won’t be published until May or June. The USDA’s budget summary for fiscal 2021, published in February 2020 does not include ARP’s $4 billion. As for the legislation’s agriculture relief effort, the $4 billion is to be used to purchase fresh food and distribute it to nonprofits, food banks, and restaurants, according to Section 1001. The same section also states the $4 billion is to finance loans and grants for food processors, distributors, and producers as additional aid in response to the pandemic. Andrew Wheeler, the media contact for the Iowa Farm Bureau, said efforts to buy fresh produce directly from farmers tend to happen over a prolonged period of time because of the need to wait until after the growing season occurs. How the American Rescue Plan is to be spent still is to be determined. But, while the act doesn’t specifically call out farmers by name, it explicitly orders a new $4 billion USDA appropriation to buy fresh food for nonprofits, food banks, and restaurants, plus additional relief for non-farmers in the food supply chain.  We rate this claim to be True. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/22/zach-wahls/american-rescue-plan-has-4-billion-food-distributi/

No, two photos don’t reveal sea levels, don’t prove climate change is a ‘hoax’
","A few days before Earth Day 2021, a meme spread across Facebook claiming to have proof that climate change is a hoax. But a couple of water’s-edge photographs don’t prove anything, climatewise. The meme’s sarcastic headline was: ""99 years of sea level rise — Palm Beach Sydney."" Palm Beach is a town north of Sydney, Australia.  Below the headline were two photos, apparently of the same strip of land, with water on the left and the right. A black-and-white photo was labeled 1917 and a color photo was labeled 2016.  ""For years they called it Global Warming. But they were proven over and over that no such thing is happening,"" the text below the photos said. ""Then they started calling it Climate Change. Again it is a hoax."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post appears to argue that the photos indicate the water level at a particular site didn’t change in 99 years.  Tides rise and fall, of course — even during the course of a day, as well over a period of years. According to experts, photos like these don’t reveal long-term changes in sea level, and globally, sea levels are up, with climate change being the primary reason why. A Google search indicates the two photos are from Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, which is about 17 miles north of Sydney. First Draft, a nonprofit that fights misinformation, told us the black-and-white photo appears to have been taken at Palm Beach and that an Australian government website dates the image as being taken between 1917 and 1946. First Draft could not confirm details about the other photo. Facebook users who clicked on the Palm Beach meme will see it has been marked with a fact-check that Climate Feedback did in 2019. It rated as inaccurate a similar meme with two photos claiming that ""unprecedented climate change"" had caused no rise in sea level at Sydney Harbour in 140 years.  The fact-checkers found that two photos taken at different times cannot reveal whether a sea-level change has occurred, given that tides rise and fall. An expert from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California told Climate Feedback that during the 20th century, the sea level in Sydney rose by about 12 centimeters or just under 5 inches. Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported in May that global warming is adding about 750 gigatonnes of water to the ocean each year. Solely for visualization purposes, that’s enough in one year to cover Texas more than 3 feet deep. Satellite observations from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center reported in October an increase of 3.3 millimeters per year in sea level since 1993. Sea level rose more than 200 millimeters (nearly 8 inches) from 1900 to 2018, according to coastal tide gauge and satellite data. ""Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms,"" NASA said. Sea-level rise is uneven in space and time but on average, sea level is rising because of climate warming caused by humans, said Thomas Frederikse, a postdoctoral fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""The post is wrong and climate change is all too real."" A Facebook post says two water’s-edge photos, apparently from the same location, show climate change ""is a hoax."" Water’s-edge photographs don’t show changes in sea level over time. Global sea levels are rising, and climate change is one reason. We rate the post False.

","A century-old church in Minneapolis was severely damaged April 19 in a fire that an Instagram post claims was tied to local protests over police brutality.

Meanwhile, a murder trial was under way for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in the May 2020 death of George Floyd. (Chauvin was found guilty on April 20.)

No, Derek Chauvin’s conviction in George Floyd murder wasn’t fake
","Shortly after a jury in Minneapolis convicted former police officer Derek Chauvin of murder and manslaughter for the killing of George Floyd, a promoter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory described a made-up version of events on Telegram, a messaging app. The jury’s verdict followed nearly three weeks of testimony from dozens of witnesses about Chauvin’s murder of Floyd, who died handcuffed and gasping for air as Chauvin kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020. Chauvin, 45, was found guilty of two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter. He could spend decades in prison.  But in the Telegram poster’s telling, the verdict delivered in one of the most high-profile court cases in decades was ""not real,"" the weeks-long trial that preceded it was faked, and the man taken into custody was ""not Chauvin.""

""People have been played again bait and switch,"" another post said. ""The whole country was on edge for a fake trial, which is why the fake Chauvin was emotionless.""  An April 20 Facebook post falsely claims that former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's trial and conviction was faked. The claims that Chauvin was replaced for a fake trial are as ridiculous as they sound.

""When this office charged Derek Chauvin with murder four days after he killed George Floyd, we knew exactly who he was,"" Freeman said in the statement. ""He is the same person the world has seen on video, in the courtroom and being led away in handcuffs to the maximum security prison at Oak Park Heights."" Chauvin’s restraint of Floyd outside the Cup Foods convenience store was documented in a widely seen video captured by a bystander, as well as in police body camera footage and other video shown by the prosecution during his trial. Much of Chauvin’s trial was streamed or televised live, including the reading of the jury’s verdict. In court on April 15, Chauvin removed his face mask before invoking his Fifth Amendment right and saying he would not testify. Judge Peter Cahill referred to him by name.   At several other points throughout the trial, the prosecution asked witnesses who saw Floyd’s murder as it happened or knew Chauvin to identify or point to him in court. Donald Williams II, a witness to the scene, testified that the officer he saw with a knee on Floyd’s neck was the same person in court and on trial.  Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo also identified Chauvin for the jury as the man in court, telling prosecutors that ""Mr. Chauvin is right there"" and describing his outfit.  Other witnesses who identified Chauvin as being present in court included David Pleoger, a retired Minneapolis police sergeant who was Chauvin’s supervisor at the time of the murder, and three Minneapolis Police Department members in charge of various officer trainings. Pleoger said he had known Chauvin since 2008 before identifying him in court. Inspector Katie Blackwell, who was formerly in charge of officer training, said she’d known him for 20 years.

No, women’s cycles and fertility are not affected by being around vaccinated people
","Social media posts are warning women that their reproductive health could be seriously harmed simply by being around people who have received COVID-19 vaccines. ""Women in their menstruating years are experiencing severe side effects from people around them having received this jab,"" said a self-described ""cosmic doula"" in one Instagram video posted April 15. She went on to describe women missing their periods, having excruciating periods and having post-menopausal periods. A Facebook post similarly shares collection of text posts it says are stories from women — some vaccinated, some who have ""been around those who have"" — who say they have experienced symptoms that ""include bleeding, hemorrhaging, passing clots, delayed cycle, prolonged cycle, bleeding POST menopause, miscarriages, decidual casts, severe period cramping and abnormal pain, etc."" These posts and many others making these claims were flagged as part of efforts by Facebook, which owns Instagram, to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Many of the posts suggest those with the vaccine are ""shedding"" spike proteins to others.  These posts, which are based largely on anecdotes, are misleading: There is no data linking vaccines to changes in women’s cycles or fertility. Furthermore, there is no mechanism by which someone who is not vaccinated could experience side-effects passed on by someone who has been vaccinated for COVID-19, as these posts suggest. Dr. Jennifer Gunter, a gynecologist who has written about the relationship between vaccines and female reproductive health, said unequivocally there is no way this is possible. There are no elements in any of the vaccines that can be passed to another person.  ""Neither of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, which use mRNA (messenger RNA), nor the Johnson and Johnson vaccine (which uses a viral vector) can possibly affect a person who has not been vaccinated, and this includes their menstruation, fertility, and pregnancy,"" Gunter wrote in a blog post. ""Let me be very clear. The COVID-19 vaccines cannot affect anyone by proxy."" Dr. Risa Hoshino, a board-certified pediatrician and public health advocate, called out the claims on her Instagram page, where she regularly publishes videos and fact-checks centered on COVID-19 misinformation. ""The shot cannot be ‘shed.’ The shots hold a temporary message that codes for the spike protein, which is a harmless piece of the virus that cannot harm people,"" Hoshino wrote. ""The message is like a Snapchat, it disappears quickly and will not stay in the body long-term. It’s not a live virus, so therefore it cannot shed — only live viruses such as actual SARS-CoV-2 can do this."" The vaccines approved for use in the U.S. can cause minor physical side effects such as a low-grade fever, body aches and soreness at the injection site, but these side effects (or any side effects) can’t be transmitted to anyone else.  There is no evidence that any of the vaccines are causal factors in those who experience irregularities in their menstrual cycles after receiving any of the shots, nor is there any evidence that the vaccines cause fertility problems. The CDC has stated that currently available vaccines are safe for those who are pregnant or may become pregnant. A woman’s menstrual cycle can fluctuate due to a number of factors, including diet, stress, exercise, illness and pregnancy. In an op-ed for The New York Times, Yale medical student Alice Lu-Culligan and Yale School of Medicine writer-in-residence Randi Hutter Epstein argued that there is room for more research about the relationship between vaccines and women’s menstrual cycles but noted that current data does not suggest a connection. ""Even if there is a connection, one unusual period is no cause for alarm,"" they wrote. Research strongly suggests that women who are pregnant are at heightened risk for severe COVID-19, putting them at greater need for protection than other healthy adults. While the effects of the vaccines on pregnant women are still being studied, data collected so far indicates they are safe. ""If you are trying to become pregnant now or want to get pregnant in the future, you may receive a COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to you,"" the CDC advises, adding that the vaccines would continue to be studied well into the future. ""There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems."" Guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists mirrors the recommendation of the CDC. ""Unfounded claims linking COVID-19 vaccines to infertility have been scientifically disproven,"" the agency said in December.  Social media posts claim that women’s menstrual cycles and fertility are affected by being around people who have received COVID-19 vaccines. There is no mechanism by which unvaccinated individuals can contract any sort of side effects from people who are vaccinated, and there is no evidence showing a link between menstrual irregularities, fertility and the vaccines.

Paper about mask wearing was not from Stanford and makes false claims
","Headlines widely shared on Facebook tried to invoke the credibility of Stanford University in falsely claiming that a study found masks do not block COVID-19 and can cause health problems, including death.

What’s being labeled as a ""study"" is actually an article in the journal Medical Hypotheses. Stanford University says it had nothing to do with the journal article. Furthermore, the article makes false claims about the ill effects of mask wearing. The article ""is paper-thin nonsense,"" said biology professor Benjamin Neuman, chief viologist Texas A&M University’s Global Health Research Complex. ""It is unreferenced personal opinion that misquotes a few scientific papers."" Medical Hypotheses says its purpose ""is to publish interesting theoretical papers. The journal will consider radical, speculative and non-mainstream scientific ideas provided they are coherently expressed."" The article about mask wearing was published in November and was authored by Baruch Vainshelboim. The website describes his affiliation this way: ""Cardiology Division, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System/Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States."" The VA facility is affiliated with Stanford, but Vainshelboim hasn’t been affiliated with the VA or Stanford since 2016, when he served for a year as a visiting scholar, the university told us.  Stanford also said it had nothing to do with the article and that it has asked the journal for a correction.  Vainshelboim identifies himself in his LinkedIn profile as a clinical exercise physiologist, with a doctorate from the University of Porto in Portugal. The article asserts that evidence about mask wearing to prevent COVID-19 is lacking, but that adverse health effects are ""established."" One section claims masks cause hypoxemia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, toxicity and increased muscle tension, which we fact-checked and rated False. ""In genuine scientific research, one either has to do new experiments, or analyze relevant data from an appropriate source. This does neither — the scientific studies that it mentions are all misquoted, or cite conversations rather than experiments,"" Neuman said. The article ""did not generate any new data, and does not appear to have analyzed any data of substance. Without any of the stuff that gives a scientific paper substance, it is hard to think of this as anything more than personal opinion, from a person with no particular relevant experience or understanding."" The Gateway Pundit’s headline went on to make a broad claim that masks don’t block COVID-19 and can cause health deterioration including premature death. The Medical Hypotheses article ""does not provide any strong evidence for the statement,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""There has never been a question that a mask decreases the chance a symptomatic person spreads COVID."" As we’ve reported, masks are most effective as ""source control,"" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people.  Respiratory droplets carrying the virus are expelled into the air when infected people cough, talk, sneeze, or breathe. These droplets quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles.  But if an infected person is wearing a mask, it will catch and contain the larger droplets in the humid space between the person’s mouth and the mask. In this environment, droplets take nearly a hundred times as long to transform into airborne particles. So masks reduce the spread of infectious particles. This makes a meaningful difference when everyone is wearing masks. If you’re the only one wearing a mask in a public location, it won’t necessarily protect you from being infected. But if everybody is wearing a mask, your odds of infection will go down by quite a bit.  Public health experts have based their guidance on a variety of scientific studies: systematic reviews, ecological studies and laboratory studies.  PolitiFact has rated False a claim that masks ""will kill quite a few people, it’s well known that they reduce blood oxygen levels and those with respiratory and cardiac disorders will die.""

No, private insurance doesn’t provide 'better coverage' than Medicaid
","A Medicaid expansion — cut two years ago from Gov. Tony Evers’ first budget by the Republicans — is back on the table in his 2021-23 spending plan. The recycled proposal from Evers, a Democrat, has garnered a predictably unenthusiastic reception from Republicans who control the state Legislature. The expansion would lean on federal funds to expand Medicaid eligibility to people with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level, instead of the current 100%. Wisconsin is one of 12 states that have not adopted the Medicaid expansion. State Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, a co-chair of the budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, made his case against Medicaid in a March 21, 2021, appearance on WKOW’s ""Capital City Sunday."" He called the access to one-time funding a ""federal bribe … to expand that welfare program,"" then talked about the financial impact on the parties involved. ""We’ve got people right now covered on private insurance through the exchange here in Wisconsin, and we know that that private insurance gives them better coverage and better payments to our health systems,"" Born said. The lower payments to health systems for Medicaid-covered patients have been well-documented. The reimbursements Medicaid pays to health care providers are about half what private insurers pay nationwide — though we’ll note the state has the ability to set higher reimbursement rates, if Born and other leaders felt that was a problem that should be addressed. But the other portion of his claim is more unique. Does private insurance really provide ""better coverage"" to the individual than Medicaid? Born turned to some convoluted logic to defend this claim, which experts say doesn’t hold water. Let’s take a look. Born’s first mistake is ignoring the uninsured. Increasing the allowable income for Medicaid would move the cutoff for a single adult from $12,880 to $17,774. That would make about 90,000 additional Wisconsinites eligible for Medicaid. Between one-third and one-half of that group is currently uninsured, depending on whether you go by estimates from the state Department of Health Services or the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. So it’s wrong to dismiss Medicaid as not offering ""better coverage"" when there’s a large group of people who could use the program and currently have no coverage at all. But Born is also wrong about the coverage being better. Asked for proof of that claim, Born spokesman Tyler Clark said cost shouldn’t be considered as part of the discussion over which plans offer ""better coverage"" — only the number of health care providers that accept Medicaid vs. private insurance. ""Rep. Born didn’t make a statement relating to cost,"" Clark said in an email. ""Value the Representative is talking about is what you get for a plan, and it is also undeniable that access to primary and dental care under Medicaid is less than commercial private plans. … Anything else is not relevant to fact-checking his words."" But that flies in the face of how the health insurance industry references quality of coverage. The Affordable Care Act marketplace, for example, places the various options into four tiers — bronze, silver, gold, platinum — based on the out-of-pocket costs involved. In other words, which one is better is defined by how much each costs the user. More importantly, the logic Clark puts forth ignores that — just like the number of available providers — cost is a critical part of access to care. A plethora of available doctors on a private insurance plan does no good if the cost of care is so high the person can’t afford to see them. ""You cannot separate those two (cost and access),"" said Donna Friedsam, a distinguished researcher and health policy programs director at the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty. ""If you can’t pay for your care, that’s a huge access barrier."" The impact of that barrier is clear when comparing the states that so far have accepted and refused the Medicaid expansion. In states that expanded Medicaid, 9% of eligible low-income adults reported not getting needed medical care due to cost, while in states without the expansion 20% of that income group passed on care, according to a 2018 study from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Another 2018 study comparing those groups found states that expanded Medicaid had fewer uninsured among the people eligible, and that group also saw a drop in out-of-pocket spending. It concluded states that substitute marketplace plans for Medicaid expansion — as Wisconsin has done so far — ""could lower coverage rates and increase out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees."" So, yes, cost matters. And Medicaid is undeniably cheaper. Medicaid requires no premiums for those who would be eligible under the proposed expansion, and most people also pay little or nothing for services. ""At most you might pay a couple of bucks for a copayment, but it’s generally zero,"" said Joe Antos, a health care scholar with the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""In terms of just money out of pocket, it’s a better deal than any private coverage. Because all private coverage even with (Affordable Care Act) coverage and the big subsidies that have been expanded, there’s going to be a premium of some sort, there’s going to be a deductible, there’s going to be copays or coinsurance."" The point Born asserted he was trying to make is that private insurance gives a person access to more doctors than Medicaid. Kaiser — a nonpartisan organization considered the gold standard for health care analysis — said in a 2019 explainer on Medicaid: ""Rates of access to care and satisfaction with care among Medicaid enrollees are comparable to rates for people with private insurance.""  The report noted there are access gaps for psychiatrists, some specialists and dentists, but those are the same fields where access is limited throughout the system due to a shortage of providers. Friedsam said Wisconsin is in better shape than many states in terms of Medicaid care access. ""In Wisconsin we actually have very robust participation by most physicians in the Medicaid programs,"" she said. ""We do have a number of studies showing that Medicaid members overall do fairly comparably to other low-income, privately insured members."" A 2016 Medicaid access study from the state Department of Health Services found 87% of primary care physicians in the state participated in Medicaid, with 72% of that group seeing enough patients to be considered active. But only 37% of dentists were in Medicaid, and less than half were considered active. It’s important to note that most private health insurance plans don’t include any dental coverage, however — those have to be purchased separately. So any dental coverage from Medicaid is an improvement over private health insurance. Born said in an interview that ""private insurance gives … better coverage"" than people would get under a Medicaid expansion. This is wrong on multiple levels. Expanding Medicaid to people making 138% of the federal poverty level gives insurance coverage to tens of thousands of people that are currently uninsured — clearly ""better coverage."" Born also asserts cost is not part of which coverage is ""better,"" but that is not how things work. The cost of premiums, deductibles and copays are a fundamental part of everyone’s health insurance and health care decision-making, and studies show a clear connection between cost and an ability to access care. Some specialties do have fewer options under Medicaid than private insurance, but generally speaking studies and experts say the care access is comparable between the two. And Born didn’t make a claim specific to health care access, he claimed overall coverage was better on private insurance. We rate that claim False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/21/mark-born/no-private-insurance-doesnt-provide-better-coverag/

The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden has taken steps to offer people gender-neutral alternatives, not to eliminate the use of terms that identify gender. The Democratic-led House of Representatives went further in a narrow way, replacing in its rules document gender-specific terms with gender-neutral ones.  News organizations reported that on Jan. 20, Biden’s first day in office, WhiteHouse.gov was changed so that people who use the Contact Form for messaging the White House can choose not to be identified by gender.  The choices in the prefix dropdown menu are: Mr., Ms., Mrs., Dr. and the gender-neutral Mx. The choices for pronoun are: she/her, he/him, they/them, other and prefer not to share. In February, The 19th, a news website that covers gender, politics and policy, reported that the Biden administration is considering whether to add ""X"" gender markers to federal documents such as passports.  Biden promised on his campaign website to work to ""ensure all transgender individuals have access to identification documents that accurately reflect their gender identity. Biden believes every transgender or non-binary person should have the option of changing their gender marker to M, F or X on government identifications, passports and other documentation. He will support state and federal efforts to allow for this accurate representation."" The House adopts rules for each of its two-year terms, typically amending the rules from the previous session to govern the new session. The rules spell out everything from directing the Speaker of the House to preserve order in the House, to organizing committees, to the management of legislation. On Jan. 4, the House voted 217-206 to adopt the Rules of the House for the 117th Congress. It was a strict party-line vote, with all yes votes coming from Democrats.  Newly passed amendments to the previous rules included a ""Gender-Inclusive Language"" section, where words such as father and mother were changed to parent; brother and sister to sibling; and himself or herself to themself. The move only changed the text of the House rules for the 2021-2023 session; the changes were not applied more broadly and do not apply, for instance, to floor debate. The changes were made to promote ""inclusion and diversity"" and to ""honor all gender identities by changing pronouns and familial relationships in the House rules to be gender neutral,"" Democrats Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Rep. James McGovern of Massachusetts, the House Rules Committee chair, said in a news release announcing the proposed rule changes. The changes led Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., to say ""a majority of Americans have voted for a party"" that ""wants a world in which you cannot call your parents mom and dad."" We rated that claim False. A meme widely shared on Facebook claimed, ""Biden and the Democrats want to remove any term that denotes gender."" The contact form on WhiteHouse.gov now allows people to choose pronouns that don’t identify gender, and Biden is considering adding a gender-neutral choice for documents such as passports. But it doesn’t eliminate gender-specific options. The Democratic-led House went further by changing all gender-specific references in its rules document to gender-neutral references.  While the Biden administration has advocated for more inclusive language that allows people to self-identify using gender pronouns that they feel are better suited to them, and the Congressional Democrats changed the language in their rules to be more inclusive, this claim goes too far. They have not removed all terms that denote gender; they have added another option to the existing ones. We rate it Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/20/facebook-posts/fact-check-biden-democrats-gender-remove/

Foot Locker did not donate $200 million to Black Lives Matter
","A Minnesota Foot Locker store was among a number of businesses destroyed during recent protests against police brutality following the April 11 fatal shooting of Daunte Wright by police. Now, a Facebook post suggests there is irony in what happened at the footwear store: ""Foot Locker donated 200 million dollars to BLM. Their stores in Minneapolis got looted last night... by... BLM,"" reads a post shared April 12. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is inaccurate. A protest over Wright's death in Brooklyn Center north of Minneapolis intensified the night of April 11 when police clashed with the crowd and used flash bangs and tear gas on the assembly. Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said during a press conference that several businesses were broken into and had merchandise stolen. The Star Tribune reported a Foot Locker at Shingle Creek Crossing mall was among 20 businesses that were ""completely destroyed."". But there isn’t evidence that Foot Locker has given money to Black Lives Matter. The retailer did make a significant pledge to efforts to combat racism and injustice, but Black Lives Matter was not one of its recipients. After the June 2020 protests over the police killing of George Floyd, Foot Locker announced its Leading Education and Economic Development initiative, saying it would devote $200 million over the course of five years to ""fight racial inequality and injustice and enhance the lives of the Black community,"" according to a company spokesman. ""The commitment is to many communities and organizations, not to one nonprofit or group,"" the spokesman said. None of the money that has been used since the pledge was made has gone to Black Lives Matter. A search of Black Lives Matter’s recent tax filings does not show Foot Locker as a donor. Tensions have been high in the Minneapolis area, as Wright’s fatal shooting by a police officer came amid the trial of former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with murder in Floyd’s death. We reached out to Brooklyn Center Police regarding arrests stemming from the protests, but did not hear back. While law enforcement has made numerous arrests associated with nightly demonstrations since April 11, it is not clear whether any were associated with the Foot Locker incident.   A Facebook post claimed that Foot Locker made a $200 million donation to Black Lives Matter and that one of their stores in Minneapolis was burgled by Black Lives Matter members. The posts confuse a $200 million pledge the company made after the George Floyd protests to fight racial inequality and uplift the Black community.

Did Derek Chauvin have his hand in his pocket as he restrained George Floyd?
","As weeks of testimony come to a close in the murder trial for former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, questions over Chauvin’s use of force against George Floyd in the arrest that preceded Floyd’s death have spilled over onto social media. Some Facebook and Instagram users said Floyd could not have been resisting arrest, because Chauvin had one hand in his own pocket as he kneeled on Floyd’s neck for roughly nine minutes on May 25, 2020. ""If George Floyd were resisting, Chauvin's hands wouldn't have been in his pockets,"" said an April 6 Facebook post, one of several to make the claim. The post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Several use-of-force experts and the Minneapolis police chief testified during the trial that Floyd was no longer resisting as he lay pinned under Chauvin’s knee, and that Chauvin should have cut off his restraint once Floyd, who repeatedly said he could not breathe, cried out in distress. Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. It’s not true, however, that Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket as he knelt on Floyd.  PolitiFact’s review of the roughly 10-minute bystander video that ignited months of racial justice protests found that Chauvin was wearing gloves that, like his pants, were a very dark color. A close review of photos taken as screen grabs of the video also show Chauvin’s hand on his thigh. The claim that Chauvin had his hand in his pocket started circulating on Facebook shortly after Floyd’s death, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.  As the trial has played out in recent weeks, those claims have resurfaced. Some news outlets have spread the narrative, USA Today reported. And in a video, Floyd’s brother Philonese said, ""He tortured my brother to death with a smirk on his face, with his hands in his pocket."" The narrative also came up in court as Minneapolis firefighter Genevieve Hansen testified that she had tried to render medical aid to Floyd but was turned away by the police officers present.  ""In my memory, (Chauvin) had his hand in his pocket, he looked so comfortable,"" Hansen said.  The prosecution asked Hansen if her assessment of Chauvin’s positioning would be different if Chauvin’s hand had been ""resting on his thigh"" rather than in his pocket. Hansen said no and that Chauvin seemed ""comfortable"" in the position he had taken to restrain Floyd regardless.  In reality, Chauvin’s hand was on his thigh, USA Today first reported. It was not in his pocket. PolitiFact reviewed the roughly 10-minute video uploaded to Facebook by Darnella Frazier, who later testified as a witness in Chauvin’s trial. Chauvin is visible for most but not all of the video.  The video Frazier posted to Facebook shows Chauvin wearing black gloves that appear to match the color of his pants. At various points in the video, Chauvin can be seen resting the knuckles of his left hand on his thigh while he pinned Floyd’s neck to the pavement with his knee. At other points, Chauvin can be seen placing his hand on his radio and other objects on the holster of his belt.  Police body camera footage of the incident does not always show Chauvin clearly. Several of the social media posts claiming that Chauvin’s hand was in his pocket relied on screen grabs taken from Frazier’s video. The screen grabs on their own can be misleading, but a closer look reveals that the photos really show Chauvin’s gloves blended in with his pants. Using image editing software, USA Today altered the brightness, exposure and vibrancy of the screen grabs to make the placement of Chauvin’s hand more visible. The enhanced version of the photo shows Chauvin’s knuckles resting against his thigh, with his fingers bent backwards. Matthew Stamm, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Drexel University, is an expert on falsified images and videos. Stamm said USA Today’s techniques for enhancing the screen grab images were a legitimate way to visually interpret what they showed. Stamm and researcher Brian Hosler also reviewed Frazier’s video for PolitiFact. From screen grabs that they took, they concluded that Chauvin’s hand was on his thigh, not in his pocket. Several use-of-force experts and law enforcement personnel, including Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, said Floyd had stopped resisting before his breathing came to a halt. ""Once Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting — and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalize that — that should have stopped,"" Arradondo said of Chauvin’s use of force. Facebook posts said Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket while kneeling on George Floyd. While some screen grabs taken from a bystander’s video appear to show that Chauvin had his left hand in his pocket as he pressed Floyd to the pavement, both the video itself and enhanced versions of the screen grabs indicate that his hand was actually on his thigh.  Chauvin was wearing black gloves during the incident that blended in with his dark pants.

No, schools didn’t stop teaching cursive writing to keep kids from reading the Constitution
","Many schools don’t teach students cursive writing anymore, for the same reason they don’t teach them how to use a manual typewriter or a slide rule. It’s just not a very relevant skill. But some on social media point to a more sinister reason for the disappearance of cursive instruction: a plot to ensure children won’t be able to read the U.S. Constitution and thus won’t understand their rights as citizens. ""Our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, is written in cursive and they no longer want generations from here on out to know how to read it,"" says one woman in a viral Facebook video, as ominous music plays in the background. The problem with that theory: You don’t need to know cursive to read the text of the U.S. Constitution. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the U.S. Constitution, Declaration of Independence and many other historical documents were first handwritten in cursive on parchment with quills and ink — the originals are in the National Archives — copies in typeset, printed form have been available almost ever since, and they have all been archived and digitized for ready access.  The Declaration of Independence was set in movable type immediately after its adoption — by order of the Continental Congress — and was distributed through the colonies. The text of the Constitution, too, was typeset and printed in the Pennsylvania Packet on Sept. 19, 1787, two day after it was signed.  Meanwhile, students who attended school when cursive instruction was in the regular rotation didn’t learn about the Constitution and other founding documents by looking at the original manuscript. They learned it from textbooks. Even for students who learn cursive, the penmanship of the founding documents can be difficult to understand. Proponents of teaching cursive argue that it has positive effects on children’s brains, as it teaches them language and sequencing and improves their motor skills. A video on Facebook claims that schools stopped teaching cursive to make sure children couldn’t read the U.S. Constitution, and other important historical documents. This is bogus. Even if that were the intention, it would not be a very good plan.

No, Hobby Lobby’s CEO didn’t say stores are closing
","A statement attributed to Hobby Lobby CEO David Green that’s being shared on social media talks about the company’s Christian principles and how they’re at odds with government mandates to cover emergency contraception.  The words are real — Green penned them for a September 2012 column in USA Today explaining why Hobby Lobby sued the federal government over a provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to offer their employees health care plans that cover all forms of contraception.  Nearly nine years later, it’s being recirculated online without context and with some creative additions.  In one Facebook post from April 15, for example, the statement is titled: ""Hobby Lobby, We may close.""

""We believe people are more important than the bottom line and that honoring God is more important than turning a profit,"" he wrote.  Under the Obamacare mandate, he said, the government threatened ""to fine job creators in a bad economy.""  Green wrote that he felt like the company had no choice but to go to court.  In the end, the Hobby Lobby case went to the Supreme Court, and in a 5-4 decision in 2014, the company prevailed.  Somebody who saw one of the recent Facebook posts sharing Green’s 2012 column may not realize that, and mistake his concerns as new.

McAuliffe near the top in restoring ex-felon voting rights
","Former and possibly future Gov. Terry McAuliffe says he holds the national record for restoring voting rights to people who have finished felony prison sentences.  ""I restored felons’ rights - 173,000 - more than any governor in the history of America,"" he said during an April 6 debate between the five candidates in the June 8 Democratic primary election for governor. When a candidate claims a record, our ears perk up. We fact checked McAuliffe’s statement. McAuliffe was governor from 2014 to 2018. He stepped down because Virginia is the only state that doesn’t allow its governor to serve successive terms. McAuliffe’s numbers On April 22, 2016, McAuliffe issued a blanket executive order enabling 206,000 Virginia people who served their prison time and finished parole or probation to register to vote. He said people who had completed their punishment deserved redemption. McAuliffe stressed that many of the eligible people were African Americans and said the ban on former felons voting was a remnant of Virginia’s racist history of keeping Black citizens from the polls. The action was heralded by civil rights advocates. Marc Mauer, then executive director of The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy group, called the order ""the single most significant action on disenfranchisement that we’ve ever seen from a governor."" Republican legislative leaders said McAuliffe’s action was a ruse to maximize likely Democratic voters during a presidential election year and filed suit, arguing the governor had exceeded his power. The Virginia Supreme Court agreed, ruling on a 4-3 vote that McAuliffe lacked the authority to issue the blanket order. The court said the governor could grant voting rights to ex felons only on an individual basis. And that’s what McAuliffe did. His administration streamlined its review process, checking only if people had completed their sentences, parole or probation, then sending each a letter with an image of the governor’s signature, saying he or she could register to vote.  By the end of his term, McAuliffe had restored voting rights to 173,166 people, according to the Secretary of Commonwealth’s office. That’s almost five times more than the total for the 19 governors who preceded him, back to 1938. The record There’s no source that lists the number of felon voting rights that have been restored by governors across the nation either recently or going back in history.  We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for proof of his claim that he’s No. 1 and were sent an April 27, 2017 article in The Washington Post reporting that McAuliffe claimed he had broken a national record held by former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who restored voting rights to 155,315 people from 2007 to 2011. We can’t verify Crist held the record, but it’s plausible because there were only a handful of states where the governor had a say in restoring voting rights. What’s clear is that McAuliffe is not the record holder today - a possibility he leaves open in his statement. His tally of 173,166 was recently exceeded by Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, who issued a blanket order in 2019 that so far has restored voting rights to 180,315 people, according to the Kentucky Department of Corrections. Beshears has not claimed the national title. There are now only four states where the governor weighs in on restoring voting rights: Virginia, Kentucky, Iowa and Mississippi.  Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, issued an order in August 2020 automatically restoring voting rights to people who have completed their sentences and were not convicted of murder or manslaughter. The order was reported to affect up to 60,000 people. Mississippi has not taken significant action.  Forty-four states, including Florida, have set up varying systems that either automatically restore voting rights at some point after imprisonment, or leave the restoration up to entities outside the governor's office. Two states - Maine and Vermont - don’t take away voting rights, even when people are in prison. We should finally note that Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has continued McAuliffe’s work. Northam announced in March 2021 that he had restored voting rights to more than 69,000 people. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""I restored felons’ rights - 173,000 - more than any governor in the history of America."" McAuliffe restored the voting rights of 173,166 people when he was Virginia governor from 2014-2018. It’s plausible that he had established a record when he left office, but we can’t say so with certainty. In any case, his achievement has been lauded as groundbreaking by many civil rights advocates. But McAuliffe’s claim needs a little clarification: He is not the current record holder. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has more recently restored voting rights to 180,315 people since 2019. So, we rate McAuliffe’s statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2021/apr/19/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-near-top-restoring-ex-felon-voting-right/

Calculating herd immunity is more than 'simple math'
","Gov. Greg Abbott is optimistic about the state of the coronavirus pandemic in Texas, where the trend line of daily new cases has dropped from wintertime highs to springtime lows not seen since September.   The reason behind his optimism, he told Fox News host Chris Wallace during an April 11 interview, is based on ""simple math.""  ""We absolutely aren't declaring victory at this time. We remain very vigilant and guarded and proactive in our response, but there's simple math behind the reason why we continue to have success,"" Abbott said.  He went on: ""When you add all the number of vaccinations that are taking place, as well as all of the acquired immunity from Texans who have been exposed and recovered from COVID-19, it means, very simply, it’s a whole lot more difficult for COVID to be spreading to other people in the state of Texas.""  Abbott’s calculation begged Wallace’s next question: ""Do you think you have herd immunity in Texas now?""  ""It looks like it could be very close to herd immunity,"" Abbott replied.  As of April 12, about 5.8 million people had been fully vaccinated in Texas, or about 20% of the state population, according to state data. Additionally, the state has recorded about 2.8 million positive cases or probable cases, identified through antigen testing, since the beginning of the pandemic. Subtract from that total the 50,000 cases that have resulted in deaths. The rest, about 2.75 million Texans, have recovered from infection and are presumed to have some level of natural immunity to future infection. Does the combined number of vaccinated people plus those with natural immunity — a total of 8.55 million people in a population of 29 million — bring Texas ""very close to herd immunity""? We found that there are several other factors and caveats that Abbott’s equation omits. Calculating a population’s immunity level and its herd immunity threshold is more than a matter of simple math.  In his interview with Wallace, Abbott said that even though he thinks Texas is ""very close"" to reaching herd immunity, he doesn’t know what the herd immunity threshold is. And epidemiologists agree that a population’s threshold is somewhat of a moving target.   Simply defined, herd immunity threshold is the percentage of a population that must be immunized from a disease, be it through infections or vaccinations, for the spread to abate. The more infectious a contagion, the higher its threshold.  Measles, for instance, is a highly infectious disease that is at least three times as contagious as COVID-19. Measles requires a herd immunity threshold level of around 94%, meaning that 94% of a population will need to be immune to measles before its transmission rate declines. This has been achieved through the widespread use of vaccinations.  COVID-19's herd immunity threshold level is not yet known. Most estimates have placed the threshold at 60%-70%, according to the peer-reviewed science journal Nature. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor and director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has cited a range of threshold levels that has changed as more has been learned about the virus.   Early on in the pandemic Fauci said that threshold was around 60% to 70%. In December, Fauci cited higher figures, saying ""I would think that you would need somewhere between 70, 75, maybe 80%,"" during a CNBC interview.  Dr. James McDeavitt, dean of clinical affairs at Baylor College of Medicine, shares Abbott’s optimism about Texas making progress toward herd immunity, but he says that we won’t know we’ve reached herd immunity until well after we’ve achieved it.   ""There are a lot of variables for what actually constitutes herd immunity threshold, and the reality is I don’t think we’ll know when we achieve it until we’re looking backwards,"" McDeavitt said.  If vaccination rates continue at today’s pace, eventually Texas will see the rate of new daily cases drop to very low levels. After those levels remain low for three to four weeks, he says, scientists could safely say that we’ve surpassed the herd immunity threshold. ""When we see that occur, we can look back and say we achieved herd immunity,"" McDeavitt said. ""But I don't think anybody can do a calculation and predict when that's going to happen.""  Abbott mentioned two factors that contribute to a population’s immunity — the number of fully vaccinated people and the known number of people who have recovered from COVID-19. These two categories total 8.55 million people, or about 30% of the state population.   An Abbott spokesperson later clarified that the governor also was including the ""true number of recoveries,"" or the category of people who contracted COVID-19 but were never tested and thus never included in the state’s case count. His spokesperson pointed to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s estimation that only 1 in 4.6 actual infections have been reported.   The CDC says that official case numbers ""likely represent only a fraction of the true number of cases that have occurred in the population,"" and there’s a variety of reasons why cases may go undetected, including asymptomatic people who were never aware of their infection, and people who suffered symptoms but never sought health care.  According to Abbott’s spokesperson, applying the CDC’s estimation to Texas would mean that another 10 million cases have gone undetected. Adding in that total would bring Texas’ immunity rate up to around 60%, the spokesperson said.  Officials at the Texas Department of State Health Services did not respond to questions asking for an evaluation of Abbott's calculation.  But applying the CDC’s estimate to Texas is just one of several ways to calculate the unknown number of cases in the population, said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ""There is a significant portion of the population that has acquired immunity — they've been infected and they've recovered,"" he said. ""How big of a slice of the population is that? That's up for debate.""  The University of Texas Coronavirus Antibody Response Survey takes a different approach to estimating that total. It estimates that the seroprevalence rate in Texas, or the percent of people with COVID-19 antibodies in their bloodstream, is around 26%. Under those estimates, around 5.1 million cases in Texas could have gone unreported. That would peg Texas’ immunity rate at around 45%.  ""It’s a guess, because we just don't have all the information at our fingertips,"" said Michaud. ""But triangulating from different surveys, from different models, you can kind of get a sense of what we're talking about here.""  There are other factors that Abbott’s ""simple math"" omits. First, there’s an overlap in the number of people who have had a prior infection and received a vaccine, yet there’s no way to tell how many people fall into both categories, experts said.  Second, none of the available vaccines are 100% effective. The Pfizer vaccine is reportedly 95% effective; the Moderna vaccine is 86% effective; and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, now suspended, is 72% effective.  Furthermore, there’s also uncertainty about whether fully vaccinated people could transmit the virus to others.   ""We hope that within the next five or so months we’ll be able to answer the very important question about whether vaccinated people get infected asymptomatically, and if they do, do they transmit the infection to others,"" Fauci said in a March 26 White House press briefing.  These factors — the overlap between vaccinated and recovered people and the unlucky people unprotected by the vaccine — would subtract from Abbott's estimated level of immunity, Michaud said. Health officials also urge anyone who’s ever had a prior infection to get vaccinated because acquiring antibodies through natural infection does not offer as much protection against the virus or its variants. It’s also unclear how long natural immunity lasts. Take for example Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, a coronavirus skeptic who has famously been diagnosed with COVID-19 three times.   ""The governor said that we are ‘close’ to herd immunity. Depending on your definition of ‘close,’ that may be the case,"" Michaud said.  ""We are getting closer to herd immunity, however you define it, because we're vaccinating more people over time. But are we there now? The answer is probably no. But when we will get there and what level do we need to get there are still open questions that people are debating,"" he said.  Abbott said that Texas ""could be very close to herd immunity"" during an interview on Fox News. He said he based this assessment on ""simple math,"" which is the number of people who have been fully vaccinated plus those who have natural immunity — those who have been infected and recovered and an estimated number of those who were infected and were not tested.  About 5.8 million people, or 20% of the state population, has been fully vaccinated as of April 12. The total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19 is not known, although various estimates show that it ranges from 25%-40% of the state population. Adding those totals together would mean that the state's immunity level ranges from 45-60%, while the herd immunity threshold is understood to range between 60-80%. However, other factors would subtract from the state's immunity level, like the fraction of people who receive a vaccine but aren’t protected, or the overlap of people who recovered from prior infection and received a vaccine. But there are no estimations for how many people fall into either of these categories, experts said. Furthermore, health officials urge everyone to get vaccinated — whether or not they've recovered from a past infection — because immunity from vaccines is known to be more durable than natural immunity. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/19/greg-abbott/calculating-herd-immunity-more-simple-math/
