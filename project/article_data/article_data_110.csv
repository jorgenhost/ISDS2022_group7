Donald Trump's inaugural speech polled well, but not as well as predecessors'
","During an interview with ABC News’ David Muir, President Donald Trump -- as he has been known to do -- took the opportunity to tout some of his poll numbers. ""A poll just came out on my inauguration speech which was extraordinary that people loved it,"" Trump said Jan. 25, 2017. ""Loved and liked. And it was an extraordinary poll."" So, is he right? We took a closer look. When we contacted the White House, they told us that the poll in question was the Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Jan. 25, five days after the inauguration. The poll surveyed 1,922 registered voters, with a sampling margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. The relevant question was, ""Based on what you have seen, read or heard recently about Donald Trump’s inauguration speech, would you say it was excellent, good, only fair or poor?"" The question was only asked of the 1,762 people who said they watched the address, which the pollster said was ""a sample that’s slightly more Republican than the overall poll, although (it) still skews Democratic."" The results? A plurality -- 49 percent -- thought Trump’s speech was ""excellent"" or ""good."" By comparison, 39 percent thought the speech was either fair or poor. So, Trump has a point: In isolation, at least, that’s a pretty good score. It’s also a similar result to another poll that asked essentially the same question. Gallup asked, ""Based on what you have heard or read, how would you rate Donald Trump's inauguration speech? Would you rate it as -- excellent, good, just okay, poor or terrible?"" Gallup surveyed 508 adults, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. The poll found that 53 percent thought the speech was ""excellent"" or ""good,"" while 42 percent thought it was ""just okay,"" ""poor,"" or ""terrible."" So both surveys found positive responses outpacing negative responses by about 10 percentage points, with positive responses accounting for either a majority or nearly a majority. The one caveat we’ll mention is that Trump’s showing wasn’t as positive as that of other recent presidents. Gallup has asked this question for the previous three inaugural addresses -- George W. Bush’s in 2005 and Barack Obama’s in 2009 and 2013. Trump’s ""excellent plus good"" score of 53 percent trailed all three. The score for Bush in 2005 was 62 percent, while Obama received 81 percent in 2009 and 65 percent in 2013. In addition, Trump got the worst-ever ""terrible"" score -- 14 percent, which was twice as high as the previous record, for Obama’s second inaugural speech. Our ruling Trump said, ""A poll just came out on my inauguration speech. … People loved it. Loved and liked."" He has a point that in both the Politico/Morning Consult poll and the Gallup poll, favorable opinions outpaced unfavorable opinions by double-digit margins. However, it’s worth noting that Trump’s positive score in the Gallup poll was between 9 and 28 points lower than the scores in the previous three inaugural addresses.

Donald Trump was not 'unanimously endorsed' by ICE, border patrol
","On the same day that President Donald Trump signed executive orders to build a border wall and hire more immigration law enforcement officials, he commended employees already serving the country for their service — and for their support. ""We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,"" Trump said Jan. 25 at the Department of Homeland Security. ""Before we go any further, I want to recognize the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) and border patrol officers in this room today and to honor their service and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president. That helps, but that's not the only reason."" It was not the first time Trump touted endorsements from immigration officers, but did they unanimously endorse him? Not exactly. Support from ICE, border patrol unions ICE agents are represented by the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, and border patrol officers are represented by the National Border Patrol Council. Both unions endorsed Trump during the presidential campaign. But it is misleading for Trump to say ICE and border patrol officers unanimously endorsed him. The National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council represents 5,000 immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. ICE has about 20,000 employees, including nearly 6,000 agents and officers in removal operations. A statement from the ICE union posted September 2016 on Trump’s presidential campaign website says their endorsement of Trump was the first ever by a vote of the membership. In that same statement, council president Chris Crane said Trump’s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton received 5 percent of that vote. The other union, the National Border Patrol Council, represents 16,500 border patrol agents. The union's endorsement was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the Los Angeles Times. The May 2016 Los Angeles Times article reported that agents in El Paso, Texas, had asked their local union to ""disavow the endorsement,"" but that their attempt failed in a 14-13 vote. Our ruling Trump said ICE and border patrol officers ""unanimously endorsed me for president."" Unions representing ICE and border patrol agents endorsed Trump for president. Not all officers represented by the ICE union voted to endorse Trump, and some border patrol agents in Texas asked their local union to disavow the national union’s endorsement.

Whoopi Goldberg wrongly says Obama waited ‘at least a couple of months’ to issue executive actions
","The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg claimed recently that unlike President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama waited before issuing executive actions. After a striking comment from co-host Joy Behar, who hypothesized Trump was passing executive actions quickly because he was afraid he’d be impeached, another co-host, Jedediah Bila, countered Behar’s point saying ""all presidents do this."" Goldberg offered an instant fact-check. ""I think the difference in what you're saying in terms of executive action is at least it took President Obama, at least a couple of months in, and this one (Trump) has came in and he said, ‘We're doing this and this, and this.’ And I understand that,"" Goldberg said in a Jan. 25 segment of the View. Goldberg repeated this idea again in response to Bila, who criticized Obama for taking executive actions at the start of his presidency when he could have passed laws through a Democratic Congress. ""But (Obama) didn’t do executive orders in the beginning,"" Goldberg said. Executive orders are the most well-known kind of presidential action, and have a long tradition in presidential history back to the days of George Washington. In fact, every president except for William Harrison (who died a month into office) has issued at least one executive order. This specific presidential action directs the federal government and bureaucracies and carries the power of the law. However, executive orders can be revoked or amended by future presidents. We wanted to settle the matter: Did Obama, unlike Trump, wait to take executive action? Long story short is that he didn’t, and experts said executive actions are common among new presidents.   Obama didn’t waste much time before issuing executive orders after his inauguration. Obama signed his first executive order (13489) about presidential records on Jan. 21, 2009, a day after the inauguration. This executive order required the Archivist of the United States notify both the incumbent president and the former president of any records the archivist feels may trigger executive privilege. (Executive privilege refers to the president’s power to withhold information from the public.) Over the next 10 days, Obama had signed nine executive orders. By the end of his first month, the number was 16. Here’s how Obama compared to Trump: As of Jan. 26, Trump had signed four executive orders aimed at achieving various campaign promises. By this time, Obama had issued five executive orders. Obama first aimed to limit access to presidential records, while another ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba within one year. That action received backlash from Republicans. As did Obama’s corresponding order to look for lawful alternatives to the detention of captives in the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. Month Executive orders signed by Obama January 2009 (starting on Jan. 21) 9 February 2009 7 March 2009 2 April 2009 1 Source: https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html Executive action has a broad definition, but just in terms of one type of executive orders, Goldberg’s claim is incorrect. That said, it’s hard to say whether Trump’s first actions as president are more significant for policy than Obama’s. Executive orders aren’t the only action president’s can take, making it difficult to compare Obama’s use of unilateral actions to Trump’s so far. Through ""executive actions,"" presidents can also pardon criminals, amend the internal structure of the executive branch, issue signing statements, write letters and memoranda, and more. ""The number of orders is often misleading, and the terminology can be confusing — both presidents issued important orders that were not ‘Executive Orders’ with numbers attached,"" said John T. Woolley, an American politics professor at University of California, Santa Barbara. William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that both Trump and Obama took controversial actions at the start. ""The early Trump executive actions have been on hot button issues, so they aroused a lot of early controversy, but we can’t forget how controversial presidential actions of the past have been,"" he said. Galston was specifically referring to the U.S. Treasury’s decision to bail out the auto industry during Obama’s first year. When Obama took office, he created a task force with a mandate to determine the fate of GM and Chrysler. He added that is not unlikely for presidents to take executive actions at first, especially when there’s a change in party, adding that presidents want to reverse actions of the previous administration. For example, Trump issued a presidential memorandum on Jan. 23 that banned all foreign nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. funds from performing or promoting abortion, reversing an Obama action. The recession gripping the country when Obama took office also spurred the former president to move with more urgent executive action, Galston said. Our ruling Goldberg said Obama waited ""at least a couple of months"" to issue executive actions. That’s not correct; Obama issued an executive order on his first day in office, and 16 with in his first month. Although it’s hard to compare one president’s actions to the other, experts said Trump and Obama both issued important orders in the beginning of their presidency, which is common practice.

Donald Trump falsely tells GOP Philly homicides are ‘terribly increasing’
","Donald Trump made his first visit to Philadelphia as president today and at the beginning of his speech at the GOP Retreat said it was ""great"" to be in the city. Then things went south. Trump said, ""Here in Philadelphia, murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing."" So what’s really happening with homicides in Philadelphia? In 2016, according to year-end data from the police department, 277 people were killed in the city. That number is down from 2015, when 280 people were killed; and up from 2014, when 248 people were killed.   Homicides since the mid 2000s, however, are way down. In 2007, Philly had 391 murders. Go back to the 1990s, and Philadelphia’s murder rate was even higher. Five hundred people were killed in 1990. The murder rate decreased throughout the 1990s before going back up in the early 2000s and falling since then. The 277 people killed in 2016 is the third-lowest amount since 1990 and down about 45 percent from the 1990 peak. We reached out to White House spokesperson Steven N. Cheung for comment. We’ll update if we hear back. Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement Thursday afternoon saying the president’s comments were ""insulting"" to police. ""Our police officers have worked tirelessly and with great personal sacrifice to get Philadelphia’s crime rate down to its lowest point in forty years, while also successfully implementing reforms to strengthen police-community relations and uphold the rights of all our residents,"" he said in the statement. He continued: ""Our homicides are, in fact, slowly declining, and while we are not satisfied with even our current numbers, we are handicapped by Republican refusal to enact any kind of common sense gun control and by their obsession with turning our police officers into ICE agents — which will prevent immigrants from coming forward to report crimes or provide critical witnesses statements that can put dangerous criminals behind bars."" Our Ruling President Donald Trump, while addressing the GOP Retreat at the Loews Hotel, said, ""Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing."" The murder rate was higher last year than it was in 2014 and 2013, but it was lower than in 2015 and the third-lowest it has been since 1990. The murder rate in 2016 was about 45 percent lower than in 1990, when 500 people were killed.

Claire McCaskill overstates tax impacts of repealing Obamacare
","Facing the possibility that congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump will repeal the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are trying to warn Americans about some of the consequences. Sometimes, though, such warnings have gone too far. One example is a statement by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in a Jan. 23, 2017, interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. During a discussion of the women’s march held a few days earlier, McCaskill said Democrats needed to shine a light on potential policy changes by the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress. As an example, she cited how the tax code could change if lawmakers repealed the ACA. ""Not one dime of the tax cut that they are going to enact with the repeal of Obamacare will go to people who make under $200,000,"" McCaskill said. We’ll take a closer look at this statement, with the acknowledgement that we don’t know the final shape of a congressional repeal of the law (or, for that matter, whether one will happen at all). Of course, neither does McCaskill. We do know, however, that McCaskill is wrong to say that a repeal would only give tax cuts to the rich. Taxes on the rich While the Affordable Care Act is best known for its provisions aimed at expanding health insurance coverage, it is also a major tax bill, since its authors sought to provide ongoing revenue sources to support other portions of the bill. When we checked with McCaskill’s office, they said that McCaskill was referring to a provision of the bill that imposed a 0.9 percentage point payroll surtax for individuals earning $200,000 or married couples earning $250,000, along with a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for higher-income taxpayers. This is indeed the biggest tax increase in the law. Shortly before it was passed, the Joint Committee on Taxation -- the bipartisan congressional panel that analyzes all proposed tax changes -- projected that these provisions would raise $210.2 billion in revenue over the 10-year period between 2010 and 2019. We found another tax provision that would also benefit wealthy Americans -- one that limits the deductibility of executive compensation in the health insurance industry to $500,000. The Joint Tax Committee projected that this provision would generate much less revenue -- $600 million over 10 years. The grand total for these tax cuts for high-income Americans, then, is nearly $211 billion. This makes it clear that a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s tax provisions would enact a significant tax cut for Americans earning more than $200,000 a year. Taxes on everyone else However, the law imposed other taxes that would hit more than just the wealthy. For instance, several provisions of the law changed the rules governing flexible spending accounts for medical expenses, such as limiting the maximum dollar amount people could put into them. In addition, the law imposed a 10 percent tax on tanning-bed services. Combined, the JCT projected that these provisions would raise more than $37 billion over 10 years. But that’s not all. The provisions we’ve listed so far in this section are direct taxes that could (and likely would) hit middle-class Americans. However, the law also contains taxes on drug makers and the health insurance industry that would likely be passed through to middle-class Americans. According to JCT’s projection, the taxes on the drug and insurance industries would raise $87.1 billion in all. Not all of these costs would necessarily be passed on, but the yardstick used by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center is that one-fifth of corporate taxes are passed through to workers, with the remainder swallowed by investors. So if we use the center’s one-fifth ratio, then the hit to middle-class Americans from these taxes would be about $17 billion. Finally, a repeal would almost certainly lift the mandate that Americans purchase health insurance or else face a tax penalty. The JCT didn’t project how much revenue these tax penalties would generate, but the most recent report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that for the 2014 tax year, 8.1 million taxpayers had been hit by these tax penalties, totaling almost $1.7 billion. So, over the 10-year window used by JCT, this provision would be expected to produce revenues of $17 billion over 10 years. If you put all these categories together, the tax changes add up to $71 billion. Two independent experts -- Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center and Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush -- told us that our analysis was sound. McCaskill’s office, for her part, pointed to a Tax Policy Center analysis that showed high-income Americans reaping the majority of the tax benefits if all ACA taxes were repealed. For instance, those earning $1 million and up would see their taxes go down by about $50,000 each, while those earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see a tax cut of $4,580. By contrast, no income group lower than that would see an average cut (or in some cases, a tax increase) of more than a couple hundred dollars. McCaskill’s office also cautioned that the JCT analysis is seven years old, and that it does not provide specifics about which taxes would hit income groups. They also cited news reports suggesting that the GOP was likelier to repeal the high-income taxes than the ones that tend to hit middle-income Americans. Still, while a repeal of all taxes in the law would disproportionately benefit high-income Americans, McCaskill’s notion that ""not one dime"" of the tax benefits would go to ordinary Americans goes too far. While a minority of the total tax benefits from a repeal would end up in the pockets of ordinary Americans, the percentage is neither zero nor negligible. Our ruling McCaskill said, ""Not one dime of the tax cut that they are going to enact with the repeal of Obamacare will go to people who make under $200,000."" She has a point that if all taxes in the law are repealed, then high-income earners are likely to reap a majority of the benefits. However, $71 billion in tax cuts spread more broadly across the income spectrum are a far cry from ""not one dime."" The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/jan/26/claire-mccaskill/claire-mccaskill-overstates-tax-impacts-repealing-/
"['National', 'Climate Change', 'Jerry Brown']","
Here's what you need to know about California's climate change deal
","California Gov. Jerry Brown offered an energetic rebuke to the Trump administration’s ""alternative facts"" and ""blatant attacks on science"" in his State of the State address. The solidly blue state voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prompting Brown to reflect on California’s place in a broader national context in a speech traditionally used to set a state policy agenda. Contrasting Trump’s positions, Brown promised to oppose deportations of undocumented immigrants, to protect health care and to continue to act on climate change. ""One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2 MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people,"" Brown said. ""We can do much on our own and we can join with others – other states and provinces and even countries, to stop the dangerous rise in climate pollution. And make no mistake, we are going to do exactly that."" We wanted to know more about what Brown was talking about and if it is accurate. The Under2 MOU, or Subnational Global Climate Leadership Memorandum of Understanding, is a pact spearheaded by California and the German state of Baden-Württemberg in the leadup to the Paris agreement in 2015. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a ""game changer."" Its 165 members represent about 1 billion people and pledge to limit carbon emissions to below 80 to 90 percent from 1990 levels with the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100. That’s the same goal and framework of the Paris agreement, the major international deal between nearly 200 nations. But there are a few differences between the two deals. First, Brown’s numbers need explanation. Of the Under2 MOU’s 165 members, 155 are signatories, meaning they've declared their commitment to limit emissions and to provide action plans. The other 10 are countries that have endorsed the MOU, meaning they support the goal but don’t have to submit plans.   Second, the MOU is voluntary and nonbinding, and while the Paris deal is also voluntary, it includes binding obligations on reporting emissions and progress. Third, unlike the MOU, the Paris agreement has increasingly stringent targets for signatories. The United States, for example, pledged to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and then 26 to 28 percent percent by 2025 (equivalent to 19 to 24 percent from 1990 levels).   Despite these differences, experts we spoke with said the Under2 MOU was a strong and forceful compact. But they said the MOU was a complement to the Paris agreement rather than its equivalent in terms of potential impact. ""They’re part and parcel to each other. If you’re driving those kind of reductions, those can help you get to the national targets. They’re not distinct realms. They’re nested within each other,"" said Brendan Guy, the international policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Under the MOU, California pledged to reduce emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and actually enacted legislation that codifies the target and sets a regulatory process in place. That’s a ""really high watermark"" that hardly any national governments have met, said Danny Cullenward, an energy economist at Carnegie Institute for Science. Experts also pointed to California’s five-year-old cap-and-trade program (which the Obama administration tried but failed to implement on a national scale), extended renewable portfolio standards and its pledge to get 1.5 million zero emissions cars on the road by 2025 as examples of strong climate change action. Just how far-reaching are these targets and policies? To state the obvious, cities and states do not account for all of a country’s emissions, so their reduction pledges will not have an equivalent impact to a national commitment. California, despite being the largest state and equivalent to the world’s sixth-largest economy, accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the United States’ emissions. The other nine U.S. states that are part of the MOU (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington) represent another 10 percent of the country’s total emissions. Looking at it another way, if all 23,458 cities from the Energy Department's city energy profile tool enacted best energy-saving practices, it would lead to a 3 to 7 percent reduction in emissions, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  ""Will these subnational efforts be enough to prevent a dangerous increase in average global temperature? Probably not,"" said Rachel Krause, a University of Kansas professor who focuses on local policy and sustainability. ""But they still can have meaningful impact."" Cullenward pointed out that the Paris agreement’s depth is the result of two decades of negotiations, while the MOU is a relatively new compact and will likely become much more sophisticated over time. ""It’s no substitute for eventual national action. But it’s a really appropriate strategy where you have national governments that aren’t interested in taking action on climate change,"" he said. Our ruling  Brown said, ""194 countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal — the Under2 MOU — has 165 signatories, representing a billion people."" The Under2 MOU, spearheaded by California and the Germany state Baden-Württemberg, is a climate change agreement signed by 155 cities and states that have pledged reductions in carbon emissions and endorsed by 10 countries. While its emissions impact is not as far-reaching as the Paris agreement, experts told us it is a very similar deal that fosters international cooperation on climate change and fills a void in times of national hesitation to act.

"['Terrorism', 'Florida', 'Cory Gardner']","
How many released Guantanamo Bay prisoners commit new terrorist acts?

","Republicans who agree with Donald Trump’s promise to keep Guantánamo Bay open have argued that too many released prisoners have committed new acts of terrorism. U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said that Trump should put the worst offenders around the globe in the prison and provide transparency about the activities of released prisoners. ""We know that about 30 percent of terrorists at Guantanamo Bay went back into battle,"" said Gardner, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Fox News Jan. 23. ""We know that a dozen or so killed Americans. These are not good people. I hope the American people understand that. This is a facility that holds the worst of the worst offenders and now down to just a handful of people that can't be released because they are so dangerous."" Gardner makes the numbers sound much more concrete than they actually are; it’s not clear that all of these prisoners ultimately turned back to terrorism. But there is some evidence that Americans have died when fighting against groups that include released prisoners. Former President Barack Obama reduced the prisoner population at Gitmo but fell short of his promise to close the prison. Trump promised to keep Gitmo open and ""load it up with bad dudes."" Estimates include unconfirmed reports At least every six months, the Director of National Intelligence, an appointee of the president, publishes a Congress-mandated report detailing the number of former Guantanamo detainees who have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity. The most recent report, which was published in September, showed re-engagement of prisoners through July 15, 2016. The report included information on 693 prisoners released since the prison opened in 2002. The government reported that 17.6 percent -- 122 individuals -- had been ""confirmed of re-engaging"" and 12.4 percent -- 86 individuals -- ""suspected of re-engaging"" in terrorism. To get to Gardner’s claim of 30 percent requires adding those confirmed and suspected of re-engaging in terrorism. A spokesman for Gardner cited a June 2016 article in the Washington Post for both portions of his claim. The article notes that the 30 percent figure includes both categories. Gardner did not mention Obama while talking about Gitmo. However, it’s worth noting that about 90 percent who re-engaged or were suspected of doing so were released before Obama took office when George W. Bush was president. It was while Obama was president that the percent of released detainees who re-entered the battlefield became a Republican talking point. The two-page report provides no details about how it arrived at the figures beyond some basic definitions. The report explains that the government labels those as ""suspected of re-engaging"" if the information is plausible but unverified or from only a single source. A 2012 House Armed Services Committee report included some examples of released detainees who committed new terrorist acts, such as Abdallah Saleh Ali al-Ajmi who was released in 2005 and conducted a suicide bombing in Iraq in 2008. The federal government stopped releasing the names of those who re-engaged in 2009 to protect intelligence sources and methods, according to the report. ""While this makes sense, it has hindered the public’s understanding of the topic and made it difficult to confirm DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) assessments in some instances,"" states the report. Some experts including DePaul University counterrorism professor Thomas Mockaitis have raised questions about the veracity of the numbers. ""I do have concerns over the use of such figures without explanation or context,"" he said. ""Many of those released are handed over to foreign states who assume responsibility for them. Tracking their activities after they leave Guantanamo can be problematic."" Almost 10 years ago, the Director of National Intelligence, the Pentagon and other stakeholders tightened the criteria under which a released detainee was classified as ""confirmed"" or ""suspected,"" said Cully Stimson, who was involved in that process and served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs during Bush's administration. He says the criteria are valid. ""That said, there is no way to know of the actual number of recidivists because one cannot know what one does not know until one knows it,"" said Stimson, who is now an expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Said another way, the intelligence community won’t know if a Gitmo transferee went back to combatant activity unless and until there is some level of proof of that recidivism, sufficient to satisfy either the ‘suspected’ or ‘confirmed’ level."" In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, compiled its own numbers of released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, news stories and other public information. At the time there were 620 released prisoners, and the foundation found that 54 of them ""are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets."" That was about one-third of the government’s figure of 184 at the time. The foundation has not updated the report since that time. A Post report documents American deaths This part of Gardner’s claim stems from a Washington Post article that stated that the Obama administration believed that at least 12 released detainees launched attacks at U.S. or allied forces in Afghanistan, killing about a half-dozen Americans. That information came from government officials including Paul Lewis, who oversaw Guantánamo issues at the Defense Department, and told lawmakers in March that former Guantánamo inmates were responsible for the deaths of Americans overseas. The other officials were quoted by the Post anonymously. One official told the Post that: ""Because many of these incidents were large-scale firefights in a war zone, we cannot always distinguish whether Americans were killed by the former detainees or by others in the same fight."" Nine of the released detainees suspected to have launched new terrorist attacks were dead or in foreign government custody and all of them were released during Bush’s administration, the Post reported. The other news reports we found about the 12 released detainees rehashed the Post story. Our ruling Gardner said, ""about 30 percent of terrorists at Guantanamo Bay went back into battle. We know that a dozen or so killed Americans."" Gardner omits that to get to the 30 percent figure requires adding those the Director of National Intelligence says were confirmed of re-engaging and those only suspected of re-engaging. Also, the federal government provides no details in its report about how it arrives at the figures or the identity of the detainees that went back into battle. Gardner is on more solid ground that ""a dozen or so killed Americans."" That stems from a 2015 Washington Post article based on interviews with government officials.

Rather, they were the work of the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The Constitution.com blog posted that ""the liberal media and Democrat pundits are mischaracterizing the past weekend’s march as grassroots. Listening to them, people would believe that the participants were sincere, spontaneous and concerned citizens.  While some were genuine, most were paid minions."" The post went on to say, ""George Soros funded over 50 organizations partnering and participating in the March for Women’s Rights. Part of that funding went straight into the protesters pockets. They weren’t there for rights. They were there for riches."" In this fact-check, we focus on whether Soros money went into the pockets of protesters. There is no evidence that's true. We used the Constitution.com website’s contact form to ask where they got their information and did not hear back. However, the blog cited an opinion piece by Asra Nomani that appeared on the Women in the World section of the New York Times website. Nomani’s article voiced her displeasure with the anti-Trump focus of the march. As a self-identified liberal feminist and Trump supporter, she said she did not feel welcome. Nomani went through the list of 403 groups listed as partners of the march and found that ""Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march’s ‘partners,’ including ‘key partners’ Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump’s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump’s environmental policies."" Nomani told us that she has now counted 65 organizations with some sort of tie, not necessarily financial, to Soros and his philanthropic organization, the Open Society Foundation. We looked at Nomani’s spreadsheet of march partners annotated with any ties to the Open Society Foundation. It is unclear exactly how many groups currently receive foundation support. Some got money for projects several years ago. For others, the connection is indirect, such as participating in programs that Soros’ Open Society Foundation also supports. No matter the number of organizations or the amount of money they may have received, Nomani never claimed that Soros’ Open Society was paying individual protestors. In an interview with PolitiFact, Nomani rejected the claims of other bloggers. ""I definitely do not conclude that most of the people marching were paid to do so,"" Nomani said. ""I believe that most of the people were motivated by sincere political and ideological beliefs. I do believe that most of the participants in the march had genuine concerns. It is not factual that they were paid to march."" But what about the role Soros money paid in making the marches happen at all? Nomani said, ""The march organizers have not yet revealed their funding sources, so it is unclear who directly funded the march."" For its part, the Open Society Foundation sent us a statement saying there is ""no truth"" to reports that either Soros or the foundation funded the protests. ""We have long supported a wide range of organizations, including those that support women and minorities who have historically been denied equal rights,"" the statement said. ""Many of them are concerned about what policy changes may lie ahead. We are proud of their work. We of course support the right of all Americans to peaceably assemble and petition their government -- a vital, and constitutionally safeguarded, pillar of a functioning democracy.""   Our ruling Bloggers said many participants in the women’s marches were motivated by money from Soros and his Open Society Foundation. The person whose work lies behind that rejects that claim and said she believes ""most of the people were motivated by sincere political and ideological beliefs."" She never claimed protesters were paid to attend. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2017/jan/25/blog-posting/pants-fire-george-soros-money-womens-march-protest/

Sean Spicer wrongly uses Pew study to bolster claim that non-citizens vote in large numbers
","Even after being sworn in as president, Donald Trump isn’t letting go of his unsubstantiated belief that millions of people voted illegally in November, costing him the popular vote. Now, he’s calling for a ""major investigation"" into voter fraud, he wrote in a Jan. 25 tweet. We have debunked Trump’s claims of massive voter fraud again and again and again (and again and again and again and again) over the past year. Trump has not yet produced any evidence that supports these claims — because none exists. In the Jan. 24 daily press briefing, a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer how Trump came to believe that it’s possible illegal votes were to blame for his popular vote loss. ""I think there's been studies,"" Spicer responded. ""There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens. There's other studies that have been presented to him. It's a belief he maintains."" Spicer is conflating a couple different studies that have been erroneously used to prop up claims that noncitizens have swayed elections by voting illegally. There is no study that shows 14 percent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by noncitizens. That would have added up to more than 18 million fraudulent votes — an implausible assertion, considering the total noncitizen population was about 22.5 million in 2010. Pew study misinterpreted The study that ""came out of Pew in 2008"" actually came out in 2012, and it’s about outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes. The 2012 Pew study — titled, ""Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient: Evidence That America’s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade"" —  makes no mention of noncitizens voting or registering to vote. Rather, it found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. Here’s what the former director of Pew’s election program said about the study in November: We found millions of out of date registration records due to people moving or dying, but found no evidence that voter fraud resulted.   Old Dominion study contested The study that shows ""14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens"" has been widely criticized for its methodology, and Spicer cites the findings incorrectly. The study Spicer likely meant to reference was conducted by professors at Old Dominion University and published in 2014. The researchers wrote in the Washington Post that about 14 percent of noncitizens in their sample said they were registered to vote, and they deduced that about 6 percent of noncitizens actually voted in the 2008 election. (That would mean somewhere in the ballpark of 1.3 million votes, using Census estimates of the noncitizen population.) So the study doesn’t show the statistic Spicer says it does. Beyond that, many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error. In a recent blog post, one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but ""our results suggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions."" There might be a problem of noncitizens voting, but it’s not nearly as large as the statistic Spicer cites. These studies do not prop up Trump’s belief that millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote. Hillary Clinton won almost 3 million more votes than Trump. So erasing Trump’s popular-vote deficit requires the assumption that all 3 million of these votes were cast illegally, and every one of them went to Clinton and not Trump. Further, no official sources or reputable academic sources have produced any evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 election, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud is rare.   Read our full debunking of Trump’s Nov. 28 claim that he ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" Our ruling Spicer said, ""There's one (study) that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens."" Spicer is both conflating and misquoting two studies: A 2012 Pew report about outdated voter rolls and a 2014 Old Dominion University study that found 6 percent of noncitizens surveyed voted in 2008. The Old Dominion University study has been widely criticized for its methodology. No study has found the statistic Spicer cites. If 14 percent of all voters in 2008 were noncitizens, that would have to mean that more than 80 percent of America’s noncitizen population voted.

Mark Pocan claim: Betsy DeVos backs groups that say LGBT students must get 'conversion therapy'
","An openly gay congressman has injected conversion therapy -- which aims to use counseling and often religious teaching to convert someone who is homosexual -- into the debate over President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of education. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Madison-area Democrat who has called for prohibiting the use of such therapy on minors, attacked Betsy DeVos in a letter on Jan. 11, 2017, six days before her Senate confirmation hearing. The letter, signed by Pocan and the other four co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, was sent to the leaders of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is scheduled to vote on DeVos’ nomination on Jan. 31, 2017. The letter said DeVos, an education activist and a major Republican donor from Michigan, has tried to undermine the rights of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. And it included a claim about conversion therapy and students, saying of DeVos:

She and her family have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo ""conversion"" therapy and have also affiliated with groups that oppose anti-bullying legislation. The next secretary of education must represent all students in our country. Anyone who promotes such fervently anti-LGBT viewpoints is wholly unqualified to serve as the secretary of education. So, Pocan is charging that DeVos and her family ""have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy."" More on DeVos, conversion therapy DeVos, whose wealth is estimated by Bloomberg at $130 million, is the daughter-in-law of billionaire Richard DeVos, the co-founder of Amway. She was part of a previous Pocan claim, that Trump's Cabinet appointments have a net worth of ""more than a third of America."" Our rating was Mostly True. One-third of American households have a combined net worth of roughly zero. So, the combined net worth of Trump Cabinet members is greater, though so is that of any American who has a net worth of more than zero. At DeVos’ confirmation hearing, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., accused DeVos of giving $25,000 to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which has lobbied for more rights for college students accused of sexual assault. PolitiFact Pennsylvania rated the claim Mostly True. DeVos was also asked about her family donating to groups that push conversion therapy. She disputed the characterization of her family’s donations and, though Pocan’s claim doesn’t refer to her personal position on conversion therapy, DeVos said she has ""never believed in that."" Conversion therapy -- also known as reparative therapy and sexual orientation change effort -- is supported by some Christian groups, such as Focus on the Family, which says it should be available for people who have ""unwanted homosexual attractions."" A number of medical groups warn of its dangers and at least two of them -- the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians -- outright oppose it. The association says the risks include depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior. (U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., announced Jan. 23, 2017 that she will oppose DeVos’ nomination. Baldwin, who is also openly gay, did not mention gay rights in her announcement.) Money part of Pocan’s claim To back Pocan’s claim, his office cited two groups: Focus on the Family and the Traditional Values Coalition. Let’s start with the ""donated extensively"" part of the claim. The office cited reports from two interest groups on Colorado-based Focus on the Family, which was founded by James Dobson, an evangelical Christian. One says says the DeVos family has given more than $6.7 million to Focus on the Family and the other says DeVos and her husband, Dick, have given $275,000 to the group. We found a comparable figure by checking federal tax records. They show that from 2003 to 2015, the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation of Holland, Mich., gave $5.7 million to Focus on the Family. DeVos was listed as the foundation’s vice president, though at her Senate confirmation hearing, she said that was a ""clerical error."" In contrast, Pocan’s office did not cite any reports on DeVos giving to the Traditional Values Coalition, a California-based conservative religious activist group. And we found nothing in tax records to indicate DeVos contributions to the coalition. (Two web articles say the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation has given money to the Traditional Values Coalition. But the article appears to mix up the coalition with the Michigan-based Foundation for Traditional Values, which the DeVos foundation has supported.) Conversion therapy part of the claim As for the second part of Pocan’s claim, we found indications that both groups cited by the congressman support conversion therapy. But no evidence that they believe that students who identify as LGBT must undergo it. And a spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups, said the center is not aware of either group making such a statement. Focus on the Family has issued statements in support of people changing their orientation, including this one from June 2013: God’s help usually doesn’t come as a fast fix. It’s often a long process. Many times it takes counseling, Bible study, prayer and community support  —  but it can be done. Here at Focus we’ve seen marriages reconciled. We’ve seen people who struggle with unwanted same-sex attraction change. We’ve seen people experience real transformation in their thoughts, behaviors, attractions and identity. The group also maintains a web page entitled ""Leaving Homosexuality."" One section notes there is opposition to conversion therapy, but states ""there is a great deal of evidence that also shows that people have been helped"" by such therapy. It says ""individuals should have the availability of professional therapy options for unwanted homosexual attractions and behavior."" A Focus on the Family spokesman told us that ""many individuals -- including students -- with same sex-attractions find those feelings to be in conflict with their faith and Focus on the Family strongly supports their right to seek help from licensed mental health professionals as they work to resolve this conflict and steward their sexuality according to their religious beliefs."" The evidence is less clear for the Traditional Values Coalition, which hosted a ""Christian Inaugural Gala"" as part of Trump’s inauguration. The Los Angeles Times reported on a conversion therapy conference that was led by evangelist Louis P. Sheldon, the coalition’s founder. But the conference was in 1990, the article didn’t mention students and we didn’t find any more recent statements from the coalition about conversion therapy. To be sure, the coalition is not viewed as friendly to gay people. Its website says military chaplains are being prevented ""from speaking out in any way against homosexuality."" And in 2015, the coalition filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed, seeking to block the Fairfax County School Board in Virginia from implementing protections the board put in place for gay and transgender students. Our rating Pocan says DeVos and her family ""have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo 'conversion' therapy."" A family foundation that listed DeVos as the vice president has given millions of dollars over more than a decade to one of two groups cited by Pocan, Focus on the Family. But we couldn’t find evidence of donations to the Traditional Values Coalition. And although there are indications that both groups support conversion therapy, we didn’t find evidence that they promote the idea that students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender must undergo it.

Sean Spicer's claim of a 'dramatic expansion in the federal workforce' is exaggerated
","One of President Donald Trump’s very first acts was to place a hiring freeze on the executive branch, in a promised show of fiscal responsibility. ""This memorandum counters (the) dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years,"" press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in his first-ever daily press briefing Jan. 23. The memorandum, which Trump signed earlier that day, says federal agencies will not fill any vacant positions or create new ones for up to 90 days, or until a plan for reducing the number of federal government employees goes into effect. Military personnel are exempt from the plan, as are any positions deemed necessary for national security and public safety. Several news outlets quickly jumped on Spicer’s assertion that the federal workforce has expanded dramatically in recent years, saying it was incorrect. We looked at the data ourselves and found that Spicer is cherry-picking. The White House press release about the hiring freeze memorandum offered more detail, saying the federal workforce expanded ""from approximately 1.8 million federal civilian employees during the (Bill) Clinton administration to approximately 2.1 million as of 2016 (an approximately 17 percent increase)."" The news release figures appear to come from the Office of Personnel Management, whose data shows an increase from 1.78 million civilian employees in the executive branch (excluding the postal service) at the end of 2000 to 2.08 million at the end of 2014. That’s an increase of about 17 percent. At an increase of roughly 1 percent a year, it sounds like Spicer is exaggerating when he calls it ""dramatic."" However, in choosing to compare the end of the Bill Clinton administration to the end of Barack Obama’s, the new White House is pitting the year with the lowest federal employment since 1950 against a relatively normal year — exaggerating the significance of the growth. Counting the employees Federal government employment has hovered around 2 million for decades, as shown in the graph below. In fact, the federal government had more employees for about half of the past 70 years than it did in 2014. During the Korean War in the 1950s, the government capped employment in the federal workforce at 2 million employees. Even though the cap was eventually lifted, it has remained politically popular to keep the government around the same size, said Paul Light, a professor of public service at New York University. The size of the federal government workforce stayed about the same as the country’s population grew. The size of state and local governments ballooned, however, and so have the number of contractors working for the federal government. The last concerted effort to shrink the federal government workforce happened under former President Bill Clinton. The end of the Cold War enabled his administration to reduce the workforce from 2.2 million in 1992 to 1.78 million in 2000, with most of the drawdown happening among Defense Department civilian employees.   ""The Clinton administration was an aberration,""  Light said. When the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began under former President George W. Bush, the number of civilian defense employees increased again, pushing up the total number of executive branch employees. Obama also added positions in other counterterroism positions and in Veterans Affairs, Light said. The number of executive branch employees actually started to come back down, however slightly, in Obama’s second term — from a high of 2.14 million in 2011 to 2.08 million at the end of 2014 — as the country pulled out of Iraq. In short, a lot of the reduction in the federal government workforce in the 1990s and subsequent growth in the 2000s had to do with civilian Defense Department employees — many of whom will be likely be exempt from Trump’s hiring freeze memorandum because it excludes positions crucial to national security. A federal employee count from another official source, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is slightly higher than the OPM figures. That’s because unlike OPM, BLS includes postal service employees in its count of the federal civilian workforce. Those figures show that the number of federal employees grew slightly under Obama, from 2.78 million employees to 2.8 million between January 2009 and December 2016. That is less than 1 percent growth. Going back to the end of the Clinton administration in December 2000, the growth is only slightly more — from 2.75 million to 2.8 million, or just under 2 percent growth. So when postal service workers are included, the federal government has barely grown in recent years. Light said Trump’s hiring freeze would not really have a significant impact on the size of the federal government. The exemptions to the freeze are so broad that Light predicts it will only affect less than half of the federal workforce. ""This is more bluster than impact,"" he said. Our ruling Spicer said there has been a ""dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years."" A White House news release shows Spicer was referring to the years since the end of the Clinton administration in 2000. The federal civilian workforce has increased at least 17 percent since then, according to OPM data. But choosing this particular time frame is disingenuous, pitting an abnormally low point against a relatively normal point. The average size of the federal workforce between 1944 and 2014 was 2.05 million, not a dramatic departure from 2.08 million in 2014.  Further, a broader set of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows just 2 percent growth over the same time period.   Spicer’s statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2017/jan/25/sean-spicer/sean-spicers-claim-federal-workforce-has-expanded-/

Donald Trump's stat on homicide increase in major cities is solid
","Now that Donald Trump moved into the White House, his staff has made over the White House website to its liking, including a new web page called ""Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community."" The page decries the country’s ""dangerous anti-police atmosphere"" and includes some new statistical claims about crime in the United States, including one about Washington, D.C., homicides that we rated Mostly False. Another claim on the web page addressing violence in major cities caught our eye. It read, ""The Trump Administration is committed to reducing violent crime. In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years."" Trump offered this same claim in July 2016, during his speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. As we noted in our original fact-check, Trump stuck close to the wording of a passage in a January 2016 article by the Wonkblog team at the Washington Post. ""The number of homicides in the country's 50 largest cities rose nearly 17 percent last year, the greatest increase in lethal violence in a quarter century,"" the article began. Since the 2015 data used in the Wonkblog article was a projection based on preliminary figures, we decided to take a new crack at fact-checking the statement, this time using full-year FBI crime data for 2015 that had been released after the Wonkblog article appeared and after Trump made his speech at the convention. (Full-year data for 2016 is not yet available.) ""In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities"" First, we used Census Bureau data to determine the 50 largest cities. Then, we obtained the number of murders and non-negligent homicides for each of those cities in 2014 and 2015. We found that five of those cities -- Fort Worth, Texas; Raleigh, N.C.; Tucson, Ariz.; Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan. -- did not submit data for one of those years, so we excluded those cities from our calculations. That left 45 cities with data we could work with. When we added up the homicides in each of those 45 cities, we found that the total number increased by 16 percent between 2014 and 2015. That’s quite close to what Trump said. ""That’s the largest increase in 25 years"" To check whether the increase was the largest in a quarter-century, we recreated the Wonkblog methodology. They looked at the year-to-year rise or decline, in percentage points, of the homicide rate in the 50 largest U.S. cities. So we took the total number of homicides we’d assembled for those 45 cities and converted the raw numbers into the standard rate -- murders and non-negligent homicides per 100,000 population. In 2014, the homicide rate was 9.3 per 100,000 population. In 2015, the rate rose to 10.8 -- an increase of 1.5 percentage points. That was barely different from the 1.6 percentage-point increase that Wonkblog had found based on the preliminary data, and the chart makes clear that that was the biggest increase since 1990. So the White House website was correct that the jump in homicides between 2014 and 2015 was the largest increase in 25 years. This finding fits with our own research. The following graph we assembled from FBI data shows that in cities with a population of at least 250,000 -- shown in red -- the increase from 2014 to 2015 was the largest going back at least to 1995. (The top 50 cities all had populations of at least 388,000, so this is a somewhat broader group of cities.) Meanwhile, the overall national rate, in blue, also showed an uptick between 2014 and 2015. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, told PolitiFact that our methodology was sound. But he cautioned that the one-year uptick may not prove to be a lasting change in the trend line -- and that focusing on just one year’s numbers obscures the significant and consistent decline in homicides over the past-quarter century, as shown in the following chart: ""Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago,"" Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist, told PolitiFact last October. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. ""A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20-year trend is downward,"" he said. ""If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase."" Our ruling The Trump White House website said, ""In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years."" By our calculations, the increase between 2014 and 2015 is very close to that -- 16 percent -- and this does appear to be the biggest one-year spike in 25 years. But we’ll reiterate a caveat we noted in past fact-checks: first, that even after the spike, homicide rates remain far lower now than they were 25 years ago, and second, that this one-year increase may, or may not, prove to be a significant turning point in the homicide trend line.

TRUE: 27 percent of Californians 'were born in a foreign land'
"," In his State of the State Address, Gov. Jerry Brown vowed to defend the protections California affords all immigrants in the state, documented or not, against the Trump administration. ""We will defend everybody – every man, woman and child – who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state,"" Brown said in his speech delivered at the state Capitol in Sacramento on January 24, 2017. Brown added that immigrants are an integral part of California, helping ""create the wealth and dynamism of this state from the very beginning."" He went on to say ""27 percent"" of Californians or ""almost 11 million were born in a foreign land."" We decided to fact-check Brown on those numbers. Our research A spokesman for Brown pointed to figures from the U.S. Census Bureau to back up the statement. The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2015 American Community Survey does, in fact, list California’s ""foreign born"" population at 27 percent. The bureau defines foreign-born as anyone who is not a U.S. citizen at birth, including those who become U.S. citizens through naturalization. California’s overall population was approximately 39.2 million as of July 1, 2016, according to census figures. Twenty-seven percent of that total would be about 10.6 million people. Brown is on track when he described the figure as ""almost 11 million."" Hans Johnson, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, told us the 2015 American Community Survey is the best source on the state's foreign born population. In a 2013 study using older data, the policy institute itself reported that 27 percent of California’s population was foreign born, about twice the U.S. percentage. California’s percentage appears to have remained steady in more recent years, according to the 2015 census study. California's foreign-born Forty seven percent of California’s immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, while about 26 percent had some other legal status, according the policy institute’s report. The study estimates 27 percent were undocumented. So, where do California’s foreign born come from? More than half, or 53 percent, were born in Latin America, while 37 percent was born in Asia, according to the PPIC study. Mexico at 4.3 million, the Philippines at 812,000 and China at 760,000 are the leading countries of origin. The nation’s foreign-born population reached 42.2 million, or 13.2 percent, in 2014, according to the Pew Research Center. That total has more than quadrupled since 1965, though its pace of growth has begun to slow in recent years. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown claimed in his State of the State Address that 27 percent of Californians, almost 11 million, ""were born in a foreign land."" A 2015 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau verifies that statistic. Additionally, a researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California, which studies the state’s immigration and demographic patterns, confirmed the census report is the best authority on California’s foreign born population.

David Beckham's proposed soccer stadium at port threatens jobs and economic impact, Miami Seaport Alliance says
","In late 2013, soccer superstar David Beckham splashed onto the scene of Miami-Dade stadium politics when he announced his pitch for a $250 million stadium. While politicians were intrigued by the idea of Beckham bringing major soccer to Miami, one of the main sites under consideration quickly drew fire: PortMiami. Some county commissioners balked at the idea of transforming part of a major economic hub for the county into a soccer stadium. Opponents, led by Royal Caribbean Cruises, created the Miami Seaport Alliance and took out ads on television, radio and in newspapers arguing that a stadium threatens the port’s livelihood. A full-page ad in the Miami Herald in April stated, ""A soccer stadium is being proposed at PortMiami. The Miami Seaport Alliance opposes any development that threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries. All jobs are important for the future of Miami, but we cannot risk full-time, well-paying PortMiami jobs like crane operators, truckers and cargo loaders, for a few, part-time concession jobs like peanut sellers and ticket takers."" Beckham’s investors responded with their own full-page ad in the Herald, vowing that a soccer stadium would achieve the port’s goals of creating jobs and revenue. At PolitiFact Florida, we are quite familiar with half truths about stadiums. It is a challenge to fact-check a prediction, but we decided to explore the evidence about whether a soccer stadium at the port would threaten the existing 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact. Is the Alliance bending the truth about Beckham? Royal Caribbean leads opposition Beckham wants to rent a county-owned 12-acre site near the port to build a 25,000 seat stadium with an open roof. Beckham has said he will privately finance the construction and apply for a state sales tax subsidy, hoping to open the stadium in 2018. Port officials had planned to build a new 7 million square foot commercial district on the site, because it’s too shallow to accommodate ships. Beckham’s group says the stadium would still leave room for about a 1 million square foot commercial development. The port site isn’t the only one under consideration, though it appears to be one of Beckham’s favorites. At Mayor Carlos Gimenez’ request, Beckham is also considering filling in a boat slip in downtown, though that site also has challenges. Many of jobs ‘tied’ to the port aren’t at the port The spin in the ad begins with the number of jobs cited. The number cited -- 207,000 jobs -- comes from a study done for the port to measure its current economic impact. Martin Associates, a Pennsylvania-based firm, interviewed 485 cruise-related businesses in the Miami-Dade County area in 2012 and released the report last year. The report adds up various types of jobs, including direct port workers and suppliers. The study also accounts for ""induced jobs,"" which includes jobs generated by spending by port workers. The largest category of jobs, though, is what the study calls ""user jobs,"" which are importers or exporters in Florida that ship or receive cargo through the port. For example, if an Orange grove in Orlando ships a portion of their oranges through Miami, then the study translates that portion of the grove’s business -- including orange pickers in Orlando -- into a number of user jobs connected to PortMiami. The study concluded that port activity ""supported"" 207,804 jobs in the state of Florida. The vast majority -- 80 percent -- were ""user jobs."" The user jobs wouldn’t disappear from Florida if PortMiami wasn’t available. ""These importers/exporters would divert their cargo through other ports,"" the study states. Similarly, most of the $27 billion in economic activity includes a lot of business that takes place far away from the port site in Miami. So hypothetically speaking, if the soccer stadium were to create such a morass that cargo and cruise companies jumped ship and fled Miami, those jobs and economic impact dollars wouldn’t vanish into thin air -- much of it would just move to other ports in Florida. Will stadium threaten existing port jobs? We sent the port report to a few economists, and several raised concerns about the jobs number in the context of the ad opposing the soccer stadium. Temple University economics professor Michael Leeds said that the ""user jobs"" category is a red herring. ""It essentially counts a lot of people and money that will never come anywhere near Miami,"" he said. Those user jobs and the user income number leads to an exaggeration of the total numbers, said Holy Cross economics professor Victor Matheson. ""That being said, in this case it doesn't matter whether the report is correct or not,"" said Matheson, a critic of public financing of stadiums. ""Whether the port generates 20,000 jobs or 200,000 jobs, the question is whether Beckham will interfere with those jobs, and I just don't see a significant disruption."" Cruise officials said the stadium could hurt the port, though. John Fox, president of the Miami Seaport Alliance, who lobbies on behalf of Royal Caribbean, pointed to a Moody’s report which downgraded the port’s credit rating in May. But the report didn’t mention the soccer stadium as a factor. Fox said that the stadium could scare away carriers who now operate out of Miami, sending them to other ports. Any other port could ""sell their port over the Port of Miami due to real perceptions that delays will be a common issue and that this community is not serious about being in the commercial port business of being a port,"" Fox said. Bruce Rubin, a spokesman for Beckham, says the port’s plan for 7 million square feet of commercial development ""would create far more traffic conflicts with cargo and cruise operations than would our plan for a professional soccer stadium"" and the smaller adjacent commercial development. Rubin said the stadium will host about 25 large events per year and ""a number of other activities."" The 17 home games largely would occur on Saturday evenings which doesn’t coincide with the typical times for the arrival and departure of cruise passengers or cargo operators. Stadium supporters haven’t yet finished their study about projected jobs, but Rubin estimated that it would include 2,000 to 3,000 construction jobs. Economic experts weigh in on impact of stadium at port We sent a summary of the soccer battle to professors who study the economics of stadiums. Rick Eckstein, a sociology Professor at Villanova University who has studied stadium financing and criticized deals, told PolitiFact Florida, ""Both groups are wildly exaggerating the economic impact of their respective plans."" ""Sports stadiums have a lousy record of spurring economic impact. Soccer stadiums, with but 19 games a year drawing about 20,000 visitors each, might be the least able to spur development. Conversely, I don’t think a soccer stadium would hurt development in that area. It would simply have no effect,"" he said. Matheson, a major critic of subsidies for sports stadiums,  said that the stadium will cause some traffic disruptions during matches, but they would likely be minor. ""It is hard to see how 20 days of extra traffic, most which will be on weekends, will have any significant impact on the port, especially if some decent traffic management is utilized,"" he said. ""I don't find the port's objections particularly convincing. Do be concerned about traffic. Do be concerned about hidden costs of a privately financed stadium. But don't reflexively torpedo any type (of economic development) just because one industry doesn't like it."" Bruce Seaman, a Georgia State University economist, said that the arguments by cargo and cruise industries ""are nearly absurd.  Even given the self-serving perspective they clearly represent, it is hard to imagine even pure rent-seekers bothering to make such weak arguments opposing that project."" One professor we interviewed -- University of South Florida economics professor Philip Porter, a major critic of financing of sports stadiums -- said the anti-stadium side has a point. ""If the soccer stadium project means the 7 million square foot commercial development would be compromised, Miami loses,"" Porter said. ""One thing we’ve come to realize is that sports -- with such infrequent activity -- cannot compete with commercial activity in creating jobs and generating income."" Our ruling The ad said that David Beckham’s proposed soccer stadium at Miami’s port ""threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries."" The numbers come from a study which states that the jobs related to the port are all over Florida. The ad is somewhat careful in the wording about the jobs because it states the jobs are ""tied"" to cargo and cruise industries, but then it talks about jobs at PortMiami such as crane operators who could be replaced by stadium peanut sellers -- which could create the impression that these are all direct jobs at the port, and that’s not the case. A soccer stadium at the port would certainly lead to some changes at the port -- and cruise operators are concerned about how that could change their operations. But at this point, there isn’t evidence that a stadium would threaten the port jobs or economic activity. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2014/may/14/miami-seaport-alliance/david-beckhams-proposed-soccer-stadium-port-threat/

For 70 years, most Americans have supported single-payer government-run health insurance?
","Americans are more politically polarized than they were a generation ago. Yet consumer activist and four-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader argues in his new book that there is ""an emerging left-right alliance"" in the country that could ""dismantle the corporate state."" Interviewed about the book on May 7, 2014, Nader told Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardin that majorities of liberals and conservatives agree on a number of issues, such as raising the minimum wage. Then he made an attention-getting claim about the enduring popularity of ""single-payer"" -- a health insurance system in which everyone is covered by the government and the government pays all the bills. Nader’s quote is a bit jumbled, but his claim is clear. ""The reason why single-payer is not discussed -- even though a majority of the American people since Harry Truman days supported full Medicare for all, everybody in nobody out, free choice of doctor and hospital; very efficient, much more than the present wasteful system -- even though that is the status in terms of public opinion, it's not on the table,"" he said. Wait. How often have most Americans agreed on any one thing for nearly 70 years? And more specifically, has a majority of Americans supported single-payer -- or ""Medicare for all,"" as Nader also referred to it -- dating back to the presidency of Harry Truman (1945-’53)? Single-payer and politicians Under single-payer, private insurers would be eliminated, although private medical providers would remain. Everyone would get health coverage from the government and government would pay all the bills. In that sense, it’s like Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older and certain younger people. Single-payer received mention in the debate during the run-up to Obamacare, which became law in 2010. But even some of its most prominent supporters have wavered on it. In 2009, Obama earned a Half Flip on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter. Compared to his earlier years in politics, Obama had moderated his statements in support of single-payer as he tried to appeal to a wider audience, our PolitiFact National colleagues found. Similarly, after Republican former Gov. Tommy Thompson made single-payer an issue in the 2012 race for a U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin, we gave a Half-Flip to Democrat Tammy Baldwin. Just before she defeated Thompson, Baldwin deflected questions about single-payer and said she was setting aside at least temporarily her efforts toward getting single-payer in place. Nader’s evidence For his part, Nader -- who won 2.74 percent of the vote in the razor-thin 2000 presidential race -- cited through a spokesman portions of three articles to back his claim about the public’s support for the concept. But none of the articles constitute evidence that most Americans have backed single-payer over the past seven decades. A 1982 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, citing polls, argued that most Americans believed there was a ""need for national health insurance and that it would require larger government intervention."" A 2003 article in the American Journal of Public Health said public opinion generally ran in favor of health care reform. And a 2009 article by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely recognized authority on health care, said polls as far back as the 1930s show Americans have generally supported ""the goals of guaranteed access to health care and health insurance for all, as well as a government role in health financing."" We wanted to know more about what polls have shown. The polls A Rasmussen Reports poll in April 2014 found that only 37 percent of Americans favored single-payer. And although the proposal has largely been out of the public debate since before Obamacare became law, earlier polling also didn’t find clear support. In 2009, with the Obamacare bill being pushed in Congress, filmmaker Michael Moore said a majority of Americans favored a single-payer system. PolitiFact National rated his statement False. Polls had consistently shown that a majority of Americans wanted some form of universal health care coverage — they want uninsured people to have insurance -- but there was wide disagreement about how to do that. For example, some people supported keeping the current the system, but with tax credits to help uninsured people buy private insurance, while others backed requiring employers to provide employee health insurance, or to pay into a government fund that would pay to cover those without insurance. In other words, not majority support for a government-run health insurance system. To get a longer view of the polling, we contacted two polling experts: Liz Hamel, the Kaiser foundation’s public opinion and survey research director; and Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Kaiser’s latest poll on single-payer, in September 2009, found that less than a majority of Americans -- 40 percent -- favored single-payer. Conversely, seven other ways to expand health insurance coverage -- such as expanding Medicare or instituting an individual mandate requiring all Americans to have coverage --  all received higher levels of support. Three years earlier, a 2006 Kaiser poll indicated possible majority support for single-payer -- but it was constructed as a limited either-or question: ""Which would you prefer -- the current health insurance system in the United States, in which most people get their health insurance from private employers, but some people have no insurance; or, a universal health insurance program, in which everyone is covered under a program like Medicare that's run by the government and financed by taxpayers?"" Fifty-six percent said they preferred a universal system. Going back further, however, there was no such majority support. In 2001, two directors of the Harvard Opinion Research Program reviewed more than 100 public opinion polls over a 50-year period. One key conclusion was that  ""most Americans remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right and do not favor a single-payer type of national health plan."" Given that it covered much of the period Nader referred to, that article is strong evidence refuting his claim. But we were curious about polling going back to the start of Truman's presidency. The results were mixed. Two examples from that period: On an either-or Gallup poll question in 1945, 53 percent said they favored ""a plan set up by the government which would require every person to take part,"" while 34 percent preferred a voluntary plan ""set up by the medical profession"" and 13 percent had no opinion. But when asked this question in 1949 -- ""Should the U.S. Congress pass the government's compulsory health insurance program, which would require wage or salary deductions from all employed persons to provide medical and hospital care for them and their families?"" -- the results were: Yes, 44 percent; No, 47 percent; No opinion, 9 percent. Our rating Nader said a majority of Americans ""since Harry Truman days"" support single-payer health insurance, or ""full Medicare for all."" While there are individual poll results dating back to 1945 that indicate majority support for single-payer, overall the results are mixed, at best. In fact, one review of more than 100 polls over 50 years found that most people opposed single-payer. We rate the claim False.

"['Georgia', 'Guns', 'John Stone']","
Stone claims unique position as gun dealer
","It’s an attention-grabbing campaign ad. John Stone fires a cannon that he says resembles the one his forefathers used in the Revolutionary War. ""As the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress, I’m willing to do the same if we have to,"" Stone declares on the video. ""But it's a whole lot easier just to vote in new House Republican leaders who will stand up to Obama and defend our Constitution."" Stone, a Republican and former congressional aide, is making his second bid to unseat five-term 12th District U.S. Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat from Augusta. He last tried in 2008. The Second Amendment is a galvanizing issue, and politicians know it. Barrow pulled out his father’s gun, his grandfather’s gun and his National Rifle Association endorsement for an ad when he was fending off other challengers two years ago. And it’s unlikely that many would say it was coincidence that this year, with the entire General Assembly up for re-election, state lawmakers passed a gun bill that the NRA called the ""most comprehensive"" in recent Georgia history and that critics decried as one of the nation’s most extreme. But can Stone really say he’s the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress? We decided a fact check was in order. We saw the potential to check Stone’s claim. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives keeps a database of all federal firearms licenses, so a check of those names against the names of all U.S. House and Senate candidates could do the trick. The only problem: There are about 140,000 current federal firearms licenses, and many are issued in the names of businesses and corporations, not individuals. Stone was forthcoming with us about his license (he even emailed us a copy) and about how he came to make his only-one-in-the-country claim. Friends in the firearms industry pointed out to him in 2012 that he might be the only U.S. House candidate with an ATF license, Stone said. He said he went to multiple sources for verification, including the NRA, Gun Owners of America, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the ATF. ""To everyone’s knowledge, I am the only one,"" Stone said. ""I have Google and Bing searched this extensively, and to the best of my knowledge and ability to check, I am the only one."" He volunteered that he would change his ad if another candidate were found to be able to make the same claim. But our research turned up another question: Can he really call himself a dealer? Stone has a federal firearms license. It is what’s known as a Curio and Relic license. He collects, restores and trades historic firearms, at least 50 years old, and as a hobby, not a business. When we asked the ATF to assist in our search for his license, we were told that, based on a code on the license, ""he’s a collector, not a dealer,"" a distinction we wondered about since his ad says dealer. The ATF does issue what it labels as ""dealer"" licenses. They are largely reserved for gunsmiths, pawnbrokers and others who make a living buying and selling many types of guns. Jerry Henry, with the gun advocacy group GeorgiaCarry.org, said he thinks Stone’s YouTube claim is ""misleading at best."" ""He’s a collector,"" Henry said. ""That’s not what I consider a firearms dealer."" Others we talked to agreed. Tim Coker with the National Firearms Dealer Network said gun enthusiasts hearing the claim would assume that Stone is a licensed dealer, selling modern firearms. NRA officials were not aware of Stone’s claim, spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. The group has been a Barrow supporter. ""He (Barrow) has stood steadfast with gun owners, hunters and sportsmen thought his career,"" Arulanandam said. Stone remains insistent. He sent us two dictionary definitions of dealer. He also said he deals in black-powder firearms and pre-1899 firearms, which require no ATF license, restrictions or registration on buying and selling. ""I am a firearms dealer. I buy and sell firearms,"" he said. ""This fact is indisputable."" When we first started the fact check, we asked Stone why he decided to tout the fact that he was a federal firearms dealer. He said the discussion of where a candidate stands on Second Amendment rights can be time-consuming. With the dealer moniker as his calling card, he said his position is immediately clear. In summary, Stone, a former congressional aide, has proclaimed himself the ""only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress."" He said he wasn’t able to document that statement, but after talking with people in the firearms community, he believes it’s true. We couldn’t find any sources to definitively prove or disprove Stone’s claim of exclusivity. He does have a federal firearms license for a very niche group of collectors. He contends this status allows him to make the claim that he is a gun dealer. Others suggest his statement is misleading. Overall, a viewer of Stone’s ad needs much more information to weigh the value of his claim -- an awful lot of context is missing even though there is some truth to part of his statement. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2014/may/14/john-stone/stone-claims-unique-position-gun-dealer/
"['Congress', 'Federal Budget', 'Foreign Policy', 'PunditFact', 'Ronan Farrow']","
Ronan Farrow says inadequate security funding from Congress leads to tragedies like Benghazi
","Partisan narratives that emerged after the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks usually take a few forms. Republicans decry the initial characterization of events from U.N. ambassador Susan Rice as deliberately misleading. Democrats argue the attack against the vulnerable Benghazi complex should not be a surprise after GOP-driven cuts in embassy security funding. Ronan Farrow, who worked as director of global youth issues under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and is the son of actress and activist Mia Farrow, highlighted embassy security issues in a 2013 story for The Atlantic, mentioning Clinton’s warnings in 2011 that a lack of funding would hurt national security. Farrow reiterated these concerns in a May 5, 2014, segment on his MSNBC show, Ronan Farrow Daily, amid news of another House-driven Benghazi investigation spurred by a recently revealed White House adviser’s email with talking points for Rice. On his show, Farrow asked Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., if House Republicans ""erred"" in 2011 when they ""cut $128 million from the administration’s request for embassy security funding, that really laid the foundation."" Later, Farrow said both parties are at fault because ""in 2010, Democrats cut $142 million from those security requests."" ""So this is really a back and forth, and it actually seems like, in my view, if you look at the history, both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of this, passing the buck,"" he said. ""It’s easy to gain political plaudits by saying ‘spend less around the world,’ and then it leads up to these tragedies."" The connection Farrow's drawing is clear enough: Congressional budget cuts, made by Democrats and Republicans, contributed to the security failures at the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi. But as we'll show you, security funding has been increased in recent years and State Department officials say budget requests did not factor into the violent attack on Sept. 11, 2012. (Some of this ground was covered by the Washington Post Fact-Checker.) The ""cuts"" aren't cuts The first thing to know is the cuts over recent years aren’t really cuts (i.e. taking money away from embassy security funding). Instead, Congress declined to provide the full amount requested by President Barack Obama.  Really, this practice goes farther back. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service says the department’s base requests have not been fully funded since 2008 (in 2009, the department’s base request was not met but it got more money in supplemental funds). So what’s the deal? We struggled to verify some of Farrow’s numbers, as there are many money pots that support embassy facility security and officer positions. Straight-up budget numbers are a little hard to figure out because of Congress’ affinity for budget strategies like ""continuing resolutions"" and sequestration. We got the following figures from the Congressional Research Service (page 23 of this 2013 PDF) and chose to look at total security spending, which includes supplemental and overseas contingency funds primarily for missions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. State Department Funds for Embassy and Diplomatic Security (total security spending, plus supplemental and overseas contingency operations funds) Request (in millions) Enacted Difference FY 2008 $2,138.7 $2,127.7 -$11.6 FY 2009 $3,404 $3,519.5 $115.5 FY 2010 $3,562.6 $3,420.8 -$141.8 FY 2011 $2,761.3 $2,576.6 -$184.7 FY 2012 $4,395.5 $4,076.2 -$319.3   Whichever numbers you use, they tell a similar story: Congress did not fully fund the administration’s diplomatic security requests for several years. That's not unusual, said John Norris, director of the Sustainable Security and Peacebuilding Initiative at the liberal Center for American Progress. The difference between what the president wanted and what Congress appropriated is not akin to a budget cut as much as it is part of the push-and-pull of the budget process. ""It’s rare for Congress to fully appropriate what’s requested, or what is most often the case is some areas will be fully funded, some will be dramatically underfunded,"" Norris said. ""Some will send back more money than what they requested reflecting whatever priorities are in Congress."" What's even more important for this fact-check is embassy security spending grew tremendously post 9/11. From 1998 to 2012, the embassy security budget rose by more than 1,000 percent from $200 million to $2.6 billion, Norris said, and the infusion of money means that there are four security personnel for every diplomat. Base security funds, which represent a chunk of the total spending represented in the chart above, increased by 32 percent from fiscal year 2008 to 2012, according to CRS. ""If you look at the numbers in what we’re spending, it’s really hard to make the case that (budget constraints) is kind of the root cause of it,"" Norris said. Money ties to the Benghazi facility As for Benghazi, funding decisions by Congress don't appear to be a major factor in the 2012 attack. Investigations have faulted State Department management decisions for security breakdowns more than insufficient funding. The State Department made some upgrades to the facility, such as increasing the height of perimeter walls, but the outpost in Benghazi was designated as a temporary facility. It did not have to meet State Department security standards of other full-time offices, and it was ineligible for some security upgrade money. The facility did receive financial and other support for security repairs from diplomatic outposts in the Libyan capital of Tripoli and Egypt, But officials on the ground in Benghazi struggled to get additional security upgrades because they didn’t have cash reserves and had to rely on the embassy in Tripoli to pass along requests. There have been many inquiries into the situation in Benghazi, some of which we will touch on in this fact-check. One by the Senate Homeland Security Committee points out neither the State Department nor Congress sought extra money for Libya or Benghazi in a supplemental request, even as officials in Libya asked for a more sizable officer presence. Farrow quoted a portion of the 2012 report by the Accountability Review Board, a group led by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering to examine the security picture at the special mission. The security was ""inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,"" the report states. But was that Congress' fault? The report said Congress ""must do its part"" to address security risks and meet mission imperatives and suggested the State Department get more flexibility for building money so temporary facilities in dangerous situations can get more advanced security upgrades. But it primarily faulted ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies,"" and not unfulfilled budget requests. Another finding: The embassy in Tripoli was not an effective advocate in pressing Washington to provide more security for the Benghazi compound, which included a CIA annex. Senate committee investigations also cite unanswered cables for more temporary officers from Libyan Ambassador Christopher Stevens to the State Department.   State Department officials, meanwhile have said publicly that budgets were not a factor. During a House hearing into the attack on Oct. 10, 2012, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher asked deputy assistant secretary of state Charlene Lamb: ""Was there any budget consideration and lack of budget which led you not to increase the number of people in the security force there?"" ""No, sir,"" Lamb said. Later, Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, asked, ""So there’s not a budget problem. It’s not you all don’t have the money to do this?"" ""Sir, it’s a volatile situation. We will move assets to cover that,"" Lamb said. More of the same on May 8, 2013. Responding to a Democratic member who pointed to embassy security spending in recent GOP House budgets, committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., prodded Eric Nordstrom, former regional security officer in Libya, about Lamb’s previous testimony. Issa said, ""Mr. Nordstrom, you were on that panel. Do you remember what she (Lamb) said?"" ""Yes, she said that resources was not an issue,"" Nordstrom said. ""And I think I would also point to the (Accountability Review Board) report, if I'm not mistaken, that they talked to our chief financial officer with (Diplomatic Security), who also said that resources were not an issue."" Farrow's executive producer Kathy O’Hearn defended his characterization of the situation.  ""In every segment, we have been diligent in making mention ... that this is not simply a question of resources, but one of how existing resources can be used,"" O'Hearn said. ""We feel strongly that our reporting has been judicious and thorough."" Yet Farrow's interview with Schiff certainly lingers on the question of whether there were enough resources and the role of Congress. He first says that some Republicans are ""strident"" that resources were not an issue, then pivoted to Clinton’s 2011 warnings that not agreeing to the White House's proposed budget would hurt national security. After that, Farrow brought up specific budget decisions by members of Congress. Only after that did he note that some standard building funds available to the State Department were not able to be used in Benghazi.  Our ruling Farrow pointed to ""cuts"" by Democrats and Republicans in Congress in recent years from what the Obama administration requested in embassy security funding and tied it to Benghazi, saying, ""It’s easy to gain political plaudits by saying ‘spend less around the world,’ and then it leads up to these tragedies."" It's true that Congress did not fully fund embassy security requests from the Obama administration in recent years, which is what Farrow argues amounts to a ""cut."" But funding for embassy security is up from 2008, and up dramatically since before 9/11. How does this tie into the Benghazi attack? State Department officials and government experts lay more blame on decisions by upper management not to provide the temporary Benghazi facility with more officers and better protections than the availability of money. Farrow made that very point in his segment, which makes it odd that he led his segment by tying the attack with insufficient congressional funding. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/may/13/ronan-farrow/ronan-farrow-says-inadequate-security-funding-cong/

Marco Rubio says humans are not causing climate change
","Scientists have been issuing more new reports on the irreversible effects of climate change in recent weeks. Two groups reported on May 12, 2014, that the global sea level will rise at least 10 feet, accelerating to a dangerous pace after the next century. Just a day before those reports were released, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sat down with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. Talk turned to climate change, where the possible Republican presidential candidate denied a link between humans and the changing environment. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" he said. ""And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy."" We’ve noted before that Rubio has disputed the basic science of climate change. So when Rubio said human activity isn’t causing changes to the environment, he’s got it all wrong. In this case, Rubio framed his thoughts about climate change as his personal opinion. But the causes of global warming are backed up by thorough research, so we didn’t see room for debate in Rubio’s claim. Rubio’s said before, ""I’m not a scientist, man."" So PolitiFact reached out to scientists who could explain the facts behind climate change. We've rated similar claims False from Tim Pawlenty and Rick Perry, but we'll rate it again because it's a persistent claim we see year after year. Rubio’s staff didn’t return our request for comment. How our climate is changing Historically, the earth goes through periods of hotter and cooler temperatures. So how do we know global warming isn’t a natural part of this cycle? By taking measurements, said Leonard Berry, director of Florida Atlantic University’s Center for Environmental Studies. ""We can measure the fact that the earth is warming. We can measure the fact that the ocean is warming,"" Berry said. ""While geological history shows warming and cooling periods, as far back as we go, none shows the kind of warming and the kind of changes we’re experiencing right now."" Scientists trace back this shift to the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1760. Since that period, carbon dioxide rose 40 percent and methane by 150 percent. High levels of these and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat at the surface of the earth, warming the planet. By burning fossil fuels, chopping down trees, and using fertilizer, humans have directly contributed to global warming. The connection between increased levels of greenhouse gases and rising temperature has been confirmed by scientists for over a century, said Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University marine and coastal sciences professor. ""There is as much uncertainty about this connection as there is about what will happen when you drop an object,"" Francis said. ""It will fall."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is also on board with human activity as a cause. They reported that were it not for human impact, the likely effect of natural changes to the environment would’ve been one of cooling, not warming. They cite ""very high confidence"" that human activities caused a change of course. The U.S. Global Change Research program published a 2014 report on climate change. It doesn’t debate whether human activity causes climate change. Rather, it focuses on what actions to take to lessen its effects. A May 2013 report analyzing all scientific papers that address the causes of climate change showed 97.1 percent of findings that took a position agree that there’s been a negative human impact on the atmosphere. Comedian John Oliver cleverly addressed the debate’s conclusiveness on a recent Last Week Tonight episode by arranging a representative debate between 97 climate change scientists and three deniers. As a politician from Florida, Rubio must contend with research that pegs Miami and Tampa as two of the U.S. cities most likely to be impacted by climate change. Rising sea levels will make them more prone to flooding. ""Whatever the cause of climate change, the impacts on Florida are already important and that it would be difficult for responsible people in Florida to ignore that fact,"" Berry said. Our ruling Rubio said human activity is not ""causing these dramatic changes to our climate."" An overwhelming majority of scientists agree that humans, by burning fossil fuels, contribute directly to global warming. Not only is Rubio incorrect, but he’s ignoring a mountain of concrete, scientific research. We rate his claim False. CORRECTION: This story was updated on May 15 to clarify that 97.1 percent of the studies that took a position on global warming agreed that there's been a negative human impact on the atmosphere; more than half the studies did not take a position. Also, the story clarifies that the 2013 report looked at studies, not individual scientists.",/factchecks/2014/may/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-humans-are-not-causing-climate-ch/

Does Oregon have 100,000 more jobs today than it did when John Kitzhaber was elected?
","Gov. John Kitzhaber, running for an unprecedented fourth term and taking a lot of flak for the collapse of the Cover Oregon website, has been trying to shine a light on his accomplishments. One of them struck a meat-and-potatoes campaign theme: jobs. The Claim In a recent campaign email, the Democratic governor claimed: ""Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected."" He repeated the claim to Harry Esteve, a reporter for The Oregonian, for a recent story, and that also got a lot of readers wondering about the figure. If the number is true, it would be great news in a state where the recession hit harder and lingered longer. We decided to check. The Analysis The standard way for economists -- and PolitiFact -- to analyze such statements is to use data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s source for employment data. The two most commonly cited sources of bureau data are a survey of households and a survey of employer payrolls. The first sample is smaller but more detailed. But for measuring raw numbers of jobs, payroll data is preferred. Within that data, ""non-farm jobs,"" tallied monthly, are the most commonly used. Nick Beleiciks, an employment economist with the Oregon Department of Employment, said that’s because every state keeps those figures, making them comparable. To make comparisons over time, economists prefer ""seasonally adjusted"" numbers to smooth out cyclical differences. So we used the bureau’s interactive website to find the seasonally adjusted figures for non-farm jobs in Oregon when Kitzhaber was last elected, in November 2010, and for March 2014, when the email went out. Here’s what we found: November 2010: 1,609,600 March 2014: 1,708,900 Increase: 99,300 So Kitzhaber’s claim is very close to accurate. It’s mirrored in the unemployment rate, according to bureau data, which fell from 10.4 percent in November 2010 to 6.9 percent this past March. Job growth in Oregon even exceeded the national rate during that time, 6.1 percent to 5.8 percent, according to BLS figures. In March, Oregon’s seasonally adjusted monthly job gain of 8,900 jobs was the largest since November 2005, when 9,300 jobs were added. Still, two points detract from the accuracy of Kitzhaber’s claim. First, the claim is ever so slightly cherry-picked. He could have started the clock the month he was sworn in -- January 2011. That time frame would have produced an increase of 94,000 jobs. Christian Gaston, a Kitzhaber campaign spokesman, agreed that the start time should have been pegged to the start of Kitzhaber’s latest term as governor, not the final two months of Ted Kulongoski’s second term. Second, while Kitzhaber did not personally claim credit for creating 100,000 jobs, he did cite the statistic in an email that began, ""Four years ago, you stood with me as together we promised Oregon that we could make critical progress on education, healthcare, and rebuilding our economy, even in the face of a significant partisan divide."" Clearly, he’s aiming to make sure he and his administration get some credit for the job growth. But we should make clear that governors are not all-powerful in shaping their state’s economy. Their policies on taxes, spending and economic development can make a difference, but state economies are also tied to the national and global economies. The Ruling Kitzhaber’s email said, ""Oregon today has 100,000 more jobs than it did when I was elected."" He’s essentially correct on the numbers. Technically, it’s 99,300 – though it’s important to note that it would have been 94,000 if he had counted from the time he was sworn in and affecting policy. It’s also important to note that governors have a modest influence on their state’s economy. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Harry Reid says Congress used earmarks for 200 years
","The term ""earmark"" has become something of a dirty word in Washington in recent years, with lawmakers pledging not to use the special funding carve-outs to aid groups back in their district. Taxpayer groups have long criticized earmarks for encouraging wasteful spending. But could the pendulum now be swinging the other way? Recently, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was quoted speaking favorably of earmarks, something you don’t hear every day in Washington. Reid defended the practice by claiming earmarks are an American tradition. ""I have been a fan of earmarks since I got here the first day,"" Reid said on May 6, 2014. ""Keep in mind, that’s what the country has done for more than 200 years, except for the brief period of time in recent years that we haven’t done these."" ""And I'll say this ...if there needs to be more transparency than what we had, then fine, do it,"" he added. ""But it is wrong to have bureaucrats downtown make decisions in Nevada that I can make better than they can make."" We wondered if earmarks have been around that long, so we took a look. First, some background. Although there is some variation in the definition of ""earmark,"" the term generally refers to provisions in bills that set aside funds for specific projects or programs at the state or local level. Shortly after celebrating victory in the 2010 midterm elections, House Republicans chose to institute a ban on earmarks. The House’s rules meant this ban effectively blocked the use of earmarks in the entire 112th Congress. Some say that the ban on earmarks has contributed to gridlock, and that bringing them back might grease the wheels for moving legislations through Congress. Historical Context The first instance of Congress using the practice we now refer to as earmarking was in the Lighthouse Act of 1789, said Don Ritchie, a historian with the Senate Historical Office. This measure, passed by the first Congress, allocated federal funds for the construction of lighthouses in states along the Atlantic coast. The earmarking in this act was drawn up by the congressional delegation from Pennsylvania, which, along with the help of an interest group, pushed to include federal funding for a pier in Philadelphia, according to a 1991 report from the Senate Historical Office. This is also considered the first time an interest group helped craft legislation. ""It’s an old practice that has appeared and re-appeared under different names,"" Ritchie said. Ritchie added that South Carolina Sen. John C. Calhoun used what amounts to an earmark in the Bonus Bill of 1817, which would have allocated money to be used for public works projects in the states. Calhoun’s fellow senator, Kentucky’s Henry Clay, used a similar method as part of his signature ""American System"" infrastructure initiative, according to Ritchie. It is important to note that then-President James Madison vetoed Calhoun’s bill, arguing that Congress did not have the power to make such appropriations. However, just because it was vetoed by the president doesn’t mean the measure can’t still be considered an earmark. Around the end of the 19th century, politicians began referring to the practice as ""pork barrel"" politics, and would tack funding for projects they wanted completed onto bills or lobby heads of agencies to request the project as part of their budgets, Ritchie said. So the earmark has a long history. But that doesn’t mean it’s been an equally important tactic for all of that time. Indeed, such prior examples pale compared to the surge in earmarked spending starting about two decades ago. Between 1994 and 2005, total spending from earmarks more than doubled, rising from $218 million to $500 million, according to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress. Over the same time period, earmarked spending as a percentage of total appropriation rose from 1.3 percent to 3 percent. That explosion of earmarking was a big departure from the work of earlier Congresses. Calling measures like Calhoun’s plan an earmark ""misrepresents the whole history,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""Even if they were earmark-ish, they were the exception, rather than the rule,"" he said. We should note that not everyone has exactly the same definition for ""earmark."" The Congressional Research Service acknowledged the difficulty of nailing down the definition of ""earmark,"" noting in January 2006 that ""one of the principal challenges to measuring earmarks in appropriation bills is defining the term and applying it consistently to the analysis."" The report also quotes Congressional Quarterly’s American Congressional Dictionary as allowing that under a looser definition, ""virtually every appropriation"" could be considered ""earmarked."" Our ruling Reid said Congress has used earmarked spending for ""more than 200 years."" A credible case can be made that Congress engaged in something like earmarking as long ago as 1789 and 1817. The tactic wasn’t used extensively and consistently during that whole period, and it really exploded in the past 20 years, before being phased out more recently. Still, Reid has a point that legislators have long directed spending, and there are 200-year-old (and older) examples of things that are very much like earmarks. We rate Reid’s claim Mostly True. Correction: This report has been changed to remove a reference to an article that examined the history of the earmark. We incorrectly identified the source of article as Taxpayers for Common Sense, but their site only reproduced the article.

Scarborough: Americans have cooled on climate change
","As Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio edges closer to a 2016 presidential bid, he wants Republican primary voters to know where he stands on litmus test issues like climate change. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate,"" Rubio said on ABC's This Week. ""I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy."" Many Republican voters would nod in agreement, but the question is, how well does this view sit with the public at large? Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, said Rubio might be on relatively safe ground with the public. ""From 2004, 2005, 2006, Americans were bought in to the concept of climate change and that we need to move aggressively on it,"" Scarborough said. But since then, the public shifted, he said. ""Check the polling: Most Americans began wandering away from this issue,"" Scarborough said. From Scarborough’s lips to our ears. In this fact-check, we review the polls on climate change and global warming (terms that are used interchangeably) to see if Americans care less than they did half a dozen years ago. Pollsters get at this question in a few ways. We’ll look at each one. Is it happening? For nearly 15 years, the Gallup organization has been asking people if they think global warming is underway. In 2002, 71 percent of the public said it is happening or will happen in their lifetime. That percentage peaked at 75 percent in 2008 and then fell. It reached a low of 62 percent in 2011 and since then has risen slightly. As of March 2014, it stood at 65 percent. With a margin of error of 4 percent, the result is modestly less than what Gallup reported in 2002. We find similar but slightly larger swings of opinion in the Pew Research Center data, although the Pew survey only goes back to 2006. Pew asks if people see solid evidence that the earth is warming. In 2006, 77 percent said yes. That fell to 57 percent in 2009, then rose to 67 percent in 2013. The trends don't exactly match the pattern Scarborough described. He suggested a simple slide down. In reality, there’s more of an up-down-up. Still, the public seems a little less certain about climate change today than in the mid 2000s. Is it something you worry about? Even if you believe the climate is changing, it might not cause you great concern. A group of university researchers from Drexel, McGill and Ohio State blended the results from a number of surveys to derive what they called the Climate Change Threat Index. Basically, the index captures whether people take the issue seriously. Robert Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University, is part of the team. From 2002 to 2005, the value of the index fluctuated between 40 and 45. (These are abstract units and should not be confused with the percentage of people who care.) Then it gained about 10 points. ""The big shift started in 2006 and coincided with the release of Al Gore’s movie  An Inconvenient Truth,"" Brulle said. ""It dropped off in the fall of 2008 after the big recession and the Wall Street meltdown."" Today, the index is about where is was in 2004. Again, up-down-up. Interestingly, Brulle and his colleagues Jason Carmichael and J. Craig Jenkins found that two factors primarily drive public concern about climate change. First, people worry more about it so long as more pressing problems like the economy don’t loom larger. Second, Republicans effectively can dial concern up or down. The partisan split on this issue shows up in every survey. The more Republican the voter, the less likely they are to say climate change is real or that it will make a difference. When Republican leaders are more vocal in their rejection of climate change (such as voting against a particular bill), public concern falls, at least among Republican leaning voters. When those leaders treat it more seriously, concern rises. But do you worry about it a lot? Gallup gets at the level of concern by asking people if they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetime. In 2004, about 34 percent answered yes. That rose to 40 percent in 2008, then fell to a low of 32 percent in 2010. It then rose to 38 percent and slid a bit to 36 percent where it stands today. When you account for the margin of error, public opinion has yo-yoed a bit but hasn’t changed all that much. Gallup finds that few American list climate change as a top concern. It ranked near the bottom out of 15 issues polled. Asked how much they worry, 51 percent said little or not at all about climate change, compared to just 11 percent who said they were unconcerned about the economy. Are humans causing it? In 2006, Pew found that 41 percent of public thought the Earth was getting warmer mainly due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels. In keeping with the pattern we saw for other questions, that number dropped to 34 percent in 2010, and then rose to 44 percent by the end of 2013. On this point, the partisan divide is pronounced. Just 24 percent of Republicans thought humans were driving climate change, compared to 43 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats. The Gallup polls show a similar pattern. In 2004, 61 percent thought humans were making the planet warmer. That fell to 50 percent in 2010, followed by a rise to 57 percent today. Again, the polling shows a slight decline in public buy-in on climate change since 2004, but it has risen from a low point a few years ago. Our ruling Scarborough said Americans have ""have wandered away"" from the issue of climate change since 2004. They certainly did, as polls consistently show dips through 2010. However, support has inched back in recent years.  While the recent gains remain below the 2004 levels, the overall drop isn't as dramatic as Scarborough makes it sound.

Does tea party favorite Justin Amash vote more often with Democrats or Republicans?
","Establishment Republicans who have for years operated under the threat of ""getting primaried"" by conservative challengers are hoping to turn the tables in Michigan, where there’s an all-out brawl to oust tea party favorite Rep. Justin Amash. Amash has become a polarizing figure within the Republican caucus, according to Politico, and some of his colleagues aren’t pulling punches in taking on the Michigander and his hardline anti-tax, anti-spending, anti-federal government stances. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called Amash, ""al-Qaida’s best friend in the Congress."" Harsh. A fellow Michigan Republican, Rep. Mike Rogers, said Amash is ""completely out of line with"" voters in his district. ""He votes more with the Democrats than with the Republicans, and that’s not out of principle, that’s out of him branding himself as something different,"" said Rogers, who has contributed $5,000 to Amash’s primary opponent, Brian Ellis. Amash’s countered: ""I vote less often with (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi, the real San Francisco Democrat, than any member of Congress."" How can you vote with Democrats more than Republicans and rarely vote on the same side as Pelosi, the House’s top Democrat? Something isn’t adding up here, so we decided to take a look. How Amash has voted A spokesman for Amash linked us to OpenCongress.org, a website from the nonpartisan Sunshine Foundation that aggregates voting records. The site also studies which colleague on each side of the aisle votes with members of Congress most and least since January 2013. Pelosi’s profile page says the Republican she least often votes with is, indeed, Amash. The two have been on the same side of just 22 percent of votes. That’s partly achieved by Amash staking out positions that put him against most of Congress on widely bipartisan measures. For example, Amash was one of only two House members to vote against a bill to reauthorize spending for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to assist local law enforcement agencies in training for and coordinating efforts to rescue missing children. On Facebook, Amash said the bill created federal bureaucracy and the tax dollars would be better spent locally. (Republicans can criticize Amash’s record, but he’s unique in his diligence about explaining nearly all of his votes on Facebook.) So if Amash seldom votes with Pelosi, is it possible he still votes with Democrats more, as Rogers said? In a word, no.   As a whole, Amash has more often sided with the GOP caucus. Amash’s profile on OpenCongress.org says he has voted with his party 82 percent of the time since January 2013. There are certainly many Republicans who toe the party line more closely. Rogers, for example, was with the majority of his GOP colleagues for 96 percent of roll calls since 2013. But there are Republicans who vote with the GOP less often than Amash this Congress, too, though none in Michigan. On some issues, though, Amash has joined forces with Democrats. His high-profile fight to curb NSA funding for metadata collection — which put Amash on the map with civil libertarians — enlisted a coalition of Republicans and Democrats weary of the military-industrial complex. The vote on his measure narrowly failed, with 111 Democrats supporting it — despite strong objections from President Barack Obama — alongside 94 Republicans. So where does Rogers’ claim come from? Rogers spokeswoman had no response but forwarded our request to Amash’s challenger Ellis. They noted that in 2012, a Congressional Quarterly analysis found Amash’s votes put him on the same side of President Barack Obama 51 percent of the time. It’s an interesting tidbit, but it won’t help Rogers on the Truth-O-Meter. The analysis only looked at 61 votes that year where Obama had a stated position. It includes many consequential bills, but it’s just a fraction of the total votes taken in 2012. Further, in 2011 and 2013, Amash was opposite Obama 75 percent of the time. But it did help us find a few interesting examples of Amash voting with Obama’s favored positions.   For example, Amash voted ""no"" on a GOP bill in 2012 that would have extended lower rates for student loans and pay for it with cuts to Obamacare. It passed the House despite a veto threat from Obama. On his Facebook page, Amash said he sided against it because he didn’t believe the cuts covered the cost of lowering student loan rates. Also in 2012, he voted against Republicans on a bill to replace across-the-board spending cuts (the so-called ""sequester"") with other more targeted cuts, while lifting spending caps on the military. Obama, instead, wanted to replace the sequester with tax increases and cut in other ways; Amash said he opposed the Republican proposal because it increased spending. More recently, Amash was one of just three Republicans (and 20 lawmakers in total) not to vote for more sanctions against Iran last July. At the time, the Obama administration was asking for some leeway from Congress to approach the newly elected Iranian regime with alternatives. Amash later said of his vote: ""If our goal is peaceful reform within Iran, it would be wise to give the new president an opportunity to talk before turning to new threats."" But again, these are a relatively small number of high-profile votes. Congressional Quarterly found Amash never voted with his party less than 85 percent of the time in a given year. Our ruling Rogers said Amash ""votes more with the Democrats than with the Republicans."" Rogers didn’t back up his claim, but we found two sources that showed that Amash has sided with Republicans upward of 80 percent of the time. That may be lower than many of his colleagues, and we found found a few high-profile examples of his voting against his own party. But by the numbers, he votes far more often with Republicans than Democrats. We rate Rogers’ statement False.",/factchecks/2014/may/13/mike-rogers/does-justin-amash-vote-more-often-democrats-or-rep/

Can a candidate be too conservative?
","A Democrat vying for a Georgia Senate seat is trying to convince voters his opponent is too far to the right for this left-leaning area. ""Elena Parent. A Disturbing Record: Too Conservative for Us,"" read a flier from Friends of Kyle Williams. One claim about Parent, a Democrat who served in the Georgia House of Representatives, seemed ripe for a fact check. ""Supported Governor Nathan Deal’s plan to slash the HOPE Scholarship,"" it said. ""The HOPE Scholarship has allowed a generation of Georgians the opportunity to afford college. There’s no excuse for Parent’s vote to limit these opportunities and hurt our children’s futures."" One PolitiFact Georgia reader said she received a robocall from Roy Barnes, the last Democrat to serve as Georgia’s governor, who claimed the ad was full of inaccurate information about Parent. The reader wanted to know which candidate is correct here. So did we. Parent and Williams are running to represent District 42 in the Georgia Senate, which includes several west-central DeKalb County communities such as Decatur, North Druid Hills and Avondale Estates. The current officeholder, Jason Carter, a Democrat, is running for governor. Parent served one term in the House and is the executive director of Georgia Watch, a consumer rights nonprofit. Williams is an attorney based in Decatur and involved in several community organizations. During one recent debate, Williams defended himself against Parent’s complaint that the flier distorted her record on HOPE. ""You don’t cut HOPE to save it,"" Williams said.   The flier contained a footnote concerning a bill passed by the Georgia Legislature in 2011 that altered the HOPE program. The Williams campaign forwarded us two documents that show Parent voted in favor of a bill Deal and other Republicans proposed to make changes to HOPE, but those items did not include a key element. Let’s explain. HOPE, for those of you unfamiliar with it, once covered all tuition costs if the student maintained a grade-point average of 3.0 or better. Since being created in 1993, HOPE had paid for more than 1 million students to attend college. By 2010, about one-third of students enrolled in public colleges relied on the award. In January 2011, Nathan Deal, a Republican, took office as governor and shortly thereafter announced plans to revamp the state’s popular HOPE Scholarship program to prevent it from going broke. HOPE is funded by the Georgia Lottery, but the lottery wasn’t raising enough revenue to keep up with rising enrollment and tuition. The state dipped into reserves to cover costs, but that well was running dry. On March 1, 2011, the House voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill that made some changes to HOPE. The changes included: Varying the amount students receive annually, depending on lottery revenue. Dropping the HOPE award private students will see from $4,000 to $3,600. Limiting the awards for full tuition at public colleges to students who graduate from high school with at least a 3.7 GPA and 1200 SAT score under a new Zell Miller Scholarship. These students will have to maintain a 3.3 GPA in college to keep the full scholarship Parent voted for the bill. That version of the House bill had the support of several key Democrats, such as Minority Leader Stacey Abrams of Atlanta and Calvin Smyre of Columbus, the House’s longest-serving Democrat. Many Democrats supported the bill as part of a strategy to negotiate with Deal to make some changes they believed would make the changes less drastic to low-income students, said state Rep. Stacey Evans, D-Smyrna. One week later, on March 8, the Senate passed a revised version of the House bill. All four Republican amendments were added to the bill, but none of the amendments proposed by Democrats were included in the revised bill. The Senate revisions included allowing only the top two graduates from each high school to get a Zell Miller Scholarship and offering low-interest loans to cover the difference between tuition and the amount of the HOPE award. When the bill came back to the House, with those changes, on March 10, Parent voted no. ""Elena didn’t feel like it was up to her standards, so she voted against the revised version,"" said Matt Weyandt, a senior adviser to the campaign. Evans, who previously endorsed Parent, said she was upset and disappointed by the Williams flier. Evans called Williams a friend and said she would have supported him if he were running against anyone but Parent. Evans voted against both versions of the House bill. Barnes also vouched for Parent’s role in the 2011 HOPE debate in the robocall, saying she ""led the fight to preserve the HOPE Scholarship."" Beth Cope, a spokeswoman for Williams, stressed that Parent should not have voted for the bill the first time. Williams has complained that Parent was too willing to compromise with Republicans. ""We don’t always get a chance to get it right the second time,"" Cope said. To sum up, Williams said Parent supported the governor’s plan to ""slash the HOPE Scholarship."" Parent voted for one version of the bill. But she voted against the final version of the legislation, which contained Republican revisions. There are a lot of problems with Williams’ claim. First, Deal, with the support of key Democrats, was trying to prevent HOPE from going broke. To accuse Parent of conspiring with a Republican governor to ""slash"" the popular program is way off base. And to say Parent supported a plan that she ultimately voted against seems to be a significant distortion of her record.

Prior to Benghazi, were there 13 attacks on embassies and 60 deaths under President George W. Bush?
","As the U.S. House of Representatives was readying a new special committee to investigate the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, many Democrats were arguing that continuing to probe the Sept. 11, 2012, attack -- which killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens -- amounted to a political witch hunt. On May 5, 2014, Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., told MSNBC host Ed Schultz that there has already been exhaustive testimony and investigation of the incident. ""This thing is just going on and on to boredom actually,"" Garamendi said. ""The Armed Services Committee actually did a hearing and the result was there’s nothing here. That’s obviously a great tragedy, but Ed, during the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died. In Karachi, there was a death of one of our diplomats, and those were not investigated during that period of time because it was a tragedy."" Readers asked us whether it’s true that under Bush, ""there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world, (and) 60 people died."" We turned to the Global Terrorism Database, a project headquartered at the University of Maryland. The database documents terrorist attacks around the world going back to the 1970s, and experts told us it is the best resource available for this fact-check. We searched the database for descriptions between January 2001 and January 2009 that included the term ""U.S. embassy."" We supplemented these with a few other attacks listed in a Huffington Post opinion piece that Garamendi’s staff said was their main source for the claim. The Huffington Post column Garamendi cited purposely didn't count any attacks in Baghdad. So we decided to construct our count from scratch. While Garamendi spoke of ""embassies and consulates,"" we found several U.S. diplomatic targets killed in the line of duty outside official compounds -- such as in convoys or their homes -- and we included them in our count. Once we cross-referenced the attacks in the article and those in the database, we narrowed down the total to 39 attacks or attempted attacks on U.S. embassies and embassy personnel. Of these 39 attacks, 20 resulted in at least one fatality. (Our complete list is here.) This is higher than Garamendi's claim, though if you only count attacks on embassy and consular property, there were 13. Garamendi also understated the number of deaths. In the 20 incidents with at least one fatality, the total death toll was 87 -- quite a few more than the 60 Garamendi cited. If you only count those at embassies and consulates proper, the number of deaths drops to 66. We should note that the vast majority of these deaths were not Americans. We counted 63 deaths that were either of non-Americans or of people whose nationality is unknown. Another three were U.S. civilians. Another 21 were workers at the U.S embassy or consulate, either of American or foreign nationality. So, using what we think is the most reasonable definition, Garamendi's numbers are a bit low. What about the implicit comparison he made between Benghazi and these previous attacks? That’s a little shakier. Generally, the experts we contacted agreed that Garamendi was making a reasonable point that there has been a steady, and comparatively overlooked, series of deadly attacks on U.S. embassies in recent years. Still, these experts also said there are valid reasons to treat Benghazi differently from the earlier attacks. ""Is Benghazi different? Absolutely,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown University’s security studies program. One reason, he said, is that an American ambassador died in the attack, which hadn’t happened since the 1970s. Another relevant question, Gartenstein-Ross said, ""is whether what happened was put to the American people in an honest manner, not just with respect to the administration, but also with respect to the intelligence community."" Gartenstein-Ross added that he wasn’t endorsing ""how the Republicans go about"" investigating this question. But he did say it’s a ""real, legitimate question."" ""As always, what causes the problem is not so much what happens, but the response to it,"" said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""‘If the administration had come out shortly after the attack and said, ‘Our consulate was attacked by organized Islamist forces, and we will pursue these terrorists and bring them to justice, one way or the other,’ I very much doubt there would be much juice in these hearings, if indeed they were being held at all."" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, agreed that Benghazi brings up important issues. ""We probably should have had more United States forces on site or at least nearby,"" he said. And the administration had a ""muddled response in terms of releasing information,"" he added. Our ruling Garamendi said that ""during the George W. Bush period, there were 13 attacks on various embassies and consulates around the world. Sixty people died."" There are actually different ways to count the number of attacks, especially when considering attacks on ambassadors and embassy personnel who were traveling to or from embassy property. Overall, we found Garamendi slightly understated the number of deadly attacks and total fatalities, even using a strict definition.

There is no 'incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself,' increases fatal accidents, Rep. Matt Caldwell says
","As the Florida legislature neared the finish line this spring, some legislators were in a hurry to increase the speed limit on major highways to 75 mph. But there was plenty of debate about whether the state should put on the brakes. SB 392 cleared the Senate, but the House was split during its April 30 debate, with many arguing that the bill was moving too fast. House sponsor Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-Lehigh Acres, waved off opponents, disputing concerns that the higher speed posed a danger. (The legislation eventually passed 58-56.) ""I have yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities,"" he said. We wondered: Is speed alone a factor in higher car crash fatalities? Let’s take this claim for a test drive. Pedal to the metal The first thing to note about the legislation is that it doesn’t decree an increase in the current 70 mph limit. Rather, Caldwell said, it allows the Florida Department of Transportation the ability to raise limits as high as 75 if they deem that advisable under the right conditions. So how do engineers determine the proper speed limit? They use something called the 85th percentile rule, a widely accepted formula that dictates the safest speed is the one at which 85 percent of drivers travel. (You can read more about the 85th percentile rule here.) Caldwell said that considering the speeds at which most Floridians travel, and given normal conditions (sunny, dry roads, etc.), 75 was an acceptable limit. And he argued that raising the speed alone was not going to increase fatalities. ""There’s certainly a huge correlation between speed and accidents,"" he told PolitiFact Florida. ""The real question is whether that’s the real cause of accidents."" Factoring in more factors We checked with the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration and the Florida Department of Highway Safety, which both referred us to the Florida Highway Patrol, since they’re the ones who would have to deal with future increases in state speed limits. Public affairs officer Steve Gaskins said the FHP had reached out to other states that increased their speed limits and didn’t find a dramatic impact impact on the number of fatal crashes. Gaskins said there were three other factors that caused crashes: -- Impairment (drunken or drugged driving) -- Distraction (texting, talking, putting on makeup, etc.) -- Aggressiveness (swerving, road rage and so on) Russ Rader, the vice president of communications of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said it was wrong to discount the effects of speed on a crash. He pointed specifically to a 2002 study that said 23 states that raised limits to 70 or 75 mph ended up with 35 and 38 percent more deaths per million vehicle miles traveled, respectively. But Rader acknowledged while speed is a problem, it’s not usually the only problem in fatal accidents. ""Crashes rarely have a solo cause. But higher speeds exacerbate other factors,"" he said. ""It’s clear from decades of research that when speed limits go up, crash risk goes up, and the crashes that happen are more likely to be deadly."" The Council of State Governments in 2013 noted that while lawmakers and researchers can agree higher speeds cause more deadly accidents because of the physics involved, ""Intense debate still surrounds the idea that speed-limit hikes alone make roadways more dangerous."" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported last year that the number of speeding-related deaths through 2011 has been dropping steadily, but maintained a steady 31 or 32 percent of total fatal accidents over several years. Michael Knodler, associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst College of Engineering, agreed that blaming speed increases alone is a difficult way to frame a public safety discussion. ""This is certainly something up for debate. If you backed me into a corner I could defend either case,"" he said. Speed variance is a much more pertinent issue in fatal accidents, he said. If the speed limit is 70 and everyone’s going 90, for example, the difference in the speed among cars is the dangerous factor. Knodler did stop short at Caldwell’s use of ""incontrovertible,"" though, saying the concrete physics of increased speed proves that speed does cause more fatalities in accidents. Those two concerns -- differences in speed and the effects of higher speeds on the severity of accidents -- still don’t mean more fatal accidents will happen, University of Kentucky transportation engineering professor Reginald Souleyrette told PolitiFact Florida. Souleyrette worked on a 2005-10 study of Iowa’s move to increase their speed limit to 70. Initial findings showed there was a slight increase in fatal and serious accidents, but in the long run crash rates went down. ""If what the representative implies is true, there should be no speed limit at all. … He is correct if he is implying that we should set ‘appropriate’ speed limits. There is no magic safe speed,"" Souleyrette said. Our ruling Caldwell said he had ""yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities."" Traffic studies and experts agree that higher speeds can lead to more fatalities in accidents, which makes Caldwell’s use of the word ""incontrovertible"" suspect. But opinions diverge when discussing whether higher speeds are the cause of those fatal accidents. Speed is no doubt a factor in accidents, but it’s rarely considered the factor leading to fatal crashes.

Sen. Tom Garrett says Medicaid fraud unit ""in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million"" last year
","State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. says Medicaid is bloated with fraud in Virginia and across the nation. In an op-ed published by three newspapers last month, Garrett cited an eye-popping amount of money recovered by Virginia’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit as an argument against expanding the state’s Medicaid program to up to 400,000 additional residents. The fraud unit, known as MFCU, operates out of the state attorney general’s office. Garrett, a Republican, worked in the unit for a few years before being elected Louisa County commonwealth’s attorney in 2007. ""Last year, the MFCU in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million!"" Garrett wrote. ""How can expanding this be a good idea?"" We took a look at Garrett’s $200 million claim and came across nearly identically written statements made earlier this year by two other Republicans opposed to Medicaid expansion: Dels. Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights and Tim Hugo of Fairfax County. Each of the three lawmakers cited the $200 million recovery figure in a paragraph discussing the damage Medicaid fraud inflicts on Virginia’s budget. Paul Allen, Garrett’s legislative assistant, said the senator made a mistake -- he understated the amount of Medicaid fraud recovery in Virginia. MFCU actually recouped about $1 billion during the budget year that ended in mid-2013, according to a report by the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.   Allen added that ""$200 million is the average year’s recovery amount."" MFCU, in its latest  annual report, said it recovered $1.01 billion during the budget year that ended June 30, 2013. The report shows that between 2009 and 2013, the unit recouped an average of $223.8 million a year. But the figures, to be fully understood, require a lot more explanation than Garrett, Cox or Hugo provided. The $1 billion-plus recovery last year was an anomaly that accounts for more than half of the total $1.9 billion total MFCU has recouped since the unit was created in 1982. Only fractions of the recovery stemmed from fraud in Virginia and were returned to state coffers. Almost all of last year’s recovery came from a national case MFCU prosecuted against Abbott Laboratories for misbranding one of its drugs, Depakote, as treatments for schizophrenia and aggression in elderly dementia patients. Depakote never has been proven effective for those uses. Abbott, which pled guilty, was ordered to pay a total of $1.5 billion to the federal government and states. The Virginia Attorney General’s office explained in its 2011-2012 annual report that the state’s fraud unit was approached in 2007 with allegations that Abbott had illegally marketed the drug, which was provided to people on Medicare and Medicaid. ""Although neither the whistleblowers nor the defendant in this case were located in Virginia, the whistleblowers came to Virginia because the MFCU has a national reputation for successfully investigating major national cases,"" the Virginia attorney general’s office said in a May 7, 2012, news release announcing the settlement. The release broke down the $1.5 billion settlement. Abbott paid the U.S. government a $500 million criminal fine. It also paid civil penalties of $270 million to the federal Medicaid program and $291 million to Medicare and other U.S. health programs. Another $239 million was distributed to state Medicaid programs and Abbott paid an additional $198.5 million in criminal asset forfeiture penalties. Of those asset forfeitures, Virginia received $115 million because MFCU led the investigation. The unit partnered with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western Office of Virginia on the four-year probe, which the attorney general’s office says entailed 40,000 man hours of investigation and sifting through 1 million records. Virginia Medicaid’s share of the settlement portion going to states was $4.2 million. That’s the total amount of fraud Abbott inflicted on Virginia’s program, according to Michael Kelly, spokesman for state Attorney General Mark Herring’s office. Outside of the Abbott case, Virginia’s MFCU recovered $11 million during last year, according to Kelly. Now, let’s get back to Garrett. His legislative assistant said the $200 million Garrett cited is the average yearly amount of Medicaid fraud recovery in Virginia. Including the Abbott settlement, MFCU has averaged recouping about $223.8 million annually during the last five budget years. If Abbott is not included, the five-year 2009-2013 annual average drops to $23.8 million. ""The federal government frequently lets Virginia’s MFCU take the lead on large, multi-state cases,"" Kelly emailed us. ""This is important to note because it means that not all the money that is ordered recovered thanks to a Virginia case came out of Virginia’s Medicaid budget, nor is it necessarily coming back to Virginia’s budget."" By far, the two next biggest years for MFCU were 2007 and 2008 when the unit recovered a total of $648.8 million. Virtually all of the sum was attributable to a national case the unit prosecuted against pharmaceutical maker Purdue Frederick Company.  The company pled guilty to misbranding OxyContin as less addictive than other pain medications when no medical research supported the claim. The recoveries from the Purdue and and the Abbott cases come to more than 85 percent of the $1.9 billion MFCU has recouped in its 30-year history. The unit also prosecutes allegations of malfeasance by health care providers, such as double billing, charging for services not rendered and embezzlement. The Department of Medical Assistance Service, the state agency that oversees the state’s Medicaid program, handles cases of fraud by Medicaid recipients. In the 2013 fiscal year, the agency identified $3.4 million in ""overpayments"" to Medicaid beneficiaries, but not all of it was due to malfeasance, according to Christina Nuckols, a spokeswoman for Virginia Health Secretary Bill Hazel. ""Overpayments can occur for other reasons (than fraud), and sometimes they are the result of mistakes,"" she emailed. Our ruling Garrett, in arguing against Medicaid expansion in Virginia, wrote that the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit last year ""in Virginia alone recovered over $200 million!"" Garrett’s aide says the senator understated the recovery, which was actually $1 billion. The figures are correct. But Garrett’s claim that MFCU collected $200 million ""in Virginia alone"" easily can be read as a statement about the amount of fraud that occurred in the Old Dominion. He doesn’t mention that almost all the money MFCU recovered last year came from a national fraud case it prosecuted against Abbott Labs. The amount of Medicaid fraud Abbott committed in Virginia was $4.2 million. Outside of the Abbott case, MFCU recovered $11 million last year. So Garrett’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that create a different impression about the level of fraud in Virginia’s Medicaid system. It’s hard to imagine Garrett wasn’t clued in on the details of MFCU’s work. After all, the senator was a lawyer for the unit between 2005 and 2007.

George Will: Incandescent light bulb has 'no effect whatever on the planet'
","The kidnapping of over 200 Nigerian schoolgirls has led to an outpouring of concern, outrage and frustration. When a Nigerian attorney penned the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, over 2 million people followed suit, including First Lady Michelle Obama, who tweeted a picture of herself holding a hand-lettered sign with the slogan. Conservatives dismissed this as a meaningless gesture toward a crime that demanded a more muscular response. Adding his voice to that view, Fox News political commentator George Will made an unlikely comparison. ""Power is the ability to achieve intended effects,"" Will said on Fox News Sunday. ""And this is not intended to have any effect on the real world. It’s a little bit like what environmentalism has become. The incandescent light bulb becomes the enemy. It has no effect whatever on the planet, but it makes people feel good about themselves."" We wondered about Will’s claim that the incandescent light bulb ""has no effect whatever on the plant."" We reached out to Will and did not hear back. Neal Elliott, associate director for research at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, called Will’s claim ""demonstrably untrue."" The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy includes representatives from utilities, manufacturers and academia. Elliott points to the work of the U.S. Energy Department. Following passage of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the department has encouraged the use of more efficient alternatives such as compact fluorescent bulbs. ""Switching to energy-saving bulbs will reduce the growth of U.S. energy demand and avoid carbon emissions,"" the department writes on one of its many Web pages on this topic. When it examined the lifetime energy use of different bulbs, from manufacture to end use, the department found that incandescent bulbs required three times more energy. All things being equal, the need for more electrical power translates into burning more fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, which leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions. That is certainly an effect on the planet. The government estimates that if every household got rid of incandescent bulbs, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions equal to getting rid of 800,000 cars. The closest we could find to an argument that might support Will was a group of scientists in Canada who said the switch to compact fluorescent bulbs might not always have a positive effect in every location. Factors such as the source of power -- hydroelectric, coal, natural gas, nuclear, etc. -- and the balance between the need for heating and air conditioning, could change the outcome from province to province. For example, in British Columbia, greenhouse gas emissions might go up, while in Saskatchewan, they would plummet. Nevertheless, in total, they still found that emissions dropped using alternative light bulbs. Electric utility companies across America are spending millions of dollars to promote the use of compact fluorescents on the theory that they will be able to avoid expensive investments in new power plants. California is a leading state in this approach with over half a billion dollars slated to be spent over seven years. The energy savings have fallen short of expectations but the program has produced savings nevertheless. Our ruling Will said incandescent light bulbs have no effect whatsoever on the planet. There is broad consensus that incandescent bulbs are less efficient than alternatives such as compact fluorescent bulbs. And because they are less efficient, they require more energy -- and generate more greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, they clearly have an effect on the planet. Alternative bulbs may not be a panacea, but Will went way too far in saying incandescent light bulbs play no role in how we consume energy resources.

Rick Santorum: Minimum wage increase would cost 500,000 jobs
","Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., criticized President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 on CNN’s State of the Union.  Santorum said he could support a smaller minimum wage increase, but not the nearly $3 an hour hike the president and other Democrats have called for. ""If you look at the CBO report, half a million people would lose their jobs as a result of the Obama minimum wage increase,"" Santorum said. ""I’m talking more in the range of a dollar, phasing that in."" Santorum didn’t respond to our request for comment, but we were able to find the February 2014 Congressional Budget Office report he was speaking about. Santorum is largely quoting the report correctly. Obama’s proposed increase would take place in three steps, with the minimum hourly wage hitting $10.10 in 2016. It currently sits at $7.25, but many states choose to pay a higher minimum wage than federal policy mandates. The CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That’s about 0.3 percent of the workforce. CBO reached its conclusion, figuring: Higher wages increase companies’ production costs. In turn, that lowers the amount of goods and services produced. That means companies need to employ fewer workers. Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing productive higher-wage workers. The one thing that Santorum didn't note is that the 500,000-job estimate is just that, an estimate. Job losses could range from hardly any, all the way up to 1 million. It pegged 500,000 jobs as its ""central estimate."" That’s not to say the CBO report had only bad news about Obama’s proposal. The report also noted that about 16.5 million workers would see their wages go up. Our ruling Santorum said if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, ""half a million people would lose their jobs."" Santorum said ""would"" but really the 500,000-job figure was the CBO’s best guess. Analysts say job losses could be anywhere from just a few workers to as many as 1 million.

Sean Duffy says ‘explosive growth in Medicare’ will cause federal deficit spending to top $1 trillion
","At the state Republican Party’s convention, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy’s mind was on Medicare. The Republican from northern Wisconsin said unchecked spending on the federal health insurance program for seniors and disabled Americans could reverse progress on taming federal budget deficits and debt. ""The debt, it has come down,"" Duffy said in an interview at the convention with Wisconsin Eye reporter Steve Walters. ""We topped out at $1.5 trillion in deficit spending … and we’re down to a bit over $600 billion (deficit). If you look out two years it actually launches again. Then we’re over $1 trillion in just a few more years. So this is not over."" Duffy added: ""The reason is you have an explosive growth with Medicare. Because our baby boomers are retiring, and -- it’s a great thing with modern medicine -- we live longer as people, and health care costs are going up. All that is putting pressure on Medicare."" The congressman’s remarks were made to bolster his case for reforms -- opposed by Democrats -- that he says could save Medicare from insolvency. We’re aware that Duffy backed U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s 2015  budget, which endorsed changes in Medicare for the next generation of recipients. But we wondered whether ""explosive growth in Medicare"" is the biggest reason projections show the federal deficit topping $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually. By the numbers Duffy’s office offered no backup for his claim, but the numbers are readily available. The annual budget deficit for the 2013 fiscal year was $680 billion, according to an April 2014 report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan scorekeeper. That’s down from $1.41 trillion in 2009, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget’s website. But projections are that after dipping to $469 billion in 2015, yearly deficits will rise steadily to $998 billion by 2022 and slightly over $1 trillion the next two years. (As a percentage of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, the deficit rises from 2.8 percent to 3.7 percent from 2014 to 2024). Why the roller coaster ride? There’s no disagreement that Medicare costs, though growing more slowly than historical rates, will rise substantially in the coming decade as growing numbers of baby boomers become eligible for benefits at age 65. ""Under current law, spending for Medicare is expected to grow by an average of 6 percent per year over the next 10 years,"" a CBO report in February said. ""That growth can be attributed in roughly equal parts to increasing caseloads and rising costs per beneficiary."" But is Medicare growth ""explosive?"" And how big a driver will it be in future deficits? For more than a decade, policy analysts have warned of the long-term consequences of rising health care spending. But it’s been widely reported that recent growth in Medicare’s per-beneficiary costs has slowed as overall health-care cost inflation has slowed. In fact, the CBO noted that, over most of the next 10 years, spending for Social Security and Medicare remains ""fairly stable"" as a share of GDP, before rising in the final few years of the 10-year projection period. Still, Medicare costs are projected to rise faster than GDP growth in the future, said Melinda Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. And the government’s crystal ball reveals some eye-popping numbers on Medicare’s future. In 2013, Medicare had about 51 million beneficiaries; that number is expected to climb to 71 million in 2024, the February CBO report said. But other major forces not cited by Duffy will drive deficits. Rising interest rates and increasing federal debt are expected to raise net interest payments from $227 billion in 2014 to $876 billion in 2024. Another player in ""healthcare costs"" is Medicaid, the federal health program for low-income people. It will account for 2.1 percent of the economy in 2024, up from 1.7 percent in 2014, as some states expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And Social Security is rising fast as well, Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us. The CBO summed up the landscape by saying the substantial rise in the deficit will be mainly because of the aging population, rising healthcare costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance (in the Affordable Care Act), and growing interest payments on federal debt. So, bottom line, what is the main driver in the deficit projections? For help, we turned to the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that educates the public about the consequences of federal budget decisions. Concord’s policy director, Joshua Gordon, said that, on a percentage growth basis, Medicare and Social Security are in a virtual tie between now and the $1 trillion projected deficit in 2022. Their predicted growth rates in that period are within a percentage point. Still, Social Security, the largest federal entitlement, contributes more to the deficit in actual dollar terms. Social Security is projected to grow by nearly $500 billion over 10 years compared with about $310 billion for net Medicare outlays (after factoring in premiums paid and other offsets). Net interest on federal debt easily tops both of those -- though Joseph Antos, a health care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, notes that ""net interest is the result of decades of deficit spending and is not something one can reduce directly."" Cutting Social Security involves directly reducing benefits. That leaves Medicare. Congress and the White House have enacted several Medicare savings items, but have been unable to reach a long-term deal to tame Medicare and Social Security growth. They have concentrated spending cuts on discretionary programs, things such as defense, law enforcement, transportation, the national park system, disaster relief, and foreign aid. As a consequence, both defense and nondefense discretionary outlays are projected to fall by more than 20 percent relative to the size of the economy over the next 10 years, CBO said. PolitiFact Florida in November 2013 checked Senator Marco Rubio’s claim that ""what is driving our long-term debt are Medicare and Social Security programs that are structured in unsustainable ways."" Rubio’s claim was rated Mostly True. Medicare and Social Security are projected to grow as a percentage of GDP, while defense is projected to shrink by the same measurement -- but defense is a factor in our debt, the item said. Our rating Duffy says ""explosive growth in Medicare"" is the reason that federal deficit spending is predicted to top $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually. The congressman’s deficit figures are on target and there’s no doubt that Medicare is a major driver of predicted deficits. But Duffy leaves out Social Security from the equation. There’s a spot on the Truth-O-Meter for a partially accurate statement that leaves out important details. We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/may/11/sean-duffy/sean-duffy-says-explosive-growth-medicare-will-cau/

Rhode Island House speaker Nicholas Mattiello says the Pell bridge is a tourism bridge
","The debate continues over whether there should be a toll on the new Sakonnet River Bridge, one of three bridges motorists can take to get to Newport, R.I. A temporary 10-cent toll on the bridge was supposed to be replaced May 16 with new rates of up to $3.75 per crossing. But that change was put on hold, as legislators debate whether to eliminate the toll entirely and find another way to pay for maintaining the bridge. During an April 6, 2014, appearance on WLNE-Channel 6’s  ""On the Record With Buddy Cianci,"" Nicholas Mattiello, Rhode Island's new speaker of the House, was asked about the contentious issue. He said people objecting to a toll on the Sakonnet ""have a point. There would be the one bridge in the state other than the Pell Bridge, which is a tourism bridge essentially and not a commuter bridge (with a toll). There's a big difference between the two. So that would be the only commuter bridge in the state that would be tolled."" On that same day, WPRI-TV aired an interview with Mattiello in which he again characterized the Pell Bridge, which connects Jamestown to Newport, as ""a tourism bridge."" We'll let others debate the merits of tolling a bridge depending on whether residents or visitors use it. But, given all the Rhode Island license plates we see on the Pell Bridge, we wondered whether it was accurate to call it a tourism bridge. There's no formal definition of a tourism bridge. But in our mind, it’s one that is primarily used by tourists. We contacted Mattiello's office to ask whether he had any data to distinguish the two. His spokesman, Larry Berman, said Mattiello ""considers the Pell Bridge a 'tourist bridge' or a 'destination bridge' because Newport is a world-renowned attraction for tourists,"" including Rhode Islanders. In 2013, the monthly vehicle count on the Pell Bridge went from 537,000 in February to 722,000 in August, the peak of the tourist season, Berman said. Yet even if those extra 185,000 trips in August were all tourists, that means tourists made up only 26 percent of the traffic during the peak visitor season. That doesn't exactly make it a tourist bridge. But there are other complicating factors. When we asked the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority to weigh in on the question, David Darlington, who was chairman at the time but has recently stepped down for health reasons, said its traffic consulting firm was estimating that ""on an annual basis 24 hours per day 7 days per week, only 20 percent of the trips on the Pell Bridge would be considered tourists."" That's because many of the people traveling the bridge in the summer aren't tourists, but seasonal workers commuting to restaurants, hotels and shops in Newport. In addition, road traffic tends to go up on all roads in the summer, not just those feeding tourist spots. Darlington said a comparable average for Sakonnet would be 18 percent. In addition, when a bridge is used primarily by tourists, fewer drivers tend to have an E-ZPass electronic toll device, said Richard Gobeille, national toll and finance unit manager, at Jacobs Engineering Group, the authority's traffic consultant. ""The Pell Bridge is one of the highest in the country"" when it comes to its frequency of E-ZPass customers, he said. But we wanted to look at the numbers ourselves. We were able to examine monthly crossing figures in several different ways using data that included how many trips involved in-state and out-of-state E-ZPasses. Every way we ran the numbers, we couldn't prove Mattiello right. For example, even if you took the biggest tourism month of the year and assumed every non-E-ZPass user, every out-of-state E-ZPass user and every Rhode Island E-ZPass user who made fewer than eight trips across the bridge that month was a tourist, tourists trips made up a minority of the vehicle crossings. If you just look at E-ZPass users, Rhode Islanders made nearly 700,000 crossings that month compared with 164,000 trips by out-of-state users. Our ruling House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said the Pell Bridge ""is a tourism bridge essentially and not a commuter bridge."" But the people who oversee the bridge say only 20 percent of the traffic is from tourists. And our own analysis of the numbers suggests that the majority -- and by some estimates, the vast majority -- of users aren't crossing as tourists. We rate the claim as False.
