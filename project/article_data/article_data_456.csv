Trump says Iran deal forces U.S. to defend Iran if it's attacked by Israel
","Donald Trump says the Iran nuclear deal would force the United States to defend Iran if it were attacked by Israel. He denounced the deal as ""horrendous"" during a Sept. 3 radio interview on ""The John Fredericks Show,"" a Hampton Roads-based broadcast that’s aired through much of Virginia. Trump added: ""If Israel attacks Iran, I think -- of course this wouldn’t happen, it wouldn’t happen with me, with Obama you never know -- but we’re supposed to be on Iran’s side if this happens. OK? And nobody knows this and even talks about that point but, basically, we’re supposed to protect them."" The Republican front-runner for the White House made similar comments a day earlier during a CNN interview. ""You know, there is something in the Iran deal that people I don't think really understand or know about,"" he said. ""And nobody is able it to explain it, that if somebody attacks Iran, we have to come to their defense."" Trump’s comments come on the heels of events that all but guarantee the U.S. will participate with other nations in a deal in which Iran will curb its short-term nuclear ambitions in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., announced her support for the accord on Sept. 2, making her the 34th senator to do so. That means opponents will be unable to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override President Barack Obama’s pledged veto of a congressional vote to defeat the deal. We asked Trump’s campaign for backup on the candidate’s statements and didn’t hear back. But the claim is familiar to PolitiFact; it also has been made by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and debated in Israel. Let’s zero in. The Iran deal At the heart of the claim is Article 10, Annex III, of the accord which states: ""E3/EU+3 parties, and possibly other states, as appropriate, are prepared to cooperate with Iran on the implementation of nuclear security guidelines and best practices."" That includes the following: • ""Co-operation in the form of training courses and workshops to strengthen Iran's ability to prevent, protect and respond to nuclear security threats to nuclear facilities and systems as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems; • ""Co-operation through training and workshops to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against, and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage, as well as to enable effective and sustainable nuclear security and physical protection systems."" This article has been criticized in the Israeli media. ""One of the clauses in the nuclear deal reached between world powers and Iran last week guarantees that the world powers will assist Iran in thwarting attempts to undermine its nuclear program,"" Israel Hayom, a newsletter, said July 20. But experts told PolitiFact Florida in late July that such interpretations are, at best, exaggerated. The aim of the provision, they said, is to protect nuclear materials from theft (say, if terrorists tried to steal Iranian assets) or from sabotage (with the intent of causing a hazardous-materials threat to health). For years, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, the United States has pushed countries around the world to improve security for their nuclear material and facilities, said Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard and an expert on nuclear theft and terrorism. This agreement furthers that goal, he said. ""It has nothing to do with helping Iran protect its nuclear facilities from a military attack"" of the kind that Israel or Egypt might carry out, Bunn said. ""It’s about protecting against thieves and terrorists who might want to steal nuclear material or sabotage a nuclear facility."" Bunn added that by its plain language, the provision does not obligate any of the signatories, including the United States, to do anything in particular. Rather, it says the signatories are ""prepared"" to cooperate with Iran on these topics, with lots of wiggle room for all sides. ""My guess is that very little cooperation in these areas will take place,"" Bunn said. Russia and China might be willing to do some training, but nothing would force the United States to do so. If the United States did participate, there’s even some historical precedent for intelligence gains from this sort of activity, Bunn said. He said American cooperation with Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union dramatically reduced the risk that nuclear material would be stolen and gave the U.S. insights into the Russian nuclear complex. Meanwhile, the agreement allows -- but doesn’t mandate -- training for Iran in protecting against threats such as cyber-sabotage. Some see this as ironic because of reports that Obama secretly ordered the Stuxnet computer virus to be launched against Iran to derail its nuclear program. But it’s hard to believe that the U.S. would share its secrets in this realm, and the agreement doesn’t force them to do so. ""Do you seriously think that any training we might offer Iran would help them ward off another Stuxnet?"" Bunn said. ""This is really silly. There are good arguments on both sides about this agreement, but this isn’t one of them."" Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. and a career Army officer, agreed that the deal doesn’t prevent the U.S. from attacking Iran using cyber or other means or require the U.S. to develop measures to counter a future cyber attack. ""The intent (of the provision) is to make certain that Iran is capable to protect nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and help it prevent sabotage,"" he said. The administration has been clear about how it interprets this provision. Rubio quizzed Secretary of State John Kerry on this portion of the deal during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing July 23. The exchange occurred one day after Rubio told Fox News that the accord would force the U.S. to defend Iran if Israel or ""any other country tries to undermine"" Iran’s nuclear facilities. Here is an excerpt: Rubio: ""If Israel conducts an airstrike against a physical facility, does this deal, the way I read it, does it require us to help Iran protect and respond to that threat?"" Kerry: ""No."" Rubio: ""If Israel conducts a cyber attack against the Iranian nuclear program, are we obligated to help them defend themselves against the Israeli cyberattack?"" Kerry: ""No, I assure you, that we will be coordinating very, very closely with Israel as we do on every aspect of Israel’s security."" Our ruling Trump said that under the Iran deal: ""If Israel attacks Iran … we are supposed to be on Iran’s side."" The claim rests on an interpretation of a provision that the U.S. and other partners are prepared, ""as appropriate,"" to cooperate with training to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage. But the White House has made it clear that its interpretation of the provision is that it is targeted at terrorists and saboteurs, not Israel or other U.S. allies. If you’re still in doubt, consider that nothing in the provision compels the U.S. to offer any assistance to Iran in the event of a threat to its nuclear program. So we rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB37700>],/factchecks/2015/sep/04/donald-trump/trump-says-iran-deal-forces-us-defend-iran-if-its-/

Hillary Clinton says '23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment'
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton recently announced a $10 billion proposal for treating drug and alcohol addiction. While addiction and treatment has not traditionally been a top-tier issue in presidential races, it has attracted concern in key caucus and primary states this year, including New Hampshire, where Clinton announced her proposal in an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union-Leader. In explaining why an assertive policy response was necessary, Clinton wrote in the op-ed, among other claims, that ""23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment."" We wondered if her figures are accurate. On the ratio, Clinton is close. The most recent data from the federally sponsored National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 22.7 million Americans needed treatment for a drug alcohol problem but only about 2.5 million received treatment ""at a specialty facility."" That means 11 percent of people who conceivably could have needed treatment at a specialty facility received it, or one out of every nine. This ratio has held steady over the years, said Arthur Robinson Williams, a fellow in the division on substance abuse in Columbia University’s Department of Psychiatry. ""The 2013 survey was consistent with prior findings and estimates,"" Williams said. Still, we wondered about the survey’s use of the term ""specialty facility."" What does that mean? We found the definition: It refers to ""treatment received at drug or alcohol rehabilitation facilities (inpatient or outpatient), hospitals (inpatient services only), and mental health centers; it excludes treatment received in an emergency room, private doctor's office, self-help group, prison or jail, or hospital as an outpatient."" Among the forms of treatment not counted are groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Not everyone agrees that AA is effective (or effective for everyone), and it is perhaps most helpful as reinforcement to other types of treatment led by clinicians. Still, the number of participants is hardly trivial: AA counted 1,283,704 members in the United States as of Jan. 1, 2015, plus an additional 35,349 in correctional facilities. Thousands more attended Narcotics Anonymous and other 12-step groups. As for excluding private doctor visits, the distinctions  ""are likely true, but largely irrelevant,"" said David Rosenbloom, a professor of health policy and management at the Boston University School of Public Health. ""Treatment in doctor’s offices is a relatively recent development, as medication-assisted addiction treatment through the medical care system has achieved regulatory approval."" While ""many people with addiction could be treated in the regular medical care system,"" Rosenbloom said, ""the delivery mechanism to get from here to there isn’t in place yet."" Allowing for some definitional concerns about the numbers, Clinton ""is mainly right,"" said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Langone Medical Center. Our ruling Clinton said that ""23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get treatment."" To be fully accurate, the claim needs some modest tweaks. The actual ratio is about one of nine, not one in 10, and it’s worth noting that the treatment statistics include only the most intensive methods, leaving out such widely used approaches as Alcoholics Anonymous. Still, experts said Clinton’s claim is close to accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC225C0>],/factchecks/2015/sep/04/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-23-million-americans-suffer-a/
"['Immigration', 'Legal Issues', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says it's always been that babies born to U.S. citizens abroad are citizens from birth
","Ted Cruz says that in a way, his bona fide citizenship traces to the birth of the United States. The Texas senator was born in the western Canada city of Calgary, Alberta, in 1970 to a Cuban father and American mother. His mother’s citizenship automatically made her son a U.S. citizen and, most legal authorities concur, eligible to run for president. (In May 2014, too, Cruz renounced his dual Canadian citizenship.) Yet in August 2015, Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor bidding for president, suggested Cruz had benefited from the 14th Amendment’s birthright grant of citizenship to anyone born in the United States, Politico said in a news story. Cruz, who had said that he wanted to end the granting of ""automatic birthright citizenship to the children of those who are here illegally,"" told reporters Bush seemed confused about legal versus illegal immigration. ""With regard to legal citizens,"" Cruz said, ""I am a United States citizen because my mother was a United States citizen, born in Wilmington, Delaware. And,"" Cruz said, ""it has been the law since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born here or abroad are American citizens by birth."" We were curious about his recap of legal history. For starters, the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey suggests that Cruz ranks among about 2.75 million citizens born abroad (including this reporter, ahem) to at least one U.S. citizen-parent. Cruz’s campaign did not respond to our requests for back-up information. But legal experts and, ultimately, a Supreme Court justice’s writings helped us realize that children born to citizens living abroad have been granted citizenship by law from the country’s earliest years, though the way Cruz got his citizenship — through his mother — wasn’t statutorily settled until the 1930s. A 1790 law To our inquiries, experts on U.S. citizenship advised us that an act passed into law by the very first Congress in March 1790 said children born abroad to citizens could be U.S. citizens — a form of ""derivative citizenship."" Christopher McKnight Nichols, an Oregon State University historian, said by email: ""Since the Naturalization Law of 1790, it is clear that Congress attempted to establish a citizenship right for children born of citizens abroad."" The 1790 law, less than 300 words long, initially said any ""free white person"" may become a citizen after satisfying residency requirements of two years (later amended to five years) and satisfying a court that ""he is a person of good character, and taking the oath or affirmation prescribed by law to support the Constitution of the United States."" Likewise, the law said, non-adult children of a person ""so naturalized"" shall be considered citizens. The law then turned to children born abroad, stating: ""And the children of citizens of the United States that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born citizens,"" though it added that ""the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States."" John Trasviña, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law, pointed out a March 2008 article in the student-edited NYU Annual Survey of American Law stating that when Congress agreed to citizenship for children born abroad, it acted much like England’s Parliament, which had earlier moved to grant citizenship to such children. Citizenship through fathers only? Then again, the student-written article and legal experts prompted us to wonder if children born abroad to mother-citizens were always granted U.S. citizenship. By various accounts, including a 2000 Supreme Court dissent, Congress didn’t settle on citizenship through mothers until 1934. The 1790 law, the article noted, ""created the first distinction between citizen-fathers and citizen-mothers. Although the first clause uses the gender-neutral ‘citizens,’ the residency requirement limited the ability of citizen-mothers to pass citizenship to their foreign-born children."" That is, the article says, the ""foreign-born child of a citizen-father and alien-mother would definitely receive derivative citizenship, but the foreign-born child of a citizen-mother and an alien-father would receive derivative citizenship only if the alien-father had been"" a U.S. resident. Additional changes may have led to more confusion. In 1802, Congress revised the born-abroad law to say: ""And the children of persons who now are, or have been citizens of the United States, shall though born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, be considered as citizens of the United States.""  In 1855, Congress revised the law afresh to offer citizenship to children born abroad to citizen-fathers who had previously lived in the country. Citizenship at birth through a mother And what about citizenship through mothers? To get a peg on that, we turned to a 2011 article by Kristin Collins, a Boston University law professor. Collins wrote that Congress addressed this gap in 1934 after ""years of persistent lobbying by women’s organizations"" and ""finally equalized parent-child derivative citizenship with respect to married citizen mothers and fathers, at least as a formal matter."" We reached Collins, who said by email that from 1790 on, it would be fair to say that ""some foreign-born children of American parents are citizens at birth. On the other hand, Sen. Cruz’s characterization of the history of American citizenship law is a tad misleading, especially with respect to individuals like him who are the foreign-born children of American mothers."" Collins summed up: ""Until 1934, under the federal citizenship statute that determined the citizenship of foreign-born children of American parents, foreign-born children of American mothers did not acquire citizenship at birth – only (some) foreign-born children of American fathers were citizens at birth. But in 1934, Congress liberalized the law so that citizenship passed through mothers as well as fathers."" Collins said it would be more accurate to say it’s been the law since the country’s beginning that some children of American citizens born abroad are citizens by birth. We also enlisted North Carolina-based historian Candice Bredbenner, who wrote a 1998 book on women and citizenship. By email, she replied that generally, ""the policies on granting citizenship at birth to children born abroad to a married citizen mother have undergone considerable change over time. So, Cruz’s assumption that, since the country’s founding, the federal government has recognized a mother’s right to transfer her U. S. citizenship to a child cannot be supported by the evidence."" In fairness to Cruz, she followed up, ""even the person with some modest interest in this subject could be easily confused.""    Justice Ginsburg's dissent Collins also emailed us a copy of a May 2000 article she wrote analyzing a 1998 U.S. Supreme Court case in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent, took note of the 1790 law establishing the pathway to citizenship through a child’s parents so long as the father had been a U.S. resident. Ginsburg further wrote: ""Statutes passed in 1795 and 1802 similarly conditioned the citizenship of the child born abroad on the father’s at least one-time"" (U.S.) residence. ""This father’s residence requirement,"" Ginsburg wrote, ""suggests that Congress intended a child born abroad to gain citizenship only when the father was a citizen. That, indeed, was the law of England at the time."" On the other hand, she wrote, the ""statutory language… was ambiguous. One could read the words ‘children of citizens’ to mean that the child of a United States citizen mother and a foreign father would qualify for citizenship if the father had at some point resided in the country."" In the 1800s, Ginsburg wrote, there was an unsuccessful push to change the law to grant citizenship to children born abroad to U.S.-born citizen mothers as well as fathers. Instead, Ginsburg wrote, Congress in 1855 ""clarified that citizenship would pass to children born abroad only when the father"" was a U.S. citizen. The same law, she said, automatically granted citizenship to women who married U.S. citizens. In 1934, Ginsburg wrote, ""Congress moved in a new direction. It terminated the discrimination against United States citizen mothers in regard to children born abroad,"" amending the law to say: ""Any child hereafter born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, whose father or mother or both at the time of the birth of such child is a citizen of the United States, is declared to be a citizen of the United States; but the rights of citizenship shall not descend to any such child unless the citizen father or citizen mother, as the case may be, has resided in the United States previous to the birth of such child."" At the time, Ginsburg wrote, Senate and House Reports on the act stated the change was made ""to establish complete equality between American men and women in the matter of citizenship for themselves and for their children."" The law today A 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service on qualifications for president and the ""natural born"" citizenship hurdle noted the existing citizenship provisions for children born abroad. The law says individuals shall be a citizen at birth including ""a person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than five years, at least two of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years."" Our ruling Cruz said: ""It has been the law since the beginning of the country that the children of American citizens born ... abroad are American citizens by birth."" From 1790 on, federal law has held that children born abroad to American citizens become citizens, provided other conditions are met. But the law wasn’t explicit about mothers conveying citizenship (how Cruz became an American at birth) until 1934. We rate this statement Mostly True.

No, 'Denali' is not a Kenyan word for 'black power'
","Critics of President Barack Obama’s decision to drop President William McKinley as the namesake of America’s tallest mountain say the move is insulting to a great president from Ohio. Anonymous social media critics point to a more hidden motive in the mountain’s new name, Denali. One image circulating on Facebook accused the president of reaching back to his Kenyan roots for inspiration, claiming that "" ‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’ "" The meme’s claim is so ridiculous that you wonder if it’s just a bad joke. To start, ""Kenyan"" is not a language. The two official languages of Kenya are English and Swahili. Neither of those languages are exclusive to one country, as Swahili is also spoken in a number of different African nations. A search of multiple Swahili dictionaries turned up no results for the word ""Denali."" As our fact-checker friends at Snopes found, the Swahili word for ""black"" is ""mweusi,"" and the Swahili word for power is ""nguvu."" That doesn’t amount to ""Denali,"" which has roots in the word ""Deenaalee"" in Koyukon, a native language of Alaska currently spoken by just 300 people. Koyukon is part of the Athabaskan language family, which also includes Navajo and several Apache languages native to the American Southwest. ""Deenaalee"" approximately translates to ""the High One,"" according to James Fall, an official at Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game, and James Kari, a linguist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Native Language Center. Obama called the name change ""a step to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives."" While the meme’s claim is ridiculous, we were able to verify that the viral image does depict the real Denali. Our ruling The meme claims "" ‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’ "" Nope. The word ""Denali"" doesn’t show up in Swahili, one of Kenya’s two national languages.

Dick Cheney slips on key nuclear treaty
","President Barack Obama may have secured the Senate votes he needs to stymie congressional opponents to the Iran nuclear deal, but the criticism remains as vigorous as ever. Former Vice President Dick Cheney predicted that the deal would ignite a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. One of the agreement’s fundamental flaws, he said, is it allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium. ""When they allow Iran to continue with enrichment, they are breaking one of the key requirements with respect to the nonproliferation treaty where enrichment has been limited to basically the weapons states,"" Cheney said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Sept. 2, 2015. ""And here we are sanctioning giving enrichment capability to the Iranians."" Given that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or NPT, was designed in part to allow countries to pursue the peaceful use of atomic energy, Cheney’s claim struck us as dubious. Ratified by the United States in 1969, the treaty’s first two articles target the spread of nuclear weapons. Nations that already have nukes promise not to help other countries acquire them, and those without nukes promise not to try and get them. The fourth article lays down the ground rules for a peaceful nuclear program: Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with articles I and II of this Treaty. National representatives to a United Nations conference in 2000 to assess the treaty added a bit more detail about the peaceful use of nuclear energy in their final report: The Conference confirms that each country’s choices and decisions in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be respected without jeopardizing its policies or international cooperation agreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and its fuel-cycle policies. Enriching uranium, as this diagram shows, is part of the nuclear fuel cycle.  Source: International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament Daryl Kimball is executive director of the Arms Control Association, an organization that favors the current deal. Kimball refutes Cheney’s statement. ""Former Vice President Cheney is incorrect in asserting that the NPT prohibits enrichment by non-nuclear weapon states,"" Kimball said. ""Article IV of the treaty does not ‘allow it,’ nor does it prohibit it.’ "" Brian Finlay, managing director of the Stimson Center, a defense policy group in Washington, also finds Cheney’s words problematic. ""He is correct to say that France, the United States, Russia, China and the United Kingdom all have enrichment capacities,"" Finlay said. ""But so do Germany, Japan, the Netherlands -- definitely not nuclear weapons states."" Finlay noted that there is debate over whether Article IV grants Iran the right to enrich uranium. Some diplomats argue it only specifically grants a right to pursue peaceful uses. Whether that includes enrichment is left vague. However, under no reading does the treaty limit enrichment to nuclear-armed states. Finlay said unambiguously, ""Cheney misspoke."" We note that Cheney is correct that the deal with Iran allows it to continue to enrich uranium. In Annex 1 of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, one section specifically addresses enrichment. The first clause states that ""Iran will keep its enrichment capacity at no more than 5060 IR-1 centrifuge machines in no more than 30 cascades in their current configurations in currently operating units at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant for 10 years."" The next clause commits Iran to a maximum level of enrichment of 3.67 percent for 15 years. There are many more details, but the point is that Iran gets to run a system to enrich uranium. For the curious, bomb-grade uranium needs to be enriched to about the 90 percent point. However, as we’ve reported before, once uranium-235 is enriched to about the 4-5 percent level, that’s about two-thirds of the work needed to get it to 90 percent. You need about 25 kilograms of that highly enriched material to make one bomb. Supporters of the deal say there are enough inspections and safeguards in place to make sure that Iran doesn’t cheat. Critics obviously think otherwise. Our ruling Cheney said that a key piece of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is that only nuclear-armed states can have enrichment programs. The text of the treaty and subsequent international conferences say otherwise. While it’s debatable whether the treaty grants nations the right to enrich, if a non-nuclear nation wants to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, the treaty doesn’t stand in the way. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC39C80>],/factchecks/2015/sep/03/dick-cheney/cheney-slips-key-nuclear-treaty/

John Kerry says Iran nuclear agreement 'never sunsets. There's no sunset in this agreement'
","President Barack Obama achieved a significant victory on Sept. 2, 2015, when enough Democratic senators announced that they would support the Iran nuclear agreement to effectively secure its passage despite the opposition of most, if not all, congressional Republicans. Earlier that day, Secretary of State John Kerry -- a key player in negotiating the agreement -- appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe as part of a back-to-back appearance with two foes of the agreement, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney, a foreign policy veteran in her own right. At one point, Kerry responded to Liz Cheney’s claim that the agreement ""sunsets,"" thus allowing Iran the relatively unfettered ability to proceed with a nuclear weapon. ""No, it never sunsets,"" Kerry said. ""There's no sunset in this agreement. There is a 10-year, extra-strong restraint on what they can do. There's a 15-year restraint on what they can do. There is a 20-year restraint. There's a 25-year restraint, which requires all their uranium to be tracked from the mine to the grave. But the Additional Protocol and the requirement to live under access and inspection is for the lifetime of this agreement. So Iran is never free to go move towards a weapon. That is just a misstatement that is repeated again and again and again by the opponents."" We thought we’d take a closer look at Kerry’s claim that nuclear agreement with Iran ""never sunsets. There's no sunset in this agreement."" What a denial of 'sunsets' overlooks Generally speaking, we found that Kerry’s description includes elements of both truth and spin -- as do the arguments made by the deal’s opponents that prompted Kerry to make this claim. On the one hand, Kerry’s vigorous denial that any sunsets exist ""in this agreement"" is not entirely accurate. As Kerry himself subsequently points out, a number of provisions of the agreement expire over time. Several provisions last for 10 years, including a limit of 5,060 operating centrifuges and curbs on research and development on advanced centrifuges. Other provisions last for 15 years, including a variety of caps on uranium enrichment, international inspector access in no more than 24 days, and prohibitions on new heavy-water reactors and reprocessing. Meanwhile, continuous surveillance of centrifuge production areas would last for 20 years, while continuous surveillance of uranium mines and mills would last for 25 years. Each of these time-limited provisions -- which collectively form important bulwarks of the agreement -- would seem to qualify as ""sunsets"" by any reasonable definition. In a statement to PolitiFact, State Department spokesperson John Kirby argued that it’s more important to focus on the entirety of the agreement and its goal of keeping a nuclear weapon out of Iranian hands. He pointed to paragraph 2 of the main text of the agreement, which says, ""The full implementation of this (agreement) will ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme."" ""Note that there is no time limit on that,"" Kirby said. ""And in the very next paragraph, the agreement states, ‘Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.’ While some of the specific measures within the deal are time-limited, the entirety of the deal is what keeps Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon."" Where Kerry has a point Meanwhile, critics of the agreement have also gone too far by implying, and sometimes outright stating, that the deal’s leverage will almost entirely dissipate once certain elements of the agreement expire. After the expirations occur, ""the mullahs can crank up their nuclear program at will and produce as much enriched uranium as they want,"" wrote columnist Charles Krauthammer when key details from the eventual deal were released last February. ""Sanctions lifted. Restrictions gone. Nuclear development legitimized. … A few years — probably around 10 — of good behavior and Iran would be home free. The agreement thus would provide a predictable path to an Iranian bomb."" Experts, however, say this argument against the agreement is an exaggeration. Scrutiny and limits on Iran don’t simply drop to zero after 10, 15, 20 or 25 years. While a number of the particularly intrusive provisions will lapse, Iran will still be bound -- permanently -- by other curbs on its ability to produce a nuclear weapon. For starters, Iran must comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974. This commits Iran to not pursuing nuclear weapons. It must also ratify the stricter curbs contained in the ""Additional Protocol,"" which expanded the types of sites inspectors could visit on short notice. Iran signed the protocol in 2003 but quit adhering to it three years later and has never ratified it. Under the nuclear deal, Iran must ratify the Additional Protocol within eight years, or else the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany would be able to take punitive action, said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. The agreement also demands that Iran implement ""modified Code 3.1,"" which requires the country to notify the International Atomic Energy Agency when it decides to build a nuclear facility, rather than six months before introducing nuclear material, and to keep the agency informed on changes to designs of existing nuclear sites. ""Iran would have the obligation to cooperate with the IAEA in this way in perpetuity,"" Richard Nephew, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, wrote earlier this year. Iran, he wrote, ""would be expected to fulfill the normal requirements of any IAEA-inspected country, whatever those may be, at the time a deal formally concludes. … Nowhere has the United States agreed that Iran would be immunized forever more from international scrutiny after a deal eventually ends."" If Iran acted contrary to its obligations, Nephew wrote, ""this would permit the United States and its partners to respond with a range of options, up to and including the use of military force."" Such ongoing and unending scrutiny provides Kerry with support for his claim that the agreement itself ""never sunsets,"" even if individual elements of the agreement do. Matthew Bunn, a nuclear-policy expert at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, said Kerry’s claim ""seems within the bounds of normal optimism by a political figure about the position he’s arguing."" Still, Kerry’s claim could lead listeners to believe there’s more permanence in the deal than there actually is. ""Kerry’s statement that ‘there’s no sunset in this agreement’ could be interpreted to mean every aspect of the deal lasts in perpetuity,"" said Angela Canterbury, executive director of the Council for a Livable World Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. ""Had he said, ‘this deal does not sunset,’ his statement would have been more accurate."" Added Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation: ""One can make the case, as Secretary Kerry does, that the agreement never sunsets. On the other hand, its key provisions expire."" Our ruling Kerry said the nuclear agreement with Iran ""never sunsets. There's no sunset in this agreement."" He’s right that the agreement as a whole does live on, and scrutiny of Iran’s nuclear ambitions will continue indefinitely under both earlier agreements and certain provisions within the nuclear deal. But his statement glosses over the fact that a number of key elements of the agreement do expire in 10, 15, 20 or 25 years.

"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Ryan Eller']","
Jesus was 'an undocumented immigrant,' ordained minister says
","An ordained minister on a CNN panel said people should choose their words carefully when discussing immigration, because even Jesus was ""an undocumented immigrant."" The Rev. Ryan Eller, executive director of Define American, a nonprofit promoting awareness of immigration issues, told Carol Costello that word choice about the issue matters. ""Jesus was an undocumented immigrant himself when he fled to Egypt seeking persecution in his day,"" Eller said on Aug. 31, 2015. (Eller told PunditFact he meant ""escaping persecution."") ""And so the question becomes, would we call Jesus himself illegal if he were, you know, in our modern times?"" Jesus’ immigration status obviously isn’t the most important part of his personal story. But people were curious if this piece of trivia holds up. In short, it doesn’t. The world in which Jesus lived was all a part of the Roman Empire, not necessarily a collection of separate sovereign nations. That makes it hard to call baby Jesus an illegal anything. What did Jesus do? Eller told PunditFact his comment was more about putting the plight of Jesus in the perspective of the modern world, not the bureaucratic details of his time. ""Jesus was clearly an immigrant, and fled violence in his day,"" Eller said. ""Many undocumented American immigrants have fled the most violent and desperate situations on the planet in search of survival and a better life."" In the context of modern boundaries, border crossings between Israel and Egypt these days are contentious, but mostly because Israel aims to stop migrants and terrorists from coming into the country. Israel in 2013 erected a fence on the Egyptian border to reduce illegal migration. Egypt also has been working to prevent smugglers from moving people into Gaza. These days, it would indeed be difficult to move back and forth between the two countries easily without approval. But back to Jesus: The biblical account of what happened right after his birth is described in the gospel of Matthew, with some details provided in the gospel of Luke. Luke 2:1-5 says Joseph lived in Nazareth with Mary, who was pregnant with Jesus, when the Roman emperor called for all the residents of the empire to be counted and taxed. Joseph left for Bethlehem, where King David had been born, because Joseph had roots there. Anyone who celebrates Christmas is pretty aware what happened in Bethlehem, but Eller is referring to what happened after that. Matthew 2:12-16 describes how the Magi visited Jesus, then were warned by God in a dream not to tell King Herod, who wanted to kill the child. Joseph then took Mary and Jesus to Egypt. According to Matthew, Herod then had every male child in Bethlehem younger than 2 killed. Verses 17-23 say Joseph moved the family back to Nazareth after Herod died. That’s what the Bible says, but the historical context matters. To be clear, the Herodian Kingdom did largely correspond to what we now know as modern-day Israel. It was a client state subservient to the Roman Empire, ruled by Herod the Great, who had been appointed king by the Roman Senate. Egypt, or Aegyptus, was a Roman province and run by a prefect appointed by the emperor. There were many administrative vagaries among the vast territory Rome controlled at the time, but experts told us one thing was clear: Anyone who lived in the empire could pretty much go wherever they wanted. Well, as long as they paid their taxes. Clifford Ando, professor of classics, history and law at the University of Chicago, said historical accounts of the period offer an incomplete picture. But for the most part, we can say the empire did not restrict movement in a way comparable to requiring paperwork to cross provinces. There were customs stations in ports and on roads to tax goods, but nothing like a border patrol. ""Rome did think of itself as keeping loose track of the borders of the empire, and of course it took a periodic census, and so did loosely record where people resided and owned property once a cycle,"" Ando said. ""That's not the same thing as saying you couldn't move."" By the second century C.E., subjects moving to a new province were required to register with the government, he said, but only if they planned to settle there. That likely was not what Joseph had in mind after being warned by God to flee to Egypt. Even though many scholars don’t agree on the exact years Jesus was born or moved to Nazareth as a youth, we know the family left Egypt after Herod the Great died in 4 B.C.E. The region known as Judaea (where Bethlehem was) became a Roman province in 6 C.E., after Rome removed Herod’s son Archelaus, who had become king of that portion of Herod’s kingdom. Nazareth, meanwhile, was in Galilee, an area later ruled by Herod’s son Antipas, known as the king who eventually beheaded John the Baptist. Charles Cochran, senior pastor at First Christian Church in Charleroi, Pa., said the Bible is full of scripture that illustrates the idea of accepting others as they are and helping those in need. But Eller’s description of Jesus and his family as comparable to undocumented immigrants was too much of a stretch, he said.   ""Joseph had to be cautious, but the caution had nothing to do with immigration status,"" Cochran said. ""It was much more like sneaking across the Georgia-Alabama line than across the Rio Grande."" Our ruling Eller said, ""Jesus was an undocumented immigrant."" He was making the point that Jesus and his family had to escape to a new land to avoid danger, as immigrant families sometimes do. In a historical context, however, Herod’s kingdom and the province of Egypt were ultimately governed by the Roman Empire, and weren’t separate nations as we know them now. Experts said there were likely very few, if any, restrictions on movement between the two, making the situation more akin to fleeing a state than another country. We rate Eller’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7A6D00>],/factchecks/2015/sep/03/ryan-eller/jesus-was-undocumented-immigrant-ordained-minister/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Did Donald Trump propose the biggest tax hike in American history as Jeb Bush says?
","Republican candidates continue to attack Donald Trump on his past positions, claiming he is not the conservative he says he is today. Jeb Bush picked up the attack by taking on Trump over tax policy.  ""I cut taxes every year,"" Bush said at an Aug. 20 rally in New Hampshire. ""He’s proposed the largest tax increase in mankind’s history, not just our own country’s history."" The next day Bush repeated the basic claim in a fundraising email: ""Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history."" Seems like something worth fact-checking. Trump’s tax plan in 1999 A spokesman for Bush told us that the former Florida governor was referring to Trump’s 1999 proposal to raise taxes on the rich. Trump, who at the time was considering a run for president under the Reform Party, proposed a one-time tax on individuals and trusts with a worth of $10 million or more. Trump said the one-time tax of 14.25 percent would raise $5.7 trillion and wipe out the debt. Trump said if the rich were having trouble liquidating their assets they could pay off their tax over 10 years. The New York Daily News featured a photograph of Trump with the words, ""SOAK THE RICH."" Experts at the time bashed Trump’s plan as economically and politically unviable. ""I don't think the plan makes much economic sense,"" said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute told the New York Times in 1999. ""The fact is that most people's wealth that has been built up over 10, 20 or 50 years is wealth that has already been taxed."" Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in 1999 said of Trump’s plan at the time, ""The lunacy of this idea is almost indescribable."" He raised concerns about the economic consequences including that households would shift assets overseas to try to avoid confiscation. Trump calculated that 1 percent of Americans would pay the Trump tax. He proposed that half the savings would go toward middle-class tax cuts and the other half for Social Security. A spokeswoman for Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, Hope Hicks, wouldn’t tell us if Trump still supports that plan and said that he will release his current tax plan later in September. But in 2011, talk show host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he still supported that tax, and Trump said it was no longer viable. ""Well, at a time, it would have paid off the deficit. I mean, you wouldn't have a deficit, at that time,"" Trump said (though he confused debt and deficit). ""Unfortunately, the world has changed, today you can't do it. Today, and I'm very strongly against tax increases. And the reason I'm-"" ""So, you're no longer for that tax?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""No, no. I'm no longer for that tax, no,"" Trump said. Would Trump’s tax have broken records?  Many tax experts told us that indeed Trump’s plan would have been record-breaking in terms of revenue, but they said it was never going to happen and lacked major details. ""It certainly would have been the biggest ever simply because of its sheer size -- it was trillions of dollars,"" said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. However, ""it’s a totally crazy idea. ...  I don't think anybody was taking it seriously -- it was Donald Trump being Donald Trump."" The United States’ gross domestic product in 1999 was $9.7 trillion, so if Trump’s tax had raised $5.7 trillion, that would have been 59 percent of GDP, said Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. Federal tax hikes typically are no more than 1 percent of GDP, Edwards said. ""The Bush 1990 hike and Clinton 1993 hike were less than 1 percent of GDP over 5 years —  whereas Trump’s tax would have been 59 percent one time in one year,"" Edwards said. PolitiFact previously has looked into the largest tax increases as a percentage of GDP. Topping the list from 1940-2006 was the Revenue Act of 1942, which was about 5 percent of GDP. Richard Phillips, an expert at the Citizens for Tax Justice research group, which aims to require the wealthy to pay their fair share, said that Trump’s one-time tax proposal can’t be compared to conventional tax reform, which typically refers to taxes collected annually. ""His estimate was based on a back of the envelope calculation of total wealth of individuals with over $10 million in assets multiplied by the 14.25 percent rate,"" he said. ""There are very real questions as to whether you could plausibly tax all forms of wealth and whether wealthy individuals would be able to take action to shield large swaths of their wealth from taxation."" Additionally, Trump proposed repealing the estate tax and enacting other tax cuts using the revenue that the federal government would save by no longer paying interest on the national debt. It’s not clear how much those tax cuts would have cost and how much of the tax they would offset over time, Phillips said. Our ruling Bush said, ""Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history."" Yes, in 1999, Trump proposed a historically large one-time tax increase. Trump said the tax would have raised $5.7 trillion and wiped out the national debt. It would have applied only to the wealthiest Americans.

Santorum: UN climate head debunked widely cited 97% climate change consensus figure
","Appearing on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, GOP presidential hopeful Rick Santorum doubled down on his skepticism of man-made climate change. Santorum made two claims to back his point. First, in a large survey of climate scientists, ""57 percent don’t agree with the idea that 95 percent of the change in the climate is caused by CO2,"" according to Santorum. (We found that claim False.) Second, Santorum said that a widely cited figure of scientific consensus on climate change — 97 percent — has been debunked by the ""head"" of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, he said. ""The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists,"" he said on Aug. 28. ""Not even 97 scientists responded to that survey."" Several readers asked us to look into Santorum’s claim. His campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found that Santorum misstated both who objected to the figure and what that person objected to. From 2002 until recently, the chairman of the IPCC was climate scientist Rajendra Pachauri, who resigned from his post in February 2015. To our knowledge, neither Pachauri nor current chairman Ismail El Gizouli has criticized the 97 percent figure. Pachauri has, in fact, endorsed the notion of scientific consensus on climate change. ""By overwhelming consensus, the scientific community agrees that climate change is real,"" he said at a press conference in 2010. Santorum is likely referring to Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex who’s been a vocal critic of the 97 percent figure. He is not, as Santorum claims, the ""head"" of the IPCC, though he was the convening lead author of a chapter of the IPCC’s fifth report. He has since parted ways with the IPCC. Currently, Tol serves as an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation. That group, says Stephan Lewandowsky, a psychologist at the University of Bristol who studies the rejection of climate science, is ""the U.K.’s most prominent source of climate change denial."" The ""thin air"" quote Santorum cited is from Tol’s testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. ""I mean it is pretty clear that most of the science agrees that climate change is real and most likely human-made,"" Tol said on during a 2014 hearing on the IPCC. ""But the 97 percent is essentially pulled from thin air. It is not based on any credible research whatsoever."" Tol was specifically referring to a 2013 survey by John Cook, who studies climate communication at the University of Queensland. Cook’s study found that among over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change, 97.1 percent ""endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global phase"" and 97.2 of 1,300 authors who responded agreed with the position. Tol takes issue with Cook’s methodology. By his analysis of Cook’s data, the real figure is around 91 percent. (Cook replied critiquing Tol’s methodology and standing by his survey’s original finding of 97 percent.) ""There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans,"" Tol writes in his analysis. ""I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this."" So Santorum is talking about the wrong person. And his reference to ""a survey of 77 scientists,"" is talking about something else entirely. The study Santorum is attempting to describe is a 2009 survey by Peter Doran, a professor of earth science at Louisiana State University. About 90 percent of around 3,000 surveyed earth scientists said they think climate change is happening, and about 82 percent said human activity is contributing to it. The 97 percent figure comes from a subsample of climate scientists in Doran’s study, and Santorum correctly describes its small size: 74 out of 77 respondents said they agreed that climate change is man-made. Beyond his and Cook’s study, a 2010 study of over 1,300 climate researchers and their work also showed a 97 to 98 percent consensus. ""They keep talking about how ‘the’ 97 percent study is wrong,"" Doran told PolitiFact in an interview. ""Well it turns out, we never know which study they are referring to because there have been three peer-reviewed studies of late that have arrived at this 97 percent number in different ways and by different people."" Our ruling Santorum said, ""The 97 percent figure that’s thrown around, the head of the UN IPC (sic) said that number was pulled out of thin air. It was based on a survey of 77 scientists."" Santorum’s claim confuses several points. First, the critic of the 97 percent he’s referring to isn’t the ""head"" of the UN’s climate panel, but an economist who has collaborated with but has since left the IPCC. Second, the 97 percent doesn’t come from one specific survey — it appears in at least three. And finally, the study Santorum describes isn’t the one the economist objects to. Moreover, Tol himself doesn’t refute the notion of broad scientific consensus on man-made climate change. Santorum’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False. Correction, Sept. 3, 2015, 10:45 a.m: Cook's analysis looked at over 4,000 studies that took a position on man-made climate change.

Where do Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders stand on the death penalty?
","An image circulating on Twitter and Reddit claims Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have opposing views on a host of issues, including the death penalty. According to the image, Sanders opposes the death penalty, but Clinton supports it. We wanted to see if the two candidates disagree on capital punishment. (See our other checks on the image here.) Sanders and the death penalty The Vermont senator has been an opponent of the death penalty for his entire political career. And with one exception, he has voted against expansions of the death penalty at every turn. Sanders opposed the Violent Crime Prevention Act of 1991 during his first year in the U.S. House of Representatives. ""All over the industrialized world now, countries are saying, ‘let us put an end to state murder, let us stop capital punishment’,"" Sanders said in a 1991 speech on the House floor. ""But here what we’re talking about is more and more capital punishment."" The bill, which included provisions to authorize the death penalty as appropriate punishment for crimes involving the murder of a law enforcement officer, terrorism and drug trafficking, never reached the desk of President George H.W. Bush. In 1994, however, Sanders voted in favor of the final version of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a bill that expanded the federal death penalty. Sanders had voted for an amendment to the bill that would have replaced all federal death sentences with life in prison. Even though the amendment failed, Sanders still voted for the larger crime bill. A spokesman for Sanders said he voted for the bill ""because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons."" Sanders reiterated his opposition to capital punishment in 2015. ""I just don’t think the state itself, whether it’s the state government or federal government, should be in the business of killing people,"" he said on a radio show. Clinton and the death penalty Clinton’s campaign did not provide her stance on capital punishment.  The last time she publicly addressed capital punishment, which was 15 years ago, Clinton offered support. In her 2000 run for U.S. Senate, she was quoted by a Washington Post columnist as saying the death penalty had her ""unenthusiastic support."" Clinton’s history on the issue, however, is slightly complicated. As director of the legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas in the 1970s, Clinton helped to get the death sentence of a 20-year-old African-American man sentenced to life in prison. But according to a timeline of the case compiled by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice, Clinton’s views on the topic changed as her husband’s did. Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is described as shifting his position on the death penalty as part of an effort to present himself as a centrist ""New Democrat"" in the 1980s. Citing Paul Kengor’s 2007 book God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, the timeline says that Hillary Clinton "" ‘agonized’ over her husband’s embrace of capital punishment,"" eventually supporting it. As first lady, she supported the 1994 crime bill that Sanders opposed. After her election to U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored a bill that made it easier for prisoners on death row to appeal for exoneration through DNA testing. Clinton hasn’t yet addressed the issue in the 2016 election cycle. Our ruling The infographic claims Bernie Sanders opposes the death penalty and that Hillary Clinton supports it. Sanders has opposed the death penalty for at least the last 20 years, though he did vote for the 1994 crime bill that, among many other provisions, expanded the number of crimes that could result in death penalty sentences. While Clinton has helped make it easier to appeal a death sentence, her most recent documented statements on the topic expressed tepid support. Without a clear idea of her most recent stance, we can only assume she still holds that position.

How Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton differ on the Trans-Pacific Partnership
","A widespread Internet post claims Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have opposing views on a number of issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade deal involving the United States and 11 other nations. The image says Sanders opposes the deal, but Clinton supports it. As part of a couple of fact-checks on the post, we looked into whether the two candidates differ on support for the deal, which has divided Democratic leaders on the Hill. President Barack Obama, the deal’s primary advocate, has sparred with Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a longtime ally, and received praise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a frequent opponent, over the deal. So where do the leading Democratic presidential candidates stand on the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Sanders sides with other members of the Senate’s progressive caucus in vehemently opposing the deal. In January 2014, he said he’s against it primarily because it will allow corporations to move jobs overseas. Clinton’s position on the proposal is complicated by her time as secretary of state, and she’s been careful as a presidential candidate not to express a firm position. There’s evidence to suggest Clinton was deeply involved in the deal’s formation and promotion as the country’s lead diplomat. In 2011, she told a congressional committee that even though the State Department was not in charge of the negotiations, ""we work closely with the U.S. (Trade Representative)."" Leaked diplomatic cables show Clinton’s deputies specifically discussed the TPP with foreign heads of state. Clinton openly pushed for the deal at least 45 times during her tenure as secretary of state, according to CNN’s tally. In 2012, she touted the trade deal, also called TPP, to a group of American and Australian officials as a way to ""lower trade barriers, raise labor and environmental standards, and drive growth across the region."" But since entering the race for president, Clinton has distanced herself from those remarks. ""I did not work on TPP,"" she told reporters in July, saying the deal was ""the responsibility of the United States Trade Representative."" At times, Clinton has echoed Sanders’ concerns about outsourcing. ""Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,"" she told a reporter from MSNBC in April. ""We have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive. It's got to be really a partnership between our business, our government, our workforce, the intellectual property that comes out of our universities, and we have to get back to a much more focused effort in my opinion to try to produce those capacities here at home so that we can be competitive in a global economy."" Hopeful comments about job creation and increased wages do not signal a clear position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton’s campaign website lists no official position on the deal. Our ruling The graphic claims Bernie Sanders opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and Hillary Clinton supports it. Sanders has said on multiple occasions that he would oppose the trade deal. Clinton supported it as secretary of state, and there’s even evidence to suggest she was an advocate for the deal within the Obama administration. But she has taken a neutral stance on the deal during her campaign for the presidency, voicing some of Sanders’ same concerns yet refusing to explicitly criticize the proposal. Clinton spoke often in support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — until that backing irritated parts of her Democratic base.

Scott Walker says his actions covered everyone in poverty with Medicaid for first time ever
","Presenting his alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Gov. Scott Walker bragged that even as he refused federal money under the law to expand Medicaid, he made historic progress in insuring Wisconsin's poor. ""I turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. And I got to tell you, that was kind of tough in a blue state like Wisconsin. There were even some Republicans that wanted us to grab the money,"" Walker said Aug. 18, 2015, in a presidential campaign speech in Minnesota. ""But we turned it down because we knew how difficult it would be to repeal Obamacare -- and put patients and families back in charge of their own health care decisions -- if states were adding to it, were expanding underneath it. ""In my state,"" Walker continued, ""even without taking that expansion, we showed that we could get results. I’m proud to say the state of Wisconsin, for the first time in our history -- first time in our history -- everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid."" As we'll see, everyone in Wisconsin who is living in poverty -- at least, based on the federal poverty level -- is now covered by Medicaid. But Walker accomplished that by taking advantage of another provision of Obamacare -- pushing less-poor people off of Medicaid and into the marketplace that was set up under the law, albeit with subsidies to buy coverage. Moreover, his move meant Wisconsin has passed up more than $550 million in federal money, putting an additional burden on Wisconsin taxpayers. Turning down federal funds Walker’s Obamacare alternative was his first major policy initiative as a presidential candidate. It was criticized by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a fellow GOP contender for the White House, as offering a ""new entitlement"" for every American. We rated that claim Half True. Walker’s plan offers an entitlement -- tax credits to help people who aren’t offered coverage by an employer. But the credits aren’t exactly new, and they’re not available to everyone. The main intent of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, meanwhile, was to expand coverage to the uninsured in two ways: through tax credits similar to those in Walker’s plan to help moderate-income people buy insurance in the marketplace; and by expanding Medicaid for low-income people, including those with incomes somewhat above the federal poverty level. That Medicaid expansion is what Walker references in his claim about insuring Wisconsin’s poor. The Obamacare Medicaid expansion Medicaid provides health coverage to some 72 million Americans, including 1 million people in Wisconsin. Low-income adults, as well as children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities, are eligible. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government, but is administered by the states. Under Obamacare, the federal government agreed to pay 100 percent of the Medicaid expansion cost for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2012, however, said states could opt out of the expansion -- and 19 states, including Wisconsin, have done so, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. When he announced in February 2013 that Wisconsin would reject the Obamacare expansion, Walker explained his decision in part by contending that the nation's growing debt would prevent the government from paying for the expansion in the future. Indeed, a year later he claimed that ""federal government reneging"" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin had caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-’15 state budget. We rated that claim False. Typical state-federal cost-sharing fluctuations -- not any reversal on a commitment by Washington -- led to higher costs for Wisconsin.    So, what did Walker do instead of accepting the extra Obamacare money to expand Medicaid eligibility? Walker’s alternative As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, Walker became the only governor in the country who used the Affordable Care Act to expand access to health insurance while turning down the additional federal dollars available to pay for it. Most of Walker’s fellow Republican governors opted not to expand their Medicaid programs through the law, thereby creating a ""coverage gap"" -- some 4 million people nationwide with incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for premium tax credits to buy insurance in the marketplace. Despite rejecting the federal money, Walker still expanded Wisconsin's Medicaid program, and 145,000 people have gained coverage as a result. Wisconsin is the only state, according to Kaiser, without a so-called coverage gap. Now, childless adults with an income below the federal poverty level — $11,770 — are eligible for BadgerCare Plus, the state's largest Medicaid program. But adults with incomes above the federal poverty level -- including an estimated 57,000 previously covered by BadgerCare Plus -- are no longer eligible for Medicaid. They can buy subsidized private health insurance in the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act. It’s important to note that the federal poverty level is a benchmark. Arguably, few people would contend that someone with an income of $11,770 a year was living in poverty, while someone with an income slightly above that was not. Moreover, Walker’s expansion comes with a higher cost to state taxpayers. The left-leaning Urban Institute estimates that accepting the federal Obamacare dollars to expand Medicaid would have saved $2.5 billion in state dollars from 2015 through 2024. To put it another way, Wisconsin would spend 5 percent less on Medicaid, or an average of $250 million less per year. Our rating Walker said he ""turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,"" but because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history ""everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid."" Under changes made by Walker, everyone in Wisconsin with an annual income at the federal poverty level ($11,770 for a single person) is now eligible for Medicaid. That is the first time in Wisconsin that everyone at or below the federal poverty level is eligible for Medicaid. But it's important to note that, while Walker rejected the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid, he used another provision of Obamacare to move less poor people off of Medicaid and into the marketplace created by Obamacare. And Wisconsin has already passed up more than $550 million in federal money, putting an additional burden on state taxpayers. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEA6440>],/factchecks/2015/sep/02/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-covered-everyone-poverty-medi/

But in a recent report, Melissa Johnson, a policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said the Peach State has the ninth highest rate of adults, ages 18 to 64, without a high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED. We’re talking about roughly 866,000 working age Georgians, Johnson said. Disturbing? Yes. Accurate? PolitiFact decided to do some checking. We reached out to Georgia Budget & Policy Institute spokesman John McCosh, who told us the statistics Johnson cited came from the Working Poor Families Project, an initiative funded by the Ford Foundation, Annie Casey Foundation and others.  We contacted the project’s Brandon Roberts, who walked us through a report the organization publishes annually and concluded Johnson’s numbers were accurate . The project’s report, Roberts said, is based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the widely recognized Population Reference Bureau. For 2013, it showed that about 865,706 -- or 13.7 percent of Georgians --  ages 18 to 64 -- lacking either a high school diploma or GED. Eight states had fewer working-age high school graduates  -- Alabama, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas, according to the analysis. California ranked the lowest, with 17 percent of its 18- to 64-year-olds failing to have completed high school or having passed the equivalency test, the data from the Working Poor Families Project showed. College and career readiness has become a key focal point in public education, and with reason. Researchers say the percentage of jobs requiring a high school diploma or less fell from 72 percent in 1973 to 40 percent in 2007. By 2018, it’s expected to be 30 percent, and the people who land those jobs may not be able to sustain a family on their salaries. Gov. Nathan Deal set a goal in 2011 of having an additional 250,000 Georgians with post-secondary school credentials -- an associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree or higher - by 2020. University officials have been making a big push in that direction and still, as evidence of the challenges, there’s talk of the deadline being moved back to 2025. We found other data that make a similar case. For example, the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement reported in 2013 that, as of 2010, 16 percent of Georgia adults -- 984,740 -- lacked a high school diploma or GED. The agency also reported that 5.9 percent of all Georgians -- or 618,820 residents -- had less than a ninth grade education and that 55 percent of Georgia’s inmates (the fifth highest inmate population in the country) did not at that time have either a high school diploma or GED. We also spoke to Dana Rickman and Steve Dolinger at the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education. Rickman, the nonprofit’s policy and research director, said she had not made an in-depth review of Johnson’s report but said the ranking of Georgia as ninth from the bottom in percentage of people, 18 to 64, with high school degrees/GEDs, ""seems reasonable."" Although Georgia’s four-year high school graduation rate has been climbing, up from 68 percent in 2011 to 73 percent in 2014, it’s still among the nation’s lowest, Rickman said. The state has looked better in the past decade or two because it has been a big importer of people with college degrees, especially in the Atlanta area, she said. ""We’re importing adult talent, so it makes sense to me that we’d be about ninth,"" she said. That trend may have slowed a little since the Recession, said Dolinger, the partnership’s president and a former county school superintendent. He and Rickman said multiple initiatives have been launched  -- everything from trying to simultaneously raise rigor and graduate rates in high schools to closely tracking college students so they stay in school and focused on completion of a degree or certificate program. ""We were part of Complete College America, which we coined Complete College Georgia, and that was helpful,"" Dolinger said. ""Now there are two new pieces, Go Back Move Ahead, to get kids who have some college to go back and complete, and the new legislation, Move on When Ready. Those are to help the kids stay in school or go back."" Georgia State University and Chattahoochee Tech are working to be models of how to track and retain students, he said. Part of College Georgia also allows some credits for life skills, an incentive for someone considering returning to college,  Rickman said. Dolinger said he believes ""the trend is that we’re doing better. ""The problem is that the states that are doing better - up in the top 10 -- are sure not waiting on us to catch them,"" he said. Our conclusion Johnson’s report states that Georgia has the 9th highest rate of adults, ages 18 to 64, without a high school diploma or GED. She based the statement on a report from the  Working Poor Families Project, an initiative funded by the Ford Foundation, Annie Casey Foundation and others, and drawn from research that the organization has produced annually based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau information.  That’s about 865,706 -- or 13.7 percent of Georgians --  ages 18 to 64 -- lacking either a high school diploma or GED. We found slightly different data for different years, but that pointed out Johnson’s overarching point that Georgia has a large problem. We rate Johnson’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBDED80>],/factchecks/2015/sep/02/melissa-johnson/report-accurate-about-georgias-low-diploma-rate/

"['Florida', 'Coronavirus', 'Marco Rubio']","
Did China halt exports of face masks to US?
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., casts some blame on China for the U.S. struggle to obtain crucial medical supplies amid COVID-19. Writing in the New York Times, Rubio accused China of using the world’s supply chain of medical gear to benefit itself during the coronavirus outbreak: ""Having monopolized those critical supply chains, the Chinese Communist Party pointed them inward. It ensured that face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus. Largely unable to import supplies from China, America has been left scrambling because we by and large lack the ability to make things, as well as the state capacity needed for reorienting production to do so. As a result, doctors are forced to ration supplies and, in some cases, cease using necessary protective equipment."" There are clear problems in the U.S. medical supply chain. A mad dash for masks and other supplies has created logistical hurdles and frenzied dealmaking in the global market, including in China.  And Rubio’s concerns about the U.S. relying on China for supplies are not new. He raised them more than a year ago. ""Although American pharmaceutical firms face short-term commercial opportunities in China, the U.S. runs the risk of losing important components of its medical supply chain to China’s government-backed industry,"" Rubio wrote in a report in February 2019. But in his op-ed, Rubio overstates the problem with Chinese imports and ignores some key factors — including that imports were declining before COVID-19 as a result of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. ""Sen. Rubio’s comment is typical of ‘bash China’ remarks, but inaccurate,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""China is exporting millions of masks."" We reached out to spokespersons for Rubio and did not receive a response. There were fears that China would not export critical medical supplies to the U.S. as COVID-19 cases ramped up. China produces much of the world’s protective medical equipment. There was a dip, but the exports did continue. China’s exports of protective medical equipment to the U.S. declined by 19% in January and February, compared with the same period last year. All other products fell by a far greater amount: 28%, according to an analysis by Chad Bown at the Peterson Institute. ""We imported less from them for these products than we did last year, but some of that is economics: They have more demand for these things internally, so they had less of an ability to export them to the world,"" Bown told PolitiFact. New export restrictions by China also created logjams. Officials in China said the restrictions were imposed to ensure quality, but U.S. companies said they were facing bottlenecks, the Wall Street Journal reported. In February, the United States was focused on exporting supplies to China to fight the crisis.  The drop in imports of masks from China is not related only to COVID-19. Rubio’s op-ed did not mention the Trump administration’s increase on tariffs for various goods from China in 2018-19. That also affects imports of medical supplies. In 2018, Matt Rowan, president of the Health Industry Distributors Association, warned that proposed tariffs would drive up health care costs. The products ""are used widely throughout health care settings and are a critical component of our nation's response to public health emergencies, such as Ebola,"" he said at a federal government hearing. The tariff hikes for personal protective equipment and other supplies went through in September 2019 despite such warnings. U.S. imports of masks, respirators and gloves from China fell following the tariff increases. In March 2020, the federal government established a temporary exclusion for masks.  ""In other words, the fall in imports from China is largely a self-imposed wound,"" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist and trade expert who is also a Peterson fellow. The decrease in imports followed the shutdown of manufacturing regions in China in the country, she said. The U.S. government has tried to increase the flow of supplies from China, including authorizing the use of a Chinese version of N95 masks. One more point: The U.S. has imported masks and other supplies from China in recent weeks. On March 29, Trump announced an operation called Project Air Bridge to bring medical supplies from overseas. The project’s first flight came from China on March 29 and brought millions of supplies, including 130,000 N95 masks.  Project Air Bridge has delivered more than 760,000 N95 masks, 600 million gloves, 52 million surgical masks in addition to other supplies including surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesperson said. Those supplies came from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, India, Honduras and Mexico.  From China alone, there have been over 133 million units of imported N95 masks, gloves, surgical masks, surgical gowns, thermometers and face shields, FEMA said. Some states have arranged their own imported masks or other supplies from China. Rubio said ""face masks being manufactured in China, for example, went to domestic consumption and their own fight against the virus"" while the U.S. was ""largely unable to import supplies from China."" China did have a greater need for its domestically manufactured masks in February as the virus ravaged the country, but Rubio greatly overstates the situation. Imports of masks from China to the U.S. did drop in January and February, but imports of other products dropped even more. Imports to the U.S. did occur in April through the federal government’s Project Air Bridge, and a few states arranged their own imports with the help of other entities.

No, Democrats aren’t pushing microchips to fight coronavirus
","Is the coronavirus pandemic going to force Americans to undergo microchip implants? What about mandatory vaccinations? That’s what a Facebook post says. ""The Democrats are pushing for an implanted microchip in humans, and everyone to be vaccinated."" says a Facebook post with text on a plain background. ""These are words of war to me!""  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is unsupported. We found no evidence of proposals or legislation, Democratic or otherwise, to promote implanting microchips to counter the coronavirus.  Not that this would even make sense as a solution to coronavirus. Even the smallest microchips ""are rather large, such that none would ever fit into a vaccine needle — these are very small-bore needles,"" Wilbur Chen, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, previously told PolitiFact. Other fact-checkers have traced the assertion in the Facebook post to an inaccurate interpretation of comments made by Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist who has focused his efforts on global health. On March 18, Gates took part in a forum on Reddit in which he was asked, ""What changes are we going to have to make to how businesses operate to maintain our economy while providing social distancing?"" Gates responded, ""The question of which businesses should keep going is tricky. Certainly, food supply and the health system. We still need water, electricity and the internet. Supply chains for critical things need to be maintained. Countries are still figuring out what to keep running. Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it."" The website Biohackinfo.com soon posted a story on Gates’ comments headlined, ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus."" It included the line that by ""‘digital certificates,’ Gates was referring to implantable ‘QUANTUM-DOT TATTOOS.'"" This misinterpretation was amplified on April 13, when Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, told radio host Joe Piscopo, ""Whether Bill Gates played some role in the creation and spread of this virus is open for vigorous debate. I have conservative friends who say it’s ridiculous, and others say absolutely."" But, Stone added, Gates ""and other globalists are using it for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people so we know if they’ve been tested. Over my dead body. Mandatory vaccinations? No way, Jose!"" This conversation was spread further by coverage in the New York Post and the Russian news service RT, according to BuzzFeed.  None of this is correct.  ""Digital certificates"" are electronic information used to securely communicate over the internet, and Gates never mentioned microchips. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told FactCheck.org that Gates was referring to digital certificates as part of an effort to create a system of home-based, self-administered testing for COVID-19 that would involve a secure connection with health officials. Meanwhile, unrelated research funded by the Gates Foundation proposed recording  vaccination history on a patient’s skin using an invisible dye that could be read by a smartphone and last up to five years. Kevin McHugh, a Rice University bioengineering professor who worked on the study, told Reuters, ""The quantum dot dye technology is not a microchip or human-implantable capsule, and to my knowledge there are no plans to use this for coronavirus."" There are legitimate concerns about privacy in some of the contact-tracing methods being considered to prevent the spread of coronavirus, experts say. However, ""the fear of insertion of tracking chips and other things like that into our bodies has been a longstanding bogeyman,"" said Mark Fenster, a law professor at the University of Florida who has written extensively about conspiracy theories. ""There is a lot of tracking that goes on, but the suggestion that it’s being used in this manner and this way seems absurd."" This part of the claim isn’t as far-fetched. Many Democrats and some Republicans do support narrowing exemptions to mandatory vaccinations based on personal beliefs. States have had the authority to require vaccinations for more than a century, and they use that authority all the time, with certain exceptions allowed. In the 1905 case Jacobson vs. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that a mandatory-vaccination law was a legitimate exercise of state power to protect public health and safety. Since that decision, every state has instituted a variety of vaccine requirements, usually for school-age children. All but five states have exceptions for non-medical reasons. Some are for religious exemptions, some are for ""personal beliefs,"" and some are for both. (The National Conference of State Legislatures has the full list.) In the past several years, certain states, led in many cases by Democratic lawmakers but often with some bipartisan support, have moved to limit the religious- or personal-belief exemptions to vaccinations. This came amid concerns about outbreaks of measles and other diseases that were believed to stem from growing opposition to vaccination. Ultimately, several states narrowed exemptions in 2019, including California, Maine, New York and Washington. They did so over the opposition of groups on the right and left who are skeptical of the value of vaccinations, a perspective the medical community strongly opposes. (Read our analysis of complaints about the safety of vaccines.) The precedent set by Jacobson vs. Massachusetts continues to be cited, three academic experts at Boston University — Wendy K. Mariner, George J. Annas, and Leonard H. Glantz — have written in the American Journal of Public Health. ""A law that authorizes mandatory vaccination during an epidemic of a lethal disease, with refusal punishable by a monetary penalty, like the one at issue in Jacobson, would undoubtedly be found constitutional under the low constitutional test of ‘rationality review,’"" the co-authors wrote, as long as regulators determined the vaccine was safe and effective. Even without an ongoing epidemic, they added, such a requirement ""would probably be upheld"" as long as the disease was still spreading to some degree and as long as the vaccine was safe.  The federal government could theoretically impose stronger mandates, but it has not done so, Richard Hughes IV, a vaccine specialist at Avalere Health, wrote in the journal Health Affairs. The federal government could do this through a law pre-empting state policies or by using federal funding as leverage against the states, Hughes wrote. But Mariner said she’s doubtful about this scenario, and there is no evidence of legislation of this type for now. A Facebook post says, ""The Democrats are pushing for an implanted microchip in humans, and everyone to be vaccinated."" On microchips, there’s no evidence that implanted microchips are being contemplated in a serious way to fight the coronavirus. This appears to stem from a warped translation of comments by Gates. As for mandatory vaccinations, the idea that Democrats are pushing for this power is exaggerated, because the Supreme Court long ago decided that the government has that power. This authority is now used in all 50 states. A minority that includes some Democrats and some Republicans oppose efforts to limit religious or personal exemptions.

Joe Biden conflates tests on the market with Americans tested
","While President Donald Trump has lauded increased testing for COVID-19, his rival Joe Biden said the administration has failed to deliver on its promises. ""The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. As of now, only 4 million have been completed,"" Biden tweeted April 21. The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It’s unacceptable.We can’t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can’t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job. Tests play a huge role in managing the COVID-19 crisis and planning for the recovery. Health experts say that the country needs a massive increase in testing before states can reopen businesses and schools, although some governors are already moving in that direction. The U.S. has lacked a national widespread testing program, a result of early missteps and a lack of capacity and supplies. Is the Trump administration really short on its March promise by 23 million tests?  We found that Biden’s tweet conflates the number of tests the Trump administration said would be on the market with the number of people who have been tested. About 4 million people in the U.S. have been tested as of April 21, according to Johns Hopkins University. The 27 million number comes from a White House briefing March 21. A reporter asked about the number of available tests. Brett Giroir, who is overseeing testing for the federal government, responded: ""So, from March 2 to March 14, we have put over 10 million laboratory tests into the U.S. commercial market, and we expect that, by March 28, to be well over 27 million into the market. So that answers your question."" But Giroir said that was the wrong question to ask because not every lab can run every test. ""So, the more important question is not how many tests are in the market — we got them in the market — but it’s to make sure that every segment of the market has the kind of test that they can use,"" said Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Giroir’s figure of over 27 million referred to how many tests he said would be in the market — not how many people would be tested.  Earlier in the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence brought up the number of Americans tested, which he said was around 210,000. ""The White House was clear that these were two separate numbers,"" Zack Parkinson, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told PolitiFact. Parkinson said that Giroir didn’t make a ""promise"" on the 27 million tests. We will leave it up to readers to decide. About one month later, Giroir was asked about the 27 million number at a White House briefing. The reporter’s question sounded a lot like what Biden later tweeted: ""On March 24 — March 21, the administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. So far, roughly 4 million people have been tested. So where are the other 23 million or so tests? Did they not materialize? Are they in the pipeline? Help us understand that discrepancy.""  Giroir replied that he was referring to tests in the marketplace. ""So if you want to use those metrics, there’s been over 40 million ‘in the marketplace.’ But we have an end-to-end issue that we needed to deal with, and that’s what we’ve been dealing with: the swabs, the transport media,"" Giroir said April 20. ""We have some of our main platforms that are only 10% being utilized,"" he continued. ""You could have a lot of tests in the market, and those are correct numbers, but if the machines aren’t utilizing them and they’re not organized at that level, then they’re not being utilized to its fullest."" In other words, it takes more than simply having the test kit available to perform and process the tests. Trump has overstated the scope of U.S. testing multiple times. He said that people were being tested getting on and off airplanes and that anybody can get a test, statements we rated Pants on Fire. Trump has portrayed the tests as readily available, but several governors say that they aren’t getting enough swabs and reagents to administer large-scale testing.  And Trump has sometimes talked about millions of tests without specifying that he was referring to testing kits. ""We have now a great system and it’s almost fully in gear, but it’s able to test millions of people,"" Trump said March 20. At the time, about 140,000 people had been tested, according to the COVID Tracking Project.  Biden tweeted, ""The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. As of now, only 4 million have been completed."" Biden conflated two different metrics: the number of projected available tests in the market and the number of people in the U.S. actually tested.  On March 21, a Trump administration official said he expected well over 27 million tests in the marketplace by March 28. As of April 21, about 4 million people had been tested. The statement is partially accurate but omits critical context.

"['Environment', 'Public Health', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Is Pelosi right that EPA said its new rule on air pollutants would harm public health?
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that as Americans grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump’s administration has weakened public health protections. ""While tens of thousands of Americans are dying from the coronavirus pandemic, the president is yet again seeking to unleash toxic pollution and dirty air into our communities,"" Pelosi said April 16. ""Even President Trump’s own EPA has admitted that this rule threatens to cause serious health problems including brain damage and death and to inflict billions of dollars of economic damage on our struggling economy."" Pelosi referenced an April 16 decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to change how it evaluates the benefits and costs of regulating hazardous air pollutants from power plants fired by coal and oil. The agency concluded that the economic benefits of reducing mercury emissions under an Obama-era rule do not outweigh the costs to the power plants of complying with the rules. PolitiFact looked into Pelosi’s claim that even Trump’s EPA said the new rule would be bad for public health and cost billions of dollars. The facts are more nuanced than Pelosi said. The main pollutant at issue is mercury due to its impact on public health. When mercury released into the air by power plants reaches bodies of water, it is converted by micro-organisms into methylmercury, a highly toxic substance that builds up in fish.  The most common way people are exposed to mercury is by eating fish contaminated with methylmercury. Some fish have higher levels of mercury that, when consumed, can be harmful to an unborn child, a young child’s developing nervous system, the elderly, people with underlying health conditions, and people who eat a lot of fish. The EPA regulates emissions of air toxics from coal- and oil-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act. The Obama administration added Mercury and Air Toxic Standards that set federal air pollution limits for power plants, seeking to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants.  The Obama administration estimated that the standards would prevent, annually, up to 11,000 premature deaths, more than 100,000 asthma attacks, about 4,700 heart attacks, reduce hospital and emergency room visits, and hundreds of thousands of days missed from work due to illness. It projected that the compliance cost to the power plant industry would be about $9.6 billion a year, while the financial value of air quality improvements could range from $37 billion to $90 billion annually. The benefits calculation under the Obama administration included ""co-benefits,"" which occur when regulation compliance also reduces a pollutant that is not the rule’s primary target. The vast majority of the financial benefits came from a reduction of particulate matter, which can lead to serious health problems. The direct quantified benefit of reducing mercury alone — the intended target — was up to $6 million a year. The Trump administration reviewed analyses done by the Obama administration and decided to take ""co-benefits"" out of the equation. Ultimately, it said that the financial benefits of the Obama rule totaled $4 million to $6 million annually (when accounting for reduction of mercury alone), while the annual cost of compliance was $7.4 billion to $9.6 billion. As a result, the EPA under Trump said it ""determined that it is not ‘appropriate and necessary’ to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act."" The rule limiting emission of mercury and air toxics remained in place. The objection Pelosi is talking about stems from a report by the EPA’s Science Advisory Board. The board is an independent committee that advises the EPA administrator on the information that is used to develop the agency’s rules. Board members serve as special government employees, but their views do not reflect the views of the EPA, an agency spokesperson told us.  On April 9, the board advised the EPA to do a new assessment on mercury’s impact. It said that the assessment from Trump’s EPA was not all-encompassing and did not take into consideration prior board recommendations. The report was logged before the agency announced the final rule. The board said it was a departure from the norm for the EPA to ""categorically"" exclude co-benefits. The move went against both the EPA’s guidance on economic analysis and recommendations of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.  The EPA reviewed links between methylmercury and brain damage, but the board said the agency should do a new risk assessment that also accounted for mercury’s impact on cardiovascular health. The EPA’s assessment on exposure to methylmercury excluded commercial fish — such as fish purchased at restaurants or supermarkets, even though it accounts for 90% of the fish consumed by Americans, the report said. ""For this or any future regulation, the EPA should prepare a new exposure estimate that accounts for total exposure,"" the report said. Michael Honeycutt, chair of the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, said the board did have concerns with how the EPA did its analysis, but it’s difficult to definitively confirm whether the EPA's new rule would lead to serious health problems, death and billions of dollars of expense. ""The EPA would need to re-do a risk assessment and take into account our recommendations,"" said Honeycutt, who also is director of the Toxicology Division of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Other experts said Pelosi was right to infer that the EPA’s change would be detrimental to public health and cost billions annually. ""The report does not use those precise words, but it is reasonable to infer that the SAB believes that the new rule is ill advised,"" said Patrick Parenteau, a law professor and senior counsel in the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Clinic at Vermont Law School. He said it was also reasonable to infer that the rule would increase the risk of diseases and that the total benefits of reducing pollutants would ""more than offset the costs of pollution controls."" The practical effect of the new procedure is unclear, he said, because it likely will be challenged in court or a new administration may repeal it. Pelosi said, ""Even President Trump’s own EPA has admitted that this rule (on air pollutants) threatens to cause serious health problems including brain damage and death and to inflict billions of dollars of economic damage on our struggling economy."" Trump did not overrule his own EPA, the agency rather did not adhere to recommendations from a science advisory board. The advisory board told the EPA it had concerns with how the agency did a risk assessment and said it should do a new one. The chair of the advisory board said that in the absence of a new assessment, it was difficult to say definitively whether the rule would have the impact Pelosi said. Other experts say that while the report did not outright say what Pelosi stated, it was accurate to infer that the rule changes could pose serious health risks for Americans.

Rochester mayor lacked context on coronavirus’ racial disparities
","As the coronavirus spreads across the country, officials are taking increasing notice of patterns of infections and deaths among people of different races.  In some states, provisional data through April 21 collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed disproportionately high rates of death from coronavirus among African Americans in Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, and Wisconsin. Experts have suggested that a variety of factors may be responsible, including disparities in income and health insurance and a higher rate of pre-existing conditions. The question of racial disparities in coronavirus impact came up during an April 8 news conference with Lovely Warren, the mayor of Rochester, N.Y.  Warren opened the press conference by saying, ""I'm going to answer some questions you have regarding disparities across the country happening in the African American community as it pertains to the coronavirus and the number of deaths and the number of people being diagnosed with it."" A reporter asked, ""What are we seeing locally here in Rochester? How badly is Rochester being impacted, especially the minority population?"" Warren responded, ""We are not seeing, at a high rate, that level of disparity right now,"" Warren said. ""We do believe if we do not change the social distancing, if we do not stay at home, we will see the level of disparity that we see across the country. … Today we are basically on par, a little bit up, from the population numbers, but we don’t see that disparity as much here in Monroe County as we’re seeing across the country."" However, the disparities were already evident on the day Warren held the press conference. On the same day as the press conference, the Monroe County Department of Health released the racial and ethnic breakdown of coronavirus hospitalizations in the county, both in non-intensive care units and ICUs, as well as deaths from the virus. Here’s a summary of that data:   The health department data shows that for African Americans, the percentage of deaths from coronavirus was slightly higher than their share of the population -- African American residents accounted for 18.2% of deaths, compared to 16.2% of the county’s overall population. That was in line with Warren’s comment. However, the hospitalization rates for African Americans in the county were significantly higher. African Americans accounted for 27.9% of the non-ICU hospitalizations in the county and 53.8% of ICU hospitalizations. Meanwhile, non-ICU hospitalizations were disproportionately high for Hispanics -- 18.6% of such hospitalizations, compared to an overall 9% share of the population. Warren did acknowledge this fact in passing later in her press conference, saying, ""What we do know is that people in the ICU, people of color, are in the ICU at a higher rate than other folks."" However, on multiple occasions during the press conference she referred to the disparities as minor.  Justin Roj, the mayor’s director of communications and special events, said Warren stands by her statement. A footnote: Subsequent data has shown that the racial disparity has grown. Here’s a look at the data through April 17:   The data shows that through April 17, African American hospitalization rates had grown to 67% of ICU hospitalizations and 39% of non-ICU hospitalization rates. And the share of deaths represented by African Americans rose to 24%, which exceeds African Americans’ 16% share of the county’s population. Meanwhile, Hispanics have accounted for 22% of ICU hospitalizations, which is more than double their 9% of the population. Referring to racial comparisons on coronavirus statistics in Monroe County, N.Y., Warren said the impact on minorities is ""basically on par, a little bit up, from the population numbers,"" meaning that ""we don’t see that disparity as much here."" That was essentially accurate when looking at the share of deaths from the coronavirus. But at the time of her comment, African Americans accounted for a significantly higher share of ICU and non-ICU hospitalizations in the county, and the same was the case for Hispanics and non-ICU hospitalizations. The statement is partially accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD1F340>],/factchecks/2020/apr/23/lovely-warren/rochester-mayor-lacked-context-coronavirus-racial-/

The Gates Foundation does not have a patent for the coronavirus
","Bill Gates is one of the leading voices on a timeline for a coronavirus vaccine. Some Facebook users say that’s because the billionaire philanthropist stands to profit from one.

(Screenshot from Facebook) We’ve fact-checked several false or misleading claims about the Gates Foundation’s connection to the coronavirus and a potential vaccine. The charity is a frequent target for online disinformation about the pandemic. This Facebook post is also bogus. It’s similar to one of the earliest hoaxes we saw about the coronavirus in January, which originated on the conspiracy website Infowars. We looked through all of the patents assigned to both Gates and his foundation by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of now, none of them have to do with the novel coronavirus. Federal guidelines stipulate that there is an 18-month confidentiality period after the first filing date. That means Gates or his foundation could have applied for a patent within the past 18 months and it would not be publicly listed. There is no known treatment or vaccine for the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said a vaccine could take at least a year and a half to roll out. The Gates Foundation is funding some of the 70 potential vaccines that are currently in development. The philanthropy said in a Feb. 5 statement that it is investing up to $60 million to ""accelerate the discovery, development and testing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics"" for the coronavirus. Gates and his philanthropy frequently apply for patents with partner organizations. But as of now, they’re not listed on a future vaccine patent. We reached out to the Gates Foundation for comment. It pointed us to a fact-check from USA Today that debunks a similar claim.  The Facebook post is inaccurate.

Virginia lags in coronavirus testing, as Mayor LeVar Stoney says
","Richmond Mayor LeVar Stoney recently said Virginia needs to dramatically expand covid-19 testing before it reopens its economy. ""We’re not doing the kind of real-time, instantaneous testing that I think we need to do in communities throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia,"" Stoney, a Democrat, said during an April 10 interview on Newsradio WRVA. ""We’ve lagged behind other states when it comes to testing."" We fact checked whether Virginia really is trailing in coronavirus testing. Jim Nolan, Stoney’s communications director, said the mayor got his information from the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University, a widely-cited website for covid-19 data. On every day in mid April, it shows Virginia ranked either 49th or 50th among states in covid-19 testing per capita. On April 21 - the date of this writing - Virginia was last. It had conducted 58,394 tests, or, on a per capita basis, 738 tests per 100,000 residents. The next lowest was California, at 747 tests per 100,000. Across the U.S., 1,168 tests had been conducted per 100,000. New York, hardest hit by covid-10, had tested a leading 3,851 per 100,000.  Here’s how Virginia compared to its neighbors, in number of tests per 100.000: West Virginia, 1,514; Tennessee, 1,479; Maryland, 1,142; Kentucky, 941; North Carolina, 794; Virginia, 738.  On April 10, when Stoney made his statement, Virginia was 49th in per capita testing, leading Kansas. While Virginia has been at the bottom in testing, other Johns Hopkins data shows it ranks in the middle in the spread of the disease. On April 21, there had been 110 infected Virginians per 100,000. That’s 21st per capita. The controversy Testing numbers have a huge role in debate in Virginia and across the country over when governors should ease their stay-at-home restrictions and allow widespread business reopenings. President Donald Trump has called for lifting restrictions and is urging supporters to ""liberate"" several states where Democratic governors issued the orders. That includes Virginia, where Gov. Ralph Northam's order lasts until June 10. Virginia has seen several recent protests demanding Northam open the state now. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, says he set the date cautiously, noting that some projections show the virus may not peak in Virginia until late May. He recently appointed a work group to ramp up Virginia’s testing. ""The ability to run large numbers of tests is key to lifting restrictions on businesses and gathering,"" Northam said at an April 20 news conference. Northam’s explanation The governor and his advisors say they’ve had trouble competing with other states for scarce testing supplies. ""We’re scouring the country for the equipment to help our institutions increase testing,"" Daniel Carey, Virginia’s Secretary of Health and Human Resources, said on April 17. ""We just haven’t been successful because of the national shortage, but we realize we have to get significantly more testing…"" Northam says Trump has given ""limited guidance"" on how states can work through the competition. Many governors have voiced similar complaints. The Northam administration also gives reasons that may be unique to Virginia. Commissioner of Health Norman Oliver says Virginia had a slow start because - unlike some other states - no Virginia hospitals or labs developed their own tests. That meant, for a while, Virginia had to rely almost solely on the state lab for testing. The state lab was so crunched, Oliver says, that it set guidelines that limited testing to the most vulnerable patients.  As a result, he says, many Virginia physicians didn’t seek tests for patients showing mild covid-19 symptoms. Carey also says Virginia’s method of reporting tests may create a time lag that hurts Virginia when compared to other states. Northam says Virginia’s has improved as the state’s private labs, universities and hospitals have begun creating their own tests. During the first three weeks of April, the total number of tests conducted in Virginia has quadrupled. Many states have seen similar expansions. Northam told clinicians this week they should start testing anyone who’s symptomatic. And the state’s now testing all patients and workers in extended-care facilities. Our ruling On April 10, Stoney said Virginia has ""lagged behind other states when it comes to (covid-19) testing.""  On any given date from the eve of the mayor's statement through this April 21 writing, Virginia has been last, or next to last, in per capita testing.  So we rate Stoney’s statement True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE29040>],/factchecks/2020/apr/22/levar-stoney/virginia-lags-coronavirus-testing-stoney-says/

Joe Biden says Trump admin isn’t doing enough to protect workers from COVID-19
","During an April 15 virtual town hall meeting with front-line workers, former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrats’ presumptive nominee for the White House, was asked by a meat processing worker what he would do to protect workers like her from COVID-19. ""We lost a co-worker at my plant because there is no regulation to protect meat chain employees,"" said Safaa Elzakzoky, who is also a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. ""We can’t work safely and get people the meat that they need to eat. So what would you do to protect a worker like my friend who just died?"" In his response, Biden called attention to steps taken by the Obama administration during the H1N1 outbreak and criticized the Trump administration. He focused on ""failures"" by the Labor Department and its Occupational Safety and Health Administration to use regulatory powers to protect workers, including OSHA’s lack of action in enforcing specific worker safety guidelines related to COVID-19. OSHA issued an advisory guidance in early March on how employers can protect workers from COVID-19, which included encouraging businesses to develop infectious disease plans, to allow frequent hand-washing, to urge workers to stay home when they feel sick and to provide face masks to employees. Biden asserted that the agency’s actions fall far short. ""Until this week, they weren’t even enforcing these guidelines. Still today, OSHA is not specifying which rules employees must follow or how to keep their workers safe and healthy,"" said Biden. With President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response emerging as a political flashpoint in the presidential campaign, we decided to dig into the administration’s role in ensuring worker safety. And, as headlines increasingly detail how those on the front lines — health care workers as well as those in grocery stores and meatpacking plants and across the food supply chain — have contracted and died of COVID-19, we thought it was important to check the veracity of Biden’s claim. We contacted Biden’s campaign to find out the basis for his response. Staffers sent us an April 9 blog post from the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for workers, that outlines how the Trump administration’s OSHA has failed to stipulate and enforce adequate employee protections during the pandemic. They also sent us OSHA’s April 13 enforcement directive. OSHA is tasked with ensuring that workplaces are safe and healthy. The agency sets standards and has inspectors determine if workplaces are compliant. If they are not, OSHA issues citations and requires employers to address the problem within a certain timeframe. Failure to do so results in fines or other sanctions. These standards tend to be broad statements that can take a decade to develop and implement. For instance, two Obama-era OSHA officials — David Michaels, the Labor Department’s assistant secretary for OSHA from 2009 to 2017, and Debbie Berkowitz, a senior OSHA official from 2009 to 2015 — told us they had worked on developing an infectious disease standard for years, but that effort was halted in 2017 by the Trump administration.  However, OSHA also can issue an ""emergency temporary standard"" during a public health emergency, such as the current coronavirus pandemic. Major unions, including the AFL-CIO and National Nurses United, have petitioned OSHA for an emergency temporary standard that would codify that a variety of types of workers are at risk of exposure to COVID-19 and issue detailed safety requirements for specific industries. So far, though, OSHA has not taken this emergency action. Also, the March advisory guidance is not enforceable, said Michaels and Berkowitz. The guideline includes language stating that it is ""not a standard or regulation and creates no new legal obligations."" And though this document sketched out certain recommendations that would reduce workers’ risk of exposure to COVID-19, when OSHA put out its April 13 enforcement directive, it didn’t mandate that any of those recommendations be followed by workplaces or enforced by OSHA inspectors. Michaels and Berkowitz pointed out that OSHA’s COVID-19 directive is geared toward health care facilities, indicating that workplaces like food processing plants and grocery stores are untouched by the directive. But Edwin Foulke, who ran OSHA during part of President George W. Bush’s administration, had a different take. Since the agency has a limited number of inspectors, the focus on health care facilities is logical, he said. ""Unfortunately, there is a death component to this virus, and obviously health care is the area where workers are most likely to be exposed,"" said Foulke, now a partner at the Fisher Phillips law firm in Atlanta and Arlington, Virginia. ""They put out the general publication on coronavirus, and now they’re doing all these specific industry guidelines on how to deal with health issues. I’m not sure what more, looking at a real world scenario, they could do. What would it entail? And how is it going to help?"" he said.   For its part, an OSHA spokesperson reiterated that employers are, and will continue to be, responsible for providing a safe and healthy workplace and that OSHA’s pre-existing standards remain in place and enforceable, as appropriate, to protect workers from coronavirus. As part of answering the meat-processing plant worker’s question, Biden pointed to his experience during the Obama administration with the H1N1 pandemic in comparison to the current coronavirus response. To be clear, OSHA did not issue an emergency standard then, either. But the agency did offer detailed guidance — almost twice as long as the COVID-19 enforcement document — on how to protect workers from H1N1. And, though the H1N1-specific issues raised in the directive also were not enforceable, the document included specific instructions for inspectors on how to use existing agency standards to identify H1N1-related safety hazards in workplaces. For example, the instructions included seven bullet points outlining situations specific to H1N1 in which a citation could be issued under the agency’s general respiratory protection standard. In contrast, the COVID-19 enforcement document does not give the same level of guidance. Biden said that OSHA was not enforcing coronavirus guidelines until the week of April 13, and since then, the agency has not told employers what rules they must implement to keep workplaces safe. It’s true that OSHA did not release any COVID-19 enforcement instructions for its inspectors until April 13. However, even when this directive was issued, it told inspectors to focus on its existing general safety standards, not recommendations geared toward the current outbreak. In other words, the coronavirus guidelines are not currently being enforced by OSHA. And while the agency’s April 13 enforcement directive instructs inspectors to focus on general safety standards, it does not guide them on how specific recommendations for COVID-19 — for instance, requiring masks and encouraging hand-washing — fit into such efforts. We rate Biden’s claim True. This story was updated to include comments from an OSHA spokesperson that came after the fact check was posted. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFE30C0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/22/joe-biden/biden-says-trump-agency-isnt-doing-enough-protect-/

No, Kennedy Center and PBS didn’t pay COVID-19 kickbacks
","When it came to the $2 trillion relief package for COVID-19, maybe few things fueled more political criticism than the $25 million that went to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Some Republicans blasted the earmark as federal largesse. But worse than the Kennedy money are coronavirus kickbacks that followed, claimed a post shared 54,000 times on Facebook. ""So, the virus bill gives $25 million to the Kennedy Center (and) $200 million to PBS,"" the post says, referring to the Public Broadcasting Service. ""In return, the Kennedy Center donates $5 million to the Democratic Party and PBS donates $25 million to the Democratic Party. This is flat-out money laundering and quid pro quo. Prove me wrong.""  With apologies, we will. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Kennedy Center opened in Washington, D.C., in 1971, eight years after the assassination of the 35th president for whom it is named. It is home to the National Symphony Orchestra and the Washington National Opera. Among its most celebrated moments is the late Aretha Franklin’s performance of ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"" in 2015. PBS is a private nonprofit owned by its more than 330 member public television stations and serves as an alternative to commercial broadcasting. It is funded mainly by those stations and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit created and funded by the federal government that manages federal funding for public media. The children’s show ""Sesame Street"" (which moved to HBO after 45 years) and the dramatic series ""Masterpiece"" (formerly ""Masterpiece Theatre"") are among PBS’ most popular shows. The largest of the coronavirus stimulus packages adopted into law so far is the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was enacted March 27.  ""Keeping workers paid and employed, health care system enhancements and economic stabilization"" are the primary aims of the overall bill.  Features include payments of $1,200 per individual, subject to income limits, a $600 bonus added to weekly unemployment insurance checks and forgivable loans for small businesses to help them meet their payrolls.  The $25 million in CARES money for the Kennedy Center is for such purposes as ""deep cleaning,"" maintenance, telework upgrades, employee compensation, rent and utilities. The center is a federal entity funded by ticket revenue and congressional appropriations, so receiving funding through a congressional bill isn’t unusual. The Democratic House leadership had said in a statement that the Kennedy Center had lost more than $20 million in unrecoverable costs from canceled performances and could ""become completely insolvent and potentially unable to reopen."" Because of COVID-19, the Kennedy Center closed March 12 and has canceled performances through at least May 22. Meanwhile, it was the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS, and not PBS itself, that received $75 million in CARES funding — not $200 million. It is for ""stabilization support"" for stations seeing declines in non-federal revenues.  As with the Kennedy Center, it is standard practice for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to receive its funding from congressional legislation. ""Public media stations are the backbone for most communities’ emergency alert, public safety, first-responder and homeland-security services,"" the same Democratic leadership statement said. ""If stations are forced to cut jobs, reduce content and services, or close, the nation’s ability to deliver emergency alerts will be significantly diminished."" There actually isn’t a legal way for the Kennedy Center or PBS to show their appreciation for politicians through campaign contributions. Because the Kennedy Center and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and tax-exempt organization with the Internal Revenue Service, they are prohibited from making political contributions.  501(c)(3) is the section of the Internal Revenue Code that applies to charitable organizations that can receive tax-deductible donations. Aside from donating, they cannot attempt to influence legislation ""as a substantial part of its activities"" and cannot participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates. Fact-checkers Lead Stories, Snopes and FactCheck.org each reported that the Kennedy Center did not make a $5 million donation. So did the Reuters news agency. Our search of Federal Election Commission records also show no political contributions at all being made by the Kennedy Center or the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or PBS. We also checked the Federal Election Commission records for any contributions made by employees of those three entities on or after March 27, the day President Donald Trump signed the CARES bill into law. We didn’t find any. A Facebook post shared more than 54,0000 times claimed that the Kennedy Center gave $25 million and the corporation that funds PBS gave $5 million to the Democratic Party after the two entities received millions from a federal stimulus law in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

State Health Secretary Andrea Palm is not from Wisconsin, but Sen. Tom Tiffany muddled his point
","Wisconsin Republicans continue to blast Gov. Tony Evers and his administration as the state remains shuttered to combat the spread of the coronavirus.  A popular target of their ire: Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm. Republican leaders of the state Legislature went to court on April 21, 2020 to try to curb Palm’s power during a health emergency, contending she has ""laid claim to a suite of czar-like powers."" State Sen. Tom Tiffany, a Minocqua Republican, previewed that sentiment in an April 20 Facebook post. Tiffany is also running for the open 7th Congressional District seat in the May 12 special election. In his post, Tiffany criticized the administration's move to extend Wisconsin’s stay-at-home order to late May and pledged action by state Republicans. It went on to say: ""The power grab by a career bureaucrat with no past ties to Wisconsin will be challenged. A plan to safely and responsibly reopen will be created."" While Evers is the only one mentioned in the post, the order itself was issued by Palm, who oversees the Department of Health Services even though she has not been confirmed by the GOP-controlled Senate. And Tiffany argued he was referring to Palm as the career bureaucrat. How does the senator’s claim hold up? Evers tapped Palm in January 2019 to run one of the state’s largest agencies, which oversees an $11.5 billion budget, more than 6,000 employees and several programs, including Medicaid. The Senate has yet to confirm her appointment, and some senators want to fire her — even as she helps guide the state through a public health crisis.  An aide for Tiffany pointed to two biographies of Palm and her LinkedIn page to back up Tiffany’s claim. Let’s see what they say: Prior to her arrival in Wisconsin, Palm spent three years as senior counselor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Barack Obama. She’s held other positions at HHS as well, including chief of staff and counselor to the secretary for science and public health. She also worked for five years as a senior health policy adviser to then-U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton and, before that, was the legislative director for former U.S. Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.  Palm earned a bachelor’s degree from Cornell University and went on to get her master’s at Washington University in St. Louis. According to WisPolitics, she was born in Star Lake, NY. So, Palm is not a Badger. What about a career bureaucrat? Merriam-Webster defines a bureaucrat as a member of a bureaucracy, which is ""a body of nonelected government officials"" or ""an administrative policy-making group."" Palm’s resume shows she has a long career in administration with an emphasis on health policy. By definition, that makes her a bureaucrat. Whether one views that as a bad thing, as Tiffany does, is a matter of opinion.  Not quite. Before Tiffany referenced Palm in his Facebook post, he went on a tirade against Evers. ""Last week, Governor Tony Evers deflated the hopes of people across Wisconsin with the announcement of shutting down the state through May,"" he said. ""Most people understood constraining their lives through April 24. Unfortunately Governor Evers provided no plan for the future."" When he refers to Palm, he says in full: ""The power grab by a career bureaucrat with no past ties to Wisconsin will be challenged."" But Tiffany never names the health secretary. The only person he directly identifies is Evers. That leaves readers with the impression that he’s discussing the governor — who was born in Plymouth, attended the University of Wisconsin and worked for 10 years as the state’s superintendent of public instruction. As for the ""power grab?"" That’s Tiffany’s opinion, and a question ultimately for the Supreme Court. But it is worth noting that — as the COVID-19 fallout has shown — Palm and Evers, like other governors and health officials, have broad powers in the face of such a crisis. Our ruling In a Facebook post, Tiffany called Palm ""a career bureaucrat with no past ties to Wisconsin."" One problem: He doesn’t tell people he’s talking about the health secretary. At first glance, it seems as if Tiffany is targeting Evers, who has deep ties to Wisconsin. That leaves us with a statement that’s accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Tiffany’s claim Mostly True.

Is COVID-19 America's leading cause of death?
","With North Carolina in the middle of a stay-at-home order, the state’s top health official tried to emphasize the severity of COVID-19. The novel coronavirus has killed more than 200 people in North Carolina and reached 93 of North Carolina’s 100 counties, according to the NC Department of Health and Human Services. On top of that, health secretary Mandy Cohen on April 20 said the virus has reached a new status among other illnesses in America. ""Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States,"" Cohen said. Is that true? If you look at average daily deaths, yes. If you look at the bigger picture, no. If you look for the answer to this question online, you’ll likely get mixed results. Several media outlets -- such as Live Science, Newsweek and others -- recently reported that coronavirus is the top cause of death in America. But those claims look at death rates in a very small window, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control tend to label diseases based on their toll in a given year.  Live Science and Newsweek based their claims on a chart created by Dr. Maria Danilychev, who practices at Scripps Health in San Diego. Her chart takes the number of COVID-19 deaths in America as reported by Worldometer.com. Then it compares the deaths to the average daily deaths from other illnesses as reported by the CDC. For instance, if you look at the number of total deaths caused by heart disease reported in 2018 (647,457) and divide that by 365 (the number of days in a year) you get about 1,774 deaths per day. On April 20, Worldometer reported 1,939 coronavirus deaths across the U.S. Cohen’s office told PolitiFact that she also based her claim on how daily coronavirus deaths compare to past heart disease death averages. In an email to PolitiFact, DHHS spokeswoman Tracy Zimmerman cited the 30-day rolling average for COVID-19 deaths as documented on OurWorldInData.com. Over the phone, Zimmerman added that Cohen didn’t mean for her comment to be taken as a broad statement about historical death trends. At the CDC, experts tend to look at a bigger picture when classifying something as a top cause of death. In fact, a spokesman for the National Center for Health Statistics has pushed back at the idea that COVID-19 is the leading cause of death. ""There are no data to support that theory,"" Jeff Lancashire, a spokesperson for the National Center for Health Statistics, said in an email to CNN on April 10. ""We have limited data on 2020 deaths by cause, and no final official numbers yet for 2019, but we do know by looking at the final death totals in 2018 for the two leading causes of death in the U.S., Heart Disease and Cancer, there is no way that at this point COVID-19 comes anywhere close to those totals,"" Lancashire said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The State newspaper in Columbia, S.C. have used Lancashire’s comments to add context to claims about coronavirus. PolitiFact emailed the CDC on Tuesday to ask if its opinion had changed. ""Not really,"" CDC spokesman Brian Tsai said in an email. ""One can argue that for some weeks, it is the leading cause for those particular weeks, but we typically talk about leading causes in terms of annual deaths,"" the spokesman said.   ""When looking at the data year-to-date (i.e., January-April), COVID-19 wouldn’t be the leading cause. In a typical year, there are more than 200,000 heart disease deaths from January-April. For cancer, the number is a little less than 200,000 for that period. By contrast, when Cohen made her claim on April 20, the CDC reported coronavirus deaths at 39,000. Cohen said ""Covid-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States.""  That’s true only if you compare the number of people dying of coronavirus daily against estimates of other causes from previous years. The CDC has advised against using those daily numbers to make sweeping claims about the biggest causes of death in America. Cohen’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details that would give a different impression about the broader situation of health risks in America. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB86D900>],/factchecks/2020/apr/22/mandy-cohen/covid-19-americas-leading-cause-death/

No, Wisconsin is not “clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections”
","As tends to happen in Wisconsin politics these days, the battle over re-opening the state is headed to the courts. The state’s Republican-led Legislature filed suit April 21, 2020, asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to stop Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration from extending the stay-at-home order into late May.  Evers had issued a ""Safer at Home"" order March 24, 2020, that restricted movement and business activity throughout the state through April 24. On April 16 that order was extended to May 26, 2020, this time signed by Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald made their case for an injunction blocking Palm in a joint statement released the same day as the lawsuit. After referencing ""public outcry"" and condemning Evers for ""unprecedented administrative overreach,"" the three-paragraph statement ends with this: ""The constant stream of executive orders … are eroding both the economy and their liberty even as the state is clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections."" We’ll leave the determinations on scope of authority to the courts, but the last bit of that is clearly a data-based claim. Are infections ""clearly"" on the decline in Wisconsin? At the time of the joint statement, COVID-19 had resulted in 242 deaths in Wisconsin, with 4,620 people testing positive for the disease. Kit Beyer, a spokeswoman for Vos, said the decline claim was based on hospitalization data and the hospital resource usage estimated in a model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The oft-cited model, last updated April 17, projected Wisconsin’s peak resource usage to be somewhere between April 10 and April 18. It’s an estimate based on their formula, not a firm calculation based on actual figures. The model has drawn some criticism for its methodology, which experts say could make it ill-suited to help determine when to ease social distancing restrictions. In any case, it doesn’t make much sense to rely on a predictive model when we have actual data to examine for Wisconsin.  So we’ll do that, starting with the hospitalization numbers Beyer cited. RELATED: No proof (yet) of a post-election ""surge"" in Wisconsin coronavirus cases As with most datasets, labeling something an upward or downward trend depends entirely on which part of the data you pluck out. So here’s what we found looking at both recent days and the full month of April. HOSPITALIZATIONS This is the lone metric that shows a decline over the last couple weeks. After rising to start the month, the daily tally leveled off around 440 per day from April 9 to 14. The number then dropped for two days before holding steady between 357 and 361 from April 17 to 21. CONFIRMED CASES The daily numbers move up and down a bit but have stayed largely consistent throughout April. Zooming in to the last six days (April 15 to 20), Wisconsin had between 147 and 170 new confirmed cases per day. The tally was lower the days before that due to a lower number of tests being performed. The most recent tally released prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald was April 20, with 153 cases, up six from the day before. That’s on par with the April average of 157 new cases per day. DEATHS Wisconsin has averaged 10.7 coronavirus deaths per day throughout April, with daily tallies ranging from six to 19. The week prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald, Wisconsin averaged 10.9 deaths, including 10 on April 20. Vos and Fitzgerald said the state is ""clearly seeing a decline in COVID infections."" There are a lot of ways to slice the coronavirus data, but this is an exaggeration. New cases and deaths in the week before this claim were roughly in line with both the preceding week and the averages for the month of April. Hospitalizations had dropped somewhat from the week prior, but were holding steady for the five preceding days. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFC67C0>],/factchecks/2020/apr/21/wisconsin-republican-legislative-leaders/no-wisconsin-not-clearly-seeing-decline-covid-case/
