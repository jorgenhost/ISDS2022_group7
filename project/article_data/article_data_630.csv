Merger will produce one of nation's largest universities
","Since 2011, the University System of Georgia has been consolidating some of its 35 colleges and universities. The biggest of these mergers -- combining four-year Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta and largely two-year Georgia Perimeter College anchored in the suburbs -- is slated to be final in 2016. When this merger was approved earlier this month by the university system’s Board of Regents, officials said the university that emerges would retain the Georgia State name. They said it also would become the largest university in Georgia. But in a mass email to former students, the school’s alumni association suggested the merger will put GSU in an even more exclusive class. With a student enrollment of more than 54,000, the consolidated university also will be one of the largest in the nation, the email said. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts and the numbers. We looked first at the claim that a merged Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would be No. 1 among the state’s colleges and universities, based on enrollment. The University of Georgia currently holds that rank, with 35,197 students enrolled last fall, followed closely by GSU with 32,556 students. But a consolidated school would have 53,927 students, if the 21,371 students who attended Georgia Perimeter last fall were put on GSU’s rolls. That would put GSU’s enrollment well above UGA’s and No. 1 in the state by more than 20,000 students, based on current data. Enrollment is forecast to exceed 54,000 by 2016, assuming normal growth.. Now, what about that national claim? We found a couple of organizations that rank colleges and universities by enrollment. But for our purposes we had to discount the most widely known of those, U.S. News & World Report. The magazine, which grades colleges and universities on several standards, bases the ranking we saw on undergraduate enrollment. Georgia State’s claim is based on total enrollment. The website Matchcollege.com identified the largest 300 colleges and universities in the U.S, -- and only 17 of them had 50,000-plus students. Several of the highest-ranking schools were largely on-line, although Ohio State University and the University of Central Florida were high on the list with 56,387 students and 59,601 students, respectively. We discounted the schools that are largely online, including Phoenix University, with its 300,000-plus students. We did not see how to make apples-to-apples comparisons between the largely online and traditional brick and mortar colleges and universities, and a data expert we consulted agreed. Bragging rights are also hard to determine since a lot depends on how the numbers are counted, and who is counted? We found where Central Florida calls itself the second-largest university in the U.S. In Indiana, we found that Ivy Tech College, which is the state's system of community colleges at multiple locations, is considered one college. It calls itself the nation’s largest single accredited statewide community college. We looked at federal government data and went to websites to get more recent enrollment numbers. From that we found: Arizona State University with a first-day 2014 fall enrollment topping 82,000; Lone Star College hitting an all-time high enrollment last fall of 82,818; University of Minnesota reported system-wide enrollment this fall of 67,477; The University of Texas at Austin in fall 2013 had 52,076 students enrolled; and Tarrant County College (another community college in Texas) with a fall 2014 enrollment of 50,628. Richard Vedder, director of the not-for-profit Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington D.C., said he was confident that Georgia State will qualify as one of the nation’s largest universities, once the merger is complete. He said it was  ""a little unusual to have a two-year merge into a four-year"" university. ""Schools like Georgia State take on thousands of marginally qualified students who don’t go on to graduate and tend to hurt their rankings. Now, they’re going to add Georgia Perimeter students,"" he said. ""It might be good to save an institution. It might be a way to improve access. But I can’t see any reputation gains from it,"" he said. Vedder also cautioned that ""getting big doesn’t necessarily mean getting better."" Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System, has never said the goal was to boost Georgia State’s size. He has said the merger will play to GSU’s strength as ""a recognized national leader in improving student retention and graduation rates."" ""Combining these attributes with Georgia Perimeter College’s leadership in providing access to students across the metro area presents a major opportunity to improve student success,"" Huckaby said after the merger was approved. GSU officials also have stressed that the university’s rankings as a top-tier public research university will not be impuned and that Georgia Perimeter’s academic enterprise will be evaluated and measured separately from Georgia State’s bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs by organizations that rank institutions. Students and faculty at GSU and Georgia Perimeter have been voicing concern about how the schools’ two missions will be blended and about staff layoffs forecast for Georgia Perimeter  A student earning a 4-year degree from Georgia State can expect to earn $44,200 starting out and $72,900 at mid-career, according to payscale.com. By comparison, a student with two-year degree from Georgia Perimeter can expect to make $37,200 starting out and $48,200 at mid-career.  Georgia Perimeter has been without a permanent president since 2012 when President Anthony Tricoli resigned after an audit revealed a budget shortfall at the college of about $25 million. Tricoli has since filed suit, alleging he was made the fall guy and misled about the finances. Revelations about the shortfall initially hurt the college’s credit rating. But it has since bounced back and recently been upgraded. Our conclusion: The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make the state’s largest university, as plans exist now. It also would make the combined university one of the largest in the nation. We rate the alumni association’s statement True.","[('GSU Alumni Association email, Jan. 13, 2015,', 'http://http://gsu.imodules.com/controls/email_marketing/admin/email_marketing_email_viewer.aspx?sid=1471&gid=2&eiid=769&seiid=501&usearchive=1&puid=479f0524-9bde-420f-a03f-05445de2be03&csid=78233'), ('University System of Georgia Enrollment Report Fall 2014', 'No link'), ('Campus enrollments from Wikipedia', 'http://www.usg.edu/research/documents/enrollment_reports/SER_Fall2014.pdf'), ('Campus enrollments from Matchcollege.com', 'No link'), ('News release: Regents Approve Proposal to Consolidate Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College,', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_university_campuses_by_enrollment'), ('Interview with Charles Sutlive, vice chancellor, Office of Communications', 'No link'), ('Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia', 'http://www.matchcollege.com/top-colleges'), ('Interview with Andrea Jones, spokeswoman for Georgia State University', 'No link'), ('Interviews with Richard Vedder, director of The Center for College\xa0Affordability and Productivity, Washington, D.C.', 'http://www.usg.edu/news/release/regents_approve_proposal_to_consolidate_georgia_state_university_and_georgi'), ('U.S. News & World Report, 10 Universities with the Largest Undergraduate Student Populations, Sept.25, 2014\xa0', 'No link'), ('Lois Norder/AJC assisted in researching this fact check.', 'https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2014/09/25/10-universities-with-the-largest-undergraduate-student-populations')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/23/gsu-alumni-association/merger-will-produce-one-nations-largest-universiti/

Obama says automakers have paid back all the loans it got from his admin 'and more'
","In the run up to his 2015 State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama was once again trumpeting his administration’s intervention in Detroit. ""Last month, the rescue of the auto industry officially came to an end,"" Obama said Jan. 7 in Detroit. ""The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in."" In December, the Treasury Department announced it sold the remainder of its 54.9 million shares in Ally Financial — formerly, General Motor’s financing service, GMAC — for $1.3 billion. With the deal, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the United States was ""winding down the Auto Industry Financing Program,"" the federal program that saved the auto industry— or bailed it out, depending on your view. Back in 2012, we looked at Obama’s campaign claim that GM and Chrysler ""repaid their loans."" We said it was Half True, partially because the government still owned stock in both automakers and it was too soon to say if taxpayers would recoup their investment. But it’s two years later, and the Treasury has since sold off most of its holdings in both companies. So we decided to take a look at this issue again. There are several circumstances that make this confusing and complicated. For starters, the bailout of the auto industry started in the waning weeks of President George W. Bush’s tenure. It continued during the early months of the Obama administration. All told, the Treasury Department reported that the program cost taxpayers $79.7 billion, of which $70.4 billion was recovered. Under that estimate, the program lost about $9.3 billion. In April, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program would end up costing about $14 billion. The Obama administration, however, makes the case that only $57.3 billion of the investment came under their watch and therefore that should be all that they’re accountable for. Let’s review the timeline, starting in 2008: Bush secured $700 billion to bailout the financial institutions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008. In November of that year, Obama was elected and soon after met with Bush to discuss the transition. It was during those early meetings that Obama began to lobby Bush to provide some financial assistance for the auto industry, according to reports. The New York Times wrote Bush had ""balked at allowing the automakers to tap into the $700 billion bailout fund, despite warnings ... that General Motors might not survive the year."" A month later, Bush announced a $17.4 billion bailout for Chrysler and GM that provided short-term financial relief through March 2009. He handed off to the incoming Obama administration the decision on how the companies would have to restructure themselves. The investment would grow to about $23 billion in short-term loans by the time Bush left office. As Politico noted in December 2008, Bush’s move was a ""reversal for the White House,"" adding that, ""President-elect Barack Obama and Democrats had long advocated that course, and Bush had resisted it."" The New York Times reported that Obama ""embraced the plan,"" though he did not comment on the details. To get to Obama’s claim that the ""auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in,"" the White House is taking credit for all of the money recovered from the auto companies in the last six years. This is somewhat problematic. Why? Obama is essentially saying ignore the money Bush invested and only look at what my administration spent on the bailout when calculating the ""expenses"" side of the ledger. But for Obama to make the claim he has recovered everything he invested ""and more,"" he’s including money paid back on loans also given out under Bush. You might ask, ""Why not just look to see which loans were repaid?"" It’s a good question. Unfortunately, it’s a lot more complicated than that. Both GM and Chrysler went through structured bankruptcies in 2009 to remain viable. The process resulted in both automakers essentially killing off their old companies and creating New GM and New Chrysler. During that process, most of their debt was converted into preferred and common stock owned largely by the government that would gradually be sold off (in the case of Chrysler, it was acquired by Italian carmaker Fiat, while the GM stock was publicly offered and later partially bought back by New GM). Some of the dealings resulted in profit, some did not. Additionally, Old GM and Old Chrysler were saddled with some debt that has not been recovered. Because most of the debt was in stock, it’s difficult to know if the money coming back into the Treasury was from the Bush loans or from the Obama administration. At the same time, it’s possible the Treasury would not have recovered any of the investment from either administration had Obama’s White House not taken the steps to restructure the companies through a managed bankruptcy. Obama created a taskforce upon taking office to determine how to proceed with the auto companies. They had three options: no further government assistance; more loans with no strings attached; or more financial resources on the condition the companies would restructure. In both cases, the third option was chosen. The administration had a heavy hand in the restructuring, forcing the sale of Chrysler to Fiat and requiring GM to fire its CEO, close plants, shrink staff and eliminate lines like Pontiac and Saturn. The general consensus from both a legislative panel and experts is that the intervention by the administration kept both companies out of long, drawn out bankruptcies that could have resulted in the liquidation of GM and Chrysler. That likely would have impacted Ford as well (Ford didn’t take government money, but lobbied for GM and Chrysler to receive assistance, noting that the three automakers shared parts suppliers) and threatened the U.S. auto industry existence. It’s impossible to know what would have happened had the administration not stepped in. However, it’s fair to say right now both companies are profitable and American car makers are in stable positions. Additionally, a $9 billion hit is less than the $24 billion loss the Treasury predicted in 2011. Our ruling Obama said, ""The auto companies have now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration invested in."" We’ll note that losses from automaker loans were expected to be higher, and the action taken by the Obama administration resulted in GM and Chrysler paying back the bulk of their loans. But to say they've paid back ""every dime and more,"" requires considerable cherry-picking. Obama doesn’t count any outstanding loans made by the Bush administration, which seem to have been made with Obama's quiet support and which were restructured (resulting in some losses) under the bankruptcy Obama's Treasury helped manage. And to get into the black, he counts money the automakers paid back for Bush administration loans.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression. That’s Mostly False.","[('Email interview with Brandi Hoffine, spokeswoman for the White House, Jan 19, 2015', 'http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Pages/TARP-Investment-Program-Transaction-Reports.aspx'), ('Email interview with Adam Hodge, spokesman for the Treasury Department, Jan. 19, 2015', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of the Treasury, ""TARP Investment Program Transaction Reports,"" accessed Jan. 19, 2015', 'https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/economic-perspectives/2012/2q-klier-rubenstein'), ('Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ""Detroit back from the brink?

"['Jobs', 'Women', 'PunditFact', 'Carly Fiorina']","
Carly Fiorina says White House is not paying women equally
","President Barack Obama didn’t say much about women in his State of the Union address, but one of his few references drew a jab from former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. In his speech, Obama said ""this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work."" He was referring to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would allow workers to talk among themselves about how much they are being paid. Fiorina, a California Republican who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2010, took the president to task the next morning on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ""Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required,"" Fiorina said during a conversation with White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. ""I also think it's just a fact that laws exist on the books today, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law. I am struck by the fact the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House."" ""In the White House, women do earn equal pay for equal work,"" Jarrett said. ""The bill that’s currently before Congress would make it easier for women to find out if they are being discriminated against."" From that exchange, what caught PunditFact's attention is that Obama isn't practicing what he preaches in the White House. So what do the facts say? At a baseline level, there is a gender pay gap in the White House. Each year, the president’s office publishes a list of all staff members, the jobs they hold and their pay. With a little commonsense and a bit of Googling (we now know that Brayden is an Irish boys name), we sorted the most recent list of 460 employees by gender. We found that the average female staff member made $78,767 in 2013, while the average male made $85,602. The Washington Post did its own analysis and came up with slightly different numbers, but no matter how you cut it, a difference exists. In round figures, the average woman makes about 10 percent less than the average man. (One detail: Just about all the staffers are listed as employees, but about 6 percent are on loan as it were from other agencies. They are listed as detailees and their pay is not set by the White House. It does have some impact on the numbers. For the record, we included all workers in our analysis.) So there is a pay gap. But the context of the comments made by Obama at the State of the Union, and then by Fiorina, go beyond that a pay gap exists. The suggestion is that it exists out of some level of discrimination. Put another way, women are paid less than men for doing the same job. We found no real evidence of that happening at the White House. When we matched men and women by their job titles, not only did the gap disappear, the edge went to the women. This table shows how things break down for two higher echelon titles, ""assistant to the president"" and ""senior policy adviser."" Job Title # Men Average pay # Women Average pay Assistant to the president 12 $170,141 10 $172,270 Senior policy adviser 7 $106,714 9 $107,442 In cases where the titles match completely, as with the ""deputy assistant to the president and deputy counsel to the president,"" the salaries were identical. The three men and one woman holding those jobs in 2013 all made $158,500. Same thing with ""analyst."" We found 15 men and women with the title analyst all making $42,000 a year. A man and woman with the title ""assistant counsel of ethics"" both earning $60,000 a year. Five men and women with the title ""assistant director"" making $50,000 a year. Another five men and women with the title ""coordinator"" making $45,000 a year. But not all titles matched up so easily. The title of ""deputy assistant to the president"" comes with a range of add-on titles. There was a ""deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of communications,"" and a ""deputy assistant to the president and director of the White House military office."" If we ignored the add-ons, we found that the average female deputy assistant made $141,562, or about $10,000 less than the average male deputy assistant who made $150,115. And within titles, we did see some pay gaps -- in both directions. A woman with the title ""director of operations"" made $30,000 a year more than her male counterpart. A male with the title ""calligrapher"" made about $9,000 a year more than a female with the same title. (There's also a chief calligrapher, in case you were wondering.) ""Equal pay means equal pay for equal work and that's what we have at the White House,"" a White House spokesman told PunditFact. ""Men and women in the White House in equivalent roles earn equivalent salaries."" He added that department heads all make the same salary and over half are women. The numbers are clear. By the standard that men and women doing the same jobs should get the same pay, the Obama White House makes the grade. When we reached Fiorina’s office, we learned that her comment emerged out of a running Republican dispute with the administration over its talking points on this issue. Fiorina had something very particular in mind when she referred to Obama’s ""own measures."" Back in April, Obama marked Equal Pay Day by signing executive orders that imposed new rules for federal contractors. A line in the press release said, ""Women still make just 77 cents on average for every dollar a man earns, and continue to face prejudice in the workplace. And that number hasn’t improved — the pay gap has stayed constant since 2002."" Republicans, including Fiorina, find the 77 cents figure to be a deceptive rallying cry, precisely because it ignores that women and men tend to hold different jobs than men and those jobs tend to be lower paying. They argued that by that standard, the White House is not much better than the average employer. ""When the White House talks about equal pay for women they use one set of math for themselves and one set for others,"" said Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. ""The president uses this statistic to compare the average pay of women in all jobs to the average pay of men in all jobs. But when applying this rhetoric to assess pay in the Obama White House, they cry foul."" In that regard, Fiorina has a point. PolitiFact rated a claim from Obama Mostly False that, ""Women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."" The rationale: The gap isn’t all because women are paid less for doing the same work. A large part of the gap exists because women and men are doing different work. But when the claim changes even slightly, it becomes more true. In 2014, Obama said simply that Women ""make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."" That rated Mostly True because it removes the idea that the pay gap is solely related to discrimination. This year, Obama was careful with his wording as well, simply saying that ""this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work."" And all Fiorina said was Obama was not paying women equally ""by his own measures."" Linda Babcock is an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a leading researcher on women in the workforce. Babcock told PunditFact that the pay gap at the White House and across the country is rooted in occupational segregation. Women tend to hold positions that pay less than men. ""We’ve made good progress on equal pay for equal work,"" Babcock said. ""But that’s not fixing the whole problem. You look at any kind of organization and you will see relatively more women at the bottom and relatively more men at the top."" Babcock said research has found that many factors lie behind this. She said men are more likely to have more senior, more powerful advocates for them inside organizations. Babcock also noted than when deciding whether to promote someone, managers tend to be risk averse. ""We are more uncertain about women and we force them to meet a higher bar of performance before they go up to the next level,""  Babcock said. Our ruling Fiorina said that Obama is not paying women equally in his own White House by ""his own measures."" That by ""his own measures"" in some ways is the key to this claim, though you wouldn’t necessarily know it by just reading Fiorina’s comment. Fiorina is trying to reference past occasions when Obama said that ""women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men."" That’s Mostly False, because the pay gap is not all about discrimination. But the framing of the discussion post-State of the Union was different. Obama said, ""this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work."" Fiorina followed with, ""Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required,"" and then, Obama’s ""not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House."" The latest White House staffing data shows that there is a gap in average pay for men and women. But when the job titles are the same, largely so is the pay. In fact, for some job categories, women do a bit better than men. Fiorina’s dispute had to do with past rhetoric, not the issue as she framed it. We rate the claim Mostly False.","[('MSNBC, Morning Joe, Jan. 21, 2015', 'http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/wh--obama-wants-to-engage-with-the-gop-387127875826'), ('Mediaite, Carly Fiorina to Valerie Jarrett: Shouldn’t Equal Pay Start at the White House?, Jan. 21, 2015', 'No link'), ('Weekly Standard, Valerie Jarrett Confronted Over Unequal Pay for Women in White House, Jan. 21, 2015', 'http://www.mediaite.com/tv/carly-fiorina-to-valerie-jarrett-shouldnt-equal-pay-start-at-the-white-house/'), ('White House, 2013 Report on White House staff, 2014', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, Male-female pay gap remains entrenched at White House, July 1, 2014', 'http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/valerie-jarrett-confronted-over-unequal-pay-women-white-house_824193.html#'), ('Harvard Business Review, Women in the Workplace: A Research Roundup, September 2013', 'No link'), (""PolitiFact, Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union address: annotated, Jan. 21, 2015"", 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/21stcenturygov/tools/salaries'), ('White House, Taking Action in Honor of National Equal Pay Day, April 8, 2014', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Barack Obama ad says women are paid ""77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men"", June 21, 2012', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/male-female-pay-gap-remains-entrenched-at-white-house/2014/07/01/dbc6c088-0155-11e4-8fd0-3a663dfa68ac_story.html'), ('Interview, Sarah Isgur Flores, spokeswoman for Carly Fiorina, Jan. 21, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview, Linda Babcock, professor of economics, Carnegie Mellon University, Jan. 22, 2015', 'https://hbr.org/2013/09/women-in-the-workplace-a-research-roundup')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/22/carly-fiorina/fiorina-obamafails-meet-his-own-measures-equal-pay/
"['Poverty', 'Texas', 'Democratic National Committee']","
Democratic group says Texas poverty up, exceeding national average, on Rick Perry's watch
","As Rick Perry delivered his last gubernatorial speech to state legislators, the  Democratic National Committee suggested the state is worse off thanks to the Republican’s long tenure. Part of a Jan. 15, 2015, email blast from the committee said: ""Since Perry took office, poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% — which is higher than the national average."" That so? A committee spokeswoman, Miryam Lipper, told us by email the cited figures come from the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2000, Lippert said, 15.1 percent of Texans were living below the federal poverty threshold; in 2013, she said, 17.5 percent of Texans were living in poverty. Perry, initially sworn in as governor in late December 2000, yielded the office to Greg Abbott, previously the Republican state attorney general, on Jan. 20, 2015. And Lipper guided us to a September 2013 bureau report stating that nationally according to the bureau’s 2000 American Community Survey, 12.2 percent of the U.S. population (33.3 million people) had income below the poverty level. A chart in the report says an estimated 15.1 percent of Texans, 3,056,244 residents, lived in poverty in 2000. Lipper also noted a September 2014 bureau report stating 17.5 percent of Texans, 4,530,039, lived below poverty in 2013. Nationally that year, according to the report, 15.8 percent of residents, 48,810,868 people, lived below poverty. So, the Texas poverty rate exceeded the national rate through the second-to-last year of Perry’s governorship — as it did before he took the state’s helm in 2000. The state’s poverty rate in 2013 was 2.4 percentage points higher than the year Perry became governor. Nationally, the 2013 rate was 3.6 percentage points higher than the U.S. rate in 2000. The government uses measures of poverty called ""poverty thresholds"" to help determine the number of residents living in poverty. If a family has an income below the relevant threshold, then the members of that family are considered to be living in poverty. Those thresholds, adjusted annually for inflation, vary by family size. In 2013, for instance, the poverty threshold for a family of four was $23,834. With help from a Census Bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, we confirmed the figures cited by the Democratic group. Bernstein said, though, that the way the bureau has checked poverty levels each year changed about a decade ago; so, it’s best only to compare the results from a supplemental survey to the 2000 Census to American Community Survey results for each year since 2005. From 2005 through 2013, Texas had a greater share of residents living in poverty than the nation as a whole, ACS survey results suggest, though in all but one of the years, the gap between Texas and the nation narrowed or stayed steady. In 2013, the latest year of available estimates, 17.5 percent of Texans lived in poverty, according to the ACS, compared with 15.8 percent of U.S. residents. It could be, then, that conditions in Texas were improving as Perry approached the end of his time as governor. People in Poverty (%), U.S. and Texas, 2005 through 2013 Year U.S. Poverty Rate Texas Poverty Rate Difference (Percentage Points) 2005 13.3 % 17.6 % 4.3 2006 13.3 % 16.9 % 3.6 2007 13 % 16.3 % 3.3 2008 13.2 % 15.8 % 2.6 2009 14.3 % 17.2 % 2.9 2010 15.3 % 17.9 % 2.6 2011 15.9 % 18.5 % 2.6 2012 15.9 % 17.9 % 2.0 2013 15.8 % 17.5 % 1.7 Source: American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates, via American FactFinder, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Jan. 16, 2015) We also asked a University of Texas researcher, Daniel Dillon, for his analysis of changes in poverty in Texas and nationally. Dillon, citing another Census Bureau tool, the Current Population Survey, said 16.2 percent of Texans lived in poverty in 2000, the year Perry became governor, though the rate was down to 15.7 percent in his first months in office. In 2013, by that measure, 16.8 percent of Texans lived in poverty. ""So to summarize, the poverty rate has gone up in TX from 15.7 to 16.8 (percent) from 2001 to 2013 (from what I’m seeing from the Census). It is important to note, however, that the overall poverty rate in the U.S. has also gone up during this time—from 11.6 in 2001 to 14.5 to 2013 (cited from the same data tables),"" Dillon wrote. Dillon said the government relies on CPS results to generate official poverty estimates. A bureau web page says the CPS surveys fewer people but asks many additional questions; the ACS reaches more households with just eight income-related questions. ""Neither one is right or wrong, they are just different surveys,"" Dillon wrote, a characterization also made to our inquiry by spokesman Oliver Bernstein of the Texas-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates programs that serve the poor. Governor’s role? We asked Dillon if Perry’s actions as governor drove the poverty rate. Dillon said it’s hard to sift out particular effects from actions by a governor. ""There is decades of debate on these issues so take this with a grain of salt, but in general I think economists would say that poverty is fairly responsive to the larger economy,"" Dillon said. ""This is especially true with downturns in the economy — economic shocks like recessionary periods have a notable effect on poverty. This happened under Perry’s term, whether he had anything to do with it or not. The same is true for growth. When the economy grows, poverty tends to decline."" Also, Dillon said, it’s worth stressing that most anti-poverty efforts are undertaken by the federal government. Dillon also passed along a comment by Cynthia Osborne, a University of Texas associate professor and director of the Child and Family Research Partnership at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, who said that generally Texas’ poverty rates will exceed national rates ""because we have a large number of single parents and of Hispanics, which have high rates of poverty. That said,"" Osborne said, ""we invest very little in our families"" through state government. Our ruling The Democratic group said that since Perry became governor in late 2000, ""poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% — which is higher than the national average."" These figures are supported by U.S. Census Bureau surveys, but they don’t tell the full story. Texas’ poverty rate went down and then up again over Perry’s decade-plus as governor, and the gap between the nation and Texas ultimately narrowed. Finally, it’s unreasonable to lay all blame for a state’s poverty rate on its governor; national economic factors dominate.

Rick Perry says Texas gained a million jobs while rest of country lost 400,000
","Rick Perry reminded lawmakers in his last speech to them before ending more than a decade as governor that he’s proud of Texas job gains on his watch — and the rest of the country lost jobs in recent years, he said. ""I have been guided by a simple philosophy: That job creation, not higher taxation, is the best form of revenue generation,"" Perry said in his Jan. 15, 2015, speech. ""And we have created jobs. In the last year, we have created 441,000 jobs. Since I became governor, with your help, we have created almost one-third of all the nation’s new jobs."" Those figures hold up if you get your wording straight. We found True Perry’s past claim to Texas’ accounting for one third of net new jobs in the country. As we checked this latest statement, analyst David Cooper of the liberal Economic Policy Institute crunched the latest federal figures and told us Texas jobs accounted for 27 percent of the net jobs gained in the 43 states that gained jobs since 2000. ""Still pretty impressive,"" Cooper said by phone. In his speech, Perry added accurately: ""The unemployment rate in Texas is significantly below the national average. And right here in Austin, Texas, it’s below 4 percentage points."" Then Perry said: ""In fact, if you look at the last seven years…starting in December of 2007, you will see that 1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."" That much of a Texas/Not-Texas gulf? By email, Perry spokesman Felix Browne pointed out U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures for Texas and other states and encouraged us to consult Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint. Professor Perry wrote in a November 2014 online commentary that from December 2007, the start of the national recession, through October 2014, Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs. ""In contrast,"" he wrote, ""civilian employment in the other 49 states without Texas is still 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level … — there were 134.9 million non-Texas jobs in October vs. 135.26 million in December 2007."" To our query, the scholar emailed a chart showing that based on what the government calls ""total employment,"" covering all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007 while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. Total employment, he said, serves as a comprehensive indicator and is used to calculate unemployment rates. Mark Perry said the likely reason the latest figures weren’t perfectly echoed in the governor’s speech is the BLS recently revised upward U.S. jobs for November 2014, which had the effect of reducing the number of jobs lost outside of Texas in the cited period. A little more: The BLS says the definition of employment in the federal household survey, which the governor relied on for his comparison, ""comprises wage and salary workers (including domestics and other private household workers), self-employed persons and unpaid workers who worked 15 hours or more during the reference week in family-operated enterprises. Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included."" In contrast, the government's oft-quoted payroll survey of employers ""covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments."" Cooper of EPI commented to us that the timeframe singled out by the governor may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government’s payroll surveys, he said, the country has added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. has added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them. Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: ""Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did,"" he emailed. ""Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won’t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that’s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains,"" he wrote. Separately, we asked a Dallas-based analyst about the governor’s claim. Cheryl Abbot of the BLS said by email the claim could have been precise by referring to ""total civilian employment"" rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. ""On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763,"" Abbot wrote. Our ruling Gov. Perry said that starting in December 2007, ""1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."" His figures mostly hold up according to household surveys by the federal government looking into civilian employment including self-employment, though positions not yet recovered outside Texas totaled closer to 350,000, according to the latest available data when Perry spoke.

'America is No. 1 in wind power,' Obama says
","President Barack Obama devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to talking up America’s energy trends, including being a leader in our own energy production. ""We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet,"" he said. ""And today, America is No. 1 in oil and gas. America is No. 1 in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008."" We’ve covered oil and gas and solar power before, but the wind energy claim was new to us. Is the United States the global leader in producing that, as well, or is Obama just being a blowhard? Let’s get on the grid and find out. Clearing the air Obama has made renewable power sources a focus of his administration, and has effectively doubled the use of many ""clean energy"" methods, a large portion of which has been from wind. The U.S. Energy Department says that the nation’s capacity for generating energy from wind, in which wind moves a turbine to generate electricity to be used on the power grid, has increased from 25,410 megawatts in 2008 to 62,300 megawatts as of September 2014. This capacity growth was fueled in part to a federal production tax credit that expired at the end of 2014. There are still projects being built using the tax credit, so capacity is expected to keep growing. Many energy reports, however, generally say the United States trails China in its total wind energy capacity. The Global Wind Energy Council said in 2013 that China has the capacity to generate 91,412 megawatts. China also has outpaced the United States for wind-driven power installations.   But that’s where we run into a headwind on the stats, because there’s a difference between capacity (what can be produced) and generation (what actually is produced). A Jan. 15, 2015, report by the American Wind Energy Association said the electrical energy actually being produced was currently greater in the United States than it was in China, and has been since 2008. The report said in 2013 the United States generated 167 billion kilowatt hours (a measure utility companies use to bill companies; a megawatt equals 1,000 kilowatts), while China generated 138 billion kilowatt hours. Simon Mahan, renewable energy manager for the pro-renewable Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said there a many factors in determining the two different measurements, leading to discrepancies depending on how they’re recorded. A wind farm in America may be more efficient than one in China because the wind is better, for example, making more power even if the one in China has more turbines. The focus on installations is due in part to the fixed capital costs of building a wind farm, and full-year generation data isn’t available if, say, an installation opens in April, Mahan said. He compared capacity and generation to how a hybrid car’s gasoline tank is smaller than a truck’s, but both can go about the same distance because the hybrid is more efficient. Whether this difference lasts is up in the air. China has plans to build 150 gigawatts (that’s 150,000 megawatts) of capacity by 2017. in the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. had an additional 13,600 megawatts of capacity under construction, which would bump the States up to around 75,000 megawatts of capacity next year, with potential projects in the future. Determining if either country maxes out that capacity depends on factors that can only be predicted and not confirmed, Mahan said, although China has issues with how much its power grid can safely hold at one time. The International Energy Agency has predicted the demand for wind power in China is slowing, while the United States faces ""policy uncertainty"" that may affect wind power’s future here.   Our ruling Obama said ""America is No. 1 in wind power."" China is actually the leader in the overall capacity for generating wind power. But the United States has overtaken China in terms of the actual amount of electricity wind power it generates.  Both countries plan to continue to expand wind capacity -- China more than the United States --  but they also both face challenges to expanding capacity and generation. We rate the claim Mostly True.","[('President Barack Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jan/20/barack-obamas-2015-state-union-address-annotated/#annotations:4758530'), ('Global Wind Energy Council, ""Global Wind Report Annual Market Update 2013,"" April 2014', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Sen.

Barack Obama says U.S. economy is creating jobs at fastest pace since 1999
","President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was notable for its celebratory language about the state of the economy, following a recovery that was widely considered long and slow. Here’s one of the claims Obama made: ""Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999."" We initially read this to mean that both the economy and the number of jobs had been growing at the fastest pace since 1999. That would have been a problematic claim, since the final figures for growth in gross domestic product in 2014 aren’t in yet. However, when we asked the White House press office for clarification, they responded that the president was making two separate claims -- first, that the economy is growing, and second, that the United States is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. The first of those claims is clearly true -- except for one quarter of negative growth in the first quarter of 2014, the economy has been expanding -- but we weren’t sure about the second part. So we decided to take a closer look at Obama’s claim that the economy is ""creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999."" Looking at job growth over the course of the calendar year We looked at total nonfarm employment from December of one year to December of the next, using official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found: Time period Total job growth Dec. 1998 to Dec. 1999 3,177,000 Dec. 1999 to Dec. 2000 1,946,000 Dec. 2000 to Dec. 2001 - 1,735,000 Dec. 2001 to Dec. 2002 - 508,000 Dec. 2002 to Dec. 2003 105,000 Dec. 2003 to Dec. 2004 2,033,000 Dec. 2004 to Dec. 2005 2,506,000 Dec. 2005 to Dec. 2006 2,085,000 Dec. 2006 to Dec. 2007 1,140,000 Dec. 2007 to Dec. 2008 - 3,576,000 Dec. 2008 to Dec. 2009 - 5,087,000 Dec. 2009 to Dec. 2010 1,058,000 Dec. 2010 to Dec. 2011 2,083,000 Dec. 2011 to Dec. 2012 2,236,000 Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2013 2,331,000 Dec. 2013  to Dec. 2014 2,952,000 So Obama’s on target: The job growth during calendar year 2014 was higher than any year going back to 1999. Adding some context That said, the current recovery is hardly perfect. There have been three clear periods of job growth over the past quarter century. We looked at the gain in employment between the low point in jobs and the high point (or, for the current period, the most recent month). As this chart shows, these periods of expansion were quite consistent while they lasted.  SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics Here’s the breakdown of the three job expansions: Time period Total jobs created Jobs created per month May 1991 - Feb. 2001 24.5 million 207,847 Aug. 2003 - Jan. 2008 8.2 million 152,167 Feb. 2010 - Dec. 2014 10.7 million 181,220 This shows that the current jobs recovery, while more robust and longer than the one from 2003-08, pales in comparison to the one that lasted from 1991-2001. Indeed, it pales in two different ways: The current job expansion has created 13 percent fewer jobs every month on average than the one in the 1990s, and it has so far lasted only half as long. The earlier expansion lasted for almost a full decade. Our ruling Obama said the economy is ""creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999."" The current jobs recovery isn’t perfect, but Obama is correct that it’s the fastest since 1999. So we rate the claim True.","[('Barack Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015', 'http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ln'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey (main index page), accessed Jan. 20, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-economy-creating-jobs-fastest/

Fox host: Obama first president since 2001 not to say 'al-Qaida' in State of the Union
","Fox News’ chief political anchor said President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was remarkable for what it left out. ""The words ‘al-Qaida’ were never used,"" said host Bret Baier, ""the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001."" The omission was particularly notable because of the speech’s proximity to the Charlie Hebdo attacks tied to al-Qaida jihadists in the Arabian Peninsula and heightened warnings from British authorities about a possible attack from ""core"" al-Qaida, Baier said. Instead, as Baier noted, Obama talked about ISIS and asked Congress to officially authorize a military fight against Islamic State terrorists, which broke off from al-Qaida. Still, Baier’s point about al-Qaida not being in the address is right. Every State of the Union address since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by al-Qaida have included references to this specific jihadist movement. We checked copies of speeches by President George W. Bush and Obama from the American Presidency Project of the University of California Santa Barbara. The Bush speeches As Baier said, the last time we didn’t hear ""al-Qaida"" in a State of the Union-like setting was Bush’s Feb. 27, 2001, ""budget message"" to a joint session of Congress. (Obama’s first speech to Congress in 2009 was also not technically a State of the Union, though it was covered and delivered like one.) In Bush’s 2001 speech, delivered nearly seven months before the day that changed everything, Bush did allude to ""terrorists who threaten with bombs"" as one of the widespread threats of the new 21st century. But he did not mention al-Qaida by name. Bush’s speech in 2002 was heavily centered on the new war on terrorism in Afghanistan, not surprisingly, but only mentioned al-Qaida once in reference to flight attendants who spotted a man trained by the group and wearing explosives and foiled his attack before Christmas. The group’s name resurged in 2003 as Bush described advances in capturing its leaders and made the case to go after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for his pursuit of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and because he ""aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-Qaida."" Subsequent speeches by Bush mainly mentioned al-Qaida in connection with captured leaders or defending the need for the PATRIOT Act’s surveillance programs. Bush’s last two State of the Unions talked about al-Qaida way more often as the country grew more weary of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was reminding Americans why they were there. There were 10 mentions in 2007 and 11 mentions in 2008, including this excerpt: When we met last year, al-Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is al-Qaida that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held. And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al-Qaida leaders and operatives. Last month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al-Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al-Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. The Obama speeches Obama took office criticizing Bush’s handling of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, so it’s no surprise that his early mentions of al-Qaida come in a different context. ""And with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al-Qaida and combat extremism,"" Obama told a joint session to Congress, ""because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not allow it."" This was the same speech -- again, technically not a State of the Union -- in which Obama called for the closure of the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (which is still open). Three years later, Obama reminded the country about the killing of Osama bin Laden and top al-Qaida fighters in his 2012 State of the Union. We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al-Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. Obama’s 2013 and 2014 remarks discussed the demise of core al-Qaida, calling the group that organized the 9/11 attacks a ""shadow of its former self."" But ""core"" was the key distinction, as Obama also highlighted the rise of affiliate extremist groups not long after the attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. And as for last night’s speech (see our annotation)? No direct mention of al-Qaida, but Obama did reference terrorists.  First, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue ... to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. ... And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission bypassing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. Our ruling Baier said, ""The words ‘al-Qaida’ were never used, the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001."" This is accurate, so we rate it True.","[('Mediaite, ""Fox’s Bret Baier: Obama’s SOTU Didn’t Mention ‘al Qaeda’ — First Time Since 2001,"" Jan. 21, 2015', 'http://www.mediaite.com/tv/foxs-bret-baier-obamas-sotu-didnt-mention-al-qaeda-first-time-since-2001/'), ('George W.

Barack Obama says unemployment rate now lower than before the financial crisis of 2008
","A significant theme of President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address was that the United States economy has come back from the brink. One of the metrics he used to make this claim was unemployment rate. During his address, Obama said that ""our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis."" We decided to check whether that’s correct. The most recent reported monthly unemployment rate was 5.6 percent for December 2014. The last time it was that low was in June 2008, when it was also 5.6 percent. The financial crisis occurred after June 2008 -- it’s generally dated to the implosion of the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers in September 2008. So Obama clearly has a point. That said, there are a few caveats. First, while we have no quarrel with Obama using the most basic version of the unemployment rate, it’s worth mentioning that there’s another version of the unemployment rate, known as U-6, that isn’t as favorable to the president’s case. The U-6 statistic tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the more familiar unemployment rate. It takes into account not just people who are unemployed but also people working part-time who would rather have full-time work, as well as people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. Because it includes these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher. As it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the more basic unemployment rate -- hasn’t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, which is higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008 and the 10.8 percent rate one month earlier in August 2008. Second, while economists cheer the clear improvement in the basic unemployment rate, they also fret that a portion of that improvement stems from Americans leaving the labor market rather than finding jobs after experiencing joblessness. (The unemployment rate can improve either if someone goes back to work, or if they leave the labor market entirely.) A way to measure this is by looking at a statistic called the labor force participation rate, which measures the number of people in the labor force divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up hope of finding a job. The labor force participation rate has decreased markedly since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66.0 percent, but that fell to 62.7 percent by December 2014, the most recent month available. It’s now at its lowest point since the late 1970s, a time when fewer women were working. Part of this is explained by the retirement of the large Baby Boom generation, but not all -- and the trendline worries many economists. So Obama has justification for celebrating the unemployment rate’s decline, but it’s worth remembering that that’s not the only important labor-market statistic out there. Our ruling Obama said ""our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis."" He’s correct when using the basic unemployment rate -- the most commonly cited figure -- but it’s worth noting that other measures of the labor market are not quite so rosy. The unemployment rate may be dropping, if only in part, because people have stopped looking for work. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","[('Barack Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015', 'http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ln'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey (main index page), accessed Jan. 20, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-unemployment-rate-now-lower-fina/

Obama: America is No. 1 producer of oil, gas
","The United States is on top of the world in terms of energy production, President Barack Obama said during his sixth State of the Union. ""We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet,"" he said during his Jan. 20 address. ""And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008."" We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil and gas producer. As it turns out, the United States passed Saudi Arabia about two years ago in terms of oil production. And we’ve been the top producer of natural gas for more than two decades. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, generally uses total oil supply production as its most relevant statistic for assessing the world oil market. This statistic includes crude oil, natural gas liquids, condensates, other liquids, such as biofuels like ethanol, and refinery gain.   By this measure, in the third quarter of 2014 -- which includes the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels per day. The next-highest producer, Saudi Arabia, produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production. If we whittle down that number further just to look at crude oil -- what typically comes to mind when we think of ""oil production"" -- with no other liquids, the United States is third behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. But when natural gas liquids are added into the mix, the United States takes the No. 1 spot again with 12.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids. A note: Natural gas liquids -- included in the oil production count -- are different from natural gas. Natural gas liquids are derivatives of petroleum (like kerosene) that are found in the same rocks as a natural gas deposit. Natural gas is methane that comes from the ground as a gas. It’s the gas that comes out of a gas stove and heats buildings. The United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia and a bit more than Russia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum. Here is a chart showing the breakdown:  The United States and Russia are the top producers of natural gas -- with the United States producing 29.5 trillion cubic feet in 2012, and Russia producing 23 trillion. Oil production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices. The majority of U.S. oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D.; Eagle Ford, Texas; the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest states; and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all U.S. crude oil production. In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production. There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared with Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market. ""In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.,"" Maugeri said. Our ruling Obama said ""America is No. 1 one in oil and gas "" The latest global oil and natural gas production statistics back up Obama’s claim. The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years. We rate his statement True.","[('NBC,\xa0Meet the Press, Jan. 4, 2014', 'https://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=50&pid=53&aid=1'), ('U.S. Energy Information Administration,\xa0global oil production database, accessed Jan. 4, 2014', 'No link'), ('U.S. Energy Information Administration, ""North America leads the world in production of shale gas,"" Oct. 23, 2013', 'https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=13491'), ('U.S. Energy Information Administration, ""U.S. expected to be largest producer of petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbons in 2013,"" Oct. 4, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Energy Information Administration, ""Despite lower crude oil prices, U.S. crude oil production expected to grow in 2015,"" Jan. 2, 2015', 'https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=13251'), ('Bloomberg News, ""U.S. Seen as Biggest Oil Producer After Overtaking Saudi Arabia,"" July 4, 2014', 'No link'), ('Reuters, ""U.S. surges past Saudis to become world\'s top oil supplier - PIRA,"" Oct. 15, 2013', 'https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19411'), ('Email interview, Klobuchar spokesman Rob Friedlander, Jan. 4, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Leonardo Maugeri, associate at Harvard’s Geopolitics of Energy project, Jan. 4, 2015', 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-04/u-s-seen-as-biggest-oil-producer-after-overtaking-saudi.html'), ('Email interview, Energy Information Administration international expert Erik Kreil, Jan. 5, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/obama-america-no-1-producer-oil-gas/

Obama: Since 2010, U.S. has created more jobs than 'all advanced economies combined'
","Positive economic indicators were a major piece of President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, including a claim he repeated throughout 2014: that the American economy has outperformed the economies of other advanced countries. In talking about his goals for the upcoming year, Obama said, ""As we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan and all advanced economies combined."" We previously rated a similar statement by Obama, giving him a Half True for the claim that ""we've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office."" His numbers at the time were off, and it seemed like the other economies were ever so slightly edging out the United States for total jobs created. A few months later, we’re able to update this fact-check with more recent data. The new information actually lines up better with Obama’s claim. But there are still problems with the idea that people are being put back to work. How does the U.S. compare to the other advanced economies? For this fact-check, we’ll use International Monetary Fund data. The IMF classifies 36 countries as ""advanced economies"" and seven of those as ""major advanced economies."" We looked at total average annual employment from 2010 through 2015. (This counts the number of payroll positions, meaning one person who works two jobs would be counted twice.) Country or Group 2010 employment 2015 employment, estimated Absolute growth Percent growth United States 139.1 million 147.5 million 8.4 million 6.1 percent IMF: 36 advanced economies (except U.S.) 326.8 million 334.7 million 7.9 million 2.4 percent IMF: G7 major advanced economies (except U.S.) 196.4 million 201.4 million 4.9 million 2.5 percent   According to the IMF, then, the net number of people employed in the United States has grown by about 8.4 million people. As Obama said, this is higher than all other advanced economies combined -- the 35 advanced economies outside of the United States expanded by 7.9 million in the same time frame. And it’s clearly more than what happened in the smaller group of other G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom). Still, the United States is the most populous of the advanced economies by far -- it has more than twice the population of Japan, which is the next most populous advanced economy. (China, Russia and India are not considered advanced economies.) So it’s logical that there will, in general, be more employment growth in absolute numbers compared to smaller nations.   Looking at the percentage growth rate instead of the absolute number of jobs helps to account for the population differences among these advanced nations. And by this measurement, the United States is not on top. The United States’ percentage growth rate is lower than quite a few nations on the IMF’s list of advanced economies, including: Australia, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Iceland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland. The country on this list with the highest job growth rate was Singapore, with a rate of nearly 15 percent. Is the U.S. putting 'more people back to work'? So if you look at net job creation, the White House claim is on target. What about the wording of putting ""more people back to work,"" as Obama said? To support its claim when we fact-checked this a few months ago, the White House cited an internal analysis -- one we weren’t able to access for independent verification. The White House press office said the analysis used IMF data for the 36 advanced economies. They told PolitiFact that the analysis ""finds that 14.9 million people have returned to work in advanced economies since the beginning of 2010. Just over half—or 7.5 million—are in the United States. In other words, the number of people put back to work in the United States exceeds the net total for all other advanced economies combined (7.4 million)."" The White House said it’s notable that the United States accounts for the majority of these jobs since the U.S. population only accounts for about 31 percent of the population in advanced economies. The White House added that within the narrower group of G7 nations the U.S. share ""vastly exceeds the rest of the G7 (7.5 million vs. 4.6 million)."" However, the White House is using net employment gain, which doesn’t necessarily refer to people who became unemployed and went back to work -- the clearest definition of putting people ""back to work,"" as Obama said. It’s possible that it could include people entering the workforce for the first time. We were unable to find other research to corroborate Obama’s claim. On the question of putting people back to work in the United States alone, we found that the Obama administration does have some data on its side. Statistics for the long-term unemployed have fallen consistently from their recession peak, both measured by the number of long-term unemployed Americans and the median duration of unemployment. The following Bureau of Labor Statistics chart shows the median duration of unemployment, in weeks, since January 2009, the start of Obama’s presidency.  Still, the median length of unemployment is 13.7 weeks now, which is higher than it was in January 2009 (10.7 weeks). More importantly, the labor force participation rate -- that is, the percentage of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that is either working or looking actively for work -- has fallen consistently since Obama took office, from 65.7 percent to 62.8 percent. This graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the falling rate of labor participation since January 2009, when Obama took office.  If these two data points sound paradoxical, they’re not. On the one hand, among the pool of people still looking for work, fewer have been looking for more than 27 weeks. On the other hand, that pool of people looking for work has shrunk, because many workers have simply dropped out of the labor market, rather than finding a job. The idea that long-term unemployed Americans are increasingly leaving the labor force is supported by an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by FiveThirtyEight.com’s Ben Casselman. The data led him to conclude that ""the share of the long-term jobless who are giving up their job searches has been rising steadily, even as the job-finding rate has remained largely flat."" This puts a damper on the notion, stated by Obama, that ""we’ve put more people back to work"" in recent years. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, added a word of caution. She noted that presidents are far from the only factor in economic growth, so it would be unrealistic for Obama to claim too much credit for these numbers. Indeed, the United States hemorrhaged jobs in the last months of 2008 and the first few months of 2009 -- meaning there was a lot of room to grow. ""Is it a good thing to just put people back to work?"" Sinclair said. ""This mostly means we had a terribly bad recession and have finally recovered from it. That's not necessarily something to consider a policy triumph.""   Our ruling Obama said, ""Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined."" From publicly available data, we know that since 2010, the United States has created more jobs than the 35 other advanced economies combined. However, it’s not as clear cut that this recovery involves putting ""more people back to work,"" as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more and more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs. On balance, we rate Obama's claim Half True.","[('PolitiFact, ""Barack Obama says U.S. has recovered from recession better than almost every advanced country,"" July 23, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/23/barack-obama/obama-us-has-recovered-recession-better-almost-eve/'), ('White House, ""Economic Report of the President,"" March 2014', 'No link'), ('IMF,\xa0World Economic Outlook database, accessed Jan. 20, 2015', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/full_2014_economic_report_of_the_president.pdf'), ('New York Times, ""Many Rival Nations Surge Past the U.S. in Adding New Jobs,"" June 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist, Nov. 9, 2014', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/index.aspx'), ('Email interview with Jeffrey Frankel, Harvard University economist, Nov. 9, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview with White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman, Nov. 9, 2014', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/business/employment-in-us-lags-where-it-was-in-2007.html?adxnnl=1&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1415545961-iq8zDxbLMXwyX37bmHdBCw')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/obama-obama-2010-us-has-created-more-jobs-all-adva/

Barack Obama says United States only developed country without paid maternity leave
","President Barack Obama sent signs in the days leading up to the 2015 State of the Union address that he would once again call for Congress to require paid maternity leave for all workers. For those hoping he would, he didn’t disappoint. The push came as part of a package of ideas to help the middle class get ahead. "" Middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change,"" he said. ""That means helping folks afford child care, college, health care, a home, retirement  —  and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year."" Paid medical leave is one way to accomplish that, he said. ""Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers,"" he said. We’ll put aside the part about sick leave for this fact-check. Instead, let’s review whether the United States’ policies on maternity leave differ from the rest of the world. Obama made a similar statement in a Huffington Post op-ed last June. We rated it Mostly True. Since this is a big piece of Obama’s State of the Union legislative push, we thought a review was warranted. Under the Family Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. There are a couple of exceptions. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes, and Washington state passed a bill to establish paid maternity leave but later reversed course. Additionally, some employers offer paid maternity leave even though it’s not required. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 13 percent of workers had access to some kind of paid family leave, up 1 percentage point from 2013. Compared to the rest of the developed world, that’s very low. According to the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, the United States joins New Guinea as the two countries out of 170 that provide no cash benefits of any kind to women during maternity leave. Of the 41 other developed countries highlighted by the report, the United States also mandates the shortest period of time off — 12 weeks. Compare that to the U.K. and Australia, which each allow for a full year off (though not all of it is paid). Iceland has the second-shortest leave of developed countries at 13 weeks off, though it’s all paid. Of the developed countries, the United States is in a bracket with the smallest percentage of people receiving the benefit in practice, with an estimated 10 to 32 percent of the population eligible for paid leave. No other developed country is below 33 percent. However, paid maternity leave is not a universal benefit even in developed countries. Some countries exclude certain portions of their populations from eligibility, making it far from a universal benefit. Temporary workers do not receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don’t receive maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don’t get any in Japan. Canada, where about 66 to 89 percent of women are actually eligible for maternity leave, also excludes migrant workers and individuals that own more than 40 percent of their business, and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible. The result is that in some countries, large portions of the population don’t end up actually being covered. In Spain and Japan, between 33 and 65 percent of workers are eligible, the fewest other than the United States. The International Labor Organization also sets a standard for what countries should provide in a benefits package: 1) women should receive at least 14 weeks off; 2) They should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings; and 3) the benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or Social Security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks (and one of just 14 studied worldwide that didn’t check off any of the three). But six other countries fall short of at least one goal. Our ruling Obama said that the United States is the only advanced country on earth that doesn’t guarantee ""paid maternity leave to our workers."" Unless you live in one of three states that mandate it, paid maternity leave is not required, and it’s uncommon among employers. As a result, the United States has the smallest population of women eligible for paid maternity leave among developed countries. All developed countries surveyed by the International Labor Organization mandate at least some paid maternity leave. However, it’s worth noting that the benefit is not exactly universally enjoyed in parts of the developed world due to restrictions and exclusions on certain workers. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('President Barack Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/sotu'), ('PolitiFact, ""Barack Obama says U.S. differs from developed world on paid maternity leave,"" June 24, 2014', 'No link'), ('Huffington Post, ""Family-Friendly Workplace Policies Are Not Frills — They\'re Basic Needs,"" June 23, 2014', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-differs-developed-world-paid-/'), ('Email interview with Rachel Racusen, spokeswoman for President Barack Obama, June 23, 2014', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Oregon, ""Is paid maternity leave really the standard around the world?""

Are corporations able to claim religious exemptions under state proposal?
","As a proposed religious liberty bill begins to pick up steam in the new legislative session, so, too, does the controversy over just what the measure does. Opponents scuttled a proposal last year over concerns that it would effectively legalize discrimination against gays and other minority groups. State Rep. Sam Teasley, R-Marietta, retooled the proposal as House Bill 29 this year and said his intent is a law that prevents government from intruding on people’s faith-based beliefs. But the head of a gay advocacy group recently said the latest proposal would still allow private businesses to discriminate against customers by citing religious beliefs. ""It is my certainly my understanding that if corporations are not specifically excluded under state law, then corporations could still claim a religious exemption,"" Georgia Equality Executive Director Jeff Graham said in an interview with WABE radio.

So we decided to check: Does existing law require corporations to be specifically exempted for it not to apply to them? Reaching out to legal scholars from across the political spectrum, we found a rare agreement. Without that exemption, businesses can claim a religious exemption. Why? Think back to Mitt Romney being mocked for telling a heckler at the Iowa State Fair that ""corporations are people, my friend."" Legally, Romney is mostly right. In legal terms, corporations have had some of the same rights as you and I since the early 1800s. Those rights that allow government to regulate businesses much the same way it legislates some human actions, said Anne Tucker, a law professor at Georgia State University who specializes in business and corporate law. Corporations went on to gain the right to make political expenditures with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010. Then, the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores ruling last year affirmed that some for-private businesses also have religious rights. The basis for that ruling: the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. On top of that, Georgia code also clearly defines a person as ""an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a business trust, an association, a firm, or any other legal entity."" Combined, that creates the opportunity for all sorts of businesses – not just the ""closely held"" firms listed in the Hobby Lobby ruling – to potentially discriminate based on religious claims, legal experts said. To opponents, the mere opportunity is of concern in Georgia, which like the federal government does not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. ""Notwithstanding the guarantees of the author, and his intentions to limit it to state action, we have some reason to be concerned, because in the past those limitations haven’t been enough to protect people from discrimination in Georgia,"" said Tanya Washington, a law professor at Georgia State University whose amicus brief was cited in the Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Supporters of the measure, though, argue that the exemption should remain so that Georgia falls in line with existing Supreme Court rulings. ""They may not like it, but the fact is, that is what the law is,"" said Mathew Staver, founder of the conservative Liberty Counsel and law professor at Liberty University. ""I think it makes sense to have corporations, which are legal persons, have First Amendment protections for free exercise of religion just like they’ve had free speech rights in the past."" That controversy has proved distracting – and fatal to other proposed religious liberty bills in Georgia and elsewhere, such as Arizona. The AJC Legislative Navigator gives this year’s bill a 13 percent chance of passing in its current state. Mark Goldfeder, a law professor at Emory University who also is the senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Law and Religion, said there is an easy fix. The bill could be amended to define a person as only a ""natural person or religious organization,"" meaning only specific organizations, churches, temples and the like. Teasley plans to do just that. He told PolitiFact Georgia that he had heard of the claim about corporations being able to claim the exemption and put the question to legislative counsel. Like the outside scholars, the attorney for the Legislature agreed the measure would extend to businesses. Teasley said he plans to add the term ""natural person"" to the bill in a bid to achieve his original objective: Stop government overreach on an individual’s right to religious conscience. He said he plans that change in the next week. ""This should not be a controversial bill,"" Teasley said. ""This kind of thing used to bring Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals together, and I hope it can again."" That’s a fact check for a different day. But in the world of politics and religion, we have found the equivalent of a leprechaun riding a unicorn across a field of four-leaf clovers: complete consensus. The claim was whether the bill, as drafted, would allow businesses to claim religious exemptions. We rate it True.

It is the third.)","[('WABE.org, ""Religious freedom bill back on the legislative docket,"" Jan. 7, 2015', 'http://wabe.org/post/religious-freedom-bill-back-legislative-docket'), ('Georgia House Bill 29, prefiled', 'No link'), ('The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Legislative Navigator, House Bill 29, prefiled', 'http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20152016/145219.pdf'), ('Georgia Code, Title 50, State Government, Chapter 22 (§ 50-22-2)', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Mark Goldfeder, Senior Lecturer, Emory Law School and Senior Fellow, Center for the Study of Law and Religion, Jan. 14, 2015', 'http://legislativenavigator.myajc.com/#bills/HB/29'), ('Phone interview with Anne Tucker, associate professor of law, Georgia State University, Jan. 14, 2015', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Tanya Washington, associate professor of law, Georgia State University, Jan. 14, 2015', 'http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-50/chapter-22/50-22-2'), ('Phone interview with Mathew Staver, Chairman of Liberty Counsel and professor of law at Liberty University School of Law, Jan. 15', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/21/jeff-graham/are-corporations-able-claim-religious-exemptions-u/

Grocery shopping in Canada is possible without COVID-19 vaccination
","A Facebook video viewed by tens of thousands of people suggested that some Canadians are prohibited from securing food unless they have been vaccinated.

""Canada joins the no jab, no food trend,"" read the caption next to the hour-long Facebook live video in which a woman decried restrictions meant to curb the spread of COVID-19. She said people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot shop for groceries:""Now they have this headline, right: ‘No jab, no food.’ Can you imagine the terror of tyranny?"" The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim misrepresents a new policy enacted in just one Canadian province that allows business and retail, including grocery stores, the option of requiring proof of vaccination when physical distancing of 2 meters is not possible inside a store. The policy does not require any retail store to ask for proof of vaccination. It also does not preclude people who are unvaccinated from shopping for food in that province or the rest of the country. Beginning at the 37:31 mark in the Facebook video, the woman read a headline that said in the province of New Brunswick, grocery stores can ban unvaccinated shoppers — though the woman referred to unvaccinated people as ""unhexxed."" (PolitiFact has reported that some social media users are relying on coded language to escape detection by platform moderators on the lookout for misinformation about COVID-19.)

Here’s the reality: Under New Brunswick’s new COVID-19 Winter Action Plan to limit the seasonal spread of the virus, stores have the option to either enforce physical distancing — through measures such as one-way aisles and limiting the number of customers in stores — or require proof of COVID-19 vaccination. Stores ""have the option of requiring proof of vaccination from all patrons, but we will leave that decision up to individual businesses,"" New Brunswick Health Minister Dorothy Shephard told CBC News. The province’s public health agency said that major retailers in the province ""plan to enforce physical distancing instead of starting to require proof of COVID-19 vaccination,"" CBC News reported. Sobeys, one of only two national grocery retailers in Canada, said it will not be asking customers for proof of vaccination, a spokesperson told CBC News. A caption on a Facebook video said, ‘Canada joins the no jab, no food trend’ and the video went on to say people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot grocery shop in Canada. That’s inaccurate. The province of New Brunswick in Canada gave retail and grocery stores the option to either enforce physical distancing or require proof of vaccination against COVID-19.

No, getting the COVID-19 vaccine won’t weaken your immune system
","One of the many misinformed claims about COVID-19 vaccination is that it will weaken a person’s immune system and make them more susceptible to other viruses.  Here’s an example from The Exposé, which highlights a video of a doctor going over the negative effects of the COVID-19 vaccines. The headline said: ""Mayo Clinic-trained doctor says COVID-19 vaccines suppress the immune system, making people more prone to HIV, shingles and herpes."" The video features Dr. Ryan Cole, an Idaho-based derma-pathologist whose expertise is in skin disorders. It was taken from a longer interview Cole gave to anti-vaccination group Health Freedom Idaho where he spoke out against the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination mandates.  In the video, Cole claims the impact the vaccine has on the body is ""almost a reverse HIV,"" where there’s a drop in a person's T cell count. T cells are part of the body’s immune response, and they kill certain cells like cancer cells and virus-infected cells. Cole claimed he has seen a rise among vaccinated people developing different illnesses because of this lower T cell count, including herpes, shingles and human papillomavirus. He also claims to have seen a 20 times increase in people older than 50 developing a type of skin rash called molluscum contagiosum. ""That’s innocuous, but what it tells me is the immune status of these individuals who have gotten the shot,"" Cole says. ""We’re literally weakening the immune system of these individuals."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Cole to see if he could provide evidence that shows a direct link between the illnesses he listed in the video and the COVID-19 vaccines, but did not receive a response. PolitiFact looked into similar claims about the vaccines’ impact on a person's health, but have found no evidence getting a shot would weaken the immune system. The science doesn’t back Cole’s claim that the vaccines cause a lower T cell count. Studies published in scientific journals like Immunity and Science Immunology have found the vaccines actually boost a person’s T cell response, especially if they haven’t been infected with COVID-19 prior to their vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also found that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 doesn’t weaken the body’s immune response, it increases. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told PolitiFact that the idea the vaccines would weaken a person’s immune system isn’t supported by the available clinical trial data. ""This wasn't observed in any of the phase 3 trials, where complete blood counts were obtained,"" he said. A doctor claimed getting vaccinated against COVID-19 would weaken a person’s immune system and make them more susceptible to other illnesses. Studies into the efficacy of the vaccines have found that they actually strengthen a person’s immunity. There has been no evidence that links a weakened immune system to the COVID-19 vaccines.  We rate this claim False. ​","[('The Exposé, ""Mayo Clinic-trained Doctor Says Covid-19 Vaccines Suppress the Immune System, Making People More Prone to HIV, Shingles and Herpes,"" Nov. 22, 2021', 'https://dailyexpose.uk/2021/11/22/mayo-clinic-trained-doctor-says-covid-19-vaccines-suppress-the-immune-system-making-people-more-prone-to-hiv-shingles-and-herpes/'), ('Archive of Exposé article', 'No link'), ('Twitter post, Aug. 25, 2021', 'https://archive.ph/dYPsk'), ('Archive of Aug. 25, 2021 Twitter post', 'No link'), ('Idaho Board of Medicine, Ryan Cole medical license, accessed Dec. 7, 2021', 'https://twitter.com/ToTheLifeboats/status/1430589141344034816'), ('Bitchute, DR.

How far has the U.S. cut its reliance on coal compared to other countries?
","As the U.S. and global economies recover from the strains of the coronavirus pandemic, the demand for energy has outstripped supply, sending energy prices higher. With energy prices expected to remain high in the near future, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., called a meeting of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which he chairs, to hear testimony from experts on energy trends. During a discussion of carbon capture technologies — ways to capture, transport and bury atmospheric carbon dioxide deep underground  — Manchin cited several statistics about the trend lines during the past decade for coal-fired power plants.  Manchin said that China, India, and other major nations have increased the number of coal-fired power plants, while the U.S. has decreased its number. ""The United States had 589 (coal-fired plants) 10 years ago,"" Manchin said during the Nov. 16 hearing. ""We're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy."" We decided to check Manchin’s math. Manchin’s deputy press secretary, Jeremy Ortiz, told PolitiFact West Virginia that the senator was referring to coal plant data from the Global Energy Monitor, a nonprofit group that tracks energy data. The group’s Global Coal Plant Tracker collects data on all coal-fired power plants that generate at least 30 megawatts of power. Manchin’s figure for current coal-fired plants — 504 — is close to one of the figures in the Global Coal Plant Tracker database. However, Manchin used the wrong terminology to describe this number. Data from the tracker show that there are 498 coal-fired units in the U.S., and that’s not far from 504.  But notice what is being counted: units, rather than ""plants,"" which is the word Manchin used. The tracker’s database counts a much smaller number of coal-fired plants in the US. — 246. So what’s the difference? ""​​Units often consist of a boiler and turbine, and several units may make up one coal-fired power station,"" said Flora Champenois, a coal research analyst with the Global Energy Monitor. ""Interchanging the terms for plants and units is inaccurate."" For example, she said, the Clifty Creek station in Indiana is one power plant, but it operates six units. U.S. coal capacity did peak a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today, Champenois said. Low-carbon alternatives have increasingly become competitive with coal on price, and the shift away from coal has been reinforced by increased attention among utilities, governments and the public to carbon emissions’ role in driving climate change. Champenois added that while the U.S. has been retiring coal-fired plants at a ""record pace,"" it is not on track to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement, the global climate accord that the U.S. rejoined earlier this year. Champenois said that the U.S has retired more capacity, measured in gigawatts, than any other country since 2000, which supports Manchin’s assertion that no other country has reduced its reliance on coal for energy as much as the U.S. has. But many other countries have been cutting back, too. China has retired a lot more coal-fired units than the U.S. has, and many of the European Union’s 27 countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity, Champenois said. The EU has reduced coal consumption by half since 2015, Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute, told PolitiFact West Virginia That said, measuring the impact of these reductions in countries like China and India is tricky. Despite the pace of coal-fired retirements, China, India and the rest of the world have also added coal-fired power units, plants and capacity during the past decade, producing net increases in all three metrics. By contrast, the U.S. has seen decreases in all three. China has been adding non-coal assets at a faster pace than it’s adding coal-fired assets, meaning that coal’s share of its energy portfolio has been declining. ""Although China is increasing generation from coal, coal's share of Chinese generation has been declining since 2010, and China has announced its intention to reduce coal-fired generation starting in 2026,"" O’Leary said. Despite the complexities of measuring the global changes in coal use, O’Leary said that Manchin overstated how unusual the United States’ transition away from coal has been. ""The notion Manchin tried to convey, that the U.S. is alone in cutting reliance on coal while the rest of the world bounds ahead, is just plain wrong,"" O’Leary said.  Manchin said the U.S. had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and ""we're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy."" Manchin is broadly right to note that the U.S. has decreased its reliance on coal for generating electricity over the past decade, although he incorrectly labeled the units of measurement that went along with his figures. He also has a point that the U.S. has led the world in the number of retirements of coal-fired assets, but it’s worth noting that the U.S. is not alone, as other countries have also made significant cuts in coal-fired power over the same period.

Scott’s claim about hospital funding cuts ignores new subsidies in Build Back Better Act
","Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott regularly attacks the Democrats’ Build Back Better Act as a formula for more inflation and government overspending. But his latest criticism chastises the $1.75 trillion package for the money it would not spend. The bill would reduce the money that compensates hospitals for charity care. That’s when they treat patients and don’t recoup their costs, generally because the patient either has no insurance or has Medicaid, which doesn’t fully cover the cost of care.  Not every state would have to worry about this provision. The change targets the 12 states that rejected federal help to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. Florida is one of them. Scott’s office said in a Dec. 7 press release that he had sent a letter to Florida hospitals ""warning them of the dangerous provision within Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending bill that includes $34.5 billion in cuts to Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments (DSH) and states’ Uncompensated Care Pool (UCP) programs."" ""These programs are used to fund charity care by hospitals for patients who are uninsured and underinsured,"" the release said. Scott’s claim is accurate about the size of proposed cuts to charity care programs, but it provides an incomplete picture of the bill’s impact on health funding. He leaves out the estimated $43.8 billion in the Build Back Better Act to give private health insurance to the people who would have been covered under Medicaid expansion — money that would presumably reduce the need for federal spending on charity care. ""Claiming that the Build Back Better Act would slash charity funds without accounting for increased spending that would expand coverage, and so decrease the need for such charity funds, is misleading,"" said David Gamage, professor of health policy law at the University of Indiana. Scott’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. For decades, Medicaid has sent federal money to the states to help so-called disproportionate share hospitals. These are hospitals that treat especially large numbers of people without insurance or who are on Medicare or Medicaid. Washington also offered another pot of money that tackled the same problem for states that get permission to create their own uncompensated-care pools. For the 12 states that did not accept federal money to expand Medicaid eligibility, the Build Back Better Act would reduce the money for both programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2031, the total reduction will be about $34.5 billion. That’s the cut Scott cites. But the proposed cut in hospital aid wouldn’t take place in a vacuum. It is part of a strategy to insure people who have fallen through the cracks of government insurance programs. These are people who make too much or otherwise don’t qualify for Medicaid in their state, yet are too poor to qualify for the premium tax credits through the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which are available only to people above the poverty line. When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the idea was that between subsidized private-insurance premiums and making Medicaid available to more people, just about every legal resident would have access to some kind of insurance. (Adults living in the country without permission are not covered.) That assumed that every state would take advantage of federal help to expand Medicaid. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out, that created a group of people caught in the middle. These are people whose incomes are below the poverty line — many work in low-wage jobs — but they don’t qualify for their state’s Medicaid program because they make too much or don't have children. And they don’t qualify for subsidized private insurance, because the way the law was written, people below the federal poverty line aren’t eligible. Today, an estimated 2.2 million people fall in this gap. The 12 states where this matters are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Closing the gap has been a Democratic focus for some time. The Build Back Better Act aims to do so by steering more money to private insurance subsidies.  In its first four years, the Build Back Better Act would provide $59.3 billion to subsidize private insurance through the exchanges for the people caught in the gap. The aid ends in 2026.  Over the same period, it would reduce hospital aid by $13.9 billion. With more insured people, the reasoning goes, hospitals would need less money to cover uncompensated charity care. This trade-off is not a new idea. Melinda Buntin, formerly at the Congressional Budget Office and now a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, said it was written into the Affordable Care Act, even if repeatedly deferred. The law took the linkage for granted. ""The ACA clearly cut Disproportionate Share payments in anticipation of hospitals seeing fewer uninsured patients,"" Buntin said. Many studies show that when states expanded Medicaid, their hospitals benefited because they were treating fewer people without insurance. A review of those studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicaid expansion ""contributed to increased hospital revenue overall."" Medicaid might not fully reimburse a hospital for its costs, but even partial coverage was better than no payment at all.  For the most part, hospitals saw a drop in the level of uncompensated care. However, the foundation’s review noted that some hospitals did better than others. One study found that ""only hospitals in non-metropolitan areas and small hospitals experienced improved profit margins.""  In short, expanded insurance helps in general, but it is trickier to predict the impact on any particular hospital. Ideally, the number of uninsured people would drop before hospitals saw their federal compensation decline. The Build Back Better Act tries to account for that. Based on the CBO estimates, the new insurance premium subsidy would come in Year 1, and the first cut in uncompensated care funding would take place in Year 2. In the first four years, the bill would spend four times as much on helping people get insured as it would cut in hospital payments. (The subsidies would end after that, so over the 10 years, the net new spending would be $48.3 billion.) The Urban Institute, a Washington research center, ran the spending plan through its computer model and said ""in the years during which additional subsidies would be provided, hospitals overall would be substantially better off than they are under current law."" But again, the researchers cautioned that not all hospitals will necessarily do better. The reductions in government aid for them might not track with the increase in the number of insured patients. In particular, because only legal residents of the U.S. would be eligible for subsidies, ""hospitals serving a disproportionately high share of undocumented people would see less benefit,"" they wrote. Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, projected that most hospitals would be much better off, at least initially, under the proposals in the Build Back Better Act. If everything was in place by 2023, Fiedler estimated a gross gain of $11.9 billion in hospital margins across the 12 states that rejected Medicaid expansion. However, Fiedler told us that over a 10-year period, that wouldn’t last. The insurance subsidies would end, but the cuts would continue. ""That suggests that the bill, as written, would be roughly a wash, or a bit better than that, for hospitals,"" Fiedler said. Fiedler said you have to be careful when comparing the new money for insurance subsidies to the cuts in charity care. He said a lot of the money to expand insurance would eventually make its way to hospitals, but some would go to doctors and drug makers, and a smaller share would go to the insurance companies. A major point of contention is how many people would sign up for the newly available insurance, and how quickly. The fewer who do, the smaller the financial relief to hospitals that treat them. ""I don't buy the argument that all these people really value health insurance,"" said Joe Antos, a health policy analyst at the market-oriented American Enterprise Institute. ""They are used to being abused by the health system. Do you really think they will have a view that I will definitely buy this insurance?"" If the growth of the insured population doesn’t keep pace with the funding cuts, Antos said, he worries most about the ""true safety-net hospitals."" That said, no expert we talked to said the expansion of insurance wouldn’t provide some benefit to hospitals.  Scott said the Build Back Better Act includes $34.5 billion in cuts to charity care funding for hospitals. Scott’s claim is accurate about the size of proposed cuts to charity care programs, but it fails to account for the $43.8 billion in the bill to provide insurance to people who don’t have it today, which would reduce the need for charity care. The impact of the package on individual hospitals will vary, depending on how fast people sign up for new insurance and local conditions. But the experts we heard from agreed that both changes need to be assessed together. We rate this claim Half True.","[('Rick Scott, Sen.

Clots, heart problems from COVID-19 vaccines rare; deaths from the virus persist
","A Facebook user with 50,000 followers claimed that people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 face serious health risks, while the unvaccinated face only minor ones. ""When you have society choosing Blood Clots and Heart Problems over Cold and Flu Symptoms, or even NO symptoms at all,"" the post read, ""you know Critical Thinking is in short supply.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Some people, particularly those who are vaccinated, experience no symptoms or only mild ones with COVID-19.  But the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and continues to cause tens of thousands of hospitalizations, just in the United States. The more serious symptoms of COVID-19 include breathing problems, chest pain and confusion.  Blood clots and heart problems linked to the COVID-19 vaccines, meanwhile, are rare. Death and hospitalization figures from Our World in Data show that the toll of COVID-19 as of Dec. 8, the day before the post, is much greater than cold and flu symptoms. There have been 5.28 million confirmed COVID-19 deaths worldwide, including 791,514 in the United States.  The organization characterizes the tallies as an undercount, saying ""we know — based on reports and estimates of excess deaths — that these figures underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality globally."" There were 58,456 COVID-19 patients in a hospital in the United States on Dec. 8. That figure was as high as 133,268 on Jan. 14. PolitiFact fact-checks have found that unvaccinated people are several times more likely than vaccinated people to catch COVID-19, and to be hospitalized or die from it. We’ve also found that vaccination does more than help prevent infection among the vaccinated — it reduces the chances of COVID-19 spread among the general public. As for the COVID-19 vaccines, they have been associated with certain heart problems, but these are rare.  Cases of heart inflammation (myocarditis and pericarditis) have been reported after vaccination with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, run by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, received 1,949 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger who received COVID-19 vaccines, as of Nov. 24, according to the CDC.  Most cases have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), particularly in male adolescents and young adults. More than 437 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States. The CDC and FDA confirmed 1,071 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis, and the CDC is investigating whether there is a relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.  The CDC says most patients who received care for these conditions ""responded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly."" A study published Dec. 6 in an American Heart Association journal found that most cases of suspected COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis occurring in people under age 21 ""have a mild clinical course with rapid resolution of symptoms."" Experts say that COVID-19 itself presents much more danger to the heart than vaccines do. Blood clots associated with the vaccines also are extremely rare. A serious syndrome involving blood clots known as TTS is associated with one of the three COVID-19 vaccines — Johnson & Johnson — that are administered in the United States. As of Nov. 24, 2021, more than 16.4 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the United States, and the CDC and Food and Drug Administration identified 54 confirmed reports of people who got the vaccine and later developed TTS.

A seaworthy myth about alcohol aboard the U.S.S. Constitution
","Yo ho ho, and thousands of bottles of rum. The drunken tale of the U.S.S. Constitution on the cusp of the 19th century has been faring the internet waters for several years now, and though debunked, the story persists.  In one recent Facebook post about Old Ironsides, as the ship is known, it is said that the ""combat vessel carried 48,600 gallons of fresh water for her crew of 475 officers and men"" and that when she sailed from Boston in July 1798, ""79,400 gallons of rum"" were on board. Stopping in Jamaica in October, the crew collected 63,800 gallons more, and then 64,300 gallons of Portuguese wine in the Azores.  ""On 18 November, she set sail for England,"" the post continues. ""In the ensuing days she defeated five British men-of-war ships and captured and scuttled 12 English merchant ships, salvaging only the rum aboard each.""  By the time the boat returned to Boston in February 1799, the post says, there was ""no rum, no wine, no whisky, and 38,600 gallons of water.""  The story ends with a triumphant ""Go Navy!""  But as the U.S.S.

""The 79,400 gallons of rum on board at sailing is some eight times more than the ship ever carried,"" the blog post says about the story. ""Besides the extreme expense of so much rum, there was simply not room in the ship’s hold for the barrels, puncheons, hogsheads, and butts needed to contain it all.""  But let’s just say there was that much alcohol on board, and none when the ship returned.

Omicron is still being studied, but data in viral Facebook post is wrong
","The omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus screeched onto the global stage in late November, with ominous warnings about how fast it could spread and questions about whether it could evade vaccines. There’s a lot that scientists still don’t know about the variant that can only be learned with time and further research. But we spotted one lengthy and widely shared Facebook post that warned about omicron’s dangers and included some very specific data points we had not seen before. Among them: ""The toxicity of COVID-Omicron is 5 times higher than that of the Delta variant, and the mortality rate is also higher than that of Delta,"" the Dec. 4 post said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not clear where this data originated. We saw the same post being shared publicly by others as early as Dec. 3 with no source information. ""Toxicity"" is not a commonly referenced measure of COVID-19 variants, so it’s unclear what point the speaker was trying to make. And there is no evidence so far to support the claim that the mortality rate for omicron is higher than delta. Early indications suggest that omicron might result in milder illness. But it also appears to be highly transmissible. Because hospitalizations and deaths usually lag outbreaks of cases, experts still need time to study the trends. On whether the variant could be less severe, Dr. Emily S. Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told The New York Times, ""It would not be shocking if that’s true, but I’m not sure we can conclude that yet."" Omicron was first identified by researchers in South Africa, who reported it to the World Health Organization on Nov. 24. The WHO designated it as a variant of concern two days later, citing its large number of mutations; evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 reinfection with the variant; and the number of cases that were appearing in South Africa. The omicron variant has since been identified in at least 50 countries, including the United States. In a preliminary study published Dec. 2 that has not been peer-reviewed, scientists in South Africa said omicron was at least three times more likely to cause reinfection than previous coronavirus variants beta and delta. And newer studies, including from Pfizer and BioNTech, suggest ​​omicron can partially dodge immune defenses granted by vaccines, which seems to be strengthening the case for boosters, including the possibility of a fourth shot. As far as the harshness of illness goes, Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House chief medical adviser, on Dec. 5 said that further study is needed before anything definitive can be determined. ""Thus far,"" he said on CNN’s State of the Union show,  it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it."" In South Africa, hospital researchers said current patients are experiencing milder illness than those who had other variants of the virus, including delta. One doctor said symptoms of omicron that she has witnessed include fatigue and a scratchy throat, but no cough. And a very small study in South Africa of 42 patients admitted to a hospital between Nov. 14 and 29 showed that most didn’t need oxygen, and many had initially come to the hospital seeking treatment for other illnesses, not COVID-19. The study has not been peer-reviewed, and the researchers did not know how many of the COVID-19 patients were infected with the omicron variant, ""though the government reported last week that it already accounted for three-quarters of virus samples in South Africa,"" the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Harvard experts warned Dec. 7 that omicron could overtake delta as the dominant strain within a matter of weeks because of its transmissibility. That remains difficult to confirm until more information is available because conditions vary in each country, and the U.S. has much higher vaccination rates  than South Africa. A Facebook post says, ""The toxicity of COVID-Omicron is 5 times higher than that of the delta variant, and the mortality rate is also higher than that of Delta."" It’s not clear where these data points originate and we find no evidence of them in available research to date. Early evidence indicates omicron might result in milder illness. But research has found it is highly transmissible, can cause reinfection at a rate of at least three times higher than prior COVID-19 variants and has the power to elude some of the protections vaccines give. But more information is still needed, in part because hospitalizations and deaths usually lag outbreaks of cases. That said, there is nothing in the research so far that indicates the data reported in this post is accurate.

How unusual would it be to create a filibuster carve-out for voting rights?
","Democrats say that Republican efforts to change the laws on voting and elections could suppress voting and even overturn election results. They’ve responded with a bill of their own to establish federal standards on voting. The Freedom to Vote Act is pending in the Senate, but it’s facing unanimous Republican opposition in the evenly divided chamber. That means it doesn’t have enough support to reach the 60-vote threshold required to clear a filibuster and proceed to a final vote under typical Senate rules. This reality has led some Democrats to call for either ending the filibuster or at least carving out an exception to the filibuster rules to be used when considering voting-related legislation. Democrats argue that election rules are such a core facet of democracy that their protection shouldn’t be able to be blocked by a minority of senators. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said she’d personally favor ending the filibuster. But she also made a case to senators who are more protective of the filibuster: that a carve-out for voting rights would be justified, based on historical precedent.  ""I would abolish the filibuster, but even if you keep the filibuster in place, over time there have been 160-some carve-outs to the filibuster,"" Klobuchar said on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" on Dec. 5. ""The rules have changed over and over."" We immediately thought of a few examples of such carve-outs. They include executive-branch and judicial confirmations — notably, for Supreme Court nominees — which have shifted to simple-majority passage during the past decade. We also thought of budget reconciliation rules, which allow a simple majority to pass fiscal-related bills that follow a congressionally passed budget blueprint. (The Biden administration was able to pass the American Rescue Plan, a coronavirus relief bill, using reconciliation earlier this year, and it hopes to do the same with the Build Back Better bill that expands the social safety net.)  Another, more obscure category involves efforts to overturn administrative rules under the Congressional Review Act. Still, we certainly couldn’t think of 160 examples, so we decided to take a closer look at Klobuchar’s assertion.  We found that Klobuchar’s number was roughly accurate, although the kinds of carve-outs she was referencing are different from what would be needed to create a carve-out for voting rights. As support for the statistic she offered on ""Meet the Press,"" Klobuchar’s office pointed to research by Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Specifically, Klobuchar’s office pointed to data from a chapter in Reynolds’ 2017 book, ""Exceptions to the Rule: The Politics of Filibuster Limitations in the U.S. Senate."" In the book, Reynolds collected 161 examples of the Senate establishing work-arounds to the ordinary 60-vote requirement to push past a filibuster. Reynolds confirmed to PolitiFact that the number Klobuchar cited accurately reflects the research. However, she and other experts on Senate procedure noted some caveats. Not all carve-outs are equal. Reynolds said that many of the exceptions, such as those involving arms sales to foreign countries, are not as sweeping and significant a category as voting rights.  ""In some cases, very similar procedures are counted separately,"" Reynolds told PolitiFact. For instance, she said, the Arms Export Control Act has several related but distinct exceptions for measures on reviewing proposed arms sales. Reynolds counted each of these as separate exceptions, but she said one could reasonably group them together, producing a much smaller number of exceptions than 161. In addition, many of the simple-majority provisions that make up that total ""simply force symbolic votes rather than making actual policy changes,"" she said. Finally, some of the 161 provisions have never become operational, while others were designed to be temporary and have lapsed. In order to enact a voting-rights carve-out, senators would have to use the same process that was used to make judicial and executive branch appointments simple-majority votes during the past decade. It’s a multi-step process that has sometimes been called the ""nuclear option."" Essentially, the majority leader would need to offer a ""point of order"" stating that a simple-majority vote is called for on the current question. This would be rejected by the chair based on precedent, then immediately appealed. This would trigger a simple-majority vote on whether to overturn the chair’s ruling. Once that simple majority is achieved, the new vote threshold would become the precedent going forward. While Democrats don’t yet have the 51 votes to support a carve-out for voting rights, this scenario is the most realistic one for them to use to create a simple-majority vote for voting rights. However, this was not the process used for the vast majority of the 161 prior examples. Rather, most of those 161 examples were created by passage and enactment of a statute, or ordinary law. This means that, at some point, most of these 161 exceptions themselves had to pass a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.  The odds of enacting a carve-out are long, given the reluctance of a few Democrats (and all Republicans) to get on board. But it’s not impossible, experts said. ""When the political and policy incentives are aligned, the Senate has shown a willingness to write new procedures protecting certain legislation from a filibuster,"" Reynolds said.  She said one of the most common reasons to enact a simple-majority vote occurs when Congress wants to avoid blame for making a politically tough decision. In that scenario, leaders decide that a simple-majority vote is the most painless way to get it done.  In fact, this phenomenon has been playing out in recent days, as congressional leaders search for a way to lift the debt ceiling — a move that is necessary for financial stability but which can be used by challengers as a way to paint those who voted for the debt increase as profligate spenders. Still, if a carve-out for voting rights is enacted, the distinction between a carve-out and total filibuster reform may one day disappear, said Josh Ryan, a Utah State University political scientist and specialist in Senate procedure. ""You could easily imagine each new Senate majority carving out additional exceptions for authorizing legislative topics,"" leaving little if anything still covered by the filibuster, Ryan said. Klobuchar said, ""Even if you keep the filibuster in place, over time there have been 160-some carve-outs to the filibuster."" This number is supported by academic research, though there are important differences between what Klobuchar is seeking for the voting-rights bill and what most of the 160-odd prior examples involved.  Many of the past examples are significantly less sweeping than voting rights, and the vast majority had to clear a 60-vote threshold at some point on their way to being enacted, unlike the voting rights carve-out being proposed. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","[('Amy Klobuchar, interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Dec. 5, 2021', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/news/meet-press-december-5-2021-n1285375'), ('Molly Reynolds, ""Exceptions to the Rule: The Politics of Filibuster Limitations in the U.S. Senate,"" 2017', 'No link'), ('Roll Call, ""House passes debt limit process, Medicare cuts delay bill,"" Dec. 7, 2021', 'https://www.amazon.com/Exceptions-Rule-Politics-Filibuster-Limitations/dp/0815729960'), ('Email interview with Josh Ryan, Utah State University political scientist, Dec. 8-9, 2021', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Molly Reynolds, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, Dec. 8-9, 2021', 'https://www.rollcall.com/2021/12/07/fast-track-debt-limit-process-added-to-spending-cuts-delay-bill/')]",/factchecks/2021/dec/09/amy-klobuchar/how-unusual-would-it-be-create-filibuster-carve-ou/

Electric vehicles not likely to stop functioning from using climate settings during a traffic jam
","A viral Facebook post suggests that electric vehicle advocates have overlooked a fundamental flaw that would make the cars prone to failure and dangerous to their owners in the event of a massive traffic jam. The post shows a photo of a road packed with vehicles at a standstill and says, ""Imagine all of these vehicles being electric powered. It’s 93 degrees outside. A major accident has rendered going anywhere impossible for hours. People are running their AC until all batteries go dead. You can’t jumpstart these cars and trucks like a gas or diesel powered vehicle. They have to be plugged in until recharged. The brains behind the EV movement don't have this figured out. These folks will die from heat, while in cold weather states, people will freeze to death. What do you say to that, Greta Thunberg?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post implies that electric vehicles are more susceptible to this type of failure than internal combustion cars. But that misunderstands how EVs and their batteries work. Many variables would affect how an EV performs in the situations described in the post compared with an internal-combustion vehicle, including how much fuel or battery power the vehicles started out with, the size of the engine, the capacity of the fuel tank or battery, and the weather — car batteries don’t do as well in the cold. But there’s one key difference between the two propulsion systems: While an internal-combustion car’s engine stays on and burns fuel while idling, electric vehicles use little battery power when at a standstill.   ""The motor doesn’t consume power at zero speed,"" David Howey, associate professor in engineering science at the University of Oxford’s Department of Engineering Science, told Reuters. ""Only the car electronics and heating/cooling systems use power when the car is stationary, and the amounts are relatively small."" Peter Wells, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School in Wales, puts it like this: The average U.S. house uses 30 kilowatt-hours of power per day, so a fully charged 62 kilowatt-hour battery in an electric car could power a house for two days. Even half-charged, a 62 kWh battery could yield 10 to 15 hours of heating in a car that’s stationary during a traffic jam, Wells said. A gasoline car’s heating or air conditioning, on the other hand, wouldn’t be able to operate without the engine running and consuming fuel to power the compressor and other parts. A British consumer watchdog group tested an electric vehicle’s battery performance during a simulated traffic jam. Using a Volkswagen ID.4 sport utility vehicle, the testers streamed music, turned on the car’s heated seats to maximum settings, turned on the air conditioner, turned on the headlights and used the car’s USB socket to charge a tablet that was playing a movie. After 75 minutes of using all of those functions while the car was stationary, the car’s main 77 kWh battery lost 2% of its power, equal to 8 miles of driving range. ""In short, a very small amount of the electric car’s battery was used to keep the car comfortable,"" the testers concluded. By comparison, idling the engine in a large car or light truck while in a traffic jam might use half a gallon of gas per hour, Wells said, and much more if it is stop-and-go traffic. A Facebook post says electric vehicles are more prone to a failure in standstill traffic where heating or air conditioning is required. The post misunderstands the way EVs and their batteries work. Electric vehicles use little power when at a standstill, and their climate settings also do not require much power. An electric vehicle with a full battery would have enough energy to operate for a day or longer while stationary during a traffic jam, even while using air conditioning or heating. We rate the claim that electric vehicles are more likely to fail in traffic jams False. ","[('Email interview, Peter Wells, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School, Dec. 9, 2021', 'https://archive.md/qXENZ'), ('Facebook post, Nov. 27, 2021', 'No link'), ('Reuters, ""Fact Check-Electric cars not more likely to get stuck in traffic jams,"" Nov. 5, 2021', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-environment-ev-idUSL1N2RW0QD?fbclid=IwAR0HMnIBV6fDIJIILnW_xsAg9qrV8eRsqpDLTEg3sjwCe48D1uJBjFz5XFs'), ('Which?

No, COVID-19 vaccines do not increase the transmission of the virus
","New COVID-19 cases have been surging in Germany, and much of Europe, in recent weeks, prompting outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel to announce new restrictions on the unvaccinated and the CDC and the U.S. State Department to issue travel advisories to Americans to avoid traveling to the country. In a seven-day stretch ending Dec. 7, Germany reported an average of 55,379 new cases per day, according to data from Reuters. While the vast majority of the cases are among the unvaccinated, there has also been a significant increase in breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people over age 60, according to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s state infectious-disease agency. Some are using that data to falsely state that vaccines are increasing the spread of COVID-19. ""COVID-19 vaccines do not stop transmission of COVID, but instead increase it"" declares a headline on a video shared on Facebook that claims new research shows vaccines have failed to halt transmission of the virus. This video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video is hosted on a site called BitChute, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as a service that ""has become a hotbed for violent, conspiratorial and hate-filled video propaganda."" The two-minute video is a clip from a broadcast of RT, formerly known as Russia Today, an American cable television network funded by the Russian government. In it, a reporter for the network quotes what she says is a medical study published in the medical journal The Lancet, saying that new research shows that among new cases involving people over age 60, the percentage that are breakthrough infections increased from 16.9% in July to 58.9% in October. She goes on to say that this shows that fully vaccinated people are a major source of COVID transmission. Below the video, there is a link to a RT article on the topic, with the headline ""Mass vaccination fails to halt Covid transmission rates – study."" However, the ""medical study"" referenced in the video and the story is not a study, but rather an opinion letter published in The Lancet, written by Günter Kampf, a professor at the University of Greifswald’s Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine in Germany. That letter links to statistics from the Robert Koch Institute. The Lancet says on its website that it publishes correspondence from readers and that they ""are not normally externally peer reviewed."" The Robert Koch Institute said on its website that ""the extent to which the vaccination reduces the transmission of the virus cannot currently be precisely quantified,"" but that ""all in all, the risk that people will become PCR-positive despite vaccination and transmit the virus is significantly reduced."" It goes on to recommend booster shots due to the vaccines’ waning efficacy over time.  The Koch Institute explains on its website that ""a high number of active cases and a relatively high vaccination rate can therefore lead to an increase in the number of vaccination breakthroughs."" The Koch Institute said in a flier and in a Twitter thread that it’s misleading to talk of the percentage of breakthrough infections in a group without noting the fact that the vast majority of that population is vaccinated. Most of the cases and hospitalizations come from the unvaccinated population, the Twitter thread said. The Institute’s flier says, ""a high proportion of those vaccinated among COVID-19 patients in hospital does not mean that the vaccination is not working.""  Germany has fully vaccinated 69% of its citizens, while 72% have received at least one dose, according to figures from Our World in Data published by The New York Times. That vaccination rate is better than many countries. However, it’s not high enough to stop the latest surge in cases in Germany, Dr. Susanne Herold, of the University Hospital of Giessen, told the Times. Only 18% of Germans have received a booster shot of the vaccine, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends as protections from the vaccine lessen over time. The rise in cases in Germany coincides with a surge of the more contagious delta variant of the virus, according to CNN. The delta variant is more than twice as contagious as previous variants, the CDC said. The video and the RT story also mislead on the results of a different study in the U.K., cherry-picking one part and saying ""throughout Britain, the number of household contacts exposed to unvaccinated cases (23%) was slightly lower than the number exposed to vaccinated individuals (25%)."" The study by the Imperial College of London said ​​that people with breakthrough cases ""infected 25% of their household contacts,"" while 23% of contacts exposed to unvaccinated COVID patients became infected. The study goes on to say that head-to-head comparison is difficult because of the small sample size and the fact that the study compares different age groups. The study’s authors concluded that ""​​fully vaccinated people can contract and pass on COVID-19 in the home, but at lower rates than unvaccinated people."" Overall, it said that about 25% of fully vaccinated household contacts tested positive for COVID-19, compared with 38% of unvaccinated people. Professor Ajit Lalvani, co-author of the study, said that ""vaccines are critical to controlling the pandemic"" as they prevent serious illness and death, but the study shows that vaccination alone isn’t enough to prevent the spread of the delta variant in household settings. According to the CDC, no vaccine is 100% effective and breakthrough infections were always expected. That doesn't mean the vaccine isn’t working. The good news for those fully vaccinated people who get infected is that symptoms are generally less severe and they are less likely to be hospitalized or die, the CDC says. Unvaccinated people had a 5.8 times greater chance of contracting the virus and a 14 times greater chance of dying than unvaccinated people in September, the CDC said.  PolitiFact, while debunking a similar claim in October, found that the biggest threat to unvaccinated people is other unvaccinated people. A headline and video claim that ""COVID-19 vaccines do not stop transmission of COVID, but instead increase it."" As proof, it cites statistics from a recent surge in breakthrough cases among people over 60 in Germany. While breakthrough infections have risen in Germany among people over 60, it’s misleading to say the vaccines do not stop transmission of the virus and wrong to say it increases it.

The claim fails to take into account that there are far more vaccinated people than unvaccinated in Germany, that the delta variant is more highly contagious than previous versions of the virus, and that the effectiveness of vaccines wanes over time, particularly among the elderly, who often received them earlier than others and have not yet gotten booster shots. We rate this claim False.","[('CBS, ""Germany announces major restrictions on the unvaccinated as COVID cases surge,"" Dec. 2, 2021', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/germany-covid-vaccine-restrictions/'), ('CDC, ""COVID-19 in Germany""', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of State, ""Germany travel advisory,"" Nov. 22, 2021', 'https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-4/coronavirus-germany'), ('Reuters, ""Germany COVID tracker,"" Dec. 8, 2021', 'No link'), ('ADL, ""BitChute: A hotbed of hate,"" Aug. 31, 2020', 'https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/germany-travel-advisory.html'), ('The Lancet, ""For authors: What we publish""', 'No link'), ('The New York Times, ""Tracking Coronavirus Vaccinations Around the World,"" Dec. 7, 2021', 'https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/germany/'), ('The New York Times, ""Germany’s Fourth Covid Wave: ‘A Pandemic of the Unvaccinated’,"" Nov. 11, 2021', 'No link'), ('CDC, ""Delta Variant: What We Know About the Science,"" Aug. 26, 2021', 'https://www.adl.org/blog/bitchute-a-hotbed-of-hate'), ('CDC, ""What We Know about Vaccine Breakthrough Infections,"" updated Nov. 9, 2021', 'No link'), ('CDC, ""COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shots,"" updated Nov. 29, 2021', 'https://www.thelancet.com/what-we-publish'), ('CDC, ""Rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths by vaccination status""', 'No link'), ('CNN, ""Germany offers booster shots to everyone amid \'very worrying\' surge in cases,"" Nov. 5, 2021', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html'), ('Robert Koch Institute, ""Weekly report from Oct. 28, 2021""', 'No link'), ('Robert Koch Institute, ""Effectiveness (as of: December 7th, 2021)""', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/world/europe/germany-covid-unvaccinated.html'), ('Imperial College of London, ""COVID vaccines effective but household transmission of delta a risk for 1 in 4,"" Oct. 28, 2021', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Key threat to unvaccinated people is other unvaccinated people,"" Oct. 24, 2021', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html')]",/factchecks/2021/dec/09/facebook-posts/no-covid-19-vaccines-do-not-increase-transmission-/
"['Gas Prices', 'Donald Trump']","
No, gas did not cost $1.86 a gallon when Donald Trump left the White House
","Former President Donald Trump took multiple shots at his successor, Joe Biden, during an interview with conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt. Among them: an attack on Biden for a rise in gasoline prices. Here’s an exchange from the Dec. 8 interview: Trump: ""Energy prices — we were energy independent, and now we’re going begging, ‘OPEC please send us oil, we have no oil, please send us oil.’ California just hit $7, $7.75 in certain areas of California. Can you believe it?"" Hewitt: ""I can’t."" Trump: ""It was $1.86 when I left."" We have previously written that gas prices are currently at their highest levels since 2014, and that the year-over-year rise is among the highest in at least 30 years. We follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions. Support our mission today.  However, Trump is wrong that the price per gallon ""was $1.86 when I left"" the White House. (Trump’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) We turned to the price data collected by the federal Energy Information Administration. The national average price of a gallon of gasoline for the week of Jan. 18, 2021, was $2.38, or about 28% higher than what Trump said it was.    The only time the national average gasoline price reached as low as $1.86 under Trump was in March 2020, at the very beginning of the pandemic, when demand cratered due to lockdowns and business closures. If Trump was intending to refer to California, which he had mentioned in his previous sentence, he would be even further off. The state has some of the highest prices in the country. That week, the average price in California was $3.21, or 73% higher than what Trump said. During Biden’s term in office, the average weekly price in California has risen as high as about $4.55,  but nowhere near $7.   In Texas, which typically has among the lowest gas prices, the average price that week was just under $2.10; in Houston, it was $2.06. ""In no U.S. city or state was the average price of gasoline $1.86 per gallon on Jan. 20, 2021,"" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis with GasBuddy. De Haan added that in some states, there were probably individual stations selling gas for $1.86 a gallon on that date, but there were also stations in Orlando, Fla., at $5.95 per gallon. So at best, Trump would be engaging in extreme cherry-picking by highlighting an unrepresentative price as typical as he was exiting the White House. And a final reminder: In general, a president, whether Trump or Biden, has limited control over the weekly and monthly shifts in gasoline prices. On a short-time horizon, gas prices depend mostly on global supply and demand.  Under both presidents, the coronavirus pandemic played a major role. The lowest prices under Trump came during plunging demand, while the higher prices under Biden have been shaped by rising demand during the economic recovery. Trump said that gasoline prices were $1.86 a gallon when he left office. The national average price for gasoline when Trump left the White House was actually $2.38, or about 28% higher than what Trump said.

Fake New Zealand poster targets vaccine refusers
","In July 2020, New Zealand Prime Minister launched a new slogan for her Labour Party in a race for re-election that she would go on to win by a landslide: ""Let’s keep moving."" More than a year later, social media users started circulating an altered version of a political poster that had promoted the Labour Party’s slogan shortly after it was rolled out.

""Remember to book your Christmas booster!"" it reads, alongside a headshot of Ardern and a Labour Party logo. ""Each booster gives you up to six months worth of freedoms."" In small font beneath the party’s logo, the fake poster adds a link to a website that doesn’t exist, plus a disclaimer warning, ""Freedoms not available in all areas and are subject to change.""

Many reporters are covering the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, despite claims otherwise
","Since Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial started on Nov. 29, misinformation has spread about how the sex trafficking case is playing out in the courtroom.  We’ve already debunked claims that a late designer was a co-defendant in the trial and that the ""hysteria"" around the omicron variant was timed to coincide and distract from the legal proceedings.    Another recent claim, that only one reporter is covering the trial, is also false.  ""Can you believe this trial is uncovering the largest sex trafficking caes in our entire world and there’s only one reporter on site?"" the Dec. 6 post says.

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ghislaine Maxwell was a friend of financier Jeffrey Epstein and she is accused of helping him sexually abuse minors. She has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sex trafficking a minor, sex trafficking conspiracy, transporting a minor for the purposes of criminal sexual activity, and conspiring to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts.  As we’ve previously reported, the media isn’t allowed to have cameras in the courtroom. Maxwell is being tried in federal court where, with few exceptions, cameras and recording devices have not been allowed for decades.  Any photographing, recording, or rebroadcasting of the proceedings is prohibited by law, according to the Department of Justice, though there are overflow rooms in the courthouse for reporters and spectators where they can watch live feeds of the trial.  But that doesn’t mean reporters aren’t there. They are — and plenty of them.  Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown, who in 2017 broke many of the stories that brought worldwide attention to circumstances that led to the case, has tweeted about her experiences waiting to get into the courthouse and about what she’s witnessing during the trial. Brown spoke on Reliable Sources about the conspiracy theories that the media isn’t covering the trial: ""There’s so many media there that there’s, some days, three overflow courtrooms full of the public and media. So that isn’t an issue. The issue is the access to the actual courtroom where this is happening and the fact that there is a limited number of people who can actually get in."" CNN reporter Lauren del Valle has filed stories and tweeted about the trial. The New York Times, the New York Post, the Independent and the Associated Press have been providing live updates from the trial.
