New York gives more aid for private college students than almost any other state
","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed free college tuition for resident students in families that earn $125,000 or less a year -- but only at the state’s public colleges and universities. Private colleges worry about their enrollment and finances if the plan passes. It wouldn’t be an even playing field, the private colleges say. Cuomo fired back at the critics at a Buffalo rally to promote his idea. ""We happen to subsidize private colleges probably more than any other state except maybe one,"" Cuomo said. Is Cuomo right? State tuition aid  The National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, which tracks college financial aid, said New York state provided $253 million in need-based grants to students attending not-for-profit private colleges in the state. That’s how much the state gave in the 2014-2015 school year, the most-recent available year for data. Only Texas offered more, giving private college students $289 million in all. Need-based grant programs vary widely among states, making it hard to rank per capita spending by state. Overall aid per student is difficult to track because students in some states can take advantage of multiple aid programs. So while it's possible to know how many students benefited from an individual program, no one keeps track nationally how much individual students receive from multiple programs.     Other states give more to individual students. The maximum award from New York state’s Tuition Assistance Program is $5,165 a year. Students in California could be eligible to receive more than double that amount. New York state’s average need-based award for private college students -- $3,200 -- is also lower than in other large states. Private college students in California receive about $8,500 on average. But New York state has more aid recipients than other states. The latest data shows nearly 79,000 private college students in New York state take advantage of the need-based TAP aid, while only about 28,000 are given comparable aid in California. Percentage of state aid Despite New York's No. 2 ranking in total aid, 15 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., allocate a higher percentage of their total need-based aid to private college students. Two-thirds of New York's need-based grant aid goes to public college students. Iowa gives 80 percent of need-based grants to students at not-for-profit private colleges.  What about merit aid? On a different kind of college assistance -- merit aid -- New York ranks first in awarding $5.5 million to private college students. About 52 percent of the total merit aid went to private college students. Our ruling Cuomo said New York state subsidizes private colleges ""probably more than any other state except maybe one."" Data from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs shows New York state ranks second behind Texas in dollar amount of aid given to private school students.  We rate this claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5f547ed7-141f-4771-8d7e-df2095b52f90",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC884180>],/factchecks/2017/feb/16/andrew-cuomo/new-york-gives-more-aid-private-college-students-a/

Trump hints stock market record high linked to optimism about his presidency
","As he lauded his first month in office, President Donald Trump reaffirmed his promise to create jobs by citing the progress of the stock market as signaling a promising business environment. ""The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world,"" Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. ""To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ‘Oh, that's good.’ Now it means, ‘That's good for jobs.’ Very different."" Trump had sent a similar message earlier in the day, tweeting: ""Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!"" Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout! All three major stock indexes closed at record highs for five days in row on Feb. 15. But does Trump get credit for that, as he suggested? Experts told us there are nuances. Stock market winning streaks The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies. All three major indexes on Feb. 15 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day. It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by CNNMoney and MarketWatch. MarketWatch countered part of Trump’s tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn’t ""the longest winning streak in decades."" ""Rather, it’s the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century … In terms of winning streaks, the S&P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That’s according to Dow Jones data,"" wrote MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks here and here.) Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump’s promised tax and regulation cuts, though that’s not the sole driver of the stock market highs. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says ""wasteful and unnecessary"" regulation kills jobs and stop businesses from growing. Trump also has promised to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. In meetings with CEOs of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he’d like to get rid of 75 percent of regulations, ""maybe more."" He has also tweeted about a border tax for imports. ""I would definitely say Trump gets credit,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&P 500 returns are up 3.8 percent from Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, said Stovall, who has studied the market’s returns during each president’s first month dating back to President Herbert Hoover in 1929. Amid the recession and during Obama's first month in office in 2009, returns fell 9.4 percent, Stovall said. They rose 1.4 percent during Obama's first month in office in his second term, according to Stovall's study. Tim Duy, an economist and professor at the University of Oregon, said the economy was poised for relative strength as the end of 2016 approached, regardless of Trump’s inauguration. ""Underlying growth remained solid, and it increasingly looked like some of the inventory overhang of the previous year was easing,"" Duy said. Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that’d been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added. ""The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down,"" Duy said. ""In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level."" It’s still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn’t the dominant factor, Duy said. Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than the previous month but based on 584,000 more people looking for jobs after accounting for annual adjustments to population controls, according to Feb. 3 BLS figures. ""Consumer confidence decreased in January, after reaching a 15-year high in December,"" said in a Jan. 31 statement Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, which presents the Consumer Confidence Index based on a monthly survey. ""The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers’ income prospects. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January,"" Franco said. ""Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months."" Trump certainly isn’t the first to boast about the stock market’s performance. In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there’s a Democratic president. While several calculations backed her statement, we rated her claim Mostly True because experts said several other factors are key in determining performance, including timing, policies and international economic trends. Our ruling Trump said, ""The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world."" The three major stock indexes, Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed at record highs for five consecutive days. While investors are optimistic about Trump’s plans to cut taxes and eliminate regulations, experts say other factors play influential roles in the stock market. After rising in December, consumer confidence dropped in January, though consumers are confident the economy will expand in coming months. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA97DC0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/trump-hints-stock-market-record-high-linked-presid/

Trump 'caught investing' in Dakota Access Pipeline before approving it, website says
","A left-leaning blog asserts that President Donald Trump was busted for approving the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline for financial gain, but the facts of the case ended up being buried. ""Breaking: Trump caught investing in Dakota Pipeline before signing it,"" read the headline on an undated post on LearnProgress.org. The blog regularly posts items lambasting Trump and his policies. Facebook flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of its efforts to weed out fake news in its users’ feeds. Most instances of the story being shared on Facebook are on Feb. 8, 2017. The website did not answer our request to confirm the date. But the implication that Trump approved the pipeline in order to profit from its construction doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. In the post, LearnProgress.org cited a Nov. 26, 2016, Associated Press report that showed Trump owned shares in two companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois. Environmentalists and Native American tribes have opposed the route of the pipeline, and in December then-President Barack Obama blocked completion of the project. The AP story pointed out that Trump owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock for a Texas company called Energy Transfer Partners. He had between $500,000 and $1 million the year before that. He also owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in stock in energy company Phillips 66, which the AP says has a one-quarter share of the pipeline. This was considered a potential conflict of interest for the future president, but to say he was ""caught"" is out of bounds. He listed the information on May 2016 federal disclosure forms. Much has been made of Trump’s stock in the companies. The issue was reported on widely, as was the fact that he said he sold the shares of pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners in the summer of 2016. The White House has not confirmed whether he still owns the Phillips 66 shares, so that does remain a question mark. A Trump spokesman we contacted did not answer our questions about those shares. In any event, the headline suggests that Trump dumped a bunch of money into the pipeline and then approved its construction, ostensibly to make a big profit from it. The timeline doesn’t support that. Trump said in December 2016, before his inauguration, that he would restart pipeline construction. He didn’t have any actual power to do so until Jan. 20, 2017, well after he sold his Energy Transfer Partners stock. He did sign an executive action on Jan. 24 to get the pipeline moving again. Construction resumed on Feb. 9, and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe challenged the pipeline in court on Feb. 14. The headline’s assertion that Trump was caught in some kind of wrongdoing by investing in the pipeline before approving it is wrong and misleading. The potential conflict of interest was known and at least partially addressed before Trump became president and restarted the project. We rate the headline False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA065C0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/16/learnprogressorg/trump-caught-investing-dakota-access-pipeline-appr/

Is news media less trusted than Congress?
","In a wide-ranging news conference, President Donald Trump said a few nice things about the media and quite a few not-so-nice things. While he acknowledged that there are good reporters, his opening salvo was strongly critical. ""The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about (it), we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people,"" Trump said. ""Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control."" Later, Trump compared the media with Congress. ""You have a lower approval rate than Congress, I think that's right, I don't know,"" Trump said. ""I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress."" Trump gave himself some wiggle room on the accuracy of that, but he still made the point. To set the record straight: The press does rank low in the trust department, but Congress ranks even lower. The latest numbers come from Gallup, which has been asking people how much confidence they have in various institutions since 1973. As of June 2016, 40 percent of the public had a negative opinion of television news, but 55 percent weighed in on the negative side for Congress. Newspapers did a hair better in the mistrust department. About a third of the people surveyed said they had very little or no trust in the printed press. Positive Negative Newspapers 20% 36% Television 21% 40% Congress 9% 55% Looking at the numbers in net terms (positive minus negative), newspapers and television have an average net rating of minus 18 percent. But Congress’ net is minus 44 percent. Other surveys might have different numbers, but the thrust remains the same. Hefty fractions of the public might have a bad feeling about the news media, but they feel even worse about Congress. A 2016 Pew Research Center survey asked people if they trusted what they heard from national news organizations and 24 percent said ""not too much"" or ""not at all."" A 2015 survey found that 69 percent viewed Congress unfavorably. The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polled the public in 2014. They reported that ""over half of Americans say they have hardly any confidence at all in Congress."" The comparable measure for the press was 44 percent. Again, trust in news media might be low, but Congress comes in lower. It’s worth noting how low both institutions score in this chart about public confidence from Gallup:  Our ruling Trump said he thought that the media had lower favorability ratings than Congress. But Congress actually ranks below the news media, according to surveys from three different research groups spanning several years. In two polls, mistrust in the media broke 40 percent, which is hardly anything to brag about. But in those studies, mistrust in Congress was over 50 percent. Trump had a point that the media has a trust issue, but he got the ranking wrong in terms of Congress. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5ffb7a0-03e5-4e96-961c-886767c0397d",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB1E4C0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/news-media-less-trusted-congress/

Trump's flip-flop on leaks and the release of secret information
","""Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks!"" -- Nov. 4, 2016 ""The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers!"" -- Feb. 16, 2017 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump couldn’t get enough of the private emails of senior Democrats released by WikiLeaks. ""Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks!"" Trump said on Nov. 4 at a rally in Wilmington, Ohio. He also touted the fruits of WikiLeaks disclosures on Oct. 31 in Warren, Mich., on Nov. 2 in Orlando and Pensacola, Fla., and Nov. 6 in Sioux City, Iowa. Trump even called on Russia to locate and release emails by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" he said during a press conference at the Trump National Doral golf course on July 27. But now Trump is assailing leaks from the intelligence community to the New York Times that led to the quick departure of Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The articles cited anonymous officials saying that during the presidential transition, Flynn had been in contact with Russia about the sanctions that had recently imposed by the Obama administration. At a Feb. 15 press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump lamented that Flynn -- ""a wonderful man"" -- had been treated ""very, very unfairly"" by the media. ""Papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,"" Trump said. ""It’s criminal actions ... and it’s been going on for a long time -- before me. But now it’s really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton."" He followed up with several tweets between Feb. 14 and 16, such as this one from Feb. 16: ""Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!"" And at a press conference the same day, he spent time criticizing leaks. ""The press should be ashamed of themselves"" for running stories based on leaks, Trump told reporters. So is this a flip-flop? Before we start, we should emphasize that our Flip-O-Meter judges whether someone has been consistent on an issue. The rating is not making a value judgment, but simply noting if a change of position has happened. In this case, there are some differences between the election leaks and the leaks by the intelligence community. However, experts on national security told us that Trump has shown inconsistent standards. We’ll note that Trump doesn’t think it’s a change in position. Pressed on the question at his Feb. 16 news conference, Trump drew a distinction between the release of classified information (the leaks on Flynn and Russia) and the release of personal emails (WikiLeaks and the Democratic National Committee). ""In one case, you're talking about highly classified information,"" Trump said. ""In the other case, you're talking about (DNC chairman) John Podesta saying bad things about the boss (Clinton). I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified (material)."" Trump has a point about the distinction. But that’s not the whole story. Though the DNC releases weren’t classified, Wikileaks has released classified information previously. That includes 750,000 pages of documents stolen by Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning. In other words, during the campaign Trump praised an organization that made its name by leaking classified information. Now he’s criticizing leaking. ""He went from ‘I love WikiLeaks,’ an organization that publishes leaked classified information, to his current position,"" said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. ""A few months ago, leaks were getting him elected -- now they are destroying"" his presidency, agreed John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. Robert F. Turner, associate director of the University of Virginia's Center for National Security Law, said he understands the distinction between leaking classified material and information that is merely private. He also made clear that he is almost always dead-set against leaking. Regardless of who makes or broadcasts the leak, ""good people die and freedom is placed in jeopardy,"" he said. However, Turner added that ""it seems clear to me that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of our election, which I view as a serious national security issue."" If a disgruntled Democratic National Committee official had copied some documents and leaked them, ""I think Trump could have drawn a reasonable distinction between those garden variety disclosures of private information (arguably by ‘whistleblowers’) and disclosures derived from classified national security programs that were apparently disclosed by government employees in violation of their security agreements."" However, ""because of the Russian role I don't think that distinction holds up,"" Turner said. ""Bottom line, I would call this a flip-flop."" Other experts emphasized that a hack -- something Trump was on record supporting and even encouraging during the campaign -- is potentially worse than a leak. ""Information from a hack carried out by a foreign power with the intention of influencing or discrediting U.S. elections is much more serious than leaks of classified information intended to inform the public or influence policy,"" Rubin said. Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, went even further. ""Trump has done something worse than flip-flop,"" he said. ""He’s showed that his stance of leaks depends on whether it helps him. Flip-floppers change their mind; Trump has showed that he doesn’t have a stance on leaks independent from his interests. He’s pretending otherwise now, but it’s not credible."" Indeed, there’s an example from Trump’s somewhat more distant past that addressed this issue. On Oct. 30, 2013 -- long before Trump was an announced candidate for president -- he tweeted, ""ObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed-but if it and he could reveal Obama's records,I might become a major fan."" Trump may have been joking in this tweet. Still, it suggests that this dichotomy -- between leaks that help him and leaks that don’t -- has crossed his mind before. Our ruling During the campaign, Trump praised WikiLeaks, an organization that exists to publicize private, and at times classified, information. Now, as president, he’s criticizing federal officials who have leaked secret or classified information to the news media. Trump has a point that the leaked material from the DNC wasn’t classified. Still, the underlying principle is the same: Trump was praising the release of private information during the campaign but criticizing it after he became president. The situations are substantially similar, but Trump’s sentiments are not. We rate it a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7EFDC0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/trumps-flip-flop-leaks-and-release-secret-informat/

Lawmaker misleads in claims about Oroville dam crisis
","Republican state Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed the Oroville Dam emergency in Northern California ""was entirely avoidable."" The Orange County lawmaker also blamed Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for the crisis. ""The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville,"" Allen said in a press release on Feb. 13, 2017. Allen posted similar claims on Twitter and Facebook the same day.  The problems at the Oroville dam are complex. And so is Allen’s claim. We’ll break his statement into parts and assess its overall accuracy. 1) The Oroville dam failure was ""entirely avoidable."" Let’s be clear: The dam itself hasn’t failed. But its main concrete spillway developed a gaping hole in early February 2017 that led officials to dial back water flows to avoid further damage. As stormwater and runoff continued to flow in, however, the reservoir overtopped its emergency spillway for the first time in its 48-year history. The emergency spillway includes a concrete lip at the top and wooded hillside below without concrete fortification. Rapid erosion took place on Feb. 12, 2017 as water rushed down that unprotected hillside, leading to fears of a major dam breach and forcing the evacuation of nearly 200,000 residents downriver.  Authorities lifted the mandatory evacuation orders two days later, though concerns over the dam’s safety are expected to continue for months. Environmental groups warned in October 2005, when the dam was up for a federal license renewal before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, that the emergency spillway needed to be armored with concrete to avoid a crisis such as the one that played out this week. And a November 2005 Sacramento Bee article quoted state water officials as saying ""Our facilities, including the (emergency) spillway, are safe during any conceivable flood event."" The issue of fortifying that hillside ""was brought up in the FERC proceeding,"" Lester Snow, who was director of the state Department of Water Resources from 2004 through 2009, told PolitiFact California this week. ""And I believe FERC, as well as DWR engineers, looked at that and did not consider it to be the kind of threat that it has turned out to be."" ""I guess (there’s) some credence,"" to the idea that the crisis was avoidable, Snow said. ""(But) again, we would not have gotten there had it not had the surprising and dramatic failure of the (main) concrete gated spillway."" The main spillway had passed federal and state inspections and those who manage it ""saw nothing that would have predicted such a failure in the concrete chute,"" said Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the Brown Administration’s Natural Resources Agency. 2) ""California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014"" California voters did, indeed, pass a $7.5 billion water bond known as Proposition 1 in 2014. It was approved at the height of the state’s severe drought with the goal of expanding California’s water storage capacity and improving water quality. It included $2.7 billion for new surface and groundwater storage projects. 3) ""But Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 (from the bond) on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville."" Again, there’s some truth in this part of Allen’s statement. But there’s also a lot of context missing. State officials said Oroville and other existing State Water Projects are not eligible for Proposition 1 money. Upkeep on the massive system of state reservoirs, dams and aqueducts is paid for by the 29 state water contractors who consume the water, including urban and agricultural water districts. Asked about using Proposition 1 money for Oroville, H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, said: ""You couldn’t have done it if you wanted to."" Allen’s additional claim that Brown hasn’t spent any of that bond money on new water storage is also problematic. A spokeswoman for Allen pointed to a state website that tracks Proposition 1 funding and shows none has been allocated for water storage projects. Brown Administration officials countered that Proposition 1 was not intended to pay for projects overnight. It was a forward-looking measure that aimed to expand and strengthen the state’s water system for future droughts. Vogel, of the state’s Natural Resources Agency, said Allen ignores the fact that ""the storage funding section of the bond precluded any money being spent until December 15, 2016. Travis Allen should remember this since he voted for the water bond,"" in the Legislature. The bond passed the Assembly with support from all but two members. Voters then approved it during the November 2014 election. The state expects applications for new water storage projects to be submitted later this year. The California Water Commission plans to award early funding for storage projects in 2018, Vogel said. Our ruling Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed: ""The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville."" State officials say there was no indication of problems with the dam’s main spillway, which developed a huge hole this week as officials released large amounts of water from the dam. Officials did, however, have warnings about the integrity of the dam’s emergency spillway, which experienced rapid erosion this week, triggering mass evacuations below the dam. Environmental groups warned in 2005 that the emergency spillway needed to be reinforced. Given those warnings, there’s some truth to Allen’s claim that the crisis could have been avoided. But there’s no evidence, at this point, that state officials knew the dam’s main spillway was in jeopardy, something Allen does not point out. Allen’s other assertion that Gov. Jerry Brown hasn't spent a single dollar from the state’s recent $7.5 billion water bond on Oroville also doesn’t tell the whole story. That dam, and all others along the State Water Project, are ineligible for those funds. Allen's additional claim that the state has yet to spend bond money on new water storage projects, ignores the fact that that money was precluded from being spent until December 2016. There’s no doubt there’s been a massive failure at Oroville. But Allen doesn’t prove the emergency was ""entirely avoidable,"" particularly given the restrictions on state water bond money. Allen’s statement includes some aspect of truth. Overall, however, it overflows with misleading claims, ignores critical facts and context that would give a different impression. We rated Allen’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Benjamin Netanyahu largely correct on Iranian missiles with Hebrew-language threats
","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of the danger to his country from Iranian ballistic missiles in his first joint news conference with President Donald Trump. Israel has been firmly opposed to the United States-Iran nuclear agreement even before it was signed during the Obama administration. Trump was often critical of the deal on the campaign trail. Two weeks before the Feb. 15 news conference, Iran tested a medium-range ballistic missile that could theoretically reach Israel, as well as many other targets in the region. The Trump administration considers Iran’s Jan. 29 test to be against the terms of the agreement, while Iran considers it permissible. Days later, the Trump administration announced new sanctions on Iran, specifically citing the missile test as the reason. At the news conference, Netanyahu said his goal, and Trump’s, is to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. ""I think beyond that,"" he said, ""President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations — Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ‘Israel must be destroyed.’ Iranian Foreign Minister (Mohammad Javad) Zarif said, ‘Our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country.’ No, they write on the missiles in Hebrew, ‘Israel must be destroyed.’"" A reader asked us to check what Netanyahu said about the Hebrew lettering. So we took a closer look. The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not reply to an inquiry, but we found news reports from March 2016, such as this one in the Times of Israel, that discussed such an incident. The claim was sourced to the Fars news service, which has been described as a ""semi-official"" organ of the Iranian government. We tracked down the Fars article, dated March 9, 2016. It said that the the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had successfully launched two ""Qadr H"" ballistic missiles at a target in southeastern Iran 1,400 kilometers away. It described the Qadr as a liquid-fueled ballistic missile that ""can reach territories as far as Israel."" (The Obama administration condemned the test.) ""One missile,"" the Fars post said, ""had a message written on it that said in Hebrew, ‘Israel should be wiped off the Earth.’ "" The English-language version of the Fars site didn’t include the exact words, but the Times of Israel article showed a screenshot of the Farsi-language page, which specifies the Hebrew phrase ""Yisrael Tsricha LeHimachek Me’Al.""  The Times of Israel noted dryly that ""the words mean ‘Israel must be wiped out from.’ Apparently, Iran’s Hebrew writers intended to complete the phrase with something to the effect of ‘the face of the Earth’ but messed up their translation."" The translation of the Hebrew in the Times of Israel article is accurate, said Michael J. Koplow, policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, a group that advocates for a negotiated two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians. Koplow and other experts said they see no reason to doubt the accuracy of the Fars post. ""This story has the ring of truth to it because I do not see why Iran would lie about it,"" said Michael M. Gunter, a Tennessee Technological University political scientist who studies the region. We won’t quibble over the exact wording, which Netanyahu got wrong but which conveys the same message. But we will raise one caveat. Hearing Netanyahu’s comments, one could assume that he’s talking about the most recent missile tests from January 2017, rather than the ones from 2016. Not only did his comment about the Hebrew lettering immediately follow a mention of the most recent tests, but he used the present tense to say that ""these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew."" We found no evidence that the most recent round of tests included missiles with threats written in Hebrew letters. ""It is striking to me that Prime Minister Netanyahu must go back to an Iranian report of a March 2016 ballistic missile test to make his point about malign Iranian intentions,"" said Greg Thielmann, a former foreign service officer and Senate Intelligence Committee staffer who is now a board member at the Arms Control Association. He suggested that the Hebrew lettering may have been ""a one-time event, and not necessarily authorized in Tehran."" The botching of the text may suggest that the gambit was ad-hoc ""sloganeering"" by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ""rather than an explicit policy dictated from the top,"" Thielmann said. Our ruling Netanyahu said, ""President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations -- Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ‘Israel must be destroyed.’ "" He’s right that there was such an incident (with slightly different wording) during an Iranian ballistic missile launch in 2016. However, it’s worth noting that, despite Netanyahu’s implication, there is no evidence of a repeat when Iran undertook its most recent test in 2017. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae08540a-2931-4912-8149-8db6ea117789",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE37BC0>],/factchecks/2017/feb/15/benjamin-netanyahu/benjamin-netanyahu-largely-correct-iranian-missile/

Bill Gates did not compare Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan on Twitter
","A host of websites known for circulating dubious reports say that software magnate and philanthropist Bill Gates compared President Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan, but there’s no evidence that ever happened. In the last few weeks, multiple outlets shared a fake tweet allegedly from Gates making the claim, ""After 17 minuts (sic) phone call with President Trump, I think he will go down as one of the greatest presidents just like Reagan."" The tweet, shown above, is dated Jan. 22, 2017. Facebook flagged an example from Feb. 4, 2017, as part of its efforts to winnow fake news from its users’ news feeds. It’s difficult to say where the item originated, but it’s now widespread, having been reposted as recently as Valentine’s Day. Considering the dodgy grammar and spelling, the tweet itself likely came from a website allowing people to create fake tweets featuring real accounts. It’s not all that difficult to find one. It’s also easy to see that Gates didn’t send the tweet. While he has more than 33 million followers, Gates isn’t nearly as prolific a thumb-masher as Trump. The only tweet Gates appears to have sent on Jan. 22 was to congratulate former Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Jeff Raikes for being elected chairman of the Stanford University Board of Trustees. Congratulations @jeffraikes. Stanford is lucky to have you. The Internet Archive doesn’t show that he tweeted anything else that day, so it doesn’t appear Gates mentioned Trump and then deleted it. He doesn’t appear to have ever tweeted about Trump at all, although he has been somewhat critical of Trump in the past. Gates did talk with Trump prior to his inauguration and did compare the real estate tycoon to a president — but it was John F. Kennedy, not Reagan. ""A lot of his message has been about where he sees things not as good as he'd like,"" Gates said on CNBC on Dec. 13, 2016, about a phone call he had with Trump. ""But in the same way President Kennedy talked about the space mission and got the country behind that, I think that whether it's education or stopping epidemics, other health breakthroughs, finishing polio, and in this energy space, there can be a very upbeat message that (Trump's) administration is going to organize things, get rid of regulatory barriers, and have American leadership through innovation, be one of the things that he gets behind."" Gates met with the then-president-elect face-to-face in New York’s Trump Tower later that day for about an hour. ""It was a good time,"" Gates said afterward. ""We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation."" But that tweet? Despite what scads of disreputable websites report, it never happened. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

Fake news alert: Texas congressman from Pecos wishes for another 9/11 to show up judges
","A newsy web post renounces a right-leaning U.S. House member from Texas for publicly wishing for another 9/11. We’re sure, though, the congressman doesn’t exist and nor does the far West Texas district the character purported to represent on his, her or its recently shuttered Twitter account. We launched into this fact check after a reader urged us to check into what seemed to be the non-existent Rep. Rob McCaskill of Texas. Next, our web search under that name led to a Feb. 11, 2017 post on liberalplug.com stating the very same Texas Republican had singled out the judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals who left in place a U.S. district judge’s ruling blocking President Donald Trump from temporarily barring people from seven countries from entering the country. The post initially says: ""GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy."" It later says that McCaskill tweeted: ""Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan."" Liberalplug.com’s post continues: ""Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party."" First things first: Texas’ 36 House members include no one named McCaskill. Also, when we checked in mid-February 2017, no Rob McCaskill Twitter feed existed. But a fresh search employing cachedview.com, which compiles web pages accumulated over time, led to what looked like the no-longer-in-business Twitter feed for ""Rep. Rob McCaskill"" of Pecos. On that feed, a photo of a smiling balding fellow with a jacket over his shoulder says McCaskill is ""representing Texas’ 37th district beginning 2017!"" Note: Texas has no 37th district.  
Our review of the limited number of tweets on the cached version of the account showed that whoever controls its posts put up about 25 tweets from Jan. 25, 2017 until 10:07 a.m. Feb. 10, 2017, nearly all of them explicitly supportive of Trump. A sampling:    LiberalPlug.com’s McCaskill web post, critical of Trump, otherwise encourages readers to click through to another web site that says it centers on discussions of the U.S. and world from a leftist perspective. We didn’t spot mention on the liberalplug site of its chiefs or purpose--nothing suggesting it’s intended to be a news source or, conversely, always a spoof. When we clicked on a Facebook icon on the site, we landed on a Facebook page titled ""Liberal Daily,"" which says it’s a media/news company. We messaged that and didn’t hear back. Otherwise, we noticed, a volunteer-led effort called Media Bias/Fact Check calls liberalplug.com ""a news and opinion website with extreme left-wing bias. Some stories appear to be outright fake news. Most others are not properly sourced and amount to left wing propaganda. This source is not credible."" Our ruling LiberalPlug.com says Rob McCaskill, a Republican U.S. House member from Texas, posted a message on Twitter wishing for another 9/11. There’s no such Texas congressman to wish for anything.

Holtz turned around on Common Core standards
","Two candidates in the Feb. 21, 2017 primary election for state superintendent of public instruction are in a race to replace. Replace the Common Core academic standards, that is. Their stances have earned Lowell Holtz and John Humphries the label of ""flip floppers"" from the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now. We decided to turn to the Flip-O-Meter to determine if the challengers to incumbent Superintendent Tony Evers -- a Common Core supporter -- merit that label. Adopted by many states, the kindergarten-to-12th grade standards were designed as a rigorous national effort that would base teaching on college and job-world needs and allow comparison of U.S. students to their international counterparts. In Wisconsin most school districts, if not all, have adopted Common Core as the standards for English and math, said Thomas McCarthy, spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction. The Flip-O-Meter, of course, does not rate whether it’s good policy or politics to switch a position. It simply measures consistency in positions over time. Some argue a change demonstrates an openness to new facts or a willingness to compromise. Others say it is evidence of inconsistent principles or lack of backbone. So, where does Holtz stand? Holtz is a former Wisconsin principal of the year at Peshtigo Elementary School. He served 13 years as a school district administrator in the Palmyra, Beloit and Whitnall districts. He was running Whitnall in 2010 when Evers determined to put Common Core in place in Wisconsin after the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices led the drafting process. In 2012, a CNI NOW newspaper story quoted Holtz saying he supported the standards. Holtz told the publication the standards concentrate on facts as related to real life rather than the traditional straight ahead factual approach. In 2013, the same publication quoted Holtz this way: ""The change is absolutely in the best interests of the kids of Wisconsin. Raising the bar will make our kids more competitive not only at the state level but at the national level."" He called it a ""fun, exciting time to be involved in education."" By July 2016, when he announced his bid, it was clear Holtz was taking a different tack. He stressed local control and said Common Core was not necessarily effective because each community is different. The Beloit Daily News quoted Holtz as saying the Common Core must be fought. ""Happy to be part of a panel discussing Education Reform and the dangers of Common Core,"" he tweeted in November 2016. Holtz explained the switch in a Feb. 6, 2017 blog post about his plan to work with the governor and legislators to wipe out Common Core if elected. State and school leaders, he said, were misled through ""high pressure marketing"" to adopt Common Core at the risk of politicizing curriculum decisions. His new position won support from conservatives including former state Rep. Don Pridemore, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully in 2013 for state school superintendent. ""Dr. Holtz will fight for local control and against Federal takeover programs like Common Core,"" Pridemore is quoted on Holtz’s campaign web site. Holtz campaign spokesman Brit Schiel acknowledged that Holtz’s position has changed. He said it had evolved in line with Gov. Scott Walker’s. In January 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin rated as a Half Flip Gov. Scott Walker’s change in position to oppose Common Core. During most of his first term, the governor showed tacit support. By mid-2013, he was hitting the pause button on further implementation of the standards. In mid-2014, Walker called for an outright repeal. But by January 2015, he was saying only that he didn’t want school districts required to use Common Core. Holtz, Schiel said, ""grew uncomfortable with Common Core’s inefficiencies, its one-size-fits-all approach to education, and the fact that the standards were coming from Washington, not from the local school boards."" Our rating Holtz definitely was for Common Core before he was against it. The change is stark. This major reversal of position merits a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCA9A80>],/factchecks/2017/feb/15/lowell-holtz/holtz-turned-around-common-core-standards/

Some argue a change demonstrates an openness to new facts or a willingness to compromise. Others say it is evidence of inconsistent principles or lack of backbone. So, where does Humphries stand? Humphries then Before the election, Humphries’ views on Common Core can be found in letters he wrote on behalf of the Wisconsin School Psychologists Association. He was president-elect. It’s an imperfect source because the communications don’t necessarily represent his personal views. But he personalized one of the letters using his own experience and has not said he disagreed with their content. In October 2013, the group praised Common Core to a task force considering implementation of the standards. The ""higher, better"" standards were developed with a broad coalition and should go into effect quickly, the letter said. ""There is broad agreement on the positive impact they have had already. I have seen firsthand the significant, positive impact these new standards have had on our work in schools,"" Humphries wrote. Humphries told the task force that he was a school psychology consultant for the state Department of Public Instruction before returning to the schools in 2011, working in Dodgeville as a school psychologist and director of special education and pupil services. The Common Core has required educators to refocus their efforts, he wrote: ""In Dodgeville for example, our staff spent hundreds of hours this summer re-working our curricula in order to align with the new, higher standards."" The letter offered some specific criticisms of Common Core, but said it should be the ""baseline"" for any new standards. In March 2014, Humphries and two other officials with the group expressed concerns about proposed state legislation to dump Common Core and start from scratch to develop new standards. New standards could be less rigorous and take Wisconsin out of the national conversation on educational outcomes, the letter warned, because more time and national expertise would be needed if Wisconsin started over. Rather, the authors wrote, the state should improve and clarify some areas of Common Core, then provide money to put the ""Wisconsin Common Core Extension Standards"" into effect. Humphries now Jump ahead to February 2017. On the campaign trail, Humphries said he wanted to ""replace"" Common Core. The standards, he said, are too weak. Instead, the state should take two years to develop new standards with state and national expertise. Good intentions have frequently turned to poor implementation, inadequate communication, and too many decisions being taken away from parents and educators by state and federal politicians, Humphries said in a campaign news release in February 2017. Humphries’ praise of Common Core had been criticized by some conservatives, and his rollout of a ""repeal"" was greeted skeptically Feb. 2, 2017 by talk show host Jerry Bader in an appearance on that show. On that show, Humphries said he disagreed that the 2013-’14 letters were supportive of Common Core. Our rating It’s tempting to call this a Half Flip given that the 2013-14 correspondence wasn’t entirely praiseworthy of Common Core. And there’s the problem that Humphries was speaking for hundreds of psychologists, not just himself. But in our view Humphries downplays and miscasts those letters instead of distancing himself from the positions expressed. And the contrast is vivid: Common Core was strong, now it’s too weak. Common Core is needed right away, now we can wait two years. Common Core should be the baseline, now it should be dumped. That’s a major reversal.

Fake news alert: Bloggers claim protesters can now be labeled terrorists under new law
","The headline on an Internet post claims a recently passed law allows protesters to face terrorism charges, but a closer read shows the post is guilty of misrepresenting the facts. ""New law now charging all protesters with terrorism,"" reads an undated post on a site called RedRockTribune.com. The post says it has been shared more than 363,000 times on Facebook, which flagged the story as part of its efforts to stamp on fake news in its users’ news feeds. The article can be traced back to a Nov. 17, 2016, item on ConservativeDailyPost.com, but it has been shared on several other websites. It says a Republican has a new legal solution for dealing with liberal protesters — a law charging them with ""economic terrorism."" The headline on the post makes it sound as if a law allowing terrorism charges for protesters is already in place. The body of the post implies the law is on a national scale. That’s not an accurate description of what happened. The headline takes the core of a real event but builds a story full of incorrect details around it. There’s currently no law on the books along these lines. Washington state Sen. Doug Ericksen did suggest a bill criminalizing protests in the way described. The Republican proposed the measure in November, after protests erupted following President Donald Trump’s election. The idea was aimed largely at environmental activists in the Pacific Northwest who looked to shut down commercial and transportation projects in the region. Ericksen said his bill would make protesting a felony were the protest to ""block transportation and commerce, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk."" There are already legal guidelines in place limiting protests — you can be arrested for harassing people, or blocking walkways, streets or the entrances to buildings, for example. But Ericksen wanted to make the punishments much more severe. The ""economic terrorism"" charges could be levied against groups that organized such protests. Penalties would have included a $10,000 fine and up to five years in prison. ""I respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people’s lives and property, it goes too far,"" Ericksen said. ""Fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression. Those who employ it must be called to account."" Ericksen is serving as communications director for the Environmental Protection Agency as part of Trump’s transition team while also keeping his state office, drawing a recall effort from opponents.   But at the time the post was written, Ericksen was only proposing a bill penalizing protesters that harshly, and only in his state. That alarmed critics and the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. He did eventually file a bill in the state Senate, but it wasn’t quite as severe as the one he originally suggested. SB 5009 would impose prison terms on protesters who ""cause an economic disruption,"" ranging from 60 days for a misdemeanor and up to a year for a felony. One example to which he referred was of Washington protesters who blocked train tracks to two oil refineries in May 2016. The bill is currently sitting in the state Senate’s Law and Justice Committee. There’s no national law that brands protesters as terrorists.

West Virginia uninsured rate has declined, though not as fast as Bernie Sanders said
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had been planning to have a town hall with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and residents of McDowell County, W.Va., on Feb. 13, 2017, until the West Virginia National Guard told them they could not use a local armory for the event. Sanders instead appeared on Hayes’ show by satellite from the U.S. Capitol, still tailoring his comments to West Virginia. Sanders: ""And one of the ironies, Chris, is that one of the states that has benefited the most from Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, is West Virginia."" Hayes: ""Yes."" Sanders: ""Before the Affordable Care Act, their uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent."" Is that correct? Sanders’ office pointed to one government number to support its point. Another government number we found showed a less dramatic decline, but it doesn't change the thrust of his overall point. Let’s crunch the numbers. We’ll start by noting that the age range Sanders cited make some sense. The mandatory Medicare program kicks in at age 65, and enhanced access for children to government health programs tends to produce higher insurance coverage rates for kids than for adults. Sanders’ office pointed to an article in the Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette-Mail that touted the state had the country’s ""biggest decline"" in the uninsured rate. The article points to data from the National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study found that between 2013 and 2015, West Virginia’s uninsured rate for persons between 18 and 64 fell from 28.8 percent to 8.9 percent. That supports Sanders’ point. (We won’t quibble about Sanders citing an age range that was off by one year.) However, the same report provides an important caveat. It notes that for several states — including West Virginia — the data was ""not statistically significant due to larger standard errors."" It turns out that some states in the CDC study don’t have enough people sampled to provide robust data. ""This would be especially important for a small, low-population state like West Virginia,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and remains a health care policy analyst..   So is there a better number? Yes, specifically, data from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement. This data set, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, asks questions every year on a battery of topics, including health insurance coverage. The database includes figures broken down by state and age category. We looked at West Virginia’s figures for the uninsured population below 65 and subtracted the uninsured population below 18. Here’s what we found. This data backs up Sanders’ most recent uninsured rate for West Virginia. But instead of 29 percent, it shows the state’s uninsured rate hovered around 21 percent between 2008 and 2013. Wilensky said she’s not surprised to see such a wide difference between the two data sets, given the methodological differences. She added that the decline in West Virginia’s uninsured rate is still notable and was made possible by the Medicare expansion provision of the Affordable Care Act. ""West Virginia’s level of uninsurance would be on the higher side to begin with since they are a poor state,"" she said. ""Since they took advantage of the Medicaid expansion, the big decline is not surprising."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""Before the Affordable Care Act, (West Virginia’s) uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent."" Sanders pointed to one federal measurement, though it has methodological problems when drilling down to the statistics for smaller states. A more reliable data set for West Virginia’s case showed a decline from 21 percent to 9 percent. The decline was not as dramatic as he’d indicated, but it was still a significant one.

Column on Feministing website about abortion law is Pants on Fire
","An Internet claim that Missouri employers will gain the right to fire people who use birth control when a state bill becomes law is incorrect. ""Missouri Votes to Let Employers Fire People Who Use Birth Control,"" reads a headline from Feministing. ""A new Missouri bill would target abortion providers and sanction employment and housing discrimination against people who use birth control or have an abortion,"" writes Sejal Singh, Feministing columnist, in the article. A St. Louis ordinance passed in February prohibits discrimination because of reproductive health care decisions. But Missouri Senate Bill 5, or SB 5, which was signed by the governor in July, will overturn that local ordinance when it takes effect in October. Since SB 5 was signed, we’ve seen claims that the bill would allow for employers to fire workers for using birth control. But we found no evidence that that’s true. Singh told PolitiFact Missouri she based her commentary on the analysis of news articles. Allure, Refinery29, and Newsweek were just a few among media sources that reported the bill would allow for employees to fire people for using birth control. Newsweek came out with an updated article stating that it, among other publications, had erroneously reported on the bill. Many of these news organizations referenced NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, which ran an ad online and on the radio that read, ""Do you think your boss should be able to fire you for using birth control?"" This ad only ran for one week, but its interpretation of the bill was influential to many of those articles. According to Alison Dreith, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri, it was the rhetoric of Republicans and not the actual language that led to this interpretation. ""It still remains to be seen if SB 5 will pre-empt the St. Louis ordinance,"" Dreith said in an email interview. The bill, signed by the governor in late July, touches on a lot of provisions, such as tissue report modifications, local abortion policies, employee disclosure policies and abortion facility inspections. Under the political subdivision authority part of the bill, it allows property owners to refuse to rent or sell to a person who plans to use the facility as an abortion clinic that isn’t for the sole purpose of saving the mother’s life. Within the same guidelines, it also doesn’t require healthcare providers or employers to provide coverage ""that includes benefits that are not otherwise required by state law."" Employers in Missouri are already allowed to deny contraceptive coverage in their employee’s health insurance plans. Daniel Wilhelm, with Republican Rep. Andrew Koenig’s office, said the bill does not reference birth control or contraceptives, except under circumstances where employers can refuse health care if they don’t want to pay for birth control. Elizabeth Sepper, a professor of law at Washington University, said in an email that no matter what Missouri does, federal law bars an employer with 15 or more employees from discriminating against employees based on their reproductive choices, such as taking contraception. Even with the passing of the bill, Sepper said St. Louis’ city ordinance still prevents employers from firing employees who use birth control, and SB 5 doesn’t affect that protection. A columnist for Feministing claimed that SB 5 will allow employers to fire their workers for using birth control. While the bill will impose higher level of restrictions on abortion providers and allow real estate agents to refuse to sell or rent them land, the bill does not say employers can fire workers for using contraceptives.

First cut to Missouri income tax in over 100 years?
","Taxes have been a hot topic in the political world lately. President Donald Trump has been calling for reduction of corporate taxes. This is something he talked about when visiting Missouri in August. However, income tax is a hot button topic in Missouri as well. State Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, boasted on Twitter that a law he helped pass would be the first cut to Missouri income tax in over a century. ""The bill that I carried cutting MO’s income tax for 1st time in over 100 years will start its 1st phase in jan 1 2018,"" the senator tweeted on Aug. 30, 2017, with the hashtag ""moleg"" and tagging Missouri State Treasurer Eric Schmitt. Over a century? This seemed a little bit out there. When Koenig’s office did not answer our inquiry, we started digging for ourselves. Koenig was referring to Senate Bill 509 from 2014. Koenig was the House handler for the bill, as a state representative at the time. What does the now law actually do to income tax though? Simply put, income tax rates will decrease by a tenth of a percent every year until the top tax rate is a half of a percent lower, or 5.5 percent instead of the current 6 percent. There will also be an increase in income tax deductibles for business income until it reaches 25 percent. To trigger the start of the law, the state’s gross income had to exceed income in one of the three previous years by $150 million. That happened in the last fiscal year, so now the bill will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2018. The prospect of decreasing income tax is appealing for taxpayers, but is this really the first time it is happening in over a century? We talked to Anne Rottman, the library administrator at the Missouri Legislative Library, about the last time Missouri saw a reduction in income taxes. ""I don’t think there ever has been a cut,"" she said. It turns out, she’s right. Missouri income tax was established in 1917. This tax was for a half of a percent annually on individuals’ income. Income tax saw revisions throughout the years. Graduated tax brackets were created in 1939 and have not been changed since 1972. The limit for deduction for federal income taxes was created in 1993. There were various other revisions and adjustments as well. However, none of these were decreases in the tax levied. For a century, tax law has been growing into what income tax looks like today. Why has there always been an increase and never a decrease? ""No idea why this approach took so long,"" said Joseph Haslag, an economics professor at MU. Others seem to be stumped as well. The half-percentage reduction of the tax rate per year gives the state legislature some time to adjust to having less revenue for the budget. Meanwhile, there’s a more immediate impact for individuals: Tax brackets will now be adjusted annually based on percent increase in inflation. However, when it comes to the economy overall, it isn’t as exciting as it sounds, Haslag said. ""For a revenue-test state like Missouri, the tax cut reduction will have small, very small, positive effect on Missouri’s economic growth,"" Haslag said. And while Koenig is correct that the state’s income rate has never decreased, it’s important to note that the legislature has enacted many income tax deductions that have the same effect of lowering someone’s state income tax bill. Beginning in 2016, for example, 100 percent of a military pension income became exempt from Missouri state tax. The state also created a new deduction for people from Missouri who relocated a business to Missouri. Koenig said that Senate Bill 509 would cut Missouri income tax for the first time in over 100 years. The truth of the matter is Missouri income tax has never been cut. Income tax laws were put in place in 1917. This was 100 years ago exactly. It’s not over 100 years, but Koenig was pretty close. It’s worth noting, however, that Missouri has created a long list of deductions that could reduce a person’s state income tax bill without having to decrease the overall tax rate. Koenig’s statement is accurate but needs that clarifying information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF434C0>],/factchecks/2017/sep/26/andrew-koenig/first-cut-missouri-income-tax-over-100-years/

Sen. Tom Cotton misleads in claim about Dream Act amnesty
","Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., claimed a current immigration bill directed at young immigrants in the country illegally could become the biggest amnesty ever granted in the United States. NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Cotton about President Donald Trump’s discussions with Democrats to help nearly 800,000 so-called ""Dreamers,"" beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump is phasing out. What’s needed is a ""targeted and incremental deal"" that solves the Dreamers’ problem but also mitigates negative side effects, said Cotton, who introduced his own bill to reduce chain migration and prioritize American workers. Legislation proposed by his colleagues would have a different outcome, he said. ""If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty, which Ronald Reagan said was his biggest mistake in office,"" Cotton said Sept. 17. Immigration scholars do consider this 1986 law to be the biggest yet allowing immigrants to legalize their status. But is Cotton right that the Dream Act would overtake it as the biggest ""amnesty"" program ever? Cotton’s claim is not just based on how many people would directly benefit from the bill, but also includes an assumption of how many additional family members could indirectly benefit. In addition, the comparison to the 1986 law is skewed, experts said. Legislation intended to help immigrants who came to the United States as children and live here illegally has been brought up in Congress several times but never enacted. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (Dream Act) was first introduced in the Senate in 2001, seeking to help young immigrants who met certain criteria attain higher education and lawful permanent residence. The term ""Dreamers"" is commonly used for potential beneficiaries of the Dream Act or similar measures, including DACA. Cotton’s office told us his comment was in reference to a 2017 Dream Act bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute estimated the effort could lead to 1.5 million immigrants receiving lawful permanent residence. The Graham-Durbin bill would grant immigrants without criminal records and who meet specific criteria a conditional status for eight years. Immigrants who meet additional requirements (such as certain levels of educational attainment, military service and employment) would become eligible for lawful permanent residence. Potential beneficiaries must have arrived in the United States before they were 18 years old and lived here four years or more. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that about 3.3 million people meet the criteria for age at arrival and length of U.S. residence. It breaks down that figure, calculating that about 1.8 million are immediately eligible for conditional status and 1.5 million eligible for legal permanent residence. Cotton’s office said the problem is that recipients will then be able to sponsor relatives. ""The 2017 Dream Act is not limited to DACA recipients … Those who receive green cards will then be able to sponsor their illegal-immigrant parents (who came illegally with the children) for (a green card),"" said Caroline Rabbitt, Cotton’s communications director. Lawful permanent residents cannot sponsor a parent for a green card — only U.S. citizens can do that. But lawful permanent residents can eventually apply to become naturalized citizens. If each of the 1.5 million immigrants sponsors one parent, then total amnesty would be over 3 million people, said Rabbitt, adding that this is a probably a low estimate because ""statistical studies have found that immigrants eventually sponsor between 1.11 and 3.46 family members on average."" What constitutes amnesty is hotly debated, but Cotton said he defined amnesty as ""giving legal status to people who came here illegally."" Cotton’s estimate is that at least 3 million people could go from living illegally to legally as a result of the Graham-Durbin bill. Based on those calculations, is that greater than the number of people who benefitted from the 1986 law? Not exactly. Republican President Ronald Reagan signed into law the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards — including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers. ""While those 2.7 million went on to sponsor family members as well, the ones they sponsored would not have been illegal beforehand, as would be the parents of DREAM Act beneficiaries,"" Rabbitt said. That’s not accurate, several immigration experts told us. ""There was no prohibition in the 1986 law against sponsoring family members who were in the United States illegally,"" said Ann Lin, associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Since immigration categories did not distinguish between family applicants of IRCA and other family members of other eligible green-card holders and citizens, there are no estimates of the number of derivative sponsorships by IRCA principals, Lin said. The claim from Cotton’s office is ""completely implausible,"" said Elizabeth F. Cohen, an immigration expert and associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. ""Not only did plenty of people eligible for IRCA have relatives living in the United States without documentation, but at that time the unlawful presence bars had not yet been passed (those came in 1996) so they could have been sponsored by IRCA recipients if they left the country,"" Cohen said. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act placed three- and 10-year bars on legal re-entry for individuals who initially came to the United States illegally. Immigrants who entered the United States illegally cannot adjust their status within the country; they must go through a consular process in their home countries. A policy under Reagan and George H. W. Bush after the 1986 law also led to legal status for family members of IRCA beneficiaries, said Audrey Singer, an immigration expert and senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Back in 2013, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, argued that the 1986 law gave amnesty to 3 million people and that through family reunification policies, an additional 15 million were able to gain legal status. King’s overarching claim was that the 1986 law led to 15 million votes for Barack Obama in 2012. We rated that False. ""The 2.7 million people who gained legal status through IRCA did so as ‘principals’ — that is, they were the applicants. The appropriate comparable number for DACA is roughly 1.5 million,"" Lin said. Counting family applicants of Dreamers, but not the family members of IRCA recipients inflates Dream Act totals and underestimates IRCA totals, she said. Experts also cautioned against assuming that every single person eligible for the Dream Act will end up applying. Pew Research Center estimated that about 78 percent of the DACA-eligible population applied for the program. Some people choose not to apply for programs, and some get weeded out at different stages of the application process, so it’s not realistic to assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between eligibility and the number of green card holders the bill would produce, said Lina Newton, associate professor of political science at Hunter College, CUNY. ""In light of past policy experience and current immigration laws it is very unlikely that the Dream Act — at least in its present form — would produce a legalized population of 3 million,"" Newton said. Cotton said, ""If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty."" A 1986 law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards. Immigration experts regard this law as the biggest yet to provide legalization for people who were in the country illegally. A 2017 Dream Act bill in the Senate is estimated to allow about 1.5 million people to become eligible for green cards. Cotton calculated that if each of the 1.5 million people eligible for a green card through the Dream Act were to sponsor a parent who’s in the country illegally, then the total number of people legalizing their status would be at least 3 million. But 1986 law beneficiaries also were able to sponsor family members who had been in the country illegally, though it’s difficult to determine how many exactly, experts said.

12 hurricanes coming toward U.S.? Fake post is totally wrong
","A phony online news article that says the United States is expecting 12 more hurricanes was created as a prank on a site that allows people to generate fake news.

These so-called prank posts can leave users vulnerable to ""like-farming,"" where scammers use click-bait posts to get as many likes as possible and spread malware through popularly clicked links. We first saw the post on Sept. 21, 2017, but it appears to have been updated by the publisher to look more current. The content of the post hasn’t changed. Since we first saw the post, there have been only three hurricanes in the Atlantic: Jose, Maria and Lee. Jose, which was quickly downgraded to a tropical storm when it came close to the East Coast, has fallen off the National Hurricane Center radar since Sept. 22. Maria has moved north off the shores of North Carolina and is predicted to move northeast, farther away from the East Coast. And Lee remains a idle swirl in the middle of the Atlantic with no apparent intent to touch American shores. The National Hurricane Center has yet to issue anything more severe than a tropical storm warning for any of these storms. Though the post is false, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center advises people to stay vigilant during this active hurricane season. Since May, the National Weather Service has forecast that this year’s Atlantic hurricane season would be more active than past seasons. On Aug. 9, they updated their forecast, stating that this may be the most active hurricane season since 2010.   But, in the eyes of the National Hurricane Center, the react365.com claim is still nothing more than fake news and, according to Feltgen, ""totally unfounded, totally baseless and totally irresponsible.""

Gwen Graham accurately says parts of Florida's infrastructure not prepared for climate change
","Gwen Graham, a former Democratic congresswoman running for Florida governor, said state leaders need to do more to prepare for the next hurricane, especially in the face of climate change. In an opinion-editorial for the Tampa Bay Times, Graham specifically focused on the state’s significant problem with infrastructure. ""Our coastal and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change,"" Graham wrote. ""They're two of the most critical areas during a storm, and received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016."" We wondered about these grades as well as Graham’s larger point about climate change preparedness. Every four years since 2008, the Florida Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers has issued a report card outlining the condition of Florida’s infrastructure. The organization was founded in 1852 and represents more than 150,000 members of the civil engineering profession in 177 countries, making it the oldest engineering society in the country. A committee of civil engineers updates the card and gives out 11 grades on different sectors of infrastructure, including bridges, energy and school facilities, to create an an average grade. (Florida’s grade point average was a C in 2016.) Florida’s highest marks were in ports (B-minus), aviation (B-minus) and bridges (B) in the group’s 2016 report card. As Graham said, coastal and stormwater infrastructure scored poorly. The worst grade, F, is given out to infrastructure with ""widespread advanced signs of deterioration,"" and designates that the infrastructure is unfit for what it’s supposed to do. Getting a D isn’t much better: ""The infrastructure is in poor to fair condition and mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of their service life. A large portion of the system exhibits significant deterioration. Condition and capacity are of serious concern with strong risk of failure."" The section about coastal areas takes a close look at the Sunshine State's 825 miles of beaches. That area received a D-plus grade in 2016, jsut like Graham said.  According to the organization, almost 61 percent of Florida’s beaches are eroding and need ""ongoing maintenance"" to fight the trend. The group put some of the fault on state policymakers, adding that ""over the last 10 years, the average difference between requested and state appropriated funds exceeded $40 million per year."" It shouldn’t come as a surprise that hurricanes and major storm events can really mess up coastal areas and beaches. During periods of extreme rain, the chance for flooding increases. Flooding combined with wind, leads to beach erosion and jeopardizes the integrity of important infrastructure, like power plants, along the coast. Florida’s stormwater infrastructure, which include the drains that capture excess rain water and transport it for cleaning, received a D. Based on the ASCE’s assessment, Florida needs about $1.1 billion through 2019 to update its stormwater infrastructure. However, as needs for improvement have increased, utility fees to upkeep the systems have decreased since 2011. Stormwater infrastructure is put into overdrive during storms and hurricanes. Increasing the amount of water compromises the natural ability of the ground to absorb water, making stormwater systems function worse. There’s no doubt that stormwater and coastal area infrastructure are critical when a storm hits, and experts agreed that the ASCE’s assessment is right on track. Experts said that coastal infrastructure does not work well under ""king"" tides, heavy storms, or heavy rains in part because of the state's low elevation, lack of pumping of water and some lack of attention. ""Stormwater (issues), like water and sewer, are not very glamorous and are therefore often ignored until they hit crisis mode,"" said Fred Bloetscher, an American Society of Civil Engineers member and a civil, environmental and geomatics engineering professor at Florida Atlantic University. Experts also agreed that the crux of Graham’s claim — that Florida's coastal and stormwater infrastructure is not prepared to handle climate change — is also accurate. That’s in part because the state isn’t taking preventative measures to better prepare. For example, experts said a starting point for Florida would be to tighten building codes and increase the number of ""disaster reduction structures."" Experts at the University of South Florida pointed to the ""monolithic concrete dome home"" that easily withstands hurricane winds and flooding events. ""We wonder why we don't see more of these,"" said T.H. Culhane, the director of climate change and sustainability at the University of South Florida. But not all hope is lost, according to Dave Randle, USF's director of sustainable tourism. ""It might be too late for the next hurricane but the sooner we start the more we could prevent damage in the future,"" Randle said. Graham said that Florida’s coastal area and stormwater infrastructure are not prepared to handle climate change, adding that the state ""received D-plus and D ratings, respectively, by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2016."" Graham is accurately citing a report card given out by the oldest engineering society in the country and experts vouched for the group’s assessment and Graham’s larger point. Florida has failed to take preventative measures in the past and it needs to update its existing infrastructure to prepare for climate change.

Trump's Mostly False claim that NFL ratings are 'way down'
","President Donald Trump blamed low National Football League ratings and attendance on unpatriotic players. ""NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.,"" Trump tweeted on Sept. 24, 2017. ...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S. His Sunday morning tweet referred to NFL players -- most notably former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick -- who kneel during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality. Trump had made a similar claim during a campaign rally on the Friday before for Sen. Luther Strange in Huntsville, Ala. Trump also urged the NFL fire or suspend those players. ""If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!"" Trump tweeted. If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend! We wanted to know if ratings or attendance of NFL games were indeed ""way down."" We previously rated a similar claim Trump made about CNN’s ratings Pants on Fire. Once again, Trump seems to be overstating rating declines, and we found little evidence of their political motivation. We’ll begin by saying that the numbers for 2017 so far are inconclusive. Advertising Age media reporter Anthony Crupi told us he estimated a decline of around 9 percent in ratings since last year, although the only window to face a significant decline was the 1 p.m. regional games. But we only have full data for the first two weeks of the season — the first of which was likely impacted by Hurricane Irma — making the data set too small to draw any conclusions according to Paulsen, editor in chief of Sports Media Watch. (Paulsen’s professional name is simply Paulsen.) Average attendance for 2017 thus far is also down — by 5 percent, while gross attendance is off 8 percent from 2016. Trump might be referring to 2016, a year when the NFL saw a significant drop in viewership, although average game attendance increased by 3 percent from 2015 to 2016. According to ESPN, NFL game broadcasters saw an average year-on-year drop in television viewership last season of 8 percent. Fox saw the lowest ratings since 2008 and ESPN since 2005. But that excluded Thursday Night Football games, which Paulsen said likely would lower the percentage, and alternate viewing platforms. ""A variety of factors made the comparison versus last year skewed, including streaming on Twitter and a new partner, NBC,"" ESPN reported. A new Nielsen study measuring audiences in bars, restaurants, gyms and other out-of-home venues showed that NFL viewership nearly matched 2015’s numbers. However, they didn’t compute out-of-home numbers for 2015, suggesting there might still be some discrepancy. It’s still a modest decline, according to Paulsen, because the NFL’s ratings are usually so strong — the NFL is the most popular televised sports event in the United States. He also pointed out that isolating the NFL made little sense. ""I think it’s really important to note the NFL is not declining while other leagues are increasing,"" Paulsen said. ""NASCAR ratings are in the cellar right now. The NBA had some of its lowest rated games ever on network television last year … It’s an industry-wide phenomenon and the NFL isn’t immune to it anymore."" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to a Seton Hall Sports Poll that found that 56 percent of 841 respondents cited players not standing for the national anthem as a reason for last year’s ratings drop. But as CNBC pointed out, the poll asked why other people — rather than respondents — aren't watching football. About half the people polled said they either follow sports ""not closely"" or ""not at all,"" but coverage of Kaepernick’s kneeling was widely covered by the media. A similar J.D. Power survey Cheung cited also reported national anthem protests as the main reason NFL fans watched less games last season. ""Among the 12 percent who watch less (sports), 26 percent of them say national anthem protests are to blame, however those respondents reflect only 3 percent of the full, nationwide sample,"" the researchers wrote. Various pundits criticized the survey results as negligible, pointing out that for every one person turned off by protests, 10 NFL fans tuned in. ""If a larger share of respondents claimed they watched more NFL, the fact that NFL ratings were actually down last year is good enough reason to discard this survey as meaningless,"" Patrick Redford wrote in Deadspin. Like the Seton Hall survey, the reasons for tuning out were offered as a list for respondents to choose from, so people weren’t necessarily offering the anthem protests on their own, and respondents could provide multiple answers. Paulsen said that NFL rating drops aren’t unprecedented, with similar declines in the ‘80s, ‘90s and the first half of the 2000s. ""It’s only now that people are deciding it’s a political issue, that people are really focusing on it. There’s any number of reasons to believe that what’s happening right now is not necessarily political,"" Paulsen said, including a loss of interest among younger viewers.  Trump said ""NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country."" Ratings were down 8 percent in 2016, but experts said the drop was modest and in line with general ratings for the sports industry. The NFL remains the most watched televised sports event in the United States. Ratings in 2017 so far suggest a similar year-on-year drop, but experts say it’s too early to tell, and external factors like Hurricane Irma, which coincided with the season’s first week, may help explain the drop. NFL game attendance dropped slightly from 2016 to 2017, and rose from 2015 to 2016. As for political motivation, there’s little evidence to suggest people are boycotting the NFL. Most of the professional sports franchises are dealing with declines in popularity.

In debate, Roy Moore claims DACA was a 'mere memo,' violated laws
","During a debate for Alabama’s open U.S. Senate seat, former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore blasted a controversial immigration policy recently ended by President Donald Trump as being illegal. Republican Roy Moore squared off in Montgomery on Sept. 21, 2017, against U.S. Sen. Luther Strange, who replaced Jeff Sessions when Sessions became attorney general. The winner of the GOP runoff on Sept. 26 faces Democrat Doug Jones on Dec. 12. Moore, who was removed from the court in 2003 after refusing a federal order to take down a monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building, attacked Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The program protected from deportation immigrants who came to the United States as children and lived here illegally, known as Dreamers. Sessions, calling the situation a ""failure to enforce immigration laws,"" announced a phaseout of DACA on Sept. 5. (Renewal applications can be submitted until Oct. 5.) The Trump administration said no current beneficiaries will be affected before March 5, 2018, giving Congress time to act. ""Obviously, Congress did not do their duty on DACA, which was a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws,"" Moore said. He said he didn’t consider the policy valid, preferring action from lawmakers. Congress hasn’t passed any laws concerning Dreamers, but does that mean DACA violated current law? It’s certainly been a contentious policy that has caused a lot of debate, but there is no court ruling directly tied to the program’s constitutionality. DACA is a policy, not a law, and is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by  then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Her memo outlined prosecutorial discretion to focus resources on removing immigrants who met the department’s priorities while protecting Dreamers from deportation. It does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people approved for DACA, but it does give a temporary reprieve from deportation. Immigration laws were ""not designed to be blindly enforced"" without considering individual cases and circumstances, Napolitano wrote. ""Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here."" DACA’s critics say that protecting Dreamers through the executive branch, as Napolitano did, instead of through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power. But the judicial branch hasn’t weighed in on the issue. ""There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional,"" Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University, previously told PolitiFact. A lawsuit challenging the program was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. ""So there was never any adjudication on the merits,"" he said. Following a lawsuit from Texas and 25 other states, a federal district judge did block an expanded version of DACA and another program that offered a reprieve from deportation, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving the lower court’s ruling in place. The DACA expansion and DAPA were not halted based on their constitutionality, however, but rather that the federal government hadn’t met some technical requirements. Those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, Kalhan said, ""based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued."" A final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said. ""And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality — it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing,"" Kalhan said. Moore said DACA was ""a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws."" The DACA program was part of a 2012 Homeland Security memo that said Dreamers would not be the focus of deportation efforts. It didn’t grant Dreamers legal status and only gave them temporary protection from deportation. While critics have called the guidance executive overreach and argued it is illegal, there has been no court ruling calling the policy unconstitutional. It remained in place until the Trump administration announced its end. Moore may feel DACA violated law, and the program has faced legal challenges, but he can’t make that claim as a definitive statement of fact.

Alabama ranks high in charitable giving, but not No. 1, as Luther Strange said
","During a debate against Republican primary rival Roy Moore, Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., urged policies to strengthen the economy -- in part because it would encourage more charitable giving. ""People need to be able to provide for their families so they can give money to their churches and to their charities,"" Strange said. ""We're the most generous state in the union in terms of what we give to charities."" Is it correct that Alabama is ""the most generous state in the union in terms of what we give to charities""? We found that the state does rank high in monetary donations, but it’s not No. 1 in recent rankings. (The Strange campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) One recent and comprehensive assessment of state-by-state charity was published by the personal finance website WalletHub in November 2016. The site looked at two broad categories of charity -- a ""volunteering and service"" category and a ""charitable giving"" category. Since Strange spoke about monetary gifts, we’ll focus on that portion of WalletHub’s calculations in this fact-check. To create a state’s rank for the charitable giving category, the website melded together several measurements. One that received double-weighting to increase its importance in the calculation was the percentage of residents’ income that was donated to charity. The additional, single-weighted measurements included the percentage of taxpayers who donated money, the number of public charities per capita, the number of food banks per capita, and the percentage of sheltered homeless residents. When the website crunched the numbers, Alabama ended up as fourth in charitable giving, behind Utah, Arkansas and Minnesota. Zeroing in specifically on the percentage of residents’ income donated to charity, Alabama finished one notch higher -- No. 3, behind Utah and Mississippi. (A separate study by the Chronicle of Philanthropy published in 2014 also placed those three states in the same order for percentage of income donated to charity.) So Alabama ranked high among the states, though Strange was exaggerating when he said it was No. 1 in the nation. Another study by a personal-finance website came out a few months earlier. The SmartAsset study looked at two slightly different measurements. One was charitable contributions per capita. On this measurement, Alabama ranked no higher than 13th. (The website listed only the top 25 states in overall rank, so Alabama could be lower than 13th.) The other measurement in the SmartAsset study was the median size of charitable contributions. In this category, Alabama fared better -- it was No. 2 after Utah. But Alabama still isn’t No. 1 in the nation, as Strange said. While both studies found Alabama with high rates of monetary donations, the state scored less well in charitable activities such as volunteering. In the WalletHub study, Alabama ranked 46th in the ""volunteering and service"" category, only rating higher than California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The factors used to measure this category included volunteer rate, volunteer retention rate, volunteer hours per capita, and percentage of population collecting or distributing food and clothes. When WalletHub averaged the ""charitable giving"" and ""volunteering and service categories"" to create an overall state rank, Alabama ended up at 30th -- below average nationally. As for the SmartAsset study, Alabama ended up in 19th place overall, or above average nationally. The four factors used to produce the SmartAsset ranking were charitable contributions per capita, median charitable contribution, value of volunteer time per capita, and nonprofits per capita. ""Volunteering is incredibly valuable to nonprofits,"" said Joannie Tremblay-Boire, an assistant professor in the Department of Public Management and Policy at Georgia State University's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. ""It can be just as important as cash or goods. Organizations just would not be able to function without volunteers."" (Tremblay-Boire helped advise WalletHub on its study.) Using the metric Strange appeared to focus on -- monetary giving -- Alabama is well positioned to do well in national rankings, because it ranks relatively low in income and relatively high in church membership. Alabama has the sixth-lowest median income in the nation, while it ranks first in the Pew Research Center’s ranking of states by the importance of religion, based on survey data. These two factors tend to help Alabama in the rankings because when you calculate the percentage of income donated to charity in each state, Alabama’s denominator (income) is relatively small, while the numerator (charitable donations) is relatively large, since church donations are included in donation total. The usual No. 1 state in these types of studies, Utah, has a much higher income level for its denominator -- Utah’s median income ranks 12th nationally -- but that is outweighed by its unusually high level of church donations in the numerator. In Utah, 55 percent of the state’s residents identify as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (or Mormons), which expects tithing. Strange said that Alabama is ""the most generous state in the union in terms of what we give to charities."" Looking at the monetary side of charity, Alabama does rank high on state-by-state lists, though we couldn’t find one where it placed No. 1 nationally. Utah ranks first in most studies. Meanwhile, if you look instead at volunteer work, Alabama ranks significantly lower than many states. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD7AD00>],/factchecks/2017/sep/22/luther-strange/alabama-ranks-high-charitable-giving-not-no-1-luth/

Graham-Cassidy, the GOP alternative to Obamacare, weakens protections for pre-existing conditions
","How the latest GOP alternative to Obamacare would treat pre-existing conditions is a question repeatedly put to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who is one of the lead co-sponsors of the bill. On Sept. 20, 2017 -- 10 days before a deadline to pass the measure with a simple majority -- there was this exchange between Johnson and Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s ""MTP Daily"" talk show: Todd: ""So, you contend that this bill will protect those folks with pre-existing conditions -- period."" Johnson: ""Every bit as well as Obamacare did. And it’s also going to protect the individuals that can’t afford Obamacare right now."" The protections are a major point of contention. The Affordable Care Act makes it illegal for insurers to deny coverage to people who have pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or cancer, or charge them higher rates. But under the Johnson-sponsored plan, waivers that would give states new flexibility erode protections for pre-existing conditions. ""The only way people (with pre-existing conditions) are protected is if every state in the nation looks at this and says, ‘We’re not going to do that,’"" said Karen Pollitz, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. ""This lets states take away your protections."" The bill The bill, introduced a week before Johnson’s interview, is known as the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill (or its shorter moniker, Graham-Cassidy). That’s for the GOP senators co-sponsoring the measure: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dean Heller of Nevada and Johnson. Under Senate rules, the bill could be approved with 51 votes (50 senators plus a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence) if it is adopted by Sept. 30, 2017. After that, Republicans, who hold 52 seats, would need 60 votes, which seems an impossibility. (On Sept. 22, 2017, with eight days left before the deadline, Arizona’s John McCain said he would join two other Senate Republicans who have indicated they would not vote for the bill, potentially dooming its chances.) The bill and pre-existing conditions got heavy attention after late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, whose infant son was born with a congenital heart disease, attacked it on his show the night before Johnson’s interview. (Johnson has also noted in defending the bill that his adult daughter was born with a pre-existing condition.) How it treats pre-existing conditions The bill keeps the Affordable Care Act prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would enable them to opt out of other ACA provisions that protect those people. The upshot: States could allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than they charge healthy people; and the insurers could offer policies that offer less than the ""essential benefits"" that are now mandated. PolitiFact National rated Mostly False a claim by President Donald Trump that the bill includes ""coverage of pre-existing conditions,"" finding that: If a state merely says it ""intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions,"" then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. The federal government could withhold money granted to a state under a waiver if the state doesn’t do as it promised, but the words ""adequate"" and ""affordable"" are open to interpretation. Policies would not have to provide the same level of coverage now mandated under Obamacare. Estimates say about 34 states would see net funding cuts under the bill. It costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it. Johnson's claim goes further than Trump’s, saying the bill’s pre-existing protections are as good as Obamacare’s. But in reviewing the GOP bill, the political news website Axios arrived at similar findings: The funding cuts ""could pressure states to waive protections for sick people as a way to keep premium increases in check. Older, sicker people in every state could end up paying more as states try to make up for a funding shortfall."" States could get a waiver to let insurers charge sick people more than healthy people. A waiver would exempt insurers from the current requirement to provide ""essential health benefits,"" including prescription drugs -- so, people who need expensive drugs might have to pay out of pocket. And Pollitz told us that states could also allow insurance companies to: Charge lower premiums to people while they’re healthy, but then raise the rates at renewal time if, for example, they get cancer. Charge higher premiums based on a person’s location or occupation, practices that are outlawed under Obamacare. Information from the bill’s sponsors say it would protect people with pre-existing conditions, but doesn’t provide details. Patrick McIlheran, a Johnson spokesman, told us the bill gives states the flexibility to try ""new approaches to keeping insurance for those with pre-existing conditions affordable."" Before we close, it’s worth noting: Writing about the bill in the conservative National Review, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, made one reference to pre-existing conditions, saying: On the positive side, supporters of the legislation correctly point out that it would give the states far more flexibility with the funds they receive, and would allow them to waive many of Obamacare’s more onerous regulations, including the mandate to buy coverage, mandated benefits and pre-existing-condition coverage requirements. Those are the regulations most responsible for driving up premiums and destabilizing insurance markets. Our rating Johnson said the GOP health bill he is co-sponsoring will protect people with pre-existing conditions ""every bit as well as Obamacare did.""

The bill would keep the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition on denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would allow insurers -- unlike under Obamacare -- to charge people with pre-existing conditions premiums and provide them lesser benefits. We rate Johnson’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC931080>],/factchecks/2017/sep/22/ron-johnson/graham-cassidy-gop-alternative-obamacare-weakens-p/

Did Roy Moore fight for pay raises for 'politicians' during a court shutdown? No
","Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., claims his opponent Roy Moore sought pay raises for politicians while the Alabama courts shut down due to a budget shortfall. ""FACT: Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding,"" reads a claim on the Strange for Senate website. Strange and Moore face off in a Sept. 26 runoff vote for the Republican nomination to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Is it a fact that Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts shut down? We delved into the recent history of Alabama’s court system to find out. The Strange for Senate website contains a footnote saying the pay raises went to ""two of (Moore’s) top political staffers."" The website also cites an Associated Press article from April 26, 2002, when Moore served as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, an elected position. ""Chief Justice Roy Moore gave pay raises to two of his top administrators this year as the state court system headed toward financial problems resulting in 170 layoffs,"" reads the article, which goes on to identify the pay raise recipients by name: Moore gave state court administrator Rich Hobson a 5 percent merit raise from $99,538 to $104,587 annually. Scott Barnett, a lawyer who acts as spokesman for the court system, got a 2.5 percent merit raise in January that boosted his pay from $72,103 annually to $73,881, according to records kept by the Retirement System of Alabama. Both men were appointed by Moore after he was elected chief justice in November 2000. When we reached out to Barnett, now an Alabama attorney in private practice, he disputed the notion that Moore was personally involved in giving him a pay raise in 2002. Barnett said it was a department head — not Moore — who recommended his merit raise. ""Judge Moore was not, to my knowledge, personally involved in decisions to grant merit pay raises to Administrative Office of Courts employees,"" Barnett said. ""The Alabama Administrative Office of Courts has its own personnel department that manages such issues."" Barnett said that given the chief justice’s role as the administrative head of the state's judicial system, it’s unrealistic to think Moore would become involved in granular details like pay raises for individual court employees. Barnett added that, to the best of his knowledge, Moore would not even have needed to approve his pay raise. We contacted two employees at Alabama’s Administrative Office of Courts who corroborated Barnett’s belief that Moore would not have needed to approve his pay raise. ""The chief justice would not have to approve a pay raise given to an employee, including a staff attorney, of the Administrative Office of Courts,"" Nathan Wilson, the assistant administrative director of courts and legal director of Alabama’s Administrative Office of Courts, said in an email. (Officially, Barnett was staff attorney with the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts.) While Barnett received a 2.5 percent pay increase, he was eligible for 5 percent. This raises the question: If Chief Justice Moore had in fact ""fought for"" Barnett’s raise, as Strange alleges, why did Barnett receive less than the full 5 percent increase? Barnett said he took issue with the amount at the time, and chalked it up to differences of opinion with his boss, the court’s legal director — a position which we’d note is subordinate to the chief justice. With regard to Hobson, the other pay-raise recipient in question, court officials said his raise would have been approved by Moore. We contacted Hobson, who now works as a consultant for Moore’s Senate campaign. He said that while his pay raise did require Moore’s approval, merit-based raises were ""standard operating procedure for deserving employees"" across the whole of Alabama’s state government, which had some 34,500 employees in 2002, including some 2,500 judicial branch employees. We found that nearly half of Alabama state government employees received a raise in 2002. That year, more than 15,000 state employees received a 5 percent merit raise, while another 1,300 received 2.5 percent merit raises, according to the Associated Press. Hobson called it a distortion to say Moore ""fought"" to give him a pay raise. ""It’s just not true,"" he said. ""I got a raise like everybody else who deserved one got a raise that year."" We contacted several election law experts and political scientists to ask if court employees like Hobson and Barnett are considered ""politicians."" The answer? A resounding ""no."" ""My understanding of a politician is someone who either holds or runs for elected office, or is an official of a political party,"" said James A. Gardner, a law professor at SUNY Buffalo Law School. ""I would not count civil servants as ‘politicians.’ Court administrators are civil servants."" Richard Fording, a political science professor at the University of Alabama, said ""no reasonable person would refer to them as politicians."" Alabama court officials told us appointees of the Administrative Office of Courts are considered ""state employees."" Both Barnett and Hobson told us they considered themselves court employees, not politicians. The Strange for Senate website states that Moore fought for the pay raises during a court shutdown. (As an aside, we’d note the differing language in the website footnote, which says Moore fought for the raises ""while budget difficulties confronted the courts."") To analyze this element of the claim requires some stage-setting. In 2002, a budget battle over Alabama court funding pitted the state’s Democratically-controlled legislature and governor against Moore. As the administrative head of the state's judicial system, Moore had requested $124.7 million from Alabama lawmakers. Instead, they approved $122 million, $2.7 million shy of Moore’s request. The legislature ended its regular session on April 17 without appropriating the extra money Moore sought. The next day, Moore’s staff announced cost-cutting measures, including the curtailment of jury trials for five months. Notably, the Associated Press reported around this time that Moore ""told judges to continue merit raises promised through April 19,"" even as he ordered spending cuts. However, Alabama court officials said judicial branch merit raises were frozen after April 19. We asked the Strange campaign if its claim applied to other pay raises than those given to Hobson and Barnett; a campaign aide indicated their claim concerned only those two employees. On May 2, Moore ordered jury trials to resume, saying $500,000 in emergency funding provided by the governor would suffice. Jury trials resumed in June, according to the Birmingham News. (For his part, Hobson said he doesn’t recall any jury trials actually being suspended, though we weren’t able to independently verify this.) Either way, to the extent that Alabama courts were ""shut down,"" as the Strange campaign claims, it would have been from late April to some time in June 2002. Both Barnett and Hobson say their pay raises came in January of that year, months before the budget fight reached a crescendo in spring. A spokeswoman for the Moore campaign backed up Hobson’s claim that his pay bump came in January, though we were not able to independently verify the timing. An Associated Press article, citing records from the Retirement System of Alabama, corroborated Barnett’s claim that his raise came in January. The Strange campaign said, ""Roy Moore fought for pay increases for politicians while courts had to shut down because of lack of funding."" Of the two pay raises at issue, Moore only needed to approve one. The notion that he needed to fight for these raises is undercut by the fact that nearly half of Alabama state government employees got raises that year. In any event, experts we spoke to unanimously agreed the two pay raise recipients were not ""politicians."" To the extent that Alabama courts experienced a shutdown in 2002, it occurred months after at least one of the raises had been approved, and after Moore had publicly advocated for more funding for courts. We rate this False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8D7580>],/factchecks/2017/sep/22/luther-strange/did-roy-moore-fight-pay-raises-politicians-during-/

Are Republicans trying to allow convicted felons to own guns?
","Rep. José Serrano, D-Bronx, said legislation he’s against would allow convicted felons to own guns. That’s not allowed under federal law for most people with a felony. Serrano said a proposed amendment could change that. ""Now Republicans want to restore #gunrights to felons - something they lose after criminal conviction - CJS bills have prevented for 24 years,"" Serrano said in a tweet. Serrano was referring to a bill that allocates funds to the U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce and other agencies. He explained his position when the amendment came up for a vote in the House. ""I rise in strong opposition to this very misguided amendment,"" Serrano said. ""This amendment would allow felons and other dangerous individuals to try to regain the ability to own guns by sending an application to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives."" The amendment was agreed to by a voice vote so there’s no record of who voted which way. The bill it’s tied to has passed the House, but not the Senate. Democrats and Republicans are typically divided when it comes to gun control. But would a Republican amendment allow felons to buy guns? The amendment Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colorado, sponsored the amendment. The amendment would give the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives funding to review applications from people who want to own a gun but legally can’t under federal law. People who have served more than a year in prison are among that group. A felony conviction typically comes with a minimum prison sentence of one year. Anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence charge or received a dishonorable discharge from the military is also not allowed to own a gun. The ATF has the power to restore gun rights to those people. Federal statute says the bureau may do so if they believe the applicant ""will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest."" But Congress has denied the bureau the funding for such a program. Congress since 1993 has said no funds given to the agency ""shall be available to investigate or act upon applications for relief from Federal firearms disabilities."" That’s the legal term for someone who is not allowed to own a gun. The amendment would allow the agency to dip into federal funds to consider those applications. What it means The amendment does not give people with criminal convictions free access to firearms. Each person would be evaluated individually by the ATF. There’s no guarantee that an applicant would be granted gun rights. If someone was convicted of a violent crime, for example, the agency may consider the person to be dangerous to public safety and deny the request. Other criminal convictions may be seen as a lesser threat to public safety. Someone convicted of embezzlement in the past may be judged differently than someone with a violent felony conviction. ""Congressman Buck’s amendment allows the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to once again process petitions from citizens for the restoration of their Second Amendment rights,"" said Kyle Huwa, Buck’s spokesperson. ""This petition process is already established under federal statute. The amendment makes no determination on the substance of the petitions."" Our ruling Serrano said Republicans want to restore gun rights to felons. An amendment proposed by a Republican congressman would allow people who have been stripped of their gun rights by the government to ask for them back. That’s not limited to people with a felony and it’s not guaranteed they will be approved. Serrano’s statement is accurate but needs clarification.

Trump's misleading claim on pre-existing protections in Graham-Cassidy
","President Donald Trump said the latest Republican bill to get rid of Obamacare raises no concerns on coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. The question has become a sticking point in the repeal effort. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers could deny coverage to people who had cancer, asthma or some other illness. The law banned that practice. ""I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions,"" Trump tweeted. ""It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace."" I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal & Replace. Trump is not entirely wrong, but his tweet papers over some pitfalls in what the bill offers. The key section lies in the bill’s rules for state waivers from many regulations in the Affordable Care Act (starting at page 8 in the bill.) If a state says it ""intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions,"" then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. Under the current rules, insurance companies can’t do that. They can’t factor in health, period. In addition, current Affordable Care Act rules limit the range for premiums and say companies can’t charge an older person more than three times what they charge a younger person. The waiver does away with those limits (starting at the bottom of page 12 in the bill). A state’s commitment boils down to maintaining ""access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage."" ""That’s not nothing"" in terms of protecting people with pre-existing conditions, said Indiana University health care law professor David Gamage. But beyond that, Gamage said the protection for pre-existing conditions gets murky. ""The bill says states have to do something, but what that something is is unclear,"" Gamage said. ""And it’s overwhelmingly likely that what some states do will won’t be as robust as what people have now."" The health consulting firm Avalere found that 34 states plus the District of Columbia would see net funding cuts under the bill sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham. The Kaiser Family Foundation had a similar finding. One way or another, it costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it. On top of that, Gamage said, Affordable Care Act regulations spread some of the costs across the private sector. Those regulations would go away, too, meaning it would be up to the states to make up the difference. Cassidy spokesman Ty Bofferding disagreed. ""We have guaranteed issue and expect states to use invisible risk-sharing (where states reimburse insurers for higher cost people) or other policies to cover pre-existing conditions or face misuse of funds penalties,"" Bofferding said. That might be a sincere hope, said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein at DePaul University, but the bill’s language doesn’t back it up. ""The terms ‘adequate’ and ‘affordable’ are very much subject to interpretation,"" Epstein said. ""What is adequate and affordable for one person may not be for another.  And it almost certainly doesn’t mean that those with pre-existing conditions have to be charged the same as those without."" If states fell short, Epstein said Washington regulators could try to hold their feet to the fire and press them to do better with their federal money, but ""we can anticipate a whole lot of litigation."" And even a win for Washington might not mean much in practice. ""Folks who are sick and need health insurance coverage now don’t have the luxury of time to let these legal debates play out,"" Epstein said. Both Epstein and Gamage said in theory, states might find ways to squeeze much more health coverage out of each dollar. Or failing that, they might decide to put much more of their own money into health care and re-establish rules modeled on the Affordable Care Act. But they said neither outcome is likely. Epstein said there’s an underlying disagreement on what it means to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Under the Affordable Care Act, those people got the same kind of coverage at the same price as others. ""But that’s not what President Trump and Sen. Cassidy mean when they say that the bill continues to require coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,"" Epstein said. ""They mean that insurers will have to continue to cover people, but not at the same rates. And the policies don’t have to provide the same coverage.""   Trump said the Graham-Cassidy bill does include coverage of pre-existing conditions. The bill does address pre-existing conditions, and if states want billions of dollars in federal aid, they must show they intend to keep coverage accessible and affordable. But the other parts of the bill allow states to give insurance companies a free hand in charging those people higher premiums. Professors who study the U.S. health care system said the bill’s language protecting people with pre-existing conditions is vague and subject to broad interpretation. Plus, they said the bill’s reduction in funds going to two-thirds of the states will make it harder for them to protect people with past health problems. Under no circumstances do the protections in the bill equal the ones Americans have today under the Affordable Care Act. They are less. There’s an element of truth in Trump’s tweet but it obscures critical details. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC75940>],/factchecks/2017/sep/21/donald-trump/trumps-misleading-claim-pre-existing-protections/

Mike Pence erroneously credits Thomas Jefferson with small government quote
","Vice President Mike Pence defended the diminished role of Washington in the latest health care bill introduced in the Senate by citing ardent anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson. Pence appeared on Fox & Friends on Sept. 21, 2017, to address criticism of the proposal to dismantle the Affordable Care Act by U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt asked Pence whether proposed block grants to states would mean governors would cover pre-existing conditions. Pence sidestepped the question by suggesting local control is better than a strong central government, a point of view the third president may have endorsed. ""Thomas Jefferson said, ‘Government that governs least governs best,’ "" Pence said. ""I mean, the question that people ought to ask is, who do you think will be more responsive to the healthcare needs in your community? Your governor and your state legislature, or a congressman and a president in a far off nation’s capital?"" It must be nice to have Jefferson on your side — except Jefferson didn’t say it. ""This comes up a lot,"" said Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard legal history professor who has written extensively about Jefferson. She pointed out that the quote is so often misattributed to him that the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello in Virginia even has a web page devoted to addressing it. For years, the quote was attributed to Henry David Thoreau, who evoked the motto ""That government is best which governs least,"" in his 1849 essay Civil Disobedience. Thoreau argued that individuals should not let governments make them agents of injustice. Historians now generally accept that Thoreau was likely quoting the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, which printed in 1837 that ""The best government is that which governs least."" By 1853, credit for the sentiment passed to Jefferson, who was not necessarily a fan of strong central governments. ""Although the ideas expressed in this quotation may be in line with Jefferson's opinions to some extent, the exact phrasing is almost certainly not Jefferson's,"" foundation research librarian Anna Berkes wrote on the page. ""However, this quotation has been associated with the ideological descendants of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party for a very long time, and this is likely why it ultimately came to be attributed to him."" Berkes previously told PolitiFact that the rampant misattribution to Jefferson led her to create the ""Spurious Quotations"" page on the Monticello website. (It seems Thomas Jefferson survives through plenty more false quotes than just this one advocating for small government.) ""The opinion has been associated with Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican party ideology, which is probably why people think he said it,"" she said.

Just pay taxes and port fees. You also will receive $100 per cabin OBC."" There’s no mention of which 2017 hurricane sparked the offer, whether it be Harvey, which drenched Texas, or Irma, which blew through Florida (the ""OBC"" stands for on-board credit). But Carnival isn’t offering such a deal, because the story is fake. It’s not readily apparent, but BreakingNews247.net is one of a gaggle of websites that allow users to create their own stories, labeling them as ""prank"" articles. Below the text and some advertisements is a button that reads ""Create a Prank."" Clicking on it allows a user to build their own fake story. PolitiFact has written about similar sites before. A range of websites allowing people to generate these kinds of stories have been reported by Facebook users for all manner of faux stories, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. While some people may look at the sites as a way to create jokes, they open up the potential for a scam known as ""like farming."" That’s when users create posts to gain as many likes as possible. The scammers then use highly ranked links to spread malware, gain readers’ personal information or otherwise make money. This particular post first appeared sometime before Sept. 15, according to the Miami Herald. It drew Carnival’s attention after being posted on Facebook. The post suggested readers contact Heald, who is a real British Carnival cruise director. Heald addressed the hoax on his own Facebook profile, in which he engages Carnival customers. ""It is a fake page and we have reported the author accordingly,"" Heald wrote in a Sept. 15 Facebook post. Heald said on the post that he was aware which Facebook group was spreading the fake story but didn’t elaborate. He also called the original poster a ""soulless, heartless wanker"" and further talked about the issue in a video posted to his profile later that day. But the fake story was still available at BreakingNews247.net. As of this writing, a counter on the article said it had been shared more than 83,000 times. Don’t pack your bags just yet, because there’s no free pleasure cruise for hurricane victims. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB3FA40>],/factchecks/2017/sep/21/breakingnews247net/carnival-isnt-giving-hurricane-victims-free-cruise/

Is Missouri really outpacing nation in jobs since Greitens took office?
","Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has been pushing job growth since his 2016 campaign. In a Facebook live video on Aug. 23, Greitens said there has already been substantial improvement since he took office in January. ""Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth,"" he said. Is Missouri really ""outpacing the nation"" in jobs? We wanted to find out. The number of jobs added from January through July 2017 increased by 0.9 percent over the same period in 2016. Greitens compared Missouri to the national average job growth over the same time, which was 0.8 percent. Between January and February of 2017, Missouri job growth increased by 0.0012 percent whereas national job growth increased by 0.0016 percent. However, Missouri experienced a 0.005 drop in jobs between February and March. Greiten’s Press Secretary Parker Briden claims that the governor has created more than 35,000 jobs since then. ""Since March, we have created 37,200 jobs, while the United States as a whole has created 792,000,"" Briden said. ""Thus, in that time we account for approximately 4.7 percent of total job creation in the country, performing far better than the national average."" The standard metric for tracking job growth at the national and state level is the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics survey. As far as numbers go, Greitens has a point. But can he take credit for the job spike? In 2016, Missouri experienced a 0.2 percent hike in job growth. The same upward trend goes for 2014 and 2015, where jobs grew by 0.5 percent in the first seven months of each year. So, jobs had been added at a decent clip before Greitens took office, though not as much as this year. BLS' data shows the state of Missouri at a steady increase in job growth over the past five years. ""Most economists would say that it’s highly unlikely anything he did in the first eight months of office is the reason for this job growth,"" said Peter Mueser, an economics professor at the University of Missouri’s Truman School of Public Affairs. Mueser even went on to say that most of the time, governors don't have enough control to cause employment growth or decline. ""Lots of things contribute to the economic growth that the governor doesn't have control of,"" he said. ""Over time, population increases and every so often it's easier to claim that employment grows because of the population growth."" Greitens’ major initiatives on the economy or workforce have either not yet taken effect or only recently became law. In January, Greitens signed SB 19, a ""right-to-work"" bill that allows workers to opt out of joining a union. Greitens pledged to pass this bill while on the campaign trail and signed the bill in an abandoned warehouse in Springfield. The bill was supposed to take effect on Aug. 28. However, after more than 300,000 petitions (more than triple what is required to put a bill on the ballot) were submitted, ""right to work"" will instead be moved to the Nov. 28 ballot for the public to decide. Another bill the governor has signed but only recently went into effect is HB 130, which requires transportation network companies, such as Uber and Lyft to pay a one-time $5,000 licensing fee and conduct driver background checks and vehicle inspections. Pacific Republican Kirk Mathews sponsored the bill and says regulations will keep transportation network company drivers in Missouri. The bill is expected to created up to 10,000 new driver jobs in the state but was five days away from becoming law when Greitens made his statement. Greitens also signed SB 43, which will make it tougher for fired workers to prove employment discrimination. The governor, who signed the bill in June, said the new law will ""prevent trial lawyers from killing good jobs."" Greitens said, ""Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth."" Missouri did outpace the national average in job growth from January to June in 2017. However, Missouri’s jobs have been on a steady uphill climb since 2014, long before Greitens took office. And although Greitens has passed multiple laws affecting employment and businesses, these bills did not go into effect until Aug. 28. So there is no evidence that the continued job growth in Missouri is because of his management. Even Greitens’ press secretary didn’t provide information on how exactly Greitens has increased job growth except employment numbers. When asked for further examples on how the governor has created 37,200 jobs, Briden did not return request for comment.  We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAE8640>],/factchecks/2017/sep/21/eric-greitens/missouri-really-outpacing-nation-jobs-greitens-too/
