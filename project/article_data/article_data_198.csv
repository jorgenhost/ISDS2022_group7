Paul Ryan releases report saying percentage of Americans in 'deep poverty' has hit a record over past three years
","Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives recently released a study that critiqued the current mix of federal anti-poverty programs and suggested a new way forward. The report, titled ""The War on Poverty: 50 Years Later,"" was released by the House Budget Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Ryan was Mitt Romney’s running mate in the 2012 election and is considered a possible presidential contender in 2016. The report, released March 3, 2014, argues in part that there are too many overlapping and ineffective programs designed to help poor Americans. At one point, the authors overseen by Ryan tried to give a sense of how far-reaching the problem of poverty remains, despite the investment of countless taxpayer dollars over the course of several decades. ""Over the past three years, ‘deep poverty’ has reached its highest level on record,"" the report said. A footnote noted that a household living in ""deep poverty"" is defined as one that ""makes less than 50 percent of the poverty line."" (The report isn't the first to use the term ""deep poverty"" -- other researchers have as well.) We wondered whether this was correct, so we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the official source of federal statistics on poverty. We found a table -- ""Percent of People by Ratio of Income to Poverty Level"" -- that breaks down those who earned various percentages of the poverty line. The smallest of those ratios was half the poverty line -- the ""deep poverty"" statistic the report cited. The federal poverty level is actually a matrix of different dollar amounts. It depends on the size of the family, with larger families having a higher threshold. For one person in 2014, the poverty level is $11,670, and 50 percent of that works out to $5,835. For a family of four, the poverty level is $23,850, and 50 percent of that is $11,925. The most recent data available is for 2012. That year, the Census Bureau found that 6.6 percent of Americans earned 50 percent or less of the poverty line. It was also 6.6 percent for 2011, and it was 6.7 percent for 2010. The table includes data going back to 1975, and the percentages were never as high as they got beginning in 2010. The highest percentage before 2010 was 6.3 percent in 2009; prior to that, it was 6.2 percent in 1993. That percentage was likely higher prior to the mid-1960s, since the poverty rate as a whole between 1959 and 1965 was between 17.3 percent and 22.4 percent, well above today's 15 percent. But before 1975, the statistic was not calculated, so we can’t know the answer for 50 percent of the poverty line for sure. Not surprisingly, the percentage tends to rise after recessions, which explains the recent spike as well as the one in the early-1990s as well as another in the early 1980s. Prior to the most recent recession, the rate of Americans at 50 percent of poverty was 5.2 percent in both 2006 and 2007. Our ruling Ryan, through his committee’s report, said that over the past three years, the percentage of Americans living in ""deep poverty"" -- making less than 50 percent of the poverty line -- ""has reached its highest level on record."" The past three years -- 2010 to 2012 -- clearly produced the highest percentage since the statistic has been calculated in 1975. While it’s possible the rate was higher prior to 1975, we don’t have statistics to prove that, so there’s no data ""on record."" So we rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971E3480>],/factchecks/2014/mar/04/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-releases-report-saying-percentage-americ/
"['Georgia', 'State Budget', 'Casey Cagle']","
Cagle: State saves money with shorter session
","Georgia lawmakers have been racing through the 2014 legislative session faster than NASCAR drivers, and for many observers frightened by the prospect of 236 politicians together for a lengthy period of time, that’s a good thing. Lawmakers want to return to their districts earlier this year. Why? The political party primaries are being held on May 20, two months earlier than normal, and elected officials want more time to campaign. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle talked about the financial benefits of a short legislative session. ""For every week that we’re able to cut off our timeline, it saves us approximately $100,000,"" the Republican said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. PolitiFact Georgia decided to whip out its calculator to see whether Cagle’s math was correct. The Georgia House of Representatives and Senate typically begin their 40-day legislative session in early January and typically finish around the end of March or early April. The end of the session, or ""sine die"" as lawmakers call it, is scheduled for March 20 this year. The state Capitol can seem as frenetic as a NASCAR driver’s pit crew during the legislative session. Lawmakers, lobbyists, reporters and visitors roam the halls for various meetings during those 40 days as the Legislature passes legislation that has an impact on all 10 million Georgians. The Legislature hires additional people to help during the session, but it comes at a cost. Slightly more than 200 aides and interns are temporarily working this session, Cagle’s staff said. Those additional workers are paid about $93,000 a week, Cagle’s office said. We asked Cagle’s office for information to back up the numbers. It took some time, but they eventually came our way. Cagle’s office sent us two sets of weekly payroll data for the temporary session staff. The first was for the week ending Jan. 19. The total was $96,666.94. The other was for the week ending Feb. 9. The total was $96,673.79. The longer the Legislature is in session, the more it costs to pay those additional workers. A 40-day session stretched over 90 days would be more expensive than a 40-day session stretched over 60 days. Cagle’s spokesman, Ben Fry, said the temporary session staff is one of three factors that the lieutenant governor had in mind when he made his statement. The second is the cost to the state for lawmakers to drive to and from the state Capitol each week. Legislators receive round-trip mileage reimbursement once a week for travel to and from Atlanta. All 236 lawmakers are eligible to get about 56 cents -- the federal standard -- for each mile they drive. The weekly total? It’s at least $20,000, Cagle said. Each lawmaker would drive an average of about 150 miles round-trip to get to that $20,000 estimate. Other Georgia lawmakers have written about the taxpayer savings of a more condensed legislative session, citing similar numbers for the cost of temporary staff. ""For every week the General Assembly is in session, temporary staff in both chambers cost the state approximately $93,000 per week in payroll – and that’s not even including the savings from legislator per diem,"" Sen. Bill Heath, R-Bremen, wrote in an item on GaPundit.com. Ah, what about the per diem? Shouldn’t that be included in the cost? That brings us to the third factor Cagle had in mind. Georgia lawmakers currently get a daily per diem of $173 for travel and other expenses. That adds up to about $200,000 a week. Adding the per diem to the cost of temporary session staff increases the weekly cost to about $300,000. Wouldn’t that mean Cagle underestimated the weekly total cost? ""That cost (of giving lawmakers a per diem for 40 days) is the same regardless of how the session goes,"" said Fry, Cagle’s spokesman. Fry said the savings would come from what he described as ""sandwich days."" These are weekdays when the Legislature is not in session. Lawmakers can still request the $173 per diem. Fry said it’s difficult to come up with an estimate of how much those days cost taxpayers, but he said it can add up. To sum up, Cagle said the state could save $100,000 for each week the Legislature can reduce their session schedule. Cagle’s argument is the longer the Legislature is in session, the more it costs Georgia taxpayers. The lieutenant governor’s statement is correct that it costs a good bit of money to operate when the Legislature is in session, if you consider the cost of temporary staff alone. If you consider the regular per diem costs, Cagle’s weekly estimate of $100,000 seems too conservative. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F9B600>],/factchecks/2014/mar/04/casey-cagle/cagle-state-saves-money-shorter-session/

Director Steve McQueen dedicated his Oscar to the 21 million people still in slavery
","The 86th Academy Awards featured the expected red-carpet pageantry, a few surprise winners, a ""selfie"" that went viral and a mid-show pizza party, courtesy of host Ellen Degeneres. But it wasn’t until the end of the three-and-a-half hour affair that viewers finally learned this year’s pick for best picture. The award went to 12 Years a Slave, the powerful true story of a black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South during the mid-1800s. In accepting the award, director Steve McQueen delivered an emotional tribute. ""Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live. This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup,"" McQueen said. ""I dedicate this award to all the people who have endured slavery. And the 21 million people who still suffer slavery today."" Because we’re PunditFact, we can’t even watch the Oscars without our ears perking up at such a statistic, especially when millions of people potentially heard it, too. So we decided to put McQueen’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. Modern slavery is often referred to today as ""forced labor"" or sometimes ""trafficking in persons."" It’s not as easily defined as the slave trade of the antebellum American South, nor is it simple to identify victims. The United States Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines trafficking in persons two ways. There is sex trafficking ""in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age."" Then there’s a more general category: ""the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery."" There are many different examples of modern slavery worldwide. The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency, looks for 11 indicators to identify forced labor: Abuse of vulnerability Deception Restriction of movement Isolation Physical and sexual violence Intimidation and threats Retention of identity documents Withholding of wages Debt bondage Abusive working and living conditions Excessive overtime. Estimates on modern slavery vary because victims are difficult to identify and do not often come forward. The United Nation’s International Labor Organization believes the best way to get statistics on slavery is through national surveys, but so far ""only a handful of countries have undertaken special surveys on this topic."" As a result ""the practice is extremely difficult to research and quantify as it is most often hidden and out-of-sight of law enforcement."" Because of this, only 46,570 victims were formally documented by law enforcement agencies internationally in 2012, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report. Still, overall estimates exist. The International Labor Organization estimated in June 2012 that 20.9 million individuals were in forced labor. This included 15.4 million adults and 5.5 million children. About 55 percent are women or girls. By far, the most common purveyor of forced labor is in Asia, where 11.7 million are in slave-like conditions. Africa is second at 3.7 million. Labor exploitation is most common worldwide with 14.2 million forced laborers, while 4.5 million are exploited for sex. State-enforced labor entraps 2.2 million, the group estimated. The organization has changed how it calculates the figure. As recently as 2005, the estimate for forced laborers was much smaller, at 12 million people, so identifying trends is not possible using their data. Other organizations, however, have estimated that the figure is much higher. Luis CdeBaca, the Ambassador-at-Large in the Office To Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, testified to Congress in 2013 that there were ""up to 27 million people living in slavery."" A State Department spokesman told us that language was agreed to after consulting with industry experts. The Walk Free Foundation, an international organization committed to ending modern slavery, estimates the figure at between 28.3 million and 31.3 million in its Global Slavery Index. We reached out to McQueen’s representation to see if they could provide a source for his claim. If we hear back, we’ll update the post. Our ruling  In his acceptance speech, McQueen said he dedicated his Oscar to the ""21 million people who still suffer slavery today."" That figure is based on a 2012 estimate from the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency. Estimates vary across organizations, and a true headcount is nearly impossible to predict with any certainty. Still, McQueen cited the estimate of the international community’s most reliable source. We rate his statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE64C0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/03/steve-mcqueen/director-steve-mcqueen-dedicated-his-oscar-21-mill/

Rick Scott says Medicare rate cuts will affect seniors’ ability to keep their doctor, hospital and prevention services
","Seniors (particularly voters), listen up: Medicare cuts have arrived -- and the way Gov. Rick Scott tells it, they’re going to lead to some sickening results. In an online ad created by Scott’s campaign, he speaks in a testimonial style to the ""wonderful seniors in our state"" who depend on Medicare. Scott, and his likely Democratic opponent former Gov. Charlie Crist, will compete for the senior vote in the November election. Here’s part of the script: ""We already know that 300,000 people in our state were told they are going to lose their insurance, but now under Medicare we are seeing these dramatic rate cuts. It’s going to have a devastating impact on their ability to one, get the doctor, look they rely on their doctor, get to go to the hospital that they trust, make sure they get prevention services that they deserve. These Medicare cuts that the president has caused are the wrong thing for Florida seniors."" PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about those 300,000 Floridians who are losing Florida Blue plans but are being transitioned to other ones. Here, we wanted to fact-check Scott’s claim about whether dramatic rate cuts to Medicare will result in a ""devastating impact"" on seniors' ability to keep their doctor, hospital and get prevention services. In response to Scott’s ad, the Florida Democratic Party issued a press release that accused Scott of overseeing ""the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history."" We rated that claim Mostly True.  Announcement of cuts Scott’s ad posted a few days after the Obama administration announced a proposed rate cut to Medicare Advantage -- but Scott didn’t specify in his ad that he was referring to only those seniors on that particular type of Medicare. Nationwide, nearly one-third of Medicare recipients are on Medicare Advantage, or about 16 million. The proportion is about the same in Florida, where about 1.4 million are on Medicare Advantage, and roughly 4.4 million are in traditional Medicare. On Feb. 21, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a proposed cut to Medicare Advantage Plans for 2015. While CMS describes it as a 1.9 percent cut, some insurers say the actual cut could be higher when taking into account other health care law changes. America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, says the cut is about 5.9 percent and will lead to a loss of benefits and choices for people on Medicare Advantage. The amount is expected to be finalized April 7, and industry groups and a bipartisan group of senators have started to lobby against it. The health care law tries to bring down future health care costs of Medicare largely by reducing Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers. President George W. Bush started Medicare Advantage in hopes the increased competition would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers. Advantage plans are required to offer basic health benefits that are at least as rich as original Medicare. But many offer extras, such as rebates on premiums, routine dental care, gym memberships and rides to the doctor, in order to compete for business. Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair pointed to articles in the Washington Post and Kaiser/USA Today about insurers cutting doctors from Medicare Advantage. (Both articles were written several weeks before the actual rate cut was proposed.) Reuters stated that insurers said they would only maintain benefits if there was no cut. ""Thousands of primary-care doctors and specialists across the country have been terminated from privately run Medicare Advantage plans, ...."" the Post wrote. ""Insurers say they must shrink their physician networks because they face billions of dollars in government-payment cuts over the next decade — reductions that are being used partly to fund insurance coverage for millions of people under the federal Affordable Care Act."" The Post wrote that medical associations describe the dismissals as the largest in the program’s history and that the American Medicare Association called for the cuts to be reversed. The Kaiser/USA Today December article states that the cut of thousands of doctors includes Florida, where ""UnitedHealthcare has dropped the state’s only National Cancer Institute-designated cancer treatment facility, the Moffitt Cancer Center and its 250 physicians in Tampa."" Experts say we don’t yet know full impact We interviewed several health care experts to ask if the Medicare Advantage cuts will result in seniors losing access to their doctors, hospitals or preventative services. Many experts said it could be several months until we get a better picture of what the rate cut means for patients -- and that the answer could vary state by state, or county by county. Lowell Richard works for a contracting agency, Adcahb Medical Coverages, that sells Medicare plans, including Medicare Advantage in Florida. ""There will be some fallout -- absolutely,"" said Richard, vice president of training and education. However, ""it’s going to vary from county to county. It’s really way too early to tell."" Any company that decides to pull out of Advantage or make changes would have to file plans with CMS this summer, he said. Will the results be ""devastating"" in Florida as Scott said? ""That depends where you live,"" said Richard, who is based in Broward County. In a smaller county with only a few types of plans, the result might mean the senior has to switch to another type of Medicare plan and the costs could go up. Some doctors will no longer be on certain Advantage plans. Though they will be replaced by others, it could mean some seniors will lose their particular doctor, Richard said. ""There is no way to know how plans will respond to the proposed reductions in payments for 2015,"" said Tricia Neuman, director of the Kaiser Foundation’s Program on Medicare Policy. ""The plans could choose to stay the course or reduce their costs in ways that would affect beneficiaries. The response could vary among insurers, and by county. The plans could choose to raise premiums, raise cost-sharing, tighten their provider networks, or even withdraw from the Medicare program altogether, but we won’t know the lay of the land until next fall."" Margaret Murphy, attorney and associate director Center for Medicare Advocacy, said that Medicare Advantage plans have always had a limited network of preferred providers and that changes in networks can happen every year. (Traditional Medicare has no networks, so participants can go to any Medicare eligible provider.) ""We are seeing (Medicare Advantage) plans change their business plans already although it’s difficult to know which changes are due to ordinary business reasons and which are the result"" of the health care law, she said. Robert Moffit, a health care expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that we have already seen an impact because insurers including UnitedHealthcare have let go of thousands of physicians. That includes cutting an entire hospital -- Yale New Haven Hospital -- from its Medicare Advantage network. ""I can’t speak personally with regard to Florida, but yes, the projections are you will see significant reductions in payments over 10 years,"" Moffit said. Medicare has a broader provider network than many Advantage plans, ""so even if plans cut benefits and caused someone to go back to traditional Medicare their access to doctors likely would not erode and might actually improve,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina. Medicare requires plans to cover all Medicare-covered benefits, which means if a prevention benefit such as a mammogram is covered by traditional Medicare, it would also be covered by an Advantage plan, Neuman said. However, Advantage plans could cut the extras which aren’t covered by traditional Medicare such as a gym membership. Our ruling ""We are seeing dramatic rate cuts,"" to Medicare that will have a ""devastating impact"" on seniors’ ability to get their doctor, their hospital and prevention services, Scott tells seniors in an online campaign ad. Scott omits that the recently announced rate cuts were for Medicare Advantage plans, a subset of Medicare. Those plans represent about one-third of Medicare plans in Florida and nationwide. The proposed rate cut won’t be finalized until April, and if it is, health care experts say we won’t know the full impact for a few months. That means it’s too soon to predict if the rate cut will have a ""devastating impact"" on seniors' ability to keep their same doctor and hospital. It is possible that some seniors on Medicare Advantage will lose or have to change doctors, but the impact could vary from county to county. Seniors on traditional Medicare are not affected by the cuts. Scott’s ad is a scare tactic that omits several caveats. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809764DC00>],/factchecks/2014/mar/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-medicare-rate-cuts-will-affect-sen/

Rick Scott 'oversaw the largest Medicare fraud' in U.S. history, Florida Democratic Party says
","First, Gov. Rick Scott scared the bejesus out of seniors with an online ad claiming that Medicare rate cuts would lead them to lose access to their doctors, hospitals and preventive care. Then, the Florida Democratic Party fired back at Scott, issuing a press release that called Scott ""the ultimate Medicare thief."" The Democrats were referring to Scott’s prior tenure as CEO of Columbia/HCA about a decade ago, when the hospital company was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud. ""Rick Scott is saying Democrats are committing Medicare robbery, when in fact he's the ultimate Medicare thief. He lost the right to accuse Democrats of raiding Medicare when he oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history. Rick Scott's company stole money that should have gone to health care for seniors,"" said Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp in the Feb. 25 press release. Separately, we have fact-checked Scott’s claim ""we are seeing dramatic rate cuts"" to Medicare that will affect people's choice of doctor, hospital and preventive care. We concluded that Scott had failed to say that the rate cut only applies to Medicare Advantage, and thus only affects a fraction of all Medicare beneficiaries. Also, it could be several months before we know the actual impact of the cut which could vary county by county. We rated Scott's claim Mostly False. Here, we’ll fact-check the Democratic counter-attack that Scott ""oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history."" Scott’s tenure at Columbia/HCA During Scott’s 2010 race for governor, PolitiFact fact-checked multiple claims related to his tenure at Columbia/HCA. Now, we’ll recap some of our earlier discussion of the investigation and fine. Scott started what was first Columbia in 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he would add hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott’s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. In 1997, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. During his 2010 race, the Miami Herald reported that Scott had said he would have immediately stopped his company from committing fraud -- if only ""somebody told me something was wrong."" But there were such warnings in the company’s annual public reports to stockholders -- which Scott had to sign as president and CEO. Scott wanted to fight the accusations, but the corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement: • Columbia billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians; • The company attached false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals; • The company illegally claimed non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education; • Columbia billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion. On Scott’s 2010 campaign website, he admitted to the $1.7 billion fine, though the link is no longer on the site. What type of record was that fine? The fine clearly set a record, though the Justice Department (and media reports at the time) were not always consistent in their terminology, sometimes describing it as the ""largest government fraud settlement in U.S. History"" and other times more specifically as the ""largest health care fraud case in U.S. History.""  A Justice Department spokeswoman said that officials refer to Columbia/HCA as ""largest health care fraud"" rather than the more narrow term ""Medicare fraud"" because it involved defrauding other government programs such as Medicaid rather than Medicare exclusively. The Justice Department described in detail the various ways the company defrauded Medicare and other government health programs here. Here’s a key point, though: While the Columbia/HCA settlement was a record at the time for health care fraud, it has since been surpassed. In cases related to the improper promotion of certain drugs, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a a $2.2 billion settlement in 2013, Pfizer settled for $2.3 billion in 2009, and GlaxoSmithKline settled for $3 billion in 2012. ""HCA was the record health care fraud at the time. It’s now Glaxo,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Linda Mansour told PolitiFact in an email. That said, these cases were a little different. While the Justice Department’s case against Columbia/HCA repeatedly mentions overbilling and defrauding Medicare and Medicaid specifically, the three newer cases focused on the marketing of drugs, with Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs caught up in the impropriety, rather than being the specific targets of the fraud. Because the Justice Department press releases explaining the settlements don’t explicitly break down how much of the misconduct in those more recent cases defrauded Medicare explicitly, it’s difficult to make comparisons. The Pfizer case includes violations relating to misbranding and kickbacks, ""so there may be a distinction to be made for that reason when thinking about whether it all should be classified under the very general category of ‘Medicare fraud,’ "" said Asha Scielzo, who practices health care law at the firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. The Columbia/HCA case ""still is the largest fraud settlement for a hospital corporation in U.S. history,"" since all the others involved pharmaceutical firms, added Zack Buck, a health care law professor at Mercer. ""So I guess, the quote (by the Florida Democratic Party) is a little loose."" The Scott campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check. However in 2010, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times, ""There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader."" Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Scott ""oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation’s history."" The Columbia/HCA settlement has since been surpassed in dollar value, though the bigger cases involved Medicare somewhat less directly. Because the Democratic Party could have been a bit more specific in its wording -- by saying that Scott oversaw the largest Medicare fraud at the time -- we rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fcf7f511-cd67-45a3-90da-1b8284f049c1",[<zip object at 0x00000280971C49C0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/03/florida-democratic-party/rick-scott-rick-scott-oversaw-largest-medicare-fra/

Georgia's forfeiture laws viewed harshly
","There aren’t many issues that can bring the American Civil Liberties Union and the tea party together, but there is one matter that has them and others on the same side. A coalition of organizations -- they call themselves Georgians for Forfeiture Reform -- recently held a news conference at the Georgia Capitol to plead for changes to the state’s civil forfeiture laws. How bad are the laws? ""Georgia’s civil forfeiture laws are among the worst in the country and the very worst in the South,"" Americans for Prosperity Georgia spokesman Joel Aaron Foster said in a press release beforehand. Lee McGrath, legislative counsel for the Institute for Justice, a Virginia-based organization that has taken a close look at the issue, repeated the talking point at the news conference. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if this claim is correct, or is this another example of some groups exaggerating the significance of a problem? Critics say some law enforcement officers unfairly keep money seized from motorists who are investigated for drug trafficking and other offenses and eventually cleared. One man spent $12,000 in legal fees to recover $43,000 police took from him when he was pulled over in South Georgia, the institute noted. The coalition wants the Georgia Legislature to pass House Bill 1, which would put law enforcement and prosecutors under greater scrutiny over how they use cash and property seized in criminal investigations. Supporters want Georgia’s forfeiture laws to be patterned after the rules in North Carolina, in which a jury can consider seizing property only after a conviction, and only if it was used for a crime. The legislation, sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Wendell Willard, R-Sandy Springs, received committee approval in early February. Its co-sponsors include House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, D-Atlanta. The bill has yet to come up for a vote in the House of Representatives. Some law enforcement leaders, such as Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter, support the legislation after initial reluctance to do so. Others, such as the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association, think Georgia laws are fine and have said no changes are necessary. To be clear, PolitiFact Georgia is not making a judgment call on whether Georgia has the worst forfeiture laws around. Instead, our goal is to see whether the claim is based on valid reports and research about Georgia’s forfeiture laws. Lawmakers worked out what they hope is a compromise to get the bill passed shortly after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published several reports last year that called into question how forfeiture funds are used. The newspaper found Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard spent thousands of dollars of forfeited funds on galas, sports tickets, staff parties and elaborate home security. Last year, Douglas County District Attorney David McDade was accused of using his forfeiture account to give side jobs and government cars to favored employees. Current state law requires agencies to file reports on their forfeiture activity with a state-run website each year, but the AJC found that few complied and that those who did gave little information. The new proposal would standardize the process and require more disclosure. The Institute for Justice released a report last year on forfeiture laws and found similar issues concerning the state’s disclosure process. A random sample of 20 law enforcement agencies found only two were providing annual reports, the institute found. Other agencies were submitting reports omitting key details. ""Reports from police departments in Atlanta, Dunwoody, Marietta and LaGrange, for example, provide only dollar amounts but no descriptions of the properties taken,"" the institute wrote in its study. The study did not contain responses from those departments to the concerns outlined in the report. Dunwoody police Chief Billy Grogan said the department complied with all reporting requirements. Georgia’s grade on the quality of its forfeiture laws put it on the dishonor roll. D-. Thank God for Michigan, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. They received the same grade, the lowest in the nation. Another study by a three-person team of researchers on state forfeiture laws showed some of what critics such as the Institute for Justice say is troubling about Georgia’s forfeiture laws. For example, Georgia puts property owners in the position of providing the burden of proof to reclaim their property. The study, though, does not rank which states have the best or the worst laws. So where does this leave us? To sum up, Georgians for Forfeiture Reform argues the Peach State has some of the worst civil forfeiture laws in the nation and the worst in the South. The claim is based on a recent report by one of the groups lobbying for legislation they believe will be more equitable to Georgians. It does rank Georgia at the bottom nationally, with a few other states. Another report highlights what critics say are some of Georgia’s flaws. Unfortunately, there’s little independent research on how states fare on the topic. The claim is also based on an interpretation of those laws. With these caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3A6680>],/factchecks/2014/mar/03/americans-prosperity-georgia-chapter/georgias-forfeiture-laws-viewed-harshly/

Virginia Interfaith Center says minimum wage households face poverty
","Pro and con, about a dozen speakers came forward last month when the House of Delegates  Commerce and Labor Committee invited comment on bills to raise Virginia’s minimum wage.   Robin Gahan, the director of programs at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, urged an increase, saying families can’t get by on the bottom rate of $7.25 an hour, which is also the national floor. ""In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage could actually support a family of three above the poverty line,"" Gahan said. ""Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two."" The Republican-controlled committee went on to kill three bills this winter that would have increased the minimum wage, maintaining that raising the rate would force employers to cut jobs. But the issue remains alive in Washington, where the U.S. Senate this spring is expected to vote on legislation that would raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. So we looked into the Interfaith Center’s claim. Gahan pointed us to a December 2013 report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that advocates boosting the wage. A graph measures the minimum wage over the years against household poverty levels.   In 1968, the minimum wage for most workers was $1.60 an hour. An employee working at that rate for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have earned $3,328. That was above the poverty thresholds that year for a three person-household: $2,817 annually for a home headed by a man and $2,516 for a home headed by a woman. The minimum wage was bifurcated back then, however, and a small group of employees -- including workers at schools, public hospitals, laundries, hotels and motels -- could be paid as little as $1.15 an hour. Those employees, working full time every week of the year, would have earned $2,392 annually and fallen below the poverty line for a three-person household. Congress ended the dual minimum wages in 1978. Now, let’s move forward to modern times. The $7.25 hourly minimum was established in 2009. A full-time minimum wage earner makes $15,080 a year. That falls slightly below the average 2013 poverty threshold for a family of two, which is $15,156.  There are a few details about all these numbers that should be noted: Our ruling There’s a slight snag in the first part of the Virginia Interfaith Center’s claim that, in 1968, a full- time minimum wage earner could support a household of three above the poverty line. The wage was bifurcated then. The majority earning $1.60 an hour could support a family of three, but a small group of workers qualifying for $1.15 an hour would have lived below the poverty line The second part of the center’s claim -- that a full-time worker today could not raise a family of two on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour -- holds up. Clearly, the buying power of the minimum wage has decreased in recent decades. The center tried to illustrate that point with a statement that is accurate but needs a little clarification. So we rate its claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A32BB00>],/factchecks/2014/mar/03/virginia-interfaith-center-public-policy/va-interfaith-center-says-minimum-wage-households-/

Historical claim shows why Crimea matters to Russia
","President Barack Obama has been vocal in his opposition to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s military intervention in Ukraine. Focus has shifted from the new government in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, to Crimea, a region Russian troops seized control of Saturday. Meanwhile, politicians and pundits are divided over what the United States’ role should be in the conflict. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius criticized Putin’s actions on Face the Nation, saying Ukraine ""is not prepared to go backwards"" to a Russian regime. He then offered up some context about Crimea’s history. ""Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954,"" he said. ""Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people."" Ignatius was correct in saying that Ukraine has only controlled the Crimean Peninsula since 1954 -- a claim we also heard from U.S. Rep. Mike Roger, R-Mich., on Fox News Sunday. Not up on your Soviet history? We’ll review the facts. Crimea is an eastern Ukrainian peninsula located on the Black Sea. It’s connected to the rest of the country by a small strip of land. Out of its 2 million residents, about 60 percent identify as Russian. That’s the highest concentration of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Although the territory belongs to Ukraine, Russia stations part of its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol as part of a pre-existing agreement between the two countries. As Ignatius pointed out, Crimea hasn’t always been part of Ukraine. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happened in the region since the Ottoman Empire used the peninsula as a hub for slave trade. 1783: Russia annexed Crimea. 1853: The Crimean War began, lasting three years. Russia lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Crimea remained part of Russia. 1917: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War. 1921: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union. 1942: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea. 1944: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members’ alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II. Many returned to Crimea in the 1980s and 1990s. 1945: After World War II, the autonomous Soviet republic was dissolved and Crimea became a province of the Soviet Union called the Crimean Oblast. 1954: Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine. It’s often reported that it was a gesture of goodwill from Khrushchev, who had Ukrainian roots. 1991: The Soviet Union collapsed. Many expected President Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation, to take Crimea for Russia. But he didn’t bring it up during negotiations with Ukraine. 1997: Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that allowed Russia to keep its fleet in Sevastopol. The agreement’s since been extended, so the fleet is set to remain there until at least 2042. As for Ignatius’ claim that Khrushchev’s decision to give Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, we found literature to support that. Slate’s Joshua Keating offered up possible reasons for the land transfer, including the 300th anniversary of Ukraine’s merger with tsarist Russia and Khrushchev’s ties to Ukraine. Though Khrushchev’s gesture had unclear motives, it didn’t seem like a problem for Russia at the time, only garnering a one-sentence write-up in the official Soviet newspaper. It became a bigger issue in the region once the Soviet Union collapsed decades later. So the story of the Crimean Peninsula is long and complicated, to say the least. And there could be more news to come as war threatens Eastern Europe. Today, Crimea’s residents are divided on the issue of Russia’s military intervention. Generally speaking, ethnic Russians support Russia’s involvement in the region, while Tatars and Ukrainians express pro-Ukrainian sentiments. Our ruling Ignatius said Crimea belonged to Russia until 1954, when Khrushchev gave the land to Ukraine, then a Soviet republic. Ignatius’ history lesson explains why Russians remain so intertwined with Crimea and why some Americans are worried that Russians will try to annex the peninsula. We rate Ignatius’ statement True. Correction: About 60 percent of people living in Crimea identify themselves as Russian. An earlier version of this story described the statistic differently.

John Kerry tells CBS viewers that Russian isolation comes with big economic risks
","American and European leaders find themselves scrambling to respond to Russia’s deployment of troops in the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine. With military action on no one’s wish-list, diplomacy and economic sanctions are the only moves effectively in play. Secretary of State John Kerry said on CBS’ Face the Nation that he had been on the phone with his counterparts among the G-8 nations. ""Every single one of them are prepared to go to the hilt in order to isolate Russia with respect to this invasion,"" Kerry said. ""They’re prepared to put sanctions in place, they’re prepared to isolate Russia economically, the ruble is already going down. Russia has major economic challenges."" This fact-check zeros in on the value of the Russian ruble. It has declined but partly because that’s what the Russians wanted. A big drop In the early part of 2013, the ruble was worth 3.3 U.S. cents. Today, its value has tumbled by 15 percent, to 2.8 cents. A little less than half of that fall came in January as the situation in Ukraine deteriorated. Here’s the picture over the past year, taken from the currency exchange service XE.com:    There is no question that the violence and political turmoil in Ukraine took a toll on the ruble. Russian banks have about $28 billion in loans in the country. Before the Russian troops moved in, investors were already worried. Last week, two of the largest banks in Russia said they would suspend any new lending in Ukraine. But the ruble’s decline has deeper roots. In 2010, the Russian Central Bank announced it wanted to get out of the business of setting the ruble’s value on the international market. It had in mind a gradual glide path for the currency’s fall, and in October, it gave the ruble even more leeway to drop further. The country’s economy grew less than 2 percent last year, and it has struggled to keep inflation in check. ""The ruble got pretty over-valued in the big energy boom from 2001-08,"" said Mark Adomanis, a management consultant and contributor to Forbes. That hurt Russian manufacturing and letting the ruble fall potentially could help. ""With a weaker ruble Russian goods become more competitive on international markets,"" Adomanis said. That said, a free fall is not what the Russian Central Bank has in mind. In January, the bank signaled that it would step in to prop up the ruble. But the overall policy remains the same. Our ruling Kerry said the ruble is going down, and it is. The Russian currency has lost about 15 percent of its value against the dollar since early 2013. It is not all because of the situation in Ukraine, however, a fact that viewers may not have picked up on by hearing Kerry's statement. The currency’s decline is also part of Russian policy to reduce inflation and make domestic manufacturers more competitive. There’s a little more going on here than Kerry’s statement would suggest. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809780F480>],/factchecks/2014/mar/02/john-kerry/john-kerry-tells-cbs-viewers-russian-isolation-com/

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson links strict gun control laws in Chicago with a high murder rate
","Citing the number of school shootings since Sandy Hook, a woman asked U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson at one of his town hall meetings why he doesn’t support expanded background checks for gun purchases. The Wisconsin Republican responded by connecting strict gun control with a high rate of homicide. ""I’ll repeat it: I think we have enough gun laws on the books; we should enforce those,"" Johnson told his audience in Appleton on Feb. 18, 2014. ""But, if you really take a look -- again, look at the facts. The most stringent gun laws on the books are in places like Chicago, (which) has the highest murder rate. ""I mean, you see a lot of these -- and let’s face it, they’re all tragedies. I wish there was some magic solution to end those tragedies, prevent them, but there’s not. Some of these tragedies occurred with firearms that were legally obtained. We’ve got, what, 300 million guns on the streets? These tragedies occur in gun-free zones. So, law-abiding citizens abide by those laws; the criminals don’t."" Is Johnson right that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, as well as the highest murder rate? And that the two are tied together? We’ll check both parts of his claim. Chicago gun laws, murders Two days after the town hall meeting, we asked Johnson spokesman Patrick McIlheran for evidence to support the senator’s claim. The next day, a blog post titled, ""If stricter gun laws were a magic wand, Chicago would be safe,"" appeared on Johnson’s official Senate web page. McIlheran referred us to the post and said he didn’t have time to discuss Johnson’s claim. In the post, Johnson cited reports from 2013 by National Public Radio and The New York Times in saying that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest anti-gun laws. Several experts told us there is wide consensus on that point. But Johnson changed the part of his claim about murder in Chicago. Chicago doesn’t have the highest murder rate among U.S. cities -- as in, the number of murders per 100,000 residents -- but rather the highest number of murders, Johnson wrote. The blog cited the latest full-year FBI figures, for 2012. Chicago ranked first among cities in raw numbers, with 500 murders. But its 18.5 murders per 100,000 people didn’t even put the Windy City among the top 10 cities for murder rate. Those figures are for all murders. We also found a January 2013 report by economist Richard Florida that said Chicago had a rate of 11.6 gun murders per 100,000 residents, far below the city with the highest rate, New Orleans, at 62.1. So, on the first part of Johnson’s claim, Chicago has some of the most stringent gun-control laws in the United States, but does not have the highest murder rate. Connecting gun laws, murder rates By citing Chicago in his remarks at the town hall meeting, Johnson’s message was that strict gun-control laws are not associated with low murder rates. In his blog post, Johnson wrote that Chicago has a much higher murder rate than Racine and Kenosha -- much smaller cities in Wisconsin, which the senator said has ""more reasonable gun laws."" But we found that, on any connection between gun control and murder, the evidence is mixed. For example, had Johnson singled out another heavy-gun-control city -- New York -- in questioning the effectiveness of strict gun control, his audience at the town hall meeting would have gotten an entirely different impression. In 2012, New York’s overall murder rate was 3.8 per 100,000 residents -- far below Chicago’s 18.5. Similarly, the Richard Florida study we noted found that New York's gun murder rate was 4 per 100,000 people and Chicago’s was 11.6 per 100,000. Other views Experts we consulted agreed there is no consensus on whether there is a clear correlation -- much less evidence of cause and effect -- between gun-control laws and a lower murder rate. They said that is particularly true in assessing the relatively few city-level gun control laws, given that most gun laws are put in place at the state and federal level. For one thing, even if a city has strict laws on who can own guns, that doesn't mean it is difficult to bring guns into that city, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. He said one study found that one-third of the guns recovered by police from criminals and crime scenes in Chicago had been purchased in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio or Mississippi -- states that, according to Webster, have the weakest gun laws. ""Not surprisingly, it turns out this is a pretty complex thing to study,"" he said. Webster said that while it is difficult to compare cities, given their differences in demographics and other factors, it is possible to examine how a change in gun restrictions is correlated with gun crime. A study of his released in February 2014, cited by the Think Progress liberal blog, looked at what happened after Missouri in 2007 repealed a law that had required gun buyers in private gun transactions to undergo background checks. It found the repeal ""was associated with"" an additional 55 to 63 murders per year  between 2008 and 2012. At the same time, there have been studies that found the opposite -- a link between fewer gun restrictions and lower murder rates. The findings of a November 2013 study by Quinnipiac University economics professor Mark Gius, which examined data from 1980 through 2009 and was cited by the National Rifle Association, ""suggest"" that states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murder rates. The results, the study added, ""suggest that restrictive concealed weapons laws may cause an increase in gun-related murders at the state level."" Guis told us that assessing gun laws and crime is difficult because so many factors, including poverty and drugs, affect crime rates. Moreover, gun murders committed in the heat of passion or in mass shootings are often carried out by people with no criminal record, many of whom would pass a gun background check, he said. ""You really can't draw any direct correlation, definitely no cause and effect,"" Guis said, ""especially with city level gun-control laws -- to crime."" Our rating Johnson said that even though Chicago has ""the most stringent guns laws on the books,"" it still ""has the highest murder rate"" in the country. Chicago does have some of the strictest gun-control laws, but is not number one among U.S. cities for the murder rate. Meanwhile, the evidence is mixed on whether stricter gun control is associated with fewer murders. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we rate Johnson’s claim Half True.

Author Bing West says 75% of young adults in U.S. not mentally or physically fit to serve in military
 ","Bing West, Marine veteran of Vietnam and an expert on counterinsurgency warfare, was discussing military preparedness with host Gene Valicenti last week on WPRO-AM. They were talking about Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel’s proposed defense budget, which includes, among other spending cuts, trimming the Army from its current level of 520,000 troops to as low as 440,000 active duty soldiers, the lowest level since before World War II. West opposes the troop reductions, saying such cuts would make it difficult for the United States to respond quickly to future military threats. If those kinds of cuts must be made, he said, it is common sense to have a backup mobilization plan in place to rapidly increase the size of the military. In other words, he said, a draft. Besides the obvious political challenges in reinstituting the draft, which ended in 1973, West said there’s a logistical problem as well: Seventy-five percent of the young adults in this country are not mentally or physically fit to serve, he said. Watch out, Valicenti warned, Politifact might hear you. Well, we did. West’s number sounded high, so we went out to muster the facts. When we called West, he said he got the figure from reports he’d read in newspapers around the country, most recently the Washington Post. We looked for the original research that might have driven those reports, and we found it. The 75 percent unfit figure has been reported for a few years now.   It came from a 2009 report called ""Ready, Willing and Unable to Serve, 75 Percent of Young Adults Cannot Join the Military."" The report was prepared by Mission Readiness, an organization that includes 89 retired military officials,  including a former navy secretary, and officers from generals to chief petty officers and sergeant majors. The group advocates for improvements in the United States’ education system and the health of the nation’s youth.   The report said increasing obesity rates among Americans ages 17 to 24, declining high school graduation rates and criminal backgrounds were severely narrowing the pool of applicants who could meet the armed forces’ academic and physical health standards for recruits. The report noted that one in four young Americans lacks a high school diploma and 30 percent of those who have one and try to enlist fail the military’s math and reading tests. It also estimated that 27 percent of those between 17 and 24 could not hit the armed forces’ weight limits and 32 percent had other health problems, such as asthma, poor eyesight or hearing or attention deficit disorders, that ruled them out for military service. The report also said about 10 percent of the potential military service population was ineligible because of at least one prior felony or serious misdemeanor. Mission:Readiness isn’t the only one sounding that alarm. On March 3, 2009, Curtis Gilroy, then the director of the accession policy office of the undersecretary for defense for personnel and readiness, told the U. S. Congress’ House Armed Services Committee pretty much the same thing. He cited the primary drivers as obesity and low high school graduation rates when he said ""we find that only 25 percent of our young people today, aged 17 to 24, are qualified for military service. Not a good situation.""     Our ruling Bing West said 75 percent of young adults in the United States were physically or mentally unfit to serve in the military. The Defense Department and a non-governmental organization have both done research that support his claim. We find the statement  True. (Comment on this ruling on providencejournal.com.

Louise Slaughter tweets that four-in-five black and Hispanic fourth-graders aren't proficient in reading
","President Barack Obama recently announced a new initiative that was close to his heart: a national effort to close achievement gaps and create opportunities for minority boys. ""My Brothers Keeper,"" unveiled at the White House on Feb. 27, 2014, combines philanthropy and research to help move young men of color from the streets into schools and the workforce. ""I'm going to pen this presidential memorandum directing the federal government not to spend more money, but to do things smarter, to determine what we can do right now to improve the odds for boys and young men of color, and make sure our agencies are working more effectively with each other, with those businesses, with those philanthropies and with local communities to implement proven solutions,"" Obama said at the White House launch event. Many Democrats in Congress voiced their support for Obama’s push to help young minorities. Among them was Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., who joined the cause on Twitter. ""By 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency levels,"" she tweeted. It’s an eye-opening statistic, and one that spoke to Obama’s new effort. But is it accurate? The Nation’s Report Card When we contacted Slaughter’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a White House fact sheet with an almost identical claim: ""Large disparities remain in reading proficiency, with 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys reading below proficiency levels by the fourth grade – compared to 58 percent of white boys reading below proficiency levels."" In turn, the White House said the numbers came from The Nation’s Report Card, a federal assessment conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Since 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress has tracked student achievement in such subjects as reading, mathematics, science, writing, U.S. history, and by a variety of demographics, including race. Broadly, proficiency is defined by the government as students being ""able to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations."" According to the 2013 report card, there is a significant disparity between white and minority students in math and reading scores at the fourth-grade level. While 46 percent of white students were proficient in reading, just 18 percent of black students and 20 percent of Hispanics meet the same benchmark. For each group, those numbers have risen quite a bit since 1990, when 16 percent of white fourth-graders were reading at a proficient level, compared to just 1 percent of blacks and 5 percent of Hispanics. Gaps in mathematic scores have been similar. Meanwhile, Asian/Pacific Islanders outpace all races and ethnicities in both reading and math in the fourth grade. It’s also worth noting that there’s no improvement in proficiency levels by the time students finish the eighth grade. Similar numbers of students start behind and stay behind. But Slaughter’s tweet specified black boys in particular. To get those statistics, we had to dive deeper into the report. Using the government’s data, we found that 14 percent of black boys and 18 percent of Hispanic boys read at a proficient level in the fourth grade. This means that 86 percent of black boys and 82 percent of Hispanic boys were not proficient. So Slaughter’s numbers are right on. By contrast, about 58 percent of white boys are considered proficient. And what about girls? They perform slightly better across all races than boys. Our ruling Slaughter said that ""by 4th grade, 86 percent of African-American boys and 82 percent (of) Hispanic boys are reading below proficiency level."" Government data backs up that depressing statistic, though it’s worth noting that the U.S. has at least seen improvements across all races since the early 1990s.

The comment is typical in committee meetings when a group indicates its position but does not wish to take the time to address the full committee. (If the first video link doesn't work, try this one).A corresponding action packet from the meeting also lists Golden as a ""proponent"" of the bill.It should be noted that the bill that the governor ultimately vetoed was almost exactly the one that appeared at that March 25 committee meeting. The only change, the Sun-Sentinel reported, was an amendment by Sen. Evelyn Lynn to allow principals to take into account advanced degrees in their performance reviews.On the governor's Web site, Golden is listed as a policy chief in the Education Policy Unit of the Governor's Office of Policy and Budget. Golden also is a registered lobbyist for the governor's office. Previously she worked as a lobbyist for Mixon and Associates, a Tallahassee lobbying group that lists nine school districts among its clients.We tried to call Golden to ask who asked her to attend the hearings on SB 6 and its companion bill, HB 7189, and why she indicated support of the bills. But Golden's office referred our inquiries to the governor's press office. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey said Golden supported the teacher tenure bill under orders from Kathy Mears – the governor’s director of legislative affairs – and Ken Granger, policy director of the Governor’s Office of Policy and Budget. “I think at the end of March, conceptually the Executive Office of the Governor was in support of the direction of the bill,” Ivey said, noting that Golden works for Crist's top education policy adviser Scott Kittel. Crist, however, told a group of reporters on April 14, 2010, that he didn't know Golden (""I don't even know who that person is -- though I'm sure they're a great person"") or why she indicated that she supported the bill on Crist's behalf. ""I'm me and they're them,"" Crist told the reporters in an exchange that was caught on video. ""What I've learned ... is that a lot of times people will say that the governor's office feels this way and the governor's office feels that way, and regrettably from time to time, rare though that may be, they may not have actually talked to the governor.""That may be true, but the one ultimately responsible for the actions of Crist's administration is Crist.A Crist education policy staffer went to a House committee hearing on March 25 and indicated the governor's support for a controversial teacher pay plan. Three weeks later, Crist vetoed essentially the same bill. We rate Hasner's statement True. Story has been updated with comments from Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979EBE80>],/factchecks/2010/apr/15/adam-hasner/charlie-crist-SB6-adam-hasner/
"['National', 'History', 'Taxes', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich says that only millionaires paid first U.S. income tax
","On April 8, 2010 -- one week before tax-filing day -- former House speaker (and possible 2012 presidential candidate) Newt Gingrich made a comment about the history of U.S. taxes that caught our eye. In a question-and-answer period following a speech to the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, the Georgia Republican said that when the United States ""first created the federal income tax, frankly, nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything."" The first federal income tax was imposed during the Civil War, but it was scrapped in 1872 and not revived until 1913, after ratification of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution. Gingrich's camp didn't respond to an inquiry, so we weren't able to ask which tax he meant. But we'll analyze his comment based on the 1913 tax. Several experts we spoke to agreed that income and tax data from the 1860s ranges from unreliable to nonexistent, and wouldn't be comparable to current statistics. In addition, the 1913 tax is the direct predecessor of the current tax system. (The first tax form in 1913 was even called the 1040.) The 1913 federal income tax had seven tax brackets, according to the Tax Foundation. Taxpayers (either individual or joint filers) who had taxable income from zero to $20,000 were taxed at a rate of 1 percent. Those between $20,000 and $50,000 were taxed at 2 percent; between $50,000 and $75,000, 3 percent; $75,000 and $100,000, 4 percent; $100,000 to $250,000, 5 percent; $250,000 to $500,000, 6 percent; and higher than $500,000, 7 percent. Right off the bat, this would seem to make Gingrich's statement incorrect, since anyone earning even one dollar in income would, by the book, be subject to the income tax. But it's actually a bit more complicated. For one thing, that line of thinking ignores exemptions. Individuals and joint filers in 1913, just like taxpayers today, could exempt a portion of their income from the federal tax. According to the 1913 tax form, individuals could exempt their first $3,000, while joint filers could exempt their first $4,000. So that set a floor for who was on the hook for taxes in 1913. As for what constitutes a ""millionaire,"" Gingrich didn't specify, but we think he meant millionaires in 2010 dollars. (It makes for a more favorable calculation for him.) According to an online Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, the 1913 equivalent of $1 million in today's money was $45,677. So, joint filers earning between $4,000 and $45,677 were liable for the federal income tax -- at either the 1 percent or 2 percent level -- but were less affluent than a ""millionaire"" in today's dollars, which was Gingrich's cutoff point. The fact that these Americans paid taxes make Gingrich's comment wrong on its face. Still, his general point might not be too misleading if an extremely small number of people fell into that income range. It's possible to estimate how many taxpayers would have fallen into that income category by looking at a well-known academic study of U.S. income distribution published in 2004 by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. The authors provide tables that examine the top end of the income distribution. (For clarity's sake, we'll list the 1913 dollar figures that we reverse-engineered from the Piketty and Saez tables, which are denominated in 2000 dollars.) Looking at their tables, we see that an income of $45,677 (remember, that's enough to qualify as a 1913 ""millionaire"") would have placed a taxpayer in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of American incomes. Meanwhile, the tables indicate that the top 1 percent of incomes began at $10,466. Their tables don't provide a figure for the top 10 percent, but working backward from the levels they do list beginning in 1917, it seems reasonable to assume that an income of roughly $2,284 would have landed a taxpayer in the top 10 percent of income. Using a back-of-the-envelope estimate, then, a couple with $4,000 income in 1913 probably would have ranked in the best-compensated 4 to 6 percent of Americans. So that means that perhaps 5 percent of Americans weren't millionaires, and yet were subject to the federal income tax. That's equivalent to several million households among the 97 million people estimated by the Census to be living in the U.S. in 1913. That number could drop a bit once other deductions are factored in, such as interest paid on loans. But the number is probably pretty close to that. Where does this leave us? Gingrich has a point that lots of taxpayers were indeed fully exempt from federal taxation in 1913. The exemption levels were equal to nearly $66,000 and $88,000, respectively, in today's dollars -- incomes that today would place one comfortably into the middle class. But to us, it's not enough to make up for his ignoring several million Americans when he claimed that ""nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything"" in federal income taxes. Someone who earns $88,000 is far from a millionaire. So we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DAB5C0>],/factchecks/2010/apr/15/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-only-millionaires-paid-first-us-inco/

Toobin says a Supreme Court nominee has never been filibustered successfully
","The announcement by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens that he plans to retire later this year has raised the curtain on a new confirmation battle -- and with it the possibility of a Republican filibuster of President Barack Obama's nominee to succeed the long-serving justice. In public comments, key Republican senators have been carefully noncommittal about how far they'll go. Against this backdrop, legal affairs analyst Jeffrey Toobin told Stephen Colbert on the April 12, 2010, edition of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report that ""a filibuster has never really been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice.""We decided to check the history books to see if that was true. There's little question that filibusters against a Supreme Court nomination are unusual. But we did find one example that would seem to fit Toobin's description: President Lyndon B. Johnson's attempt to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice in 1968. In June 1968 -- just five months before the election to succeed Johnson -- then-Chief Justice Earl Warren told the president that he planned to retire soon. Fearing a victory by Republican Richard Nixon in the November election, Johnson, a Democrat, acted quickly to nominate a successor to the liberal chief justice. The president chose Fortas, a longtime friend. Many members of the Republican minority, joined by some conservative Southern Democrats, mobilized against the Fortas nomination for a variety of reasons, including his liberal record, his ""crony""-like ties to Johnson, and the hope that Nixon would win and appoint someone else.Initially, it looked like Fortas' nomination would squeak by the Senate. But he hemorrhaged support after revelations that he'd attended White House staff meetings as a sitting justice, informed the president about secret Supreme Court deliberations and been paid for a series of lectures at American University by a collection of private-sector interests whose business could come before the court. When Fortas' nomination went to the floor on Sept. 24, it wasn't clear whether he had the votes to be confirmed. Some news accounts at the time described the opposition as a filibuster. For a 2005 Washington Post article that looked back on the confirmation battle, congressional reporter Charles Babington tracked down some of the original coverage and found a page-one story in the Post that declared, ""Fortas Debate Opens with a Filibuster."" It went on to describe the day's actions as a ""full-dress Republican-led filibuster."" Meanwhile, the New York Times said that Fortas' opponents ""began a historic filibuster today.""Under Senate rules at the time, breaking through a filibuster and proceeding to an up-or-down vote -- a process called securing cloture -- required the votes of 67 senators, assuming that all 100 senators were present and voting. (That number was later reduced to 60, where it stands today.) On Oct. 1, following four days of debate, the Senate held a cloture vote. The final tally was 45 senators in favor of cloture and 43 against -- well short of the 59 required to proceed to a final vote, given that only 88 senators were present and voting. Seeing the writing on the wall, Johnson -- a master of Senate strategy from his tenure as majority leader -- withdrew Fortas' nomination for chief justice.Sure sounds like a filibuster, right? Yes, but there are some nuances. During a partisan conflict in the mid 2000s about judicial filibusters, Republicans argued that the Fortas case -- then being used as a frequent Democratic talking point -- wasn't really a filibuster after all.C. Boyden Gray, former chief counsel to President George H.W. Bush, wrote in a 2003 op-ed that ""four days of debate on a nomination for chief justice is hardly a filibuster."" He cited the closing floor speech of none other than Sen. Robert Griffin, R-Mich., the leader of the fight against Fortas. Griffin asked, ""When is a filibuster, Mr. President? ... There have been no dilatory quorum calls or other dilatory tactics employed. The speakers who have taken the floor have addressed themselves to the subject before the Senate, and a most interesting and useful discussion has been recorded in the Congressional Record."" Griffin reportedly wrote a letter in 2003 reiterating his belief that he and his allies had not engaged in a filibuster. A 2002 report by the Congressional Research Service -- the authoritative, nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- provides a bit of support for this argument, noting that the mere fact that a cloture vote has been taken does not necessarily prove that an actual filibuster was under way.""Supporters of a nomination may move for cloture, in order to speed action, even when opponents may not consider themselves to be conducting a filibuster against it, or when they may have only threatened, but not actually conducted, a filibuster,"" the report says. ""Since filibusters may be conducted through a variety of tactics, there are no specific actions that definitively indicate the occurrence of a filibuster, much less of a mere threat to filibuster."" That said, CRS didn't say it wasn't a filibuster, either. And many scholars agree with the press coverage at the time that Fortas' opponents did, at the very least, threaten a filibuster, and quite likely undertook one outright. ""It was understood as a filibuster at the time,"" Laura Kalman, a professor of history at the University of California at Santa Barbara and author of Abe Fortas: A Biography, told MSNBC in 2005, adding that ""both Abe Fortas and LBJ are spinning in their graves at the notion there was no filibuster."" Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a 2004 column that saying the opposition didn't really filibuster ""is like arguing, 'Yes, I shot him, but I can’t be charged with murder because he would have died of cancer anyhow.'"" In an interview for this article, Ornstein acknowledged that the peculiarities of the Fortas episode do suggest that it merits ""an asterisk,"" but he added that he still believes it's accurate to call it ""a successful filibuster.""The official guardians of Senate history don't mince words. The Senate Historical Office's Web site headlines its recap of the nomination fight, ""Filibuster Derails Supreme Court Appointment."" In an interview, Senate historian Donald Ritchie said that the term ""filibuster is a matter of definition, and Boyden Gray, as an attorney, was defining it to suit the purposes of his client. Historians and political scientists would define it differently."" Let's return to Toobin's statement. We'll acknowledge that there's some debate about whether Fortas' opponents in 1968 officially launched a filibuster. But as CRS points out, there's no magic test to determine whether a filibuster has actually occurred. Meanwhile, news accounts from the time describe it as a filibuster, and a variety of scholars agree that Fortas' opponents at the very least used the implied threat of a filibuster as leverage. So we rate Toobin's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A3640>],/factchecks/2010/apr/14/jeffrey-toobin/toobin-says-supreme-court-nominee-has-never-been-f/

Wikileaks founder Julian Assange tells Colbert permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used
","In an April 12, 2010, interview on The Colbert Report, one of the WikiLeaks founders was pressed to explain why ""Collateral Murder"" was an accurate title for a leaked military video of a 3-year-old deadly encounter between a U.S. Apache helicopter gun crew and a cluster of men on a Baghdad street corner, two of whom were journalists for Reuters.Host Stephen Colbert called the title ""emotional manipulation."" He noted that while soldiers in the Apache did mistake cameras with long telephoto lenses slung over the shoulders of the two journalists for weapons, there were, in fact, two other men in the group with weapons.""How can you call it 'Collateral Murder?' "" Colbert asked guest Julian Assange of Wikileaks, referring to the controversial and widely-viewed video.""So it appears there are possibly two men, one carrying an AK-47 and one carrying a rocket-propelled grenade -- although we're not 100 percent sure of that -- in the crowd,"" Assange answered. ""However, the permission to engage was given before the word RPG was ever used and before the Reuters cameraman, Namir Noor-Eldeen, ever pulled up his camera and went around the corner.""Assange is referring to a moment in the video when a Reuters cameraman peers from behind a wall, pointing a long telephoto lens. A soldier on the Apache yells ""He's got an RPG!"" According to a military investigation several days later, there were U.S. ground troops less than 100 meters away, and ""due to the furtive nature of his movements, the cameraman gave every appearance of preparing to fire an RPG on U.S. soldiers.""It's true that that's the first time the word ""RPG"" is uttered by the Apache crew in the unedited 40-minute version of the video. And it's also true that the permission to engage was given prior to that.But that doesn't mean the group of men on the street was believed to be unarmed prior to that, or that U.S. troops were given permission to shoot at a group of what they believed to be unarmed men.Let's walk through some of the early minutes of the the video, and accompanying audio, that comes via an Apache gun camera, to check Assange's claim.When the soldiers spot the group, the gun camera zeroes in on Noor-Eldeen, with the camera slung over his right shoulder. ""There's one, yeah,"" says one of the crew members on the Apache.""Oh yeah,"" says another. ""That's a weapon,"" the soldier says.""Yeah.""Behind Noor-Eldeen is the other Reuters journalist, also with a camera.But then the cross-hairs in the camera pan to a couple of the other men farther back in the group.""Yep, he's got a weapon too,"" the soldier says.The soldier radios back, ""Have 5 to 6 individuals with AK-47s. Request permission to engage.""""Roger that...You are free to engage. Over.""At that point, however, the helicopter has apparently circled around, and the group is no longer visible behind a wall. That's when we see the crouching journalist peek around the corner, pointing the camera.""He's got an RPG!"" a soldier in the Apache yells. Moments later, the Apache circles back around the building, getting the men in full view, and the shooting begins.An investigative report prepared by the military includes several still photos taken from the gun camera video. One shows the two journalists with the cameras, and the report concludes they ""could easily be mistaken for slung AK-47 or AKM rifles, especially since neither cameraman is wearing anything that identifies him as media or press."" In addition, the report includes a still photo of the men a little father back, the ones who appeared to have prompted the comments ""Yep, he's got a weapon, too."" Entered as Exhibit B, the investigator placed red circles around what he concluded was two men ""openly displaying an RPG and an AKM, while a third individual carries what appears to be an RPG round.""Assange agreed on The Colbert Report that it appears one of the men was carrying an RPG launcher, and another an AK-47, but that the video is not entirely conclusive. The military investigative report states that ground troops later discovered two RPGs, an RPG launcher and a rifle where the group had been clustered, and an RPG round under one of the bodies. In an interview with PolitiFact, Assange correctly pointed out that military investigators state definitively that the Apache soldiers had identified men with weapons, ""AK-47s and a RPG,"" though the crew had not actually said the word RPG prior to asking for permission to engage. The report states that men on the street were observed with ""weapons consistent with reports of hostile acts conducted against friendly forces"" and that they had ""satisfied all requirements to initiate an engagement."" The report also mentions that the man peering around the side of the building (with what turned out to be a camera) appeared to be a sign of ""hostile intent."" Again, that happened after permission to engage had already been granted. Assange called that ""retrospective justification."" When Assange points out in the context of justifying the title ""Collateral Murder"" that the word ""RPG"" was not used until after the permission to engage was given, he leaves the impression that the soldiers were given the okay to open fire on a group of unarmed men, or men believed to be unarmed. But the video and accompanying audio make clear that the soldiers in the helicopter said they spotted ""weapons"" among those in the group -- later identified by an army investigator as an AK-47 and an RPG -- and that they mistook two cameras with telephoto lenses as weapons as well. Assange said he does not accept that his comment makes that implication, that introductory text in the video clearly states, ""Although some of the men appear to have been armed, the behavior of nearly everyone was relaxed."" Who can say whether those in the Apache meant RPG when the crosshairs turned to two of the other men in the group -- not journalists -- and they said ""he's got a weapon, too."" Photographs suggest that it probably was a man with an RPG, and another with an AK-47 rifle. Still, the soldiers in the Apache reported, ""Five to six individuals with AK-47s."" That's what the permission to engage appears to have been based upon. RPG's were not specifically referred to by that point, but other ""weapons"" were. And so while Assange's statement is technically accurate, we think it leaves out critical context. And we rule it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D96F00>],/factchecks/2010/apr/14/julian-assange/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-tells-colbert-per/

Colbert claims Justice John Paul Stevens is the last Protestant on the Supreme Court
","And then there were none.On the April 12, 2010, episode of The Colbert Report, host Stephen Colbert pointed out that ""the departure of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens will leave an unsual void.""""Stevens is the last Protestant,"" Colbert said to his guest, legal expert Jeffrey Toobin. ""When he's gone, who will speak for the people in Bermuda shorts?"" In fact, much has been made of Stevens' religion since he announced his retirement on April 9. Once he steps down -- and unless President Barack Obama appoints another Protestant to take his place -- there will be no more Protestants on the bench. Justice David Souter, who left the court in 2009, is Episcopalian, a religion that combines both Protestant and Catholic traditions. He was replaced by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Catholic. In addition to Sotomayor, five of the justices are Catholic, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsberg are Jewish. So, why all this discussion of Stevens' religious affiliation? If anything, it says a lot about how the demographics of the court have changed over the years. Historically speaking, the religious affiliations of the current court are quite unusual, according to a report and study done by NPR's Nina Totenberg. For decades, the court was majority Protestant, she reports. It was Catholics and Jews who were the anomaly. That shift is even more pronounced when you look at the nation's religious affiliations. According to the CIA World Factbook, a little more 50 percent of Americans identify as Protestant. Catholics make up about 24 percent of the population, while Jews represent about 1.7 percent of the population. So, back to Colbert's claim.

Rep. Ken Legler said cell phone numbers will be released to telemarketing companies
","
Fact or fiction: Your cell phone number will soon be released to telemarketing companies and — the kicker — your provider also will charge you for incoming sales calls. 
That's what state Rep. Ken Legler, R-Pasadena, said this week via his Twitter account. His Monday warning: ""Cell phone numbers go public this month."" 
His message linked to a note published on his Facebook page the same day: 
""REMINDER..... all cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketing companies and you will start to receive sales calls. YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE CALLS."" 
To prevent this, Legler instructed, people should call ""888-382-1222, the number for the National DO NOT CALL list... It blocks your number for five (5) years. You must call from the cell phone number you want to have blocked. You cannot call from a different phone number. HELP OTHERS BY PASSING THIS ON."" 
That breathless alert caught our eye. Yet by the time we looked into Legler's Facebook post, it'd been yanked. Legler told us Tuesday that his campaign ""fell victim to urban legend and we put it out there and I take full responsibility... we shouldn't have put it out there."" 
After our inquiry, Legler posted a retraction on his Facebook explaining that a volunteer campaign staff member had received the e-mail warning from ""what we considered a reliable source"" and ""felt it was important to keep the public up to date."" 
Legler explained to us that his aides will post notes like press releases from state agencies on his Facebook and Twitter account while he is responsible for the personal messages on both sites. 
Brad Tegeler, Legler's chief of staff, said he recognized the e-mail as one that had landed in his inbox in the past, and checked to see it if it was true. When he realized it wasn't, Legler's office pulled the Facebook note down ""not more than half a day"" later. 
Meanwhile, Legler's Twitter message remained online for the more than 3,000 people who follow his feed to see as we finished this article. (Nearly 1,100 friends could have seen his Facebook post.) 
Next, we called the National Do Not Call Registry listed in Legler's note to to check on what happens when individuals phone in. A recording by the Federal Trade Commission, which operates the registry, tells callers that anyone can register their home or cell phone number to permanently stop receiving telemarketing calls. It's not just a five-year reprieve, as Legler's note puts it. 
This gaffe isn't new; a Google search for the same text as Legler's Facebook entry shows similar incorrect warnings — apparently linked to rumors about a national cell-phone directory — posted on blogs starting in 2004. 
Mitch Katz, a public affairs specialist at the FTC, said this ""rumor has been going around for five years and there have been attempts to (create a cell phone directory) but they've all fallen apart."" 
If a cell phone directory is ever created, Katz said, it's likely to work differently: People would have to opt in to get their number listed. 
The FTC also has debunked the incorrect message on its Web site, which states: ""You may have received an e-mail telling you that your cell phone is about to be assaulted by telemarketing calls as a result of a new cell phone number database; however, that is not the case. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers. Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers don’t call consumers on their cell phones without their consent.""

National conservative figure says Marco Rubio more experienced than Barack Obama when he ran for president
","Former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio hasn't been elected to the U.S. Senate -- he hasn't even won his Republican primary -- but already his name is being floated as a possible 2012 presidential contender.One of the latest mentions comes from Richard Land, president of The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. The conservative religious group opposed President Barack Obama's health care reforms as well as a recent federal hate crimes bill because the group said it provided ""special federal protections for homosexuals that most others do not have.""In a recent interview with Politico, Land -- unprompted -- brought up Rubio's prospects.""The longer nobody catches fire, the more space there is for Marco,"" Land said of a possible presidential run. ""It wouldn’t be unheard of for a freshman senator from Florida to be the nominee — particularly one who was speaker of the (Florida House of Representatives).""He's got more experience than Obama had,"" Land continued. ""There are a lot of Hispanics in this country who would find someone with Marco’s ethnic background very appealing. Although I like Sarah (Palin), I think Sarah’s got a lot more impediments to a nomination than Marco Rubio does.""Rubio has tried to dismiss the Internet buzz of a possible run.But that doesn't mean PolitiFact Florida can't dream. Which begs a real question: If the fresh-faced Rubio did run in 2012, would he have more experience than Obama did when he was elected in 2008?To begin to answer that question, we have to first presuppose Rubio 1.) gets elected in November 2010 to the U.S. Senate and 2.) decides to run for president in 2012.If that happens, Rubio will have two years in the Senate plus nearly 11 previous years of political experience -- a little less than two years as a part-time West Miami city commissioner (April 1998-January 2000), and almost nine years in the Florida House of Representatives. (He was elected in a special election in early 2000 and served through 2008.) While in the House, Rubio served in the Republican leadership as whip, majority leader and eventually speaker. A position in the state House is considered part time.All together that adds up to 13 years of political experience.Before that, Rubio's work experiences are thin.According to his official biography, Rubio attended South Miami Senior High School and graduated in 1989. He went to three colleges, eventually graduating from the University of Florida in 1993 with a bachelor of science, and then from law school at the University of Miami in 1996.He then began to work for the private Miami law firm Tew Cardenas. He has worked as a lawyer with private firms on and off ever since. In 2008 and 2009, Rubio co-instructed a class on Florida politics at Florida International University.Contrast that with Obama.During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact extensively researched Obama's work and political experiences.Obama had 12 years of political experience prior to being elected president -- nearly four years in the U.S. Senate (2005-2008) and eight years in the Illinois state Senate (1997-2004). Like Florida, Illinois' Legislature is considered part time work. That's in addition to his work before being elected to the state Senate. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama worked for a year as a financial analyst, then three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. He graduated from law school in 1991, then ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992. After that, he accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993 and was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school while in the Illinois Senate. PolitiFact determined that Obama had at least 20 years of work and political experience. By the same calculation, Rubio would have 16 years of work and political experience if he was elected president in 2012.Rubio would have one more year as a public official, but less work experience overall.And all experience is not equal.Obama, when elected president, had four years in the U.S. Senate. Rubio would just have two. That's a significant difference. Consider this: Of the 16 U.S. senators to have been elected president, all served at least four years in the Senate, and most served at least one full term. President Richard Nixon served only four years in the Senate, but he was vice president for two terms. President William Henry Harrison left the Senate after a truncated term (he was appointed minister plenipotentiary of Columbia) but had been a war hero from the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 and previously had served in the U.S. House of Representatives.Then there's Rubio's time in West Miami (pop. 5,533). While constructive, being a city commissioner in a small town certainly doesn't have the complexities of state or federal government.That said, Obama and Rubio's state experiences certainly are comparable -- Rubio served almost nine years in Florida's state House, including two years as House speaker, to Obama's eight in Illinois' state Senate. If elected in 2012, Rubio would be the country's youngest-ever president at age 41.In making a hypothetical argument that Rubio could be elected president in 2012, Land said that Rubio -- while young -- would have more experience than Obama when he was elected in 2008 at age 47. Rubio spent slightly more time in state government than Obama and had a more prominent role, so by that measure he has more experience than Obama did. But if you look at time in the U.S. Senate (Obama's four years to what would be Rubio's two) and overall work and political experience (Obama's 20 years to Rubio's 16), Obama outmatches Rubio. And Obama has worked in a variety of roles, while Rubio has only been a lawyer.As such, we rate Land's statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972C1A40>],/factchecks/2010/apr/14/richard-land/rubio-president-obama-experience/

Charlie Crist tries to link Marco Rubio with indicted ex-state Rep. Ray Sansom in new TV ad
","Gov. Charlie Crist, facing an exceedingly difficult Republican U.S. Senate primary, has launched a second blistering television attack against former House Speaker Marco Rubio.In his first ad, Crist portrayed Rubio as a greedy politician who helped fund his personal lifestyle with Republican Party donations. (You can see our analysis of one of the ad's claims here.)Crist's new ad, which the campaign released April 12, 2010, seeks to link Rubio with indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom.""Both steered millions of taxpayer money into two colleges,"" a female narrator says, followed by a male voice that adds, ""Then, received cushy jobs from the colleges.""The ad then flashes to a booking mug shot of Sansom and a picture of Rubio. Under Sansom's picture is the word ""indicted."" Under Rubio's picture is the word ""subpoenaed.""This item will explore whether Rubio was indeed ""subpoenaed,"" and examine links between Sansom and Rubio.First, about Sansom.Sansom was Rubio's budget chief in 2007 and 2008 and succeeded Rubio as speaker in November 2008. On the day Sansom took over from Rubio, he also took a $110,000 job at Northwest Florida State College in the Florida Panhandle. A subsequent St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald investigation showed how Sansom had steered $35 million to the school. Included was $6 million for an airport building that one of Sansom's friends wanted to use for his corporate jet business. The airport building deal led a grand jury to indict Sansom. That case is ongoing. The Florida House also sought to investigate the deal, but Sansom abruptly resigned before a scheduled ethics trial was to start.What links Rubio to all this?Nothing, really, has been established.Yes, Sansom was Rubio's budget chief and the two were close, but Rubio contends that he knew nothing about the $6 million for the airport, saying the project was directed ""solely"" by Sansom, and that the specific language of the budget request was misleading.Ironically, it's the same answer offered by Crist -- who could've vetoed the project, but didn't.The 35-second TV ad builds its case by first linking Rubio and Sansom as close colleagues in the Florida House (they were). Next the ad says both Rubio and Sansom helped colleges get money from the Legislature and then took jobs from those institutions (We already discussed Sansom; Rubio did help Florida International University get $21 million for a hurricane center and medical school, records kept by the governor's office show, and then took a $69,000 part-time teaching job with FIU after leaving office).The next frames of the ad are where the paths diverge. But you wouldn't know it by watching.Sansom was indicted for his part in the airport hangar deal. And Rubio was subpoenaed, as the ad says, but not as part of his dealings with FIU.The subpoena was part of Sansom's House ethics trial in February 2010. Sansom's attorney Gloria Fletcher included Rubio among 35 potential witnesses that included current and former state legislators. (See the list here). The subpoena was formally issued Feb. 12, 2010. (See it here). We should note that Rubio never received the subpoena, his campaign says. And a subpoena doesn't suggest in any way Rubio did something wrong. Sansom, meanwhile, resigned on Feb. 21, 2010, the day before the ethics trial was to start. The House canceled the trial as a result, and Rubio never testified. To recap, while the ad tries to draw similarities between Sansom's history and Rubio's, Rubio has not been accused of wrongdoing in his association with Florida International University. In fact, Rubio took his job with FIU only as he was leaving the state House -- when his power was fading -- while Sansom took his higher-paying job as he was becoming one of the state's most powerful legislators. The differences are stark enough that overall impression caused by the ad can be quite misleading.  The ad rightly says that Rubio was subpoenaed, but the overall connection between Rubio and Sansom is flimsy at best. First, a subpoena was issued, but apparently never delivered. Additionally, a subpoena isn't an indication Rubio did something wrong. It just means he could have been called to testify. As such we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967771C0>],/factchecks/2010/apr/13/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-marco-rubio-ray-sansom/
"['Ethics', 'Texas', 'Lone Star Project']","
The Lone Star Project says that U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions held two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs
","
Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been getting flak after the RNC reimbursed a staffer some $2,000 spent at a risque club in Los Angeles. 
So why, asks the Democrat-backing Lone Star Project, is U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions of Dallas, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, off the hook for ""his fundraising at Las Vegas strip clubs?"" 
The Lone Star Project is steered by Matt Angle, director of the Texas Democratic Trust and former aide to then-U.S. Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, whom Sessions beat in 2004. On its Web site, the group says it's an arm of the Lone Star Fund political action committee, offering ""political and legislative analysis to help individuals, organizations and the press see beyond the rhetoric and misinformation typically provided by the current Republican state leadership in Texas and Texas Republicans in Washington."" 
""Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies,"" according to an April 8 press release from the group. 
In the wake of the RNC's recent brouhaha, we wondered if Angle & Company bared the truth about Sessions' events. 
As back-up to his claim, Angle pointed us to a video attached to the press release. The video, made and uploaded to YouTube this month by the Lone Star Project, shows scenes from Forty Deuce, a Las Vegas club where Sessions has previously confirmed he held an event in 2007 to raise money for his political committee, Pete PAC, which gives money to Republican political candidates. The PAC spent more than $5,000 to rent the club for the occasion, according to federal finance disclosures. 
Included with the video: A sound clip from the American Public Media radio show Marketplace. On the clip, Sessions says: ""We do a Las Vegas fundraiser every year, and uh, not only raise money, but see Las Vegas. It's a beautiful town."" 
Marketplace reporter Steve Henn replies: ""Forty Deuce is a strip club."" 
According to the clip, Sessions says: ""You know, I've never seen that. It is what I would call a burlesque show, where there's a woman who comes out and has a dress on... uh, she never gets naked. There's no nudity, there's no nudity in there."" 
According to an undated promotional advertisement for Forty Deuce, the club calls itself a ""World-Famous Burlesque,"" with ""striptease that is very empowering to women"" and ""appeals to both sexes."" The original Forty Deuce opened in Los Angeles in 2002 and closed in 2008. The Las Vegas Forty Deuce venue in the Mandalay Bay casino was open from 2004 to 2007. Since 2008, the Forty Deuce show has played Friday nights at its new Hollywood venue. 
Lana Gates, events director for Forty Deuce and other Kane ventures, told us ""there is no nudity in the show — it's a mix of sexiness and whimsy, pleasing to both genders."" 
In the Marketplace segment, Kane offered this distinction about his burlesque shows: ""The key component would be to have girls who were dancers taking their clothes off, not just girls taking their clothes off."" 
Promotional video of Forty Deuce's scantily-clad dancers crawling across the floor and grinding on musicians indicated the show is adult-oriented, as the Lone Star Project says. Published reports reinforce that conclusion. In 2002, The New York Times wrote of the Forty Deuce in Los Angeles: ""The dancer, Carolina Cerisola, gyrated and fox-trotted while peeling off her gown, a pair of long violet gloves and a pink bra. When she kicked off a pair of spangled black panties, they grazed the back of the bartender's head."" And writing in The New York Times' travel section, Frommer's Travel Guides describes the Las Vegas joint as ""the first establishment to cash in on the return of the high-class hoochie girl."" Zagat, on its Web site, calls it ""good for a bachelor party."" 
Unnoted by the Lone Star Project: Sessions raised money for his leadership PAC, People for Enterprise, Trade and Economic Growth (PETE), at the Forty Deuce club before he was elected by House Republicans in November 2008 to lead the NRCC. So, unlike GOP chairman Steele, he did not yet hold a national party post. 
The second fundraiser cited by the Lone Star Project, also for Sessions' PAC, took place at Tao Las Vegas in February 2009. The Tao complex includes an Asian-cuisine restaurant, topless pool and nightclub (the club promises ""a happy ending"" on its Vegas billboards). 
The Washington Post reported that unnamed Republicans had said the 2009 fundraiser was held at Tao's restaurant, which, according to Restaurants & Institutions magazine, ranked as the highest-grossing independent restaurant in the United States — a title it still claims today. According to federal financial disclosures, Sessions' PAC spent about $4,390 on food and beverages at the restaurant. 
What we found: The restaurant is two floors down from Tao's nightclub, which has nearly nude dancers that restaurant patrons 21 and older can go upstairs to see. Pennapa Chutima, a hostess at the restaurant, said it's not adult-themed. She said: ""It's a peaceful calm environment. Families are more than welcome. We are stroller-friendly."" 
The city of Las Vegas classifies local clubs as topless clubs with liquor, adult night club establishments or as nightclubs. Tao's club — which doesn't have burlesque or striptease — is listed among nightclubs. 
Finally, we didn't find record of Sessions airing fundraising regrets. Neither Sessions nor his aides agreed to our requests for on-the-record interviews. 
The naked truth? 
All indications are that Sessions held one fundraiser in an adult-themed venue and another in a restaurant that's separated from its nightclub featuring nearly nude dancers. 
We rate the Lone Star Project's statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C15EA00>],/factchecks/2010/apr/13/lone-star-project/lone-star-project-says-us-rep-pete-sessions-held-t/
"['National', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton doesn't answer hypothetical questions? Sometimes
","Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to answer a ""what if?"" question on ABC News' This Week, saying she didn't like those kinds of questions. Here's the exchange with interviewer Jake Tapper:Tapper: ""President Obama officials say he's contemplating presenting a peace plan to help jump start the process between the Israelis and the Palestinians. What advice do you give President Obama when it comes to whether or not he should offer a peace plan?""Clinton: ""Well, I never share advice that I give directly to any president."" Tapper: ""Well then, hypothetically?"" Clinton: ""Well -- and I don't answer hypotheticals. But I will say this. That this administration from the very first day has made it clear we are committed to pursuing a path of peace in the Middle East. And to get the two parties to get to a point where they can engage in negotiations again to deal with these very difficult final status issues.""We zeroed in Clinton's claim that she doesn't answer ""hypotheticals."" Politicians often say that, but they'll answer them when it's in their political interest. Such is the case with Clinton.  Indeed, we found several instances of Clinton batting away hypothetical questions, just as she did with Tapper: • In an interview with the BBC last October, when asked about sanctions for Iran if it acquires a nuclear weapon, she said, ""I don't want to get ahead of myself and I don't want to answer a hypothetical. I think it's important that we stay together, we keep moving together, and we stay committed to the same goal, which is to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons pile."" • During a CNN interview a few weeks later on the same topic, she answered, ""Well, I don't want to speculate or answer a hypothetical. I want this process to play out."" • In June 2007, Wolf Blitzer asked Clinton about using military force to stop genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan. ""Well, but, we're not going to engage in these hypotheticals,"" she said. ""I mean, one of the jobs of a president is being very reasoned in approaching these issues, and I don't think it's useful to be talking in these kind of abstract, hypothetical terms."" • She protested hypotheticals again in a debate moderated by Tim Russert in February 2008, when Russert asked, if ""al-Qaida resurges and Iraq goes to hell, do you hold the right, in your mind as American president, to re-invade, to go back into Iraq to stabilize it?"" Clinton answered, ""You know, Tim, you ask a lot of hypotheticals,"" before answering broadly, ""You have to look at the entire situation to try to figure out how we can stabilize Afghanistan and begin to put more in there to try to get some kind of success out of it, and you have to work with the Iraqi government so that they take responsibility for their own future."" But every so often, Clinton will answer hypotheticals. We found a few examples in the presidential campaign where her answer allowed her to distinguish herself from then-Sen. Barack Obama, to emphasize her hard-line approach on foreign affairs. During an April 2008 debate, she answered a question about what U.S. policy should be if Iran were to attack Israel. ""Of course I would make it clear to the Iranians that an attack on Israel would incur massive retaliation from the United States, but I would do the same with other countries in the region,"" she said. A week later, in an interview with Keith Olbermann, she was asked what would constitute ""massive retaliation."" She didn't specifically answer his question, she didn't protest that it was hypothetical, either. Perhaps the most significant example we found was when Brian Williams asked candidates a stark hypothetical about terrorist attacks on the American homeland. He started with Obama.""Senator Obama, if, God forbid a thousand times, while we were gathered here tonight, we learned that two American cities had been hit simultaneously by terrorists, and we further learned beyond the shadow of a doubt it had been the work of al-Qaida, how would you change the U.S. military stance overseas as a result?"" Williams asked.Obama talked about managing an effective emergency response and making sure the United States had high-quality intelligence on who had attacked. Clinton didn't quibble about the hypothetical in this case and emphasized she would make a strong and swift response.""Well, again, having been a senator during 9/11, I understand very well the extraordinary horror of that kind of an attack and the impact that it has far beyond those who are directly affected,"" she said. ""I think a president must move as swiftly as is prudent to retaliate. If we are attacked and we can determine who was behind that attack, and if there were nations that supported or gave material aid to those who attacked us, I believe we should quickly respond. Now, that doesn't mean we go looking for other fights. You know, I supported President Bush when he went after al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. And then when he decided to divert attention to Iraq, it was not a decision that I would have made had I been president, because we still haven't found bin Laden. So let's focus on those who have attacked us and do everything we can to destroy them.""The next day, the Clinton campaign even promoted her response to the hypothetical, saying Clinton ""was the candidate who demonstrated that she would know how to respond if the country was attacked."" So Clinton has a mixed record on hypothetical questions. She's dodged many, as she did with Tapper, but she's also answered a fair number -- particularly when it suited her political goals. So we rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973BA700>],/factchecks/2010/apr/13/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-doesnt-answer-hypothetical-questio/

Schumer claims no one questioned that Sotomayor was out of the mainstream
","With the announcement that Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is retiring, speculation has turned to whom President Barack Obama will nominate to replace him, and -- depending on the nominee -- how much of a fight Obama will encounter from Senate Republicans. On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he doesn't expect a Republican filibuster. What Republican and Democrats alike want is ""somebody who will follow the law, not make the law,"" Schumer said, and he pointed to the pick of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as evidence that Obama would choose someone ""in the mainstream."" ""If you look at who President Obama has nominated, somebody like Judge Sotomayor, who got nine Republicans to vote for her, no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream,"" Schumer said. ""The other nominees in many of the courts of appeals and district courts, he chooses people in the mainstream. So I don't think there's going to be a filibuster or a blocking."" We are checking the claim that ""no one questioned that she (Sotomayor) was out of the mainstream."" We recalled that phrase came up a lot during the Sotomayor confirmation debate, so we did some checking. To start, we direct your attention to a July 13, 2009, AP story under the headline, ""Sessions: Sonia Sotomayor 'out of mainstream.'"" That's Sessions as in Sen. Jeff Sessions, the leading Judiciary Committee Republican. The AP wrote that just hours before Sotomayor's initial confirmation hearing, Sessions charged that Sotomayor is ""out of the mainstream"" of legal thinking and has a very activist judicial profile. Sessions criticized Sotomayor's much-discussed comment from a speech in 2001, that she hoped a ""wise Latina"" often would reach better conclusions than a white male without the same life experience. ""She has criticized the idea that a woman and a man would reach the same result. She expects them to reach different results. I think that's philosophically incompatible with the American system,"" Sessions said on CBS's Face the Nation. Sessions was among 31 Republican senators who voted against Sotomayor's confirmation, though Sessions said afterward that he was glad that during the hearings Sotomayor rejected the ""empathy standard"" Obama referred to when he nominated her. And Sessions wasn't the only Republican to invoke the ""out of the mainstream"" claim: • In a press release issued Aug. 5, 2009, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., took issue with Sotomayor's ruling in a gun case, saying, it ""shows an alarming hostility to law-abiding gun owners across the country. That is a view that is certainly out of the mainstream in this nation."" • In a press release issued Aug. 6, 2009, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said that at her confirmation hearing Sotomayor attempted to distance herself from several statements ""and explain them away, most likely recognizing that they were controversial and out of the mainstream. However, in my mind, she was not very successful."" • In a statement released on Aug. 4, 2009, Grassley said Sotomayor ""openly questioned whether 'ignoring our differences as women, men, or even people of color...we do a disservice both to the law and society.' This is yet another example of an out of the mainstream judicial philosophy."" • A June 29, 2009, story in Roll Call noted that talking points prepared for House and Senate Republicans urged members to make the case that Sotomayor's written statements, rulings and speeches ""show an out of the mainstream view of the role of a judge."" Perhaps Schumer's comment was one part hyperbole - that what he meant was ""hardly anyone"" claimed Sotomayor was out of the mainstream. But we're sticklers for words, and Schumer's absolute claim that ""no one questioned that she was out of the mainstream"" isn't accurate. We understand that ""out of the mainstream"" is a subjective term, but the fact is that a number of Republican senators used that exact phrase. We rule Schumer's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A44AB00>],/factchecks/2010/apr/13/charles-schumer/schumer-claims-no-one-questioned-sotomayor-was-out/

Gates said leaked military video of shooting in Iraq doesn't show the broader picture of Americans being fired upon
","On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, host Jake Tapper asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the recently released WikiLeaks video showing American soldiers in an Apache helicopter opening fire on a group of men on a Baghdad street, which seriously injured two children and resulted in the deaths of two Reuters journalists who were mistaken for insurgents.""I understand the fog of war,"" Tapper said. ""And I understand that this was a very difficult situation. Does the release of that video, and the fact that that happened damage the image of the U.S. in the world?""""I don't think so,"" Gates said. ""They're in a combat situation. The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops. It's obviously a hard thing to see. It's painful to see, especially when you learn after the fact what was going on. But you -- you talked about the fog of war. These people were operating in split second situations.""""And, you know, we've investigated it very thoroughly. And it's unfortunate. It's clearly not helpful. But by the same token, I think it should not have any lasting consequences.""We are fact-checking the claim that, ""The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops.""According to a military review completed five days after the incident, soldiers in that company ""had been under sporadic small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire since"" the operation -- described as ""clearing their sector and looking for weapons caches"" -- began at dawn that morning.That comports with the detailed reporting from David Finkel, a Washington Post journalist who was embedded for eight months with the battalion in question, and who described the events that day in his book, The Good Soldiers.""All morning long, this part of Al-Amin had been the most hostile,"" Finkel wrote. ""East Al-Amin had been filled with gunfire and some explosions. There had been reports of sniper fire, rooftop chases, and rocket-propelled grenades being fired at Bravo Company, and as the fighting continued, it attracted the attention of Namir Noor-Eldeen, a twenty-two year-old photographer for the Reuters news agency who lived in Baghdad, and Saeed Chmagh, 40, his driver.""In the graphic and controversial video footage shot from an Apache helicopter on the morning of July 12, 2007, and later leaked by whistle-blowers to WikiLeaks -- now viewed by millions --it is clear from the audio that a soldier on the helicopter mistakes a camera with a telephoto lens slung across the shoulder of one of the journalists for a rocket-propelled grenade launcher (RPG).An investigative report by the military issued five days later concluded that among the group of 11 men on the street, two were carrying cameras with large telephoto lenses (""which could be easily mistaken for"" a machine gun) but also that at least one other in the group had a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and another had a rifle.The video at one point shows the Reuters cameraman peering from behind a wall, pointing a long telephoto lens. According to the military investigation, there were U.S. ground troops less than 100 meters away, and ""due to the furtive nature of his movements, the cameraman gave every appearance of preparing to fire an RPG on U.S. soldiers.""The report states that ground troops later discovered two RPGs, an RPG launcher and a rifle where the group had been clustered, and an RPG round under one of the bodies.""There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force,"" Lt. Col. Scott Bleichwehl, a spokesman for the multinational forces in Baghdad, told the New York Times a day after the incident. Glenn Greenwald, an author and blogger for the online magazine Salon who has been highly critical of the military response, said Gates' comment was ""sufficiently vague that it can't be called factually false, but is quite misleading.""None of the people who were shot at by the Apache in that video ever fired on American troops, he said.""It's true that on that day -- and every day -- there were firefights involving American forces, but that had nothing to do with the incident depicted in the video,"" Greenwald said. ""Worse, the part of the video that caused the most controversy -- the shooting of unarmed rescuers who were dragging an unarmed, wounded man to safety -- has absolutely nothing to do with prior firefights. Nothing that happened previously could justify or even mitigate the killing of people who plainly are not a threat and can pose no threat.""The military investigation concluded that the men shot while trying to help one of the wounded journalists into a van were believed at the time to be insurgents. Two children in the van were seriously wounded. ""I think it's fair to say that there have been many, many bad days for Iraqis and Americans, and this was one of them,"" Finkel wrote in an online Q & A about the video on April 6, 2010. By way of context, Finkel noted, ""What's helpful to understand is that, contrary to some interpretations that this was an attack on some people walking down the street on a nice day, the day was anything but that. It happened in the midst of a large operation to clear an area where U.S. soldiers had been getting shot at, injured, and killed with increasing frequency. What the Reuters guys walked into was the very worst part, where the morning had been a series of RPG attacks and running gun battles.""More context,"" Finkel later added. ""You're seeing an edited version of the video. The full video runs much longer. And it doesn't have the benefit of hindsight, in this case zooming in on the van and seeing those two children. The helicopters were perhaps a mile away. And as all of this unfolded, it was unclear to the soldiers involved whether the van was a van of good Samaritans or of insurgents showing up to rescue a wounded comrade. I bring these things up not to excuse the soldiers but to emphasize some of the real-time blurriness of those moments. ""If you were to see the full video, you would see a person carrying an RPG launcher as he walked down the street as part of the group. Another was armed as well, as I recall. Also, if you had the unfortunate luck to be on site afterwards, you would have seen that one of the dead in the group was lying on top of a launcher. Because of that and some other things, EOD -- the Hurt Locker guys, I guess -- had to come in and secure the site. And again, I'm not trying to excuse what happened. But there was more to it for you to consider than what was in the released video.""Asked about Finkel's comments, Greenwald said the only evidence for all of this is the video and the Army's investigative reports.""It's unclear from the video if someone had an RPG -- definitely possible, but far from definitive,"" Greenwald said. ""The Army report claimed that an RGP was found at the scene -- impossible to verify or otherwise know, but that is what it claimed.""Our aim here is not to settle this very complicated, controversial and terribly sad incident. We are not ruling on whether the United States military acted properly. Rather, we are looking specifically at Gates' comment that, ""The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops."" Some might interpret Gates' comment to mean that if only the video had panned back, or started a little earlier, you'd see that this group of men in the street was firing at the Apache helicopter, and there's no evidence that that's the case. But we think Gates' words suggest he was speaking more broadly of the context around that incident, that -- as Finkel noted in providing context during his Q & A -- insurgents had been firing at American soldiers in that immediate area that very morning. And military reports support that. So we rule Gates' comment Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D73640>],/factchecks/2010/apr/12/robert-gates/gates-said-leaked-military-video-shooting-iraq-doe/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Jon Kyl']","
Yuma's daily newspaper quoted Kyl saying Republicans would filibuster
","Update: After publishing this item on April 12, 2010, we received new information, including video of a town hall meeting in Yuma, a comment from Sen. Jon Kyl's staff and more information about the Yuma Sun report. We have updated this item on April 13 to fully reflect the new information. The ruling, however, remains the same -- False. What Sen. Jon Kyl did or didn't say about immigration at a town hall in Yuma, Ariz., was in dispute on ABC News' This Week. Host Jake Tapper asked Kyl, ""You helped lead the cause of immigration reform in 2007. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he is going to bring up immigration reform. You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?"" ""I don't think I said that, Jake, but what I did say is that the conditions for immigration reform no longer exist,"" Kyl said. ""The consensus that existed before does not exist. And among other reasons, because the administration -- this current administration has not done what's necessary to secure the border and enforce the law. We just saw the tragic death of a rancher down on the border, presumably from drug smugglers or illegal immigrants, that simply illustrates once again the fact that we have not controlled the border. And until that's done, I think it's going to be very difficult for Congress to support legislation that would be as comprehensive as that I supported three years ago."" The answer indicates Kyl is not optimistic about immigration reform, but we wanted to find out whether Kyl said Republicans would filibuster or not. Kyl made his remarks at a town hall attended by 350 people in Yuma, Ariz., on April 7, according to a report in the Yuma Sun, a daily newspaper owned by Freedom Communications. The newspaper reported the filibuster remark, though very briefly. Here's what the paper's report said:One man in the audience asked Kyl about the GOP's strategy to curtail the efforts of the Democrat-controlled Congress and executive branch. ""First of all, our strategy on health care included taking as long as we possibly could so the American people could clearly understand (it).. and it took a year for it to get done,"" Kyl said, adding they will do their best to slow up any other bills, like immigration reform, in the same manner. ""My guess is (immigration reform) won't have the votes to pass, but political promises have been made to key constituency of the party that is in power. Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster..."" Kyl's remarks did not go unnoticed. The Wonk Room, a liberal blog run by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, linked to the Sun's report and noted that Kyl's remarks were ""the first time a high-ranking GOP member has threatened to block reform entirely."" Tapper's question -- ""You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?"" -- was a verbatim repeat of the quote the Sun reported. But the Sun's quotation of Kyl -- ""Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster"" -- is a little off. Kyl's staff provided us with a transcript and video; they said it showed more context for Kyl's statement. We reviewed the material; here's an extended version of Kyl remarks. ""My guess is, neither (card check and immigration reform) will have the votes to pass. But because political promises have been made to key constituency of the party that is in power, that they're going to do something about these problems, they will bring up very partisan legislation. Republicans will, primarily Republicans, will vote it down, that is to say we will prevent it from coming up through the filibuster, through requiring cloture and they won't get 60 votes. And then they’ll be able to blame us for being anti-union or anti-Hispanic or whatever. It's false, but that’s the political game. But at least those things won't pass."" On April 13, the Yuma Sun said it would run a correction on the quote. But Tapper's summary of the misquote is still a fair account of what Kyl said. And of course, there are no quote marks on broadcast television. If anything, the video makes a stronger case that Kyl believes Republicans will filibuster immigration reform, which was the premise of Tapper's question.  Kyl's staff told us he only meant that Republicans would filibuster a purely partisan bill, not the kind of bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that Kyl put forward with Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2007. That's why Kyl objected to Tapper's premise. Still, Tapper's question -- ""You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?"" -- remains an fair summary (though not a quotation) of Kyl's town hall remarks. The video showed that Kyl predicted a Republican filibuster. So Kyl's statement -- that he didn't say Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster -- is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB1400>],/factchecks/2010/apr/12/jon-kyl/yuma-daily-newspaper-quoted-kyl-saying-republican/

Sink says McCollum should have consulted congressional delegation on health care lawsuit
","Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor, issued a news release on March 25, 2010, that accused her Republican rival, state attorney general Bill McCollum, of breaking the law when he filed a lawsuit against the health care reform bill recently signed by President Barack Obama. In the release, the Sink campaign wrote that McCollum ""was so eager to file a partisan lawsuit designed to deny Floridians the benefits of the new health care reform bill (that) he may have neglected his duty under Florida law. Florida Statutes require McCollum to consult with members of Florida's Congressional delegation before filing his politically motivated lawsuit against health care reform.""Specifically, the Sink release continued, ""Florida Statutes state that if an Attorney General is undertaking action opposing federal legislation, they must 'furnish to each of the several representatives in the Congress from this state, a written statement giving the reasons for any action being considered, or about to be taken ... and if possible, shall procure the assistance of such representatives.' However, multiple members of Florida's Congressional Delegation received no such statement from Bill McCollum.""We were intrigued by the claim that a state law might require such a consultation, so we decided to look into it. First, some background on the lawsuit. McCollum is one of 18 state attorneys general -- all but one are Republicans -- challenging the new health care law. In a March 22 news conference, McCollum argued that the ""individual mandate"" -- the requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance or face a tax penalty -- is an infringement on individual liberty. ""This is a tax or a penalty on just living. And that's unconstitutional,"" McCollum said. ""There is no provision in the Constitution of the United States giving Congress the power to do that. So it's the absence of authority that is unconstitutional."" Democrats attacked the lawsuit as politically motivated, a charge McCollum has dismissed. The question of whether the attorney general went through proper legal channels before pursuing the lawsuit emerged when U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from South Florida, responded ""state law requires a study and to consult with the congressional delegation."" Sink's campaign picked up the issue from there, citing Florida statute section 16.52, ""Participation in preserving constitutional integrity of state."" You can read the full text on the Legislature's Web site, but it essentially says that in order to allow the state to take part in legal efforts with other states about federal laws, that Florida's Department of Legal Affairs needs to first study the impact of the new federal law to see if it includes ""objectionable or harmful encroachments upon the constitutional integrity of state governments. . . . ""The law specifies that the Department of Legal Affairs give a report to members of Florida's congressional delegation that explains the reasons that legal action is being considered and says that ""if possible,"" the department ""shall procure the assistance of such representatives therein and therefor.""Sink is right that the law is on the books, even if it's a bit dusty. The statute dates from 1943, as is made clear by its mention of ""due regard to this state's full contribution to the national war effort.""And the statute hasn't always been adhered to, said Peter Antonacci, a Democrat who served as Florida's deputy attorney general.Antonacci, now in private practice with the firm Gray Robinson, noted that in a case filed during the 1990s, when Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles was in office, state and local Florida officials sued the federal government, alleging it had failed to enforce immigration policies, leaving the state with heavy expenses in educating and providing public services to undocumented immigrants. Like McCollum's lawsuit, the immigration case dealt with the impact of federal government actions on the state.  Yet, Antonacci told PolitiFact Florida that, ""we didn’t seek anyone's opinion from either party"" before filing the suit. ""We didn't regard the statute as anything that was even guiding, much less binding on the attorney general. This is a statute that might as well have been written in the Civil War for all its relevance today.""McCollum's office agrees with Antonacci's interpretation, citing common-law powers -- those created by previous court decisions -- that empower the attorney general to challenge the constitutionality of a statute. McCollum's office points to a 1999 memo from the opinions division to then-Attorney General Bob Butterworth -- a Democrat -- that says just that.""The courts of this state have recognized that that Attorney General possesses broad common law powers in addition to those prescribed by statute,"" the memo to Butterworth says. ""Among these powers is the authority to prosecute all actions necessary for the protection and the defense of the property and revenue of the state. ... This authority includes the initiation of lawsuits in both state and federal court to protect the public interest. ... The authority of the Attorney General to challenge the constitutionality of a statute has also been recognized as a common law power.""Finally, McCollum's office noted that he did provide an analysis that could fulfill the law's requirement. On Jan. 19, 2010, the attorney general's office released a five-page document signed by McCollum personally that was titled, ""Constitutional Analysis of the Individual Mandate in the Federal Health Care Legislation."" In the cover letter, McCollum wrote, ""I call your attention to these legal concerns so that constitutional issues may be remedied before a final bill is negotiated. I will continue to work with my Attorney General colleagues in order to pursue appropriate legal action should these provisions be in a bill that becomes law."" The letter was addressed to the four Congressional leaders -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. It was posted on the attorney general's Web site, along with a news release.In our judgment, this document seems to fit the requirements of the Florida statute -- namely, ""a study of federal legislation -- existing and proposed -- to determine whether such legislation has resulted, or may result, in objectionable or harmful encroachments upon the constitutional integrity of state governments."" The trickier question is whether the document adheres to the statute's requirement that the attorney general ""shall furnish to each of the several representatives in the Congress from this state, a written statement giving the reasons for any action being considered, or about to be taken hereunder at the time.""Sandi Copes, communications director for the Florida attorney general's office, said that ""we sent the memo to Rep. Pelosi, Sen. Reid, Rep. Boehner and Sen. McConnell, as well as Sen. George LeMieux. We also sent it out to our full distribution list, including over 1,000 press contacts, and posted it on our public Web site."" Antonacci said what McCollum's office did went ""beyond the call of duty based on my experience"" as deputy attorney general. Not good enough, said Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton. ""I don't think (the letter) meets a minimum (requirement), even for a zoning board meeting, which requires more notice than that. I'm pretty sure that when they wrote the statute the intent was that they'd interact with the members of Congress, not simply hope they visited a Web site.""When PolitiFact raised this question, the Sink campaign had Jennifer S. Blohm, an attorney with the Tallahassee law firm Meyer, Brooks, Demma and Blohm, write a legal analysis. In the memo, Blohm argued that ""the statute's language is unambiguous. Providing a memorandum to Congressional leadership from outside the state of Florida and posting the memorandum on the Attorney General's Web site does not comply with the plain language of the statute. ... The statute does not place the onus on Florida's Congressional delegation to seek out what actions the Attorney General may be contemplating. It is the Attorney General's duty to inform Florida's Congressional delegation of his or her proposed actions with regards to federal legislation and seek the delegation's input and, hopefully, assistance in any planned actions."" (In an earlier legal memo, Blohm also argued that state law trumps common law. So to recap: Sink is correct that the law is still on the books. But it's been ignored and a former deputy attorney general says he doesn't find it binding. It's important to note here that we are not rendering a legal verdict on McCollum's actions but merely saying whether Sink is correct that ""Florida Statutes require McCollum to consult with members of Florida's Congressional delegation"" before filing the suit. They do, although there's definitely debate about how much the law still applies. So we'll take this one down a notch to Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A44A240>],/factchecks/2010/apr/12/alex-sink/sink-mccollum-delegation-health-care-lawsuit/
"['LGBTQ', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
David Dewhurst, objecting to student play, says it includes acts reprehensible to vast majority of Americans
","Last month, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst objected to a play subsequently canceled by a professor, citing security concerns, at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, 70 miles southwest of Fort Worth. Dewhurst said in a March 26 press release: ""Every citizen is entitled to the freedom of speech, but no one should have the right to use government funds or institutions to portray acts that are morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans."" Reprehensible acts dramatized at a state-supported university? In support of Dewhurst’s statement that the acts presented are ""morally reprehensible to the vast majority of Americans,"" Dewhurst spokesman Rich Parsons pointed to an aggregate of Gallup Polls taken in 2008 indicating that 77 percent of Americans consider themselves Christians compared with 91 percent when Gallup began tracking religious identification in 1948. When we asked what acts the lieutenant governor was referring to in the play ""Corpus Christi"" by Terrence McNally, Parsons didn’t specify them. Parsons said in an e-mail that Dewhurst generally supports artistic expression ""but he would also never support the denigration of any American’s religion."" So what are the play’s offensive acts? Tarleton State University declined to provide a copy of the abridged version of the play that students in a directing class planned to present. We checked out a copy from the Austin Public Library. The play depicts the life and death of a gay Jesus-like figure, Joshua, and his conversations with his homosexual disciples. The protagonist is born in a Corpus Christi hotel room. As an adult, Joshua wanders the desert, performs miracles and also officiates over a gay wedding; there's male-on-male kissing too and moments suggestive of sex such as a beach blanket scene and sounds of heterosexual coupling. Toward the end, Joshua has a last supper with followers before being betrayed by a friend named Judas. He is crucified. The play drew protests when it made its New York premiere in 1998, though Time magazine critic Richard Zoglin wrote: ""Years from now, when the brouhaha is past, Corpus Christi may get its due as one of McNally's best, most moving and personal works. His updating of the Christ story is witty but not patronizing, as sober and cleansing as a dip in baptismal water."" Mark Holtorf, the Tarleton State theater professor whose students had planned a single performance of the play, said he interprets the drama as a commentary on what it was like to grow up gay in Corpus Christi in the 1950's. Referring to McNally, who grew up there, Holtorf said: ""In a way, it’s somewhat autobiographical. I walked away from the play having a much better understanding of what this poor guy must have gone through.""  Holtorf said the version that was to be performed had women filling eight of 13 roles because of the preponderance of female drama students. He said the only use of government funds would have been the cost of class time devoted to the play and utilities associated with a campus building; tuition-paying students also paid about $200 out of pocket for permission to perform the play and to receive scripts. Parsons, of Dewhurst’s office, pointed us to reports on objections to the Tarleton State production. An article posted by Catholic Online calls the play ""blasphemous,"" quoting a leader of the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property saying: ""With this play Tarleton State University is offending the honor of Our Lord, the Apostles, and 68 million Catholics. What makes it even worse is the fact that it’s taking place right before Holy Week."" The play was scheduled  for the Saturday before Palm Sunday. Another Catholic Online article quotes Catholic League President Bill Donohue calling the play ""hate speech directed at Christians and (as) far more than just a ‘gay Jesus’ play."" Short of Dewhurst revealing what acts in the play he believes most Americans consider morally reprehensible, we'll assume he's referring to the provocative element that suffuses the play—depiction of a Jesus-like figure and his acolytes as gay men. We found no polling on such specifics. But the non-partisan American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a think tank with conservative roots, recently updated a compilation of national polls that suggests adults are divided in their views of homosexuality, though attitudes have relaxed over time. In 2006, 56 percent of respondents said sexual relations between two adults of the same sex are always wrong with another 5 percent saying they almost always are wrong. The institute, quoting the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, says that in 1973, 73 percent of adults said such relations were always wrong with 7 percent saying they're almost always wrong. In a May 2007 Gallup poll, 55 percent of Americans said that homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal, up from 32 percent in 1986, according to the institute. In 2008, a Gallup poll found 48 percent of Americans saying homosexual relations are morally acceptable and 48 percent saying they’re morally wrong, the institute said. In May 2008, a Gallup poll found 57 percent of Americans saying they feel homosexuality should be considered an acceptable alternative lifestyle; 40 percent said not. Among adults who attend church weekly, 79 percent considered sexual relations between two adults of the same sex always wrong in 2002—compared to 46 percent of respondents who attended church once a month or less, according to the institute. Daron Shaw, a University of Texas professor of government and the polling director for UT's Texas Politics Project, cautioned against assuming that widened tolerance of gay lifestyles means Americans would be comfortable with presenting a play at a public university that depicts a Jesus-like figure as gay. In Texas, Shaw speculated, 80-plus percent of residents would object. ""Close to 50 percent of Texans identify themselves as evangelical, fundamentalist, or born again,"" Shaw said in an email. ""Furthermore, if you were to actually poll-test this item, I'd be stunned if there weren't huge majorities who think a play protraying Jesus as gay would be offensive (and probably deeply offensive).""  Where does all this leave Dewhurst’s statement? Dewhurst accurately recaps the play's intended presentation at a state-supported institution, though the use of government funds would have been minimal. While he doesn't share what ""morally reprehensible"" acts he believes most Americans abhor, we assume he's upset at the play's gay aspect. Polls indicate that a large percentage of Texans see themselves as religious. And most frequent church-goers consider gay sex morally wrong. Yet that's not the ""vast majority of Americans,"" as Dewhurst put it. Americans in general are split on whether gay relations are immoral; it's unmeasured how they'd rate unspecified acts in a play. We rate Dewhurst's statement as Barely True -- granting that this could change should Dewhurst identify the acts he considers reprehensible.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097296B40>],/factchecks/2010/apr/12/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-objecting-student-play-says-it-incl/

Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the Bush administration policy was also not to add new nuclear capabilities
","The Nuclear Posture Review released by the Obama administration this week has several key points. It says that the United States will not develop new nuclear warheads, that programs to extend the life of the existing arsenal would rely on previously tested designs, and that the United States will not support new nuclear military capabilities.That's a break from the policy of George W. Bush, who proposed new nuclear warheads that would be longer-lasting, reliable and provide greater flexibility to ultimately reduce the nation's nuclear stockpile. On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the policy objectives of the two administrations are not that different.""The reliable replacement warhead program that existed in the past was really a means to an end,"" said Gates, who served in the same job for President Bush. ""It was a means to modernizing the nuclear stockpile ... making it more reliable, safer, and more secure. The policy of the Bush administration was also not to add new nuclear capabilities. This was about how do you make the stockpile safer and more reliable.""President Barack Obama's Nuclear Posture Review outlines a plan to modernize the existing nuclear arsenal without creating new warheads. If replacement of nuclear components is deemed critically necessary, the Pentagon would need the okay of the president and Congress. Gates said that plan ""offers us a path forward, as Secretary Clinton says, in terms of reuse, refurbishment, and -- and if necessary, replacement of components. Not an entire warhead necessarily. So the chiefs, and I and the directors of the nuclear labs are all very comfortable this puts us in a position to modernize the stockpile.""Here, we are focusing on Gates' claim that, ""The policy of the Bush administration was also not to add new nuclear capabilities.""That may be how the Bush policy ended up, but early on Bush championed a plan to develop a nuclear ""bunker-buster"" weapon.Bush's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review report stated that ""a need may arise to modify, upgrade, or replace portions of the extant nuclear force or develop concepts for follow-on nuclear weapons better suited to the nation's needs."" Specifically, the report talks about the need to develop weapons to get at a growing number of ""hard and deeply-buried targets.""That led to Bush administration proposals in 2003 and 2004 to modify existing warheads to develop a nuclear ""bunker buster"" -- formally known as the ""Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator"" -- that would use a nuclear warhead to destroy underground targets.But Congress repeatedly balked, and the nuclear weapon was never built. Obama, we note, was among those who voted against the program in 2005.""Congress basically said, 'No, you can't have it,' "" Darryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, told PolitiFact.The Bush policy then evolved toward modernizing the arsenal without adding to the U.S. nuclear capability. Bush proposed the Reliable Replacement Warhead Program, which sought to design new warheads with more long-term reliability, allowing the United States to continue to reduce its aging nuclear stockpile. The weapons could only have the same explosive power and be suited for similar targets as existing ones. That's what Gates meant when he said the Bush policy was not to add new nuclear capabilities. Congress denied funding for the program in 2008. Some were concerned it sent the wrong message to other countries that the United States was trying to persuade not to pursue nuclear arms; and others feared it might open the door to new nuclear weapons testing. Congress then passed the Stockpile Management Plan, which seeks to extend the life of the nuclear arsenal without building wholly new warheads.Gates makes a valid point that the Bush policy in the later years of his presidency -- while it called for the development of new nuclear warheads -- did not call for new nuclear capabilities. That's where Bush's policy ended up. But early on, the Bush administration did call for modifications to existing weapons to create a nuclear ""bunker buster"" that very much would have added to the United States' nuclear capabilities. And so we rule Gates' claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A4D540>],/factchecks/2010/apr/11/robert-gates/defense-secretary-robert-gates-says-bush-administr/

Obama criticized Supreme Court filibuster of Alito even as he joined it
","U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement last week, and while President Obama has not yet announced his nominee, U.S. senators are already discussing prospects of a filibuster.Democrats in the Senate hold 59 votes, one short of the 60 needed to bring nominees or legislation to an up or down vote.Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said he thought a filibuster was unlikely, but he wasn't taking it entirely off the table as an option. Kyl appeared on ABC News' This Week, alongside Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. ""President Obama himself attempted to filibuster Justice Alito, who now sits on the Supreme Court,"" Kyl said. ""So if the president isn't going to take it off the table, I'm not going to take it off the table. But I think it can easily be avoided by appointing, frankly, the kind of person that Senator Schumer just mentioned, someone who is mainstream enough that with intellect and the application of good law can persuade colleagues to support his position or her position.""We wanted to examine whether Kyl was correct about Obama's position on then-Judge Samuel Alito back in 2006, when Obama was a senator and Alito was President George W. Bush's nominee.We found that Obama did join a broader Democratic effort to filibuster Alito. Democrats said Alito opposed abortion and was too deferential to executive power.But in what's become Obama's trademark on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand style, he joined the filibuster while at the same time saying he thought it was a bad idea. Here's what he told George Stephanopoulos on Jan. 29, 2006:Stephanopoulos: ""Two of your colleagues, Senator (Edward) Kennedy and Senator (John) Kerry, want to try to mount a filibuster tomorrow. Will you join them?""Obama: ""Well, I will be supporting the filibuster because I think Judge Alito, in fact, is somebody who is contrary to core American values, not just liberal values, you know. When you look at his decisions in particular during times of war, we need a court that is independent and is going to provide some check on the executive branch, and he has not shown himself willing to do that repeatedly. I will say this, though, I think that the Democrats have to do a much better job in making their case on these issues. These last-minute efforts using procedural maneuvers inside the Beltway, I think, has been the wrong way of going about it, and we need to recognize, because Judge Alito will be confirmed, that if we're going to oppose a nominee that we've got to persuade the American people that, in fact, their values are at stake and frankly I'm not sure that we've successfully done that.""Stephanopoulos: ""Well, it sounds to me like you're not really happy about going forward and joining this filibuster. And I've actually seen some reports that inside the Democratic caucus you were arguing against this strategy. Is that true?""Obama: ""Well, you know, I don't talk about what I, you know, what takes place in caucus but what I will say is that there is an over-reliance on the part of Democrats for procedural maneuvers and mechanisms to block the president instead of proactively going out to the American people and talking about the values that we care about. And, you know, there's one way to guarantee that the judges who are appointed to the Supreme Court are judges that reflect our values and that's to win elections.""Later that day, a report from the Associated Press carried the headline, ""Sen. Obama Criticizes Filibuster Tactic.""The next day, Democrats failed in their attempt to filibuster on a vote of 72 to 25, with Obama joining 24 other Democrats on the losing end. Obama may have criticized the filibuster even as he joined it, but at the end of the day, he still joined it.
