Kathleen Falk says Gov. Scott Walker signed bills affecting women in secret
","
In the world of politics, it’s known as ""the Friday dump"" -- the tradition of officials delivering bad news (usually as it relates to themselves) at week’s end or before a holiday. The idea is to ensure light media coverage.

Democrats and liberal interest groups accused Republican Gov. Scott Walker of an all-time classic dump on Good Friday, when Walker’s office announced by news release he had signed four bills they had labeled as part of a ""war on women.""

What’s more, they said he concealed the fact they were signed.

In an April 6, 2012, news release, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Falk challenged Walker to ""explain to the people of Wisconsin why in secret, he allowed legislation that will restrict women’s access to health care and equal pay and will end age-appropriate sex education for students to become law.""

She added that Walker had ""violated the trust of the people.""

Wait.

Can a bill signing announced by news release really constitute ""a secret""?

The four bills at issue prevent people subjected to employment discrimination from seeking damages in state court; reverse a 2010 ban on abstinence-only sex education courses; create new requirements for getting medical advice before abortions; and prohibit insurance plans offered in Wisconsin under the federal health care reform law from covering some abortions.

Democrats say they are part of a broader GOP ""war on women."" Republicans said the bills protect women and reverses ill-advised legislation passed when Democrats had control.

But what about the signed-in-secret part?

The bills, of course, were argued and approved in public. And once signed into law, they ultimately are published. So from that perspective no bill signings are secret.

Sometimes, bills are signed in elaborate ceremonies in front of TV cameras that are announced in advance. Most bills, though, are signed quietly by the governor and announced via news release.

Let’s look at this case more closely.

Walker faced a legal deadline, based on when the bills passed, to sign or reject the four bills. That deadline was Thursday, April 5, 2012.

That day, the Journal Sentinel’s Capitol bureau reporters -- and other media members -- asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie if the bills had been signed. He declined to directly say.

To back up her statement, Falk’s campaign alleged there had been a one-day gap between when Walker signed the bills and his office’s April 6, 2012 announcement, which listed the four among 51 bills that had been signed.
   
We checked legislative records, and they listed the bills being signed on Thursday (most of the others were signed on Friday).

In addition to April 6, 2012 being Good Friday, it was opening day for the Milwaukee Brewers -- a ""Friday dump"" bonus.

The news release, issued at about 12:30 p.m. -- a couple hours before the first pitch at Miller Park -- offered no comments about any of the bills. It was the first time Democratic lawmakers, who are copied on the releases, were notified they had been signed.

So, Democratic lawmakers -- and the public -- were not notified in a timely fashion about the four bills in question.

What’s more, the release said Walker ""signed bills into law today"" (italics ours).

So, the public notice itself was misleading on when they were signed.

We asked Werwie precisely when and where the four bills were signed. He would only say that it was not ""the dark of night"" as critics alleged, and that Walker didn’t sign them in his office because ""he didn’t have time.""

On that same day, Walker signed two job-creation bills at Palermo’s Pizza in Milwaukee. This underlines a point about bill signings and announcements: In the same manner politicians call attention to popular measures with public signings (for political advantage), they can downplay controversial ones by skipping one (also seeking political advantage).

In the end, it all becomes public. The secretary of state gets the bills within 24 hours of a signing, and publishes them.

To find out more, we called the sponsors of the four bills.

They told us there was a private signing ceremony -- on Thursday, April 5, 2012, at the governor’s Milwaukee office. The Republican sponsors were invited to attend, according to Sen. Mary Lazich (R-New Berlin) and an aide to Rep. Michelle Litjens (R-Oshkosh)  though neither of those officials could make it.

Some additional information:

The general timing of Walker’s move was influenced by the Legislature’s actions. The bills in question were not sent to Walker until March 29, 2012. The state constitution gives Walker six working days to sign or veto.

So the timing with Easter Week was determined by lawmakers, while the specific day that week was Walker’s call.

A big-batch signing itself is not unusual, especially in the rush at the end of a legislative session. Earlier that week, Walker issued a similar news release announcing 36 bill signings.

Our conclusion

Echoing others, Falk took Walker to task for signing the four bills ""in secret.""

Falk’s words suggest at the very least a highly unusual effort to conceal an  official action. And the record reflects that. It’s clear to us that Walker cloaked the signing from reporters, and delayed his announcement to the public and Democratic lawmakers.

But although Walker sought to quietly approve these bills -- that’s his prerogative. The timing was only partially in his control, and it’s not unusual to sign big batches of bills out of direct public view, for practical reasons or political ones.

We think it’s a stretch to call it ""secret"" when the signing will ultimately become public -- and when it was announced in a news release.

In short, we think there’s an element of truth to Falk’s claim but it ignores critical facts that could give a different impression.

That’s our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809797B0C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/22/kathleen-falk/kathleen-falk-says-gov-scott-walker-signed-bills-a/
"['New Jersey', 'History', 'Raymond Bateman']","
Former state legislator claims Mason-Dixon Line crossed into New Jersey
","
New Jerseyans living in the northern and southern parts of the state already have plenty to divide them: politics, professional sports teams, and whether it’s called going ""down the shore"" or ""to the beach.""

Now former state legislator Raymond Bateman has added another point of division: the Mason-Dixon Line, best known for separating free and slave states in the period leading up to the Civil War.

Bateman, a Republican who served as a state assemblyman and senator for two decades before his failed gubernatorial bid in 1977, offered that historical claim in an April 9 opinion piece published on DailyRecord.com. The column focused on the split between northern and southern New Jersey in light of the fierce debate over merging Rutgers-Camden with Rowan University.

""The political and cultural divisions between North and South Jersey are historic and run deep,"" Bateman wrote. ""Early in 1861, on a train route to his first presidential inauguration, Abe Lincoln stopped in Trenton and addressed a joint session of the New Jersey Legislature. He was roundly booed and bombarded with inappropriate catcalls.

""New Jersey’s North-South political landscape during the Civil War was definitely mixed — remember that Cape May, Cumberland, Salem and part of Atlantic counties are all south of the Mason-Dixon line.""

But PolitiFact New Jersey found that the Mason-Dixon Line never entered the Garden State.

Although closely associated with the divide between free and slave states, the line was originally meant to settle a border dispute between the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania, according to experts and historical records. The line runs north along the border between Delaware and Maryland, and then west along the Maryland-Pennsylvania border.

Bateman acknowledged his claim is inaccurate, but said the presence of the Mason-Dixon Line in New Jersey has been a commonly held belief.

""If I’m wrong, I’m wrong,"" Bateman, a Somerset County native, told us. ""If that’s the authority, I stand corrected.""

Let’s trace the history behind the Mason-Dixon Line.

The famous boundary gets its name from English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, called upon in the 1760s to establish the boundaries between Maryland and Pennsylvania. The Calvert family of Maryland and the Penn family of Pennsylvania had been engaged in a long-running dispute over their borders.

The resulting border separated Delaware, which was then part of Pennsylvania, from Maryland and Pennsylvania. The line was later extended westward to form the boundary between Pennsylvania and what is now West Virginia.

Matthew Crocker, a history professor at Keene State College in New Hampshire, said in an e-mail that ""no part of N.J. was ever thought of being south of the Mason-Dixon Line.""

Joseph Bilby, a member of the New Jersey Civil War Sesquicentennial Committee and the author of several books on the state’s history, told us myth-makers ""have been drawing political conclusions from this make-believe line crossing New Jersey for some time.""

""If you insist on drawing the line across from the Maryland/Pennsylvania border to the Atlantic Ocean, then yes, Southern New Jersey would be under that ‘line,’ although the line itself would be, of course, meaningless,"" Bilby said in an e-mail.

The symbolic importance of the Mason-Dixon Line as dividing free and slave states increased as Pennsylvania’s gradual emancipation act took effect during the 1780s and 1790s, according to Max Grivno, an assistant history professor at the University of Southern Mississippi.

""Tensions over slavery along the border increased steadily beginning in the 1790s, but they reached a climax in the 1850s when there were several violent skirmishes between runaway slaves and slave catchers in southern Pennsylvania,"" Grivno said in an e-mail.

Our ruling

In an April 9 opinion piece, Bateman claimed ""Cape May, Cumberland, Salem and part of Atlantic counties are all south of the Mason-Dixon line.""

But historical records and experts confirmed that the Mason-Dixon Line never entered New Jersey. The boundary was first established in the 1760s to settle a border dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania.

We rate the statement False.

"['Water', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Ron Oakley']","
Ron Oakley says his 'conservative leadership' slashed water district's budget
","
Ron Oakley acknowledges that in election years, a lot of candidates talk like conservatives. But if you believe a recent mailer from his campaign, he is a proven conservative with a record of reining in government. 
Need proof? Oakley, a Republican candidate for Pasco County commission, offers his time on the governing board of the Southwest Florida Water Management District. His mailer makes a pair of specific claims about his experience with the agency’s budget. It helps to quote at length: 
""Ron Oakley was a consistent voice and vote for lower taxes. Applying the principles he learned while leading his family businesses, Oakley voted to cut the District’s millage rate by 43 percent — from .687 to .392 mils."" 
The mailer continues: ""Ron Oakley voted to reduce the Water Management District’s budget by 58 percent in the four years he served on the board. His conservative leadership protected local taxpayers over government bureaucrats."" 
There’s no doubt the agency’s spending has plummeted. Here, we are checking whether Oakley’s leadership resulted in those cuts. Can he take credit for cuts ordered by state officials? 
Oakley, an east Pasco citrus grower, joined the 13-member water district board in June 2007. The first budget he voted on was for Fiscal Year 2008. As a baseline for his claims, he used the previous budget, FY 2007, that was in place when he took office. 
Informally known as Swiftmud, the agency covers portions of 16 counties and at the time had eight water basins with different tax rates. For example, folks in Trinity or Pinellas County paid a total tax rate of 0.822 that year, or 82 cents in taxes for every $1,000 of assessed value. The tax rate for owners in Bradenton or Sarasota was only 0.582. 
Oakley, 66, used his hometown Withlacoochee River basin, covering northeast Pasco and parts of five other counties to the north. (That’s also the district for his opponent, incumbent Commissioner Ted Schrader.) That basin’s total tax rate was 0.687 that year, about average for the eight basins. 
The first budget Oakley voted on included a 0.617 tax rate for property owners in the Withlacoochee basin. That reduction was ordered by property tax legislation signed by Gov. Charlie Crist in June 2007. The rate was left unchanged for the next two years. In fall 2010, the board adopted a rate of 0.608. 
Then the world changed. 
Gov. Rick Scott was elected November 2010. His initial budget proposal — released in February 2011 — called for a 25 percent cut to Swiftmud’s property taxes. Then lawmakers sharpened their knives and ordered a 36 percent cut for Swiftmud, the largest cut of Florida’s five water districts. Scott signed the legislation requiring that cut. 
To shrink the budget that much, board members eliminated the basin districts, and their tax rates — more on that later. They later set a property tax rate of 0.392. 
Bottom-line budget figures tell a similar story. When Oakley took office, Swiftmud’s budget was $383 million. Oakley and other board members adopted a slightly larger budget the next year, $395 million. Even with a tax rate cut, the budget grew from higher property values and increased state money. 
The next three budgets were: $376.5 million (FY 2009); $298.9 million (FY 2010); and $279.8 (FY 2011). Thank plunging property values and reduced state spending for those cuts. Then Scott took office, ordered more cuts, and the budget plummeted to $155 million. That figure is 59.4 percent smaller than Oakley’s baseline budget. Darn close to his 58 percent claim. 
Oakley’s last meeting was May 24, 2011. He said he should get credit for that year’s budget cuts because he cast votes on preliminary versions of the budget. As with many local governments, key budget decisions are made early in the year. Details get ironed out closer to final passage in the fall. 
The governing board eliminated the basins during that May meeting. The majority of the budget cut came from wiping out the basins, though there was $41 million in unspent basin money included in the spending plan. The district also lost nearly all of its state funding. 
Several board members lamented the move, saying the basins were a vital conduit to local citizens on water issues. But it was clear a larger power was at play. 
""I guess it’s sort of like an edict from Tallahassee,"" said board member Todd Pressman, the lone dissenting vote on the plan. 
Added board member Jeff Adams: ""It’s not something that was suggested. It’s been mandated, and it’s been forced to us."" 
Oakley said board members had options. They could have removed all the basins. They could have consolidated them into three larger districts. They could have sliced more money from the overall agency budget. ""We chose the option we thought was best,"" he said. 
However they found the money, board members still had to meet the 36 percent reduction. 
""We’ve already committed to the tax reductions,"" Deputy Executive Director Kurt Fritsch said during a budget workshop later in the meeting. ""We have met the governor’s promises. The governor promised a tax reduction. He’s getting it."" 
During an interview last week, Oakley said the board was considering cuts before the governor and lawmakers made their proposals. That’s true. The board in January approved a staff report calling for a drop in the district’s base tax rate. The report also suggested looking for ""further opportunities"" to reduce the basin tax rates. 
""The Legislature was sending us a message they wanted us to cut more,"" he said. ""I don’t know many people that want to fight the Legislature."" 
Oakley’s claims of eye-popping cuts to Swiftmud’s tax rate and budget are largely correct. And we’ll give him partial credit for ""voting on"" the budget in 2011, even though he only voted on a preliminary version and not the final product. 
But the bottom line is most of those eye-popping cuts came as Oakley was leaving office, and they were specifically ordered by Scott and the Legislature. For most of Oakley’s four years at Swiftmud, the agency saw much more modest budget reductions, thanks largely to declining state money and falling property values. 
Oakley’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. 
In this case, Tallahassee politicians should get the lion’s share of the credit for the 2011 cuts. We rate Oakley’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A74340>],/factchecks/2012/apr/22/ron-oakley/ron-oakley-conservative-leadership-water-managemen/
"['Rhode Island', 'Corporations', 'Economy', 'Elections', 'Jobs', 'Small Business', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says annual new business startups have dropped by 100,000 since Barack Obama became president
","
When Mitt Romney was in Rhode Island April 11 to campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, he said that President Obama’s policies were hurting the economy.

To demonstrate that point during his speech in Warwick, Romney pointed to the rate of new business start-ups around the nation.

""The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term,"" Romney said.

Romney has made this claim in other speeches. In Colorado in February, he was more detailed, saying, ""Last year, under President Obama, there were almost 100,000 fewer new business start-ups than there were three years before.""

Start-up businesses are a crucial part of the nation’s economy. One recent study found that they account for only 3 percent of employment but almost 20 percent of gross job creation.

So it stands to reason that one explanation for the slow pace of recovery is a lack of start-up activity. In that context, we were interested to see if Romney’s claim was accurate.

A spokeswoman for Romney’s campaign refused to comment for this piece, so we did our own research.

We started with an item written March 23, 2010, by our friends at PolitiFact Ohio checking a claim by House Speaker John Boehner that ""new business start-ups are at the lowest levels in 30 years."" Boehner’s statement was rated True, because the rate of start-ups per thousand people and the total number of start-ups per year were lower than in 1977 -- the date cited by Boehner’s office. But that item was not directly attributing the rate to Obama, as Romney did.

We called Scott Shane, an expert on entrepreneurship who was a source for the PolitiFact Ohio Item. Shane is chairman of the economics department and professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

He sent us a spreadsheet of Census Bureau data compiled by the U.S. Small Business Administration. His chart included the number of new firms created annually from 2005 to 2009, the most recent year that data is available.

The number of new firms increased from 2005 to 2006 but fell steadily each year afterward, going from 556,899 in 2006 to 403,765 in 2009.

The difference between 2008 -- George W. Bush’s last year in office -- and 2009 -- Obama’s first year -- was 84,499 fewer new businesses. Although it’s close, that’s not the drop-off of 100,000 new businesses that Romney claimed in his statement. But the available SBA data doesn’t cover Obama’s subsequent years in office, so it’s impossible to use it to make a conclusive ruling on Romney’s claim.

So we turned to another source of information that has data for more recent years -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for labor figures. The bureau also tracks the creation of new businesses, but its numbers are different from the SBA data.

While the SBA only includes start-ups, the BLS includes all new establishments. As Shane explained, if McDonald’s opens a new branch somewhere, then that branch is included in the BLS numbers but not in the SBA numbers. So the more-inclusive BLS number is generally larger than the SBA number for any given year.

Although the BLS number doesn’t correlate perfectly to the number of new start-up businesses, we believe it’s still relevant. Romney’s claim was made as a part of a broader criticism of Obama’s economic policies and the slow rate of recovery. Whether a new establishment is a completely new business or a branch of an existing one, it still creates jobs and contributes to economic growth.

According to the bureau’s Business Employment Dynamics statistics, the number of new establishments rose until 2006, when it was 667,341. It fell every year afterward up to 2010 by an average of 40,053 -- but then rose again in 2011 by 29,316.

Despite the recent increase, however, the overall decrease since Obama became president is close to 100,000. In 2008, the number of new establishments was 626,771. In 2011, it was 536,445 -- 90,326 less.

Because Romney’s campaign would not give us a source for his claim, we can only make an educated guess that he used the BLS number and rounded it up to 100,000. That may be reasonable, but there are still problems with Romney’s statement.

By saying that the number of new businesses dropped during ""this president’s term,"" he is clearly implying that Obama is responsible. Later in the speech he gave in Warwick, Romney was more emphatic.

""This has not been a good time to start new enterprises,"" he said. ""This president’s policies are responsible for the fact that this recovery has been postponed...""

In a past speech, Romney called Obama’s presidency a ""war on enterprise.""

At PolitiFact, we treat these types of blame/credit statements in two parts. We examine whether the numbers are right and how much experts say the person being blamed is responsible.

But the number of new business start-ups had been declining before Obama took office. The numbers tracked by both the Small Business Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were down in 2007 and 2008, President George W. Bush’s last two years in office. The trend continued under President Obama.

The decline coincided with the onset of the global economic recession. Not surprisingly, the biggest year-on-year drop-off in new businesses -- 17 percent according to the SBA and 12.5 percent according to the BLS -- occurred from 2008 to 2009, when the recession was at its worst. Obama took office in January 2009.

In general, because of the complexities involved, PolitiFact has been leery of attributing the health of the economy to the policies of a president. We’ll borrow a quote from a recent PolitiFact National item to explain.

""A recession that is under way or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new office holder,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. (Burtless has provided advice to the campaign of Republican John McCain and contributed money to Obama.)

""The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office.""

So what are some reasons for the drop in new business start-ups? In testimony to the House Committee on Small Business, Martin Neil Baily, another economist at Brookings, said that a reduction in home equity -- an important source of funds for start-ups -- and a tightening of banks’ lending standards are partly to blame.

It’s important to note that the recession didn’t just affect start-ups in the United States. A 2010 World Bank study of 95 countries found that ""nearly all experienced a sharp drop in business entry during the crisis.""

We should also add that it is extremely difficult to accurately measure the rate of business start-ups. We found one study that showed entrepreneurship rising in 2009 before falling in subsequent years. Another showed the rate rising in 2009 and 2010 before falling last year.

""No single measure captures entrepreneurial activity perfectly,"" Shane wrote in a commentary last year.

Finally, it’s telling that in 2011, as the United States started moving toward a recovery, the rate of new establishments tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics increased for the first time since 2006. Romney didn’t mention that in his speech.

Our ruling

Mitt Romney said: ""The number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 during this president’s term.""

Many studies have found that fewer businesses have been created during the recession than in previous years. But we couldn’t find any that attributed a drop-off to Obama’s policies or, for that matter, Bush’s policies.

There is some truth in Romney’s claim, but he neglected to say that the rate of new business start-ups was dropping before Obama took office. Or that by one measurement it has increased recently.

Because Romney ""leaves out important details or takes things out of context,"" we rate his statement Half True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Barack Obama's ""suggested reduction in spending for next year"" is zero
","
In an effort to relate the federal budget to a typical family’s budget, the Mitt Romney presidential campaign posted an explanatory graphic on April 17, 2012. It concludes with this claim ""President Obama's suggested reduction in spending for next year: $0.""

We decided to see whether that’s accurate.

As its source, the graphic pointed to Obama’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2013. This document, produced annually, is usually considered an opening volley rather than a final set of numbers, particularly when the president and Congress are controlled by different parties. Congress typically gives little deference to the president’s budget request.

Still, as a summary of the president’s fiscal priorities, it’s reasonable for Romney to use it in the way it did. The question is whether Obama did propose no net reduction in spending for 2013 compared to 2012.

Indeed, Romney has a point.

According to Obama’s proposal, overall federal outlays would increase from $3.796 trillion in fiscal year 2012 to $3.803 trillion in fiscal 2013. That’s an increase -- though a modest one. It’s a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent of all federal outlays, which is likely to fall well short of the inflation rate.

But an important detail is missing: Obama doesn't have much control over the parts of the budget that are increasing -- the ""mandatory spending"" and net interest.

Mandatory spending includes entitlements such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Their annual costs are determined by automatic formulas rather than congressional appropriations. Meanwhile, net interest is what the nation pays on its outstanding debt. Collectively, mandatory spending and net interest account for about 65 percent of federal outlays in 2012.

The remaining 35 percent is considered discretionary spending -- funds that are appropriated by Congress and signed by the president on an annual basis. This part of the budget includes all the other functions of government that aren’t determined by a formula.

Under the president’s budget, mandatory spending plus net interest -- the costs that are largely set by formula and debt commitments -- are poised to rise from $2.477 trillion to $2.541 trillion between 2012 and 2013, an increase of about 2.5 percent. But discretionary spending -- again, the part he has more control over -- would actually decline from $1.319 trillion to $1.261 trillion, a drop of 4.3 percent. So by this measure, Obama is suggesting cuts in his budget proposal.

Our ruling

Romney claims that the president’s ""suggested reduction in spending for next year"" is zero. Romney's claim ignores the detail that Obama proposed cuts in the discretionary portion of the budget, which he has more control over. The increases come from mandatory spending and net interest. Still, Obama could propose cuts in mandatory spending if he wanted. 
The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC3B80>],/factchecks/2012/apr/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obamas-suggested-reduction/

Chain email says voters must turn out to protect homestead benefits of elderly and people with disabilities
","
A reader passed along a warning she’d fielded in an email about a so-called proposed constitutional amendment.

""You MUST vote in May to keep the Homestead tax cap for 65 and over, even if you are not 65 yet,"" the chain email says. ""If you are a Texas homeowner then this is important to YOU.""

The email says that state lawmakers who approved a reduction in school property taxes in 2006 failed to share the benefits with senior citizens and people with disabilities. ""So an amendment is on the May ballot to correct this error,"" the email says. ""The problem is that most voters who are younger than 65 or not disabled probably won’t even notice the amendment or care.""

The email closes by saying that early voting runs from April 30 through May 8 and election day is May 12, 2012.

Those dates align with the schedule for upcoming municipal elections, according to the Travis County clerk’s office.

However, Texans resolved the issue affecting homestead exemptions for senior citizens and people with disabilities in May 2007 -- nearly five years ago.

In that homestead-related vote, some 88 percent of voters authorized lawmakers to lower the cap on public school property taxes that may be imposed on residence homesteads of the elderly or disabled to reflect the reductions in rates approved by lawmakers the year before. 
When the same chain email surfaced in 2009, the Austin American-Statesman quoted Ashley Burton of the Texas Secretary of State’s office saying such emails were fakes. Burton further pointed out that there were no statewide issues on the May 2009 ballot, according to an April 24, 2009, American-Statesman news blog.

Similarly, there are no proposed constitutional amendments on the May 12, 2012 ballot.

The next statewide elections are the Republican and Democratic primaries on May 29, 2012. Proposed constitutional amendments do not appear on primary ballots.

Finally: It’s not uncommon for chain emails to say Texans are voting on an issue not on the ballot. We pointed out a flaming example in 2010, adding that if voters want to check into anything on the ballot, the state recommends an online visit or a telephone call to the secretary of state at 1-800-252-8683.

Has Dwight Holton 'never set foot' in an Oregon courtroom?
","
There are two narratives in the race between two Democrats for Oregon attorney general. Dwight Holton paints himself as an exciting advocate and opponent Ellen Rosenblum as a boring government lawyer. Rosenblum describes herself as the home-grown -- double Duck! -- candidate and Holton as not from around here.

""When you’ve joined the Oregon State Bar in 2009 and you've never set foot in an Oregon courtroom, I'm not sure that qualifies you to be Attorney General,"" Rosenblum said of Holton in a news story published in The Oregonian.

The average person is likely to think that Rosenblum means Holton has never been in a courtroom physically located in the state of Oregon. That, on its face, is a ludicrous claim. Holton started work in the U.S. attorney’s office in Portland in 2004 before resigning in January to run for attorney general.

However, we understand Rosenblum is making the case that the attorney general is a state position, and Holton has spent his career in Oregon working in federal court. Rosenblum’s spokeswoman, Cynara Lilly, said as much in defense of the statement.

""Federal Court is referred to as 'U.S. Court,' state courts as 'Oregon Court.' It has nothing to do with the physical state the court is in, it is the type of court. So yes, our campaign stands by the statement that Dwight has never set foot in an Oregon State Courtroom,"" Lilly writes. ""If you search the Oregon Courts online under his name and/or his bar number you will find no record of him trying any cases in Oregon Court.""

Jillian Schoene, a spokeswoman for Holton, confirms the candidate has not tried a case in a state courtroom. But she raises a number of points we think add important context to the claim.

Holton has lived in Oregon since 2002, when he moved here with his wife. During his time in the U.S. attorney’s office, he worked with local law enforcement to address prescription painkiller abuse and to keep illegal guns away from domestic abusers. He reached out to Muslims living in Oregon.

It’s not as if Holton was sitting in his nice federal office keeping away from public safety issues important to this state. As interim U.S. attorney, he supervised the lawyers who represented the federal government in state courts in Oregon.

And we’re not inclined to repeat endorsement sound bites, but it means something that most of the state’s 36 district attorneys -- all in the state system, last time we checked -- have endorsed him.

Certainly Rosenblum has deeper experience with state courts. She was a state judge for 22 years. We gave Holton a Half True for saying that Rosenblum said 80 percent of the attorney general’s job is being the state’s lawyer. She said it -- and even denied saying it -- but she said other things about the job, as well.

Here we find that her attempt to paint Holton as an Oregon outsider, just because he personally hasn’t argued in state court, is misleading. The statement contains a bit of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

We rule Rosenblum’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0B3880>],/factchecks/2012/apr/20/ellen-rosenblum/has-dwight-holton-never-set-foot-oregon-courtroom/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
David Dewhurst says state general revenue spending has dropped about 11% on his watch
","
On the defensive several times during the April 13, 2012, Republican U.S. Senate debate, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst countered a charge that he has never cut the budget by saying he has done just that numerous times and ""by billions and billions of dollars.""

Dewhurst was responding to fellow Senate hopeful Ted Cruz, who questioned Dewhurst’s record by saying that ""in (Dewhurst’s) entire tenure in elected office, he has never once cut one penny from the state budget.""

Dewhurst replied that Cruz, a Houston lawyer, was wrongly focusing on the size of the total state budget — including state and federal funds — when he should be zeroing in on expenditures of state revenue, often called general revenue, which Dewhurst described as ""the only money that we can control.""

""Every conservative group that I have ever worked with has said, ‘Governor, don’t increase your general revenue spending more than inflation and population growth,’"" Dewhurst said. ""Not only did we do better than that, but we have cut it 10.7 percent.""

Elsewhere, we’re fact-checking Cruz’s charge that Dewhurst hasn’t cut a penny from the budget. Here, we’ll dig into Dewhurst’s statement that when adjusted for inflation and population growth, general revenue spending has declined nearly 11 percent while he’s led the Senate.

First, a note on Dewhurst’s methodology. Limiting spending increases to the sum of inflation and population growth is advocated by small-government groups as one way to ward off what they see as excessive spending. It’s a way to keep per-resident spending from increasing other than through inflation.

As backup for Dewhurst’s debate claim, his campaign sent us a spreadsheet containing details on overall state government expenditures per two-year budget period, as well as the subcategory of general revenue. The figures for the current biennium, 2012-13, are estimates. The spreadsheet also includes the historical expenditure figures adjusted for population and inflation. (The same figures are in a chart in a January 2012 report from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters.)

First, we looked at how overall spending, including state and federal funds, has changed since Dewhurst became lieutenant governor in early 2003. The estimated ""all funds"" expenditures for 2012-13 of $173 billion are nearly 50 percent greater than such spending in 2002-03, which was the last two-year budget period before Dewhurst assumed his gavel-wielding post.

However, according to the report, once the 2012-13 figure is adjusted for inflation and population growth over the intervening years, ""all funds"" spending is actually down about 2.4 percent from 2002-03.

Next, we looked at general revenue. According to the board’s figures, the estimated 2012-13 general revenue spending level is about 36 percent greater than the 2002-03 spending level. But adjusted for inflation and population growth, general revenue spending is estimated to be down about 11.5 percent, according to the report. That’s pretty close to the 10.7 percent that Dewhurst cited at the debate.

Open and shut case?

Not exactly. We spotted several wrinkles.

For instance, general revenue spending, adjusted for inflation and population growth, did not drop in every biennium once Dewhurst began presiding over the Senate. According to the budget board’s report, adjusted general revenue spending, when compared to the previous biennium, rose twice and dropped three times. The biggest drop came in 2004-05, when adjusted general revenue spending declined 9.6 percent. The highest increase came in 2008-09, when the level rose 10.8 percent.

More significantly, the estimated spending levels for 2012-13 in Dewhurst’s backup material and the budget board’s report fail to account for more than $6 billion in spending that the 2011 Legislature, in a maneuver to help balance the budget, pushed into the next biennium.

It was much-reported during the 2011 legislative session that lawmakers failed to appropriate enough state money to cover projected Medicaid costs for 2012-13. The budget board’s report says it is expected that the 2013 Legislature will have to put more money — estimated at about $4 billion — into the program to help pay for ""the last four to five months of fiscal year 2013."" The report says the amount of money needed could vary based on factors such as the size of the state’s caseload and medical costs.

That’s not all. Also as widely reported, lawmakers reduced spending on public education in the 2012-13 budget in part by delaying a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts by several days, pushing it from the end of the 2013 fiscal year into the next budget cycle.

We wondered how these maneuvers might be inflating the general-revenue reduction proclaimed by Dewhurst — and made a run at rolling the postponed education payment and Medicaid costs into the estimated 2012-13 general revenue spending figures in the board report. We then adjusted for inflation and population growth using the same factors as the board staff and compared our new 2012-13 figure with the 2002-03 spending level.

Our finding: Estimated general revenue spending in 2012-13 still appears to be less than such spending in 2002-03. However, the difference is 4.7 percent — not the 10.7 percent Dewhurst cited at the debate or the 11.5 percent aired by his campaign.

Our ruling

Dewhurst’s debate claim that state general revenue spending dropped by 10.7 percent on his watch is close to the 11.5 percent reduction that a comparison of 2012-13 estimated spending to 2002-03 spending yields.

But that result is misleading, too simplistic.

First, it overlooks changes — up and down — in general revenue spending, adjusted for inflation and population growth, between each of the preceding two-year budgets. Second, the spending figure for 2012-13 does not account for more than $6 billion in state costs postponed to the next budget period. Rolling in those costs, making for a closer-to-realistic accounting of costs in the latest Dewhurst-touched budget, shrinks the difference of 11.5 percent to 4.7 percent.

We rate Dewhurst’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973836C0>],/factchecks/2012/apr/20/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-state-general-revenue-spending/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says David Dewhurst hasn't ever cut a penny from state budget
","
Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz sounded dubious of Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst’s fiscal record in a televised debate, saying: ""I’ll tell you something the lieutenant governor will not tell you: In his entire tenure in elected office, he has never once cut one penny from the state budget.""

Not a cent, ever?

That’s provocative considering Dewhurst has presided over the Texas Senate during the adoption of five two-year state budgets, including two -- for 2004-05 and 2012-13 -- balanced partly by enacting cuts in the face of multibillion-dollar projected revenue shortfalls. He previously served a term as state land commissioner.

Then again, a case might  be framed that Dewhurst has no budget-cutting duties. That is, the lieutenant governor has no specified role in writing each state budget, though typical duties include appointing members of the Senate Finance Committee and, later each session, naming a few senators to negotiate budgetary differences with the Texas House.

Cruz, the former Texas solicitor general, made no reference to the lieutenant governor’s lack of budget-writing duties. In laying out the basis of his claim during the April 13, 2012, Republican Senate debate at WFAA-TV in Dallas, he said that when Dewhurst was elected to the post in 2002, the two-year state budget, for 2002-03, was $116 billion. For 2010-11, Cruz said, the budget was $188 billion -- $72 billion more.

Those cited figures are accurate, according to a chart in the January 2012 Fiscal Size-up report by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. The chart, Figure 22, details state government spending by two-year budget cycles.

However, Cruz did not account for the latest state budget, which shows less spending in 2012-13 than the previous biennium. Also, comparing the first and fourth budgets passed into law on Dewhurst’s watch is not the only way to gauge whether Dewhurst ever cut a penny.

Let’s drill down.

Notably, Cruz’s cited figures reflect spending from all sources, including state and federal funds. At the debate, Dewhurst countered that state lawmakers have the most direct control over the state, or general revenue, portion of each budget -- which is true to a limited degree. According to the budget board report, lawmakers were able to freely appropriate only $15 billion of the nearly $88 billion in general revenue in the 2012-13 budget. The bulk of general revenue was restricted by provisions in state law or the Texas Constitution or influenced by funding formulas or federal laws, regulations or court decisions, the report says.

Also, comparisons of state budgets over Dewhurst’s years as lieutenant governor might benefit from taking into consideration inflation and population growth. The figures aired by Cruz were not adjusted.

The budget board’s 2012 report presents changes in spending from all sources and from general revenue alone biennium by biennium since 1992-93, meaning September 1991 through August 1993.

And according to the report, raw dollar and percentage changes from biennium to biennium increased in each of the four Dewhurst-touched budget cycles. The increases in spending from all sources of funding averaged nearly 13 percent, ranging from 8.9 percent between 2008-09 and 2010-11 to 20.6 percent from 2006-07 to 2008-09, the report says.

However, general revenue spending in 2004-05 was down about $960 million from 2002-03, or 1.6 percent. Such spending increased in the other budget cycles referenced by Cruz. 
Adjusted for inflation and population, though, the average biennium-to-biennium surge in spending from all sources drops to 3.5 percent, with individual increases ranging from 0.4 percent between 2002-03 and 2004-05, the report says, to 9.9 percent, from 2006-07 to 2008-09.

The adjusted 2004-05 decrease in general revenue spending was 9.6 percent, the report says, while the 0.4 percent raw increase in such spending for 2010-11 amounted to an adjusted reduction of 5.9 percent.

That is, then, one of the referenced budgets had a raw drop in general revenue spending and two of them had adjusted reductions.

And what of the 2012-13 spending plan -- the one not mentioned by Cruz?

The board report says that estimated spending from all funds in 2012-13 of $173.5 billion is down 7.5 percent from 2010-11. Adjusted for inflation and population growth, that reduction shakes out to 14.6 percent.

Also, according to the board chart, nearly $81.3 billion in state general revenue spending in 2012-13 was down 0.8 percent from 2010-11. That raw spending total also is less than $81.6 billion shown in general revenue expenditures in 2008-09.

Adjusted for inflation and population growth, state spending for 2012-13 is shown as down 8.4 percent from 2010-11.

In a telephone interview, Cruz’s campaign consultant, Jason Johnson, said Cruz did not touch on the latest budget because the figures as presented in the board’s report deliver an incomplete picture. Johnson pointed to maneuvers by the 2011 Legislature that, he said, helped members balance the budget while inflating the savings shown between 2010-11 and 2012-13.

There’s meat on that bone: Lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to postpone a regular $2.3 billion distribution of education aid to public school districts into the next biennium, in September 2013, and also did not pony up for an estimated $4 billion in 2012-13 Medicaid costs, a gap likely to be addressed by the 2013 Legislature.

In November 2011, we looked at how much genuine cutting there was in the 2012-13 budget while checking a Perry claim. Our sense then was that counting the postponed Medicaid and public school expenditures and including additional federal aid that would roll in if the state committed more to Medicaid, the 2012-13 budget might actually total about $184.3 billion, making the overall reduction from the previous biennium about $3.2 billion. Some estimates have since changed. By our analysis, the overall reduction would lately amount to $1.8 billion, down 1 percent from what was spent overall in the 2010-11 biennium. 
Bottom line: Even after wrapping in the spending not reflected in the report’s total for 2012-13, the overall raw spending level for 2012-13 is slightly lower than in the previous biennium. 
After adjusting for population growth and inflation, total funding still shows a decrease, although again, it’s smaller, about 8.5 percent, in comparison to the 14.6 percent the report shows.

We also looked at how the general revenue picture changes after considering the left-out state spending. On a raw-dollar basis, the reduction of 0.8 percent shown in the report changes to a 6.8 percent increase. But after adjusting for inflation and population growth, the 2012-13 general revenue spending level still shows a reduction, of 1.4 percent, from the previous biennium.

Another angle: Johnson of Cruz’s campaign forwarded his calculation of how the budget would have changed from 2002-03, before Dewhurst ascended, through 2010-11 if spending had only tracked inflation and population growth. Spending from all sources would have increased nearly $45 billion, 39 percent, his chart indicates. The actual unadjusted difference was about $72 billion, a difference of 62 percent. 
Johnson did not extend his analysis to the latest budget. The budget board suggests the raw difference between estimated spending in 2012-13 and what was spent in 2002-03 is about $58 billion, or 50 percent. We calculate that the difference increases to 60 percent if you count the postponed Medicaid and education expenses as part of spending in the 2012-13 biennium.

We asked Johnson how Cruz concluded that Dewhurst has never cut a penny from the state budget, particularly given that the 2003 and 2011 Legislatures made reductions to accommodate projected revenue shortfalls and the Republican majority’s desire not to raise taxes.

Johnson noted that overall raw spending from all sources of funding increased over the four Dewhurst-touched budget cycles covering September 2003 to September 2011 (though, again, not considering the latest two-year budget adopted in 2011). Johnson later said by email: ""Spending more than you spent in the previous (legislative) session doesn't meet the definition of a cut.  More pennies be more pennies.""

Johnson, in the interview, also suggested adjustments of spending figures for inflation and population growth should be discounted: ""The average Texan, when they look at dollars spent by the state, that Texan does not step back and say, ‘Let me think about inflation.’ I assure you those same taxpayers aren’t able to make that same calculation on their pay and turn around and seek reimbursement from their employers,"" he said.

As noted in a Dallas Morning News blog entry posted April 16, 2012, Eva DeLuna Castro, an expert fiscal analyst for the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, recently said that to close the state’s latest revenue shortfall, lawmakers in 2011 cut about $11 billion in spending. She said legislators also applied new revenue, adopted budgetary maneuvers and withdrew money from the state’s rainy day fund, she said. The News’ blog entry closes by calling it an overreach to ""say there were no spending cuts.""

Our ruling

Cruz’s claim rests on overall spending by state government escalating in the first four two-year budgets adopted with Dewhurst as lieutenant governor. State government spent 62 percent more in 2010-11 than it did before Dewhurst filled his post.

However, these results do not mean Dewhurst never once cut the budget. 
Indeed, expenditures of state revenue alone were reduced by nearly $1 billion -- some 960 million pennies -- in the 2004-05 budget. Also, the 2012-13 budget -- overlooked by Cruz -- spends less than what the state spent in 2010-11, even after adjusting for major current costs to be paid for in the next budget period.

Graves: Tens of thousands of federal properties are vacant or underused
","
Nowadays, real estate and the word ""glut"" come hand in hand.

There’s been a glut of homes for sale. A glut in available commercial properties.

There’s also a lesser-known glut in properties owned by the federal government that it no longer needs or does not fully utilize. It existed years before the economy took a tumble in the late 2000s, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

By U.S. Rep. Tom Graves’ reckoning, the federal real estate glut is serious enough to earn his vote on a bill that aims to save tax dollars by streamlining the process to get rid of those properties.

""The federal government owns tens of thousands of properties that are vacant or underused,"" the Ranger Republican said in a March 20 press release announcing his vote.

This number struck your PolitiFact Georgia scribes as high. Hundreds would be well within reason. Thousands? Sure. But tens of thousands?

We asked Graves spokeswoman Jennifer Hazelton for more information. She sent us a link to a February 2011 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, ""Federal Real Property: The Government Faces Challenges to Disposing of Unneeded Buildings.""

""In fiscal year 2009, 24 federal agencies including the Department of Defense reported 45,190 underutilized buildings that cost $1.66 billion annually to operate,"" the report stated.

Underutilized buildings are those that are not being used to their fullest capacity. Some buildings owned by the federal government are even sitting empty.

We cross-checked the data with the General Services Administration, which is often billed as the government’s landlord. According to its yearly property reports, the number of underutilized buildings numbered 43,360 in fiscal year 2008 and 45,190 in fiscal year 2009. These properties were valued at more than $1.6 billion.

The problem of surplus buildings came to the attention of President Barack Obama, who issued a 2010 memorandum directing federal agencies to speed up the process of identifying and getting rid of unneeded space.

Obama aims to save at least $3 billion by fiscal year 2012, but the GAO report raised concerns that he may be unable to meet that goal because the process of selling government buildings is tangled in red tape.

The bill Graves mentioned in his press release would create a pilot program that would streamline the process. The Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act of 2012, or HR 665, passed the U.S. House of Representatives and is before the Senate.

A congressional hearing on the issue took place March 22 -- ironically, on excess federal property.

The 89,000-square-foot Cotton Annex, which is near the National Mall in Washington, has been unoccupied for about five years, according to Republicans on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Its managers said the building remains a moneymaker because the Federal Protective Service is renting it to inspect delivery trucks.

Mike Dovilla says tourism in Ohio accounts for 439,000 jobs as visitors spend $36 billion a year
","
The Ohio Department of Development was in Republican Gov. John Kasich’s crosshairs before he even was elected.

Kasich has never been shy about ripping the department as a sluggish bureaucracy unable to keep pace with the modern business world. Since taking office last year, Kasich has worked to overhaul the department through privatization and other means.

Such dramatic changes have required the help of state lawmakers, and GOP members of the House of Representatives and the Senate have been supportive of Kasich’s plan to reform the department.

GOP lawmakers unveiled legislation – House Bill 489 and its companion, Senate Bill 314 – in March that proposes several new changes to the Department of Development, or what remains of it. The department’s economic development responsibilities last year were transferred to JobsOhio, a private nonprofit corporation that Kasich proposed and lawmakers approved.

A key provision of the new legislation establishes TourismOhio, an agency that would, through a five-year pilot program, replace the department’s tourism division.

State Rep. Mike Dovilla, a Republican from Berea who is a primary sponsor of HB 489, said funding for TourismOhio would be linked to sales-tax revenues from tourism-related industries. Dovilla also talked about the connection between tourism and job creation.

""According to recent figures, tourism accounts for 439,000 jobs in the state of Ohio, and visitors spend $36 billion annually,"" Dovilla said April 12 in a news release from his office announcing TourismOhio.

PolitiFact Ohio thought the robust figures Dovilla cited were worth a look, particularly since Kasich’s overhaul of the Department of Development has been a source of constant skepticism from Democrats from the beginning.

Dovilla’s office pointed us down two paths to back up the figures for jobs and spending. Each however, lead us to the same source. That was Tourism Economics, a subsidiary of Oxford Economics, which is a joint venture that involves Oxford University’s business college and provides economic research and advice international organizations, governments and blue-chip companies. 

The state has hired Tourism Economics to monitor the economic impact of tourism in Ohio for about five years, said Amir Eylon, Ohio’s tourism director. The company is responsible for the estimates Dovilla cited for tourist spending in Ohio and the Ohio jobs supported by tourism. In its report, it notes that the data it collects is cross checked against figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Eylon said Tourism Economics’ economic impact estimates are credible and consistent with other metrics he monitors.

Tourism Economics’ report released in May 2011, ""The Economic Impact of Tourism in Ohio,"" contained the jobs statistic. The report, which measured employment in 2010, said that 326,964 jobs were directly related to tourism while another 112,109 jobs were indirectly linked to tourism. 

Indirect employment figures include jobs that are sustained when tourism-related industries spend money. It also includes jobs that are supported by the spending of workers whose jobs are directly tied to tourism.

Taken together, Ohio tourism supported 439,073 jobs, according to the report. 

The inclusion of indirect jobs for evaluating economic impact is not uncommon, but it’s also one worth explaining since in this case they account for about 26 percent of the jobs involved. The average listener might not realize that the total figure includes not just jobs such as those of hotel workers, but also jobs that rely on the patronage of those hotel workers who spend their wages on items such as gasoline or groceries.

The $36 billion spending figure Dovilla cited is slightly out of date. Tourism Economics provided that figure to Ohio’s tourism division in 2010. More recently, Tourism Economics reported in May 2011 that Ohio tourism generated $38 billion in sales in 2010, up $2 billion from the previous year.

While overall spending increased $2 billion from 2009 to 2010, hotel occupancy increased about 6 percent over that time, and revenue from room sales increased slightly less than 6 percent, according to the Ohio Hotel and Lodging Association.

Dovilla’s statement is accurate. He has accurately cited figures for employment and spending prepared by credible researchers.

And it’s true that the total jobs figure he cited includes 112,109 indirect jobs that are not supported by consumers spending tourism dollars, but rather by the spending habits of the tourism industry and its employees. But inclusion of such indirect jobs is not unusual for assessing economic impact.

Austin school librarian says the school district has 64 dates set aside for state-mandated exams
","
Austin school librarian Sara Stevenson says state-mandated testing occurs too often.

""The Austin school district calendar lists 64 different dates for either a state-mandated test or make-up test,"" Stevenson wrote in an opinion column posted by the Austin American-Statesman on April 4, 2012.

A third of the 180-day school year marked for state-ordered tests or make-ups?

After we asked Stevenson how she reached her count, she said in a telephone interview that she mistakenly counted every test, re-test or make-up on the testing calendar as a separate date when that’s not what the calendar shows.

""I should have said (64) different tests rather than different test dates,"" she said.

Still, there’s a lot of testing, she said.

Stevenson was referring to dates set aside for one of two state-mandated tests behind the state’s long-established mandate that students pass such tests to advance from grade to grade and, ultimately, qualify for a high-school diploma. One exam, the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills, started getting phased out in 2011-12 with the more rigorous State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness taking its place in most grades.

By our count, the Austin district’s calendar shows 34 dates set aside for state-mandated tests or make-up tests from mid-October 2011 through mid-July 2012 when the district has scheduled re-tests for different versions of the TAKS and STAAR.

Mark Billingsley, the district director of systemwide testing, cautioned in a telephone interview against concluding that every student is taking a state-ordered test on 34 different days -- or even any number of days close to that. He said that high-school students, faced with the exit-level TAKS plus end-of-course subject-matter tests, are taking the most state tests.

From Oct. 18, 2011, through July 12, 2012, the calendar lists more than 60 different tests or make-up/re-test opportunities. In March 2012, for instance, the calendar shows 14 possible tests, re-tests or make-ups on nine different dates. Students in some grades could re-take the Mathematics and Science TAKS. Other tests on the month’s calendar include grade-specific STAARs in English, writing, math and reading.

Separately, district spokeswoman Helena Wright pointed out that the state-related testing dates are dictated by the Texas Education Agency, which posts annual student assessment testing calendars. Indeed, the state agency’s 2011-12 state calendar shows almost all the same testing dates as the Austin district’s calendar.

TEA spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe confirmed that every Texas district must give the state tests on the same dates, though she said in a telephone interview that a district may seek permission to test on a different date after, say, a hurricane or other momentous event.

Ratcliffe said the number of testing dates in Texas schools has increased over the years in response to state and federal mandates. But, she said, ""any one kid is only going to spend two to five days a year taking the state tests"" unless he or she fails, in which case re-testing would be possible.

She pointed us to an agency chart, dated March 3, 2011, showing that for the STAAR, the total mandatory testing days in 2011-12 are varying by grade. For  third- and sixth-graders, the number is two days. It’s three days for fifth graders, four days in grades 4, 7 and 8 and five days in grades 9, 10 and 11.

Ratcliffe pointed out another potentially relevant aspect. ""This perception that there’s an excessive amount of testing comes not just from the state tests,"" Ratcliffe said, but also from practice testing that districts undertake to prepare students for the TAKS and STAAR.

More testing dates? We were curious.

To our inquiry, the Austin district shared its 2011-12 schedules for district-level ""benchmark"" assessments. With the exception of brief reading tests given in Kindergarten through second grade, the benchmark tests are not state required.

But they do take up some time, occurring 12 and 25 weeks into the year and at year’s end so teachers learn how well students have absorbed what they have been taught in line with the state’s curriculum, Debra Ready, the district’s executive director of assessment and accountability, told us in a telephone interview. She said, though, that it would be inaccurate to say that the bulk of each test date gets taken up by the tests, which average just 30 to 41 questions each.

The benchmark test schedules indicate that the number of days during which up to two hours would be spent taking the benchmark tests varies by grade, ranging from four days or so for third graders, for instance, to as many as nine days for eighth graders, it appears.

Finally, we did not determine how many, if any, days that Austin schools devote to practice runs of the TAKS and STAAR. By email, district spokeswoman Erin Moore said the district administration does not develop practice versions of those exams. ""However,"" Moore said, ""some campuses may use state-released (test) items to help students feel comfortable before testing begins. This may be done on a campus by campus basis. We do not track this practice.""

Upshot: At Stevenson's request, the Statesman published a correction specifying that the district calendar shows 64 different state-mandated tests, not testing dates.

Our ruling

Austin’s school calendar has about 34 separate state-related testing dates, not 64. Also, many of the state tests are penciled in for the same dates. In addition, significantly, no students are taking tests on all 34 dates or, really, any number of dates close to that.

Still, Stevenson’s claim has an element of truth. According to the district calendar, state-mandated testing was a possibility on at least one day in six of the 10 months from mid-October 2011 through mid-July 2012.

We recently noticed a Facebook post that took Republicans to task for flip-flopping on the individual mandate, the key issue in the Supreme Court case on President Barack Obama's health care law.

""In 1993 the Republicans embraced a health platform that proudly features an individual mandate as its main component,"" the Facebook post says. ""(Newt) Gingrich argued for individual mandate in 2008. (Mitt) Romney urged Obama to embrace individual mandate in 2009. But now that it’s a Democratic health plan the Republicans want to vilify, decry, demonized this very thing that they invented.""

The post, by a group called Americans Against the Tea Party, includes photographs of four Republican senators from that era, with favorable quotes about the individual mandate, the requirement that individuals and families buy health insurance. The four senators pictured are John Chafee of Rhode Island, Robert Dole of Kansas, Kit Bond of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma.

The post makes a number of claims, but we decided to focus on this one: ""In 1993 the Republicans embraced a health platform that proudly features an individual mandate as its main component.""

That would be remarkable because the Republicans have focused much of their opposition on the mandate, portraying it as a dramatic expansion of government by bureaucracy-loving Democrats.

To find out if that's true, we have to go back to the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton was trying to get Congress to pass an overhaul of the health care system.

Legislative proposals

As we noted in an earlier item, the Clinton plan included a different kind of health insurance mandate -- one on employers requiring they provide coverage for their workers. That approach worried some Republicans and conservative Democrats, and some of the critics instead backed alternatives to the Clinton option.

In 1993, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., introduced the Health Equity and Access Reform Today (HEART) Act of 1993, which included a requirement that individuals purchase health insurance. That provision was to take effect on Jan. 1, 2005 -- more than a decade after the bill would have been enacted.

The bill never made it even to the hearing stage. But Chafee continued to push for an alternative to the Clinton option.

In mid 1994, he and a fellow member of the Senate Finance Committee -- conservative Democrat John Breaux of Louisiana -- worked on a new version that also would have required all Americans to buy insurance.
   
According to a New York Times account, the bill would have imposed an individual mandate in 2002 only if ""other methods to spread health insurance had not led to either 95 percent or 96 percent of the American people's being insured.""

We did not find the Chafee-Breaux bill in the THOMAS database of congressional legislation, so it apparently did not receive a formal vote. (Clinton, it should be noted, also failed to win passage of his plan.)

How widespread was Republican support?

So yes, there was legislation that included a mandate -- a bill by Chafee and a subsequent proposal by Chafee and Breaux. But was the support extensive enough to say, as the Facebook post does, that ""the Republicans embraced a health platform"" that featured the individual mandate?

The HEART Act attracted 19 Republicans as sponsors or co-sponsors, including Chafee, Bond and Dole, who was then the Senate minority leader, plus a number of ranking Republicans on Senate committees -- Mark Hatfield of Oregon (appropriations), Pete Domenici of New Mexico (budget), John Danforth of Missouri (commerce), Orrin Hatch of Utah (judiciary) and Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas (labor and human resources).

Nineteen Republicans is not a trivial number, and the fact that many members of the Senate Republican leadership signed on is noteworthy. Still, 19 represented less than half of the GOP conference at the time, and the list of co-sponsors includes many of the party’s moderates. The idea was less popular among conservatives in the party. For instance, Nickles, one of the four pictured in the Facebook post, was not a co-sponsor.

The Times, in a June 23, 1994, story on the later Chafee effort, called it the ""moderates’"" proposal. The newspaper reported that Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one of the GOP’s leading conservatives, said that any plan that ""got his support and that of most Republicans"" would not ""guarantee anything."" And not having a guarantee of coverage would have meant not having an individual mandate.

This jibes with the recollections of Gail Wilensky, a health care economist at Project HOPE, an international health foundation. Wilensky directed Medicare and Medicaid from 1990 to 1992 and served as a senior health adviser to President George H.W. Bush.

""I do not remember Republicans, especially conservative Republicans, embracing individual mandates,"" Wilensky said.

Did the Chafee proposal ""proudly"" feature the individual mandate ""as its main component""?

This part is doubtful. As indicated, the mandate didn't start until at least eight years years after enactment -- double the four-year lag in Obama’s law.

And while Obama’s mandate is envisioned as a permanent feature of the law, the Chafee/Breaux version was seen as a tool that may never need to be used at all. It would only come into effect if other mechanisms failed to insure a target percentage of the U.S. population.

As the Times reported, ""Breaux said he believed that the individual mandate might never come into effect, because a commission to administer the plan would make regular recommendations on how to increase the number of Americans with health insurance. As a result, he said, it would not be necessary to rely on a mandate.""

Role reversal

Further complicating the Facebook post’s one-sided story line is that some of the individual mandate’s biggest opposition at the same time came from … Democrats.

""The idea of requiring people to buy their own health insurance drew criticism from liberal Democrats,"" the Times wrote. ""Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota said it did little to help people who lacked the money for insurance. In the House, Representative Vic Fazio, the Californian who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, sent a memorandum to other House Democrats today criticizing what he called the Republican idea of the individual mandate. Mr. Fazio urged Democrats to work against the individual mandate and in favor of a bill requiring employers to insure their workers. He said they would be rewarded in the November elections once voters saw that Republicans were more interested in helping business and the wealthy and were ‘selling out the middle class.’""

All told, there’s ""lots of hypocrisy to go around in terms of consistency of positions today with those of 20 years ago,"" said Mark V. Pauly, a professor of health care management at the Wharton School of Business who has informally provided advice on health care policy to the administrations of both Obama and George H.W. Bush.

Our ruling

It would be accurate to say that a number of Republicans -- including several high-profile senators -- supported a bill or a subsequent proposal that included an individual mandate provision. But the Facebook post exaggerates when it says that ""the Republicans embraced"" the idea, a phrasing that suggests widespread support inside the party. Less than half the Senate Republican conference went public in support of Chafee’s bill, most of them from the party’s more moderate wing.

The Facebook post also stumbles when it says the proposals in question ""proudly"" featured the individual mandate ""as its main component."" The mandate was a mechanism that would have taken effect from eight to 11 years after enactment, and only if other policies failed to expand insurance coverage enough. Breaux, the bill’s co-sponsor, suggested that it may never need to be put into effect at all. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A45B280>],/factchecks/2012/apr/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-republicans-embraced-individual/

Confiscating US billionaires’ wealth would run the US government about 8 months
","Around the time Democrats briefly considered a proposed ""billionaires tax,"" a two-year-old Facebook post resurfaced claiming that even if all the wealth of the nation’s billionaires were seized, it wouldn’t run the federal government for very long. ""The 550 US billionaires together are worth $2.5 trillion,"" said a viral image with the post. ""If we confiscated 100% of their wealth, we'd raise enough to run the federal government for less than 8 months. Perhaps our problem isn’t how much billionaires have but how much politicians spend."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The figures in the 2019 post are not currently accurate for the number of billionaires and their total wealth. But current estimates and spending figures indicate the billionaires’ total wealth would be enough to cover government spending for about eight months.  The viral image is a Feb. 1, 2019, tweet by Antony Davies, an economics professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and a fellow with the free-market Foundation for Economic Education.  At the time, Check Your Fact found that the billionaires’ wealth would have covered about nine months of spending, not less than eight months. So, what do the latest figures show? Estimates put the total wealth of America’s billionaires at $5 trillion, while the federal government spent nearly $7 trillion in the fiscal 2021, which ended Sept. 30. Here are the breakdowns. With its 2021 list of world billionaires, Forbes estimated there were 724 U.S. billionaires as of March 5, the most in any one nation, worth a total of $4.4 trillion.  More recently, the Institute for Policy Studies estimated that as of Oct. 15 there were 745 U.S. billionaires, together worth slightly more than $5 trillion. That’s a 70% collective increase in fortune since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak on March 18, 2020, according to the institute. As for the federal government, it spent $6.82 trillion in fiscal 2021, which ended Sept. 30, according to the Treasury Department. That’s the figure the Institute for Policy Studies and the Tax Foundation referred us to when we asked about the claim we’re checking.  We also reached out to Davies, noting that we’re checking the accuracy of the Facebook post currently being circulated. He pointed us to the Institute for Policy Studies as well and cited the fiscal 2022 budget, which lists $7.25 trillion in outlays for fiscal 2021. So, in round numbers: The government spends $7 trillion in a year — or about $19 billion per day. Tapping the billionaires’ $5 trillion would pay for about 263 days of federal government spending — or more than eight months. There are some caveats.  Primarily, no one is suggesting a 100% tax. But Chuck Collins, director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, said billionaires have seen their effective tax rates go down compared to the average taxpayer, ""so surely billionaires can pay more.""  Davies, the author of the original post, told PolitiFact that even if there were an effort to confiscate all of the billionaires’ wealth, it would actually net less than eight months’ worth of revenue because very little of the wealth is in cash. Billionaires would have to liquidate their stocks, bonds, land and other assets in order to pay the tax and if they did so, it would drive down stock and bond prices and the prices of buildings and land, and in turn, generate less than $5 trillion, ""possibly a lot less."" Alex Muresianu, a federal policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said the claim is ""a useful illustration of the problems with comparing what would be a one-time revenue increase for the government as a way to pay for expenses that recur every year."" A 2019 viral image newly reshared on Facebook claimed: ""The 550 U.S. billionaires together are worth $2.5 trillion. If we confiscated 100% of their wealth, we'd raise enough to run the federal government for less than eight months."" The two figures are out of date, but the thrust of the claim is accurate: The estimated $5 trillion in wealth of the nation’s billionaires is enough to cover about eight months’ worth of federal spending.

Claim that spike proteins will cause illness to spread like wildfires in kids is False
","On Oct. 29, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. In anticipation of this announcement, an Instagram post warned parents that children who receive COVID-19 vaccinations will become ""walking factories of spike proteins"" and ""cause illnesses to spread like wildfire in schools.""  We have previously fact-checked other claims about the safety of the spike protein that the COVID-19 vaccine instructs the body to generate in order to trigger an immune response. Each of these fact-checks concluded that there is no evidence that spike proteins are toxic or pose any serious health risk. We were curious if this still applies to younger age groups. There is also no evidence to support the claim that the COVID-19 vaccine causes the body to continuously produce infectious spike bodies in children.  COVID-19 is more likely to spread in schools when children are not vaccinated. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  COVID-19 mRNA vaccines function similarly in children as they do in adults. The vaccine delivers instructions, or mRNA, to the body on how to make the spike protein that the COVID-19 virus uses to bind to cells. When a cell receives these instructions, it creates and displays the spike protein on its surface like a flag. Exposing the immune system to this flag primes it to recognize the spike protein on the COVID-19 virus and mount an attack. Spike proteins produced by the body's cells are harmless and do not cause illness or infection. Nor do these spike proteins last long in the body. mRNA, the instructions that teach the body how to make the spike protein, is fragile and degrades within a few days. ""Since our cells are continuously producing proteins, mRNA is broken down fairly quickly by normal body processes,"" said Dr. Hank Bernstein, pediatrician and member of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, in a video for the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. After mRNA degrades, it can no longer instruct the body to produce spike proteins. Though the vaccine dosage for children ages 5 to 11 is a third of that given to those 12 and up, data from the Pfizer study shows that its vaccine is 90.7% effective at preventing COVID-19, with similar safety levels and side effects as older age groups.  Children may be less likely to die from COVID-19, but they are not immune to infection. There have been over 1.9 million COVID-19 cases in U.S. children ages 5 to 11. As of the week ending Oct. 21, 2021, U.S. children comprised a quarter of reported weekly COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 has also been among the top 10 leading causes of death for U.S. children in 2021. An Instagram post claims that children who receive COVID-19 vaccinations ""will be walking factories of spike proteins"" that will ""undoubtedly cause illnesses to spread like wildfire in schools."" The spike proteins generated by the body through vaccination are neither infectious nor continuously generated in children and adults.  We rate the claim False.

Yes, five abortion restrictions that took away services passed under Kleefisch and Walker
","Even before Texas lawmakers made headlines by effectively banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, statehouses across the country were setting up to tighten abortion restrictions in other ways.  Buoyed by a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court, states have enacted more than 100 such restrictions as of early October, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access. Experts say the new laws could be aimed at directly challenging Roe v. Wade, which was decided in 1973.  Such restrictions have been blocked in Wisconsin in recent years by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has vetoed a handful of abortion bills that made their way to his desk since he took office in 2019.  But former Lt. Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, a Republican challenging Evers in 2022, has made it clear she’ll do the opposite if elected.  Kleefisch told a conservative radio host in September that she would sign a bill that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. (That breaks with former Gov. Scott Walker, who signaled at the end of his term that he would not ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.) State Sen. Kelda Roys, D-Madison, sought to bring up Kleefisch’s past record on abortion under Walker, even though at the time it didn’t include that specific bill.  In a Sept. 28, 2021 fundraising email, Roys wrote that ""Wisconsin cannot become the next Texas"" under Kleefisch as governor.  ""Rebecca Kleefisch worked with Scott Walker to sign five abortion restrictions into law that took away services and threatened doctors with prison time for providing safe and legal abortions,"" she wrote.  Is Roys right?  Roys’ office pointed to five laws passed during the Walker administration that involved abortion:  A 2015 law that banned abortions after 20 weeks, with no exceptions made for fatal fetal anomalies or for victims of rape or incest. A 2012 law that prohibited giving an abortion-inducing drug to a pregnant person unless the physician who prescribed the drug gives the person a physical exam and is physically present when the drug is given. A 2012 law that prohibited insurance plans offered in Wisconsin under the Affordable Care Act from covering some abortions. A 2013 law requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges. A 2011 budget provision that prohibited abortion providers from receiving funding from state family planning grants funded with state and federal money.  It’s clear that these laws took away abortion services by limiting when, how and where people could obtain abortions. Many of them were aimed at reducing the capacity of Planned Parenthood. The 2011 funding cut also ended up taking away health care services that weren’t abortion-related by forcing the closure of Planned Parenthood clinics in Beaver Dam, Johnson Creek, Chippewa Falls and Shawano. At the time, Planned Parenthood officials said those centers did not perform abortions but did provide people with check-ups, screenings and access to birth control.  (It’s also worth noting that the law about hospital admitting privileges, which would have cut in half the number of abortion providers in the state, was ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals court two years later.) What about Roys’ point about prison time for doctors who provided abortions?  Walker’s 2015 bill banning abortion after 20 weeks made performing the procedure after that point a felony punishable by up to three and a half years in prison. Anti-abortion advocates say the fetus can feel pain during the procedure at 20 weeks; the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reports that painful touch cannot be distinguished until late in the third trimester. To be sure, it was Walker signing the bills into law, not Kleefisch.  But the former lieutenant governor has long been part of the anti-abortion movement. She earned the endorsements of Wisconsin anti-abortion groups when she ran for lieutenant governor for the first time in 2010. And during the 2012 recall election, she was endorsed by the Susan B. Anthony List Candidate Fund, a national anti-abortion political action committee.  In that endorsement, the Susan B. Anthony List president thanked Kleefisch for her leadership alongside Walker and the Legislature in defunding Planned Parenthood of more than $1 million dollars.  Roys said Kleefisch worked with Walker to pass five abortion restrictions that took away services and threatened abortion providers with prison time.  The five rules did restrict abortion services, and one carried a punishment of prison time. Though Kleefisch did not herself sign them into law, she’s been credited with helping to push them through.  We rate this claim True.     ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AAAC00>],/factchecks/2021/nov/02/kelda-helen-roys/yes-five-abortion-restrictions-took-away-services-/

No, the National Guard isn’t replacing a city’s unvaccinated police officers
","Cities across the United States have implemented vaccine mandates for public employees as a means to help control the spread of COVID-19. But one group of public workers has continuously fought against such mandates — law enforcement officers. Scores of law enforcement personnel across the country have resisted calls to take the vaccine, even as COVID-19 has become the leading cause of death among officers. This resistance led some in law enforcement to sue their cities over the vaccine requirements and, in some cases, to resign. One Instagram post purports to show a screenshot from a news article that claimed the National Guard will be brought in to replace officers who do not get the COVID-19 vaccine. The screenshot is of the article's headline, ""National Guard to fill in for cops who refuse to get vaccinated,"" and appears to be written by Joshua Rhett Miller and published on Oct. 20. A photo of what appears to be a group of National Guard troops wearing face-coverings and walking through Times Square in New York City is included with the screenshot.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

There have not been any instances of a state’s National Guard mobilizing to replace a city’s law enforcement officers because of a COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The closest has been Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who offered to marshal state resources, including the National Guard, to help the city of Chicago as the police union urged its members to not get vaccinated. Chicago officials have yet to accept Pritzker’s offer. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also outlined a plan where medically trained troops of the state’s National Guard could be brought in to take over for hospital employees who violate the state's vaccine mandate for healthcare workers. It has yet to be implemented. An Instagram post shared the headline of a supposed news article that claims National Guard troops will replace law enforcement officers who refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The headline itself is vague and the post did not offer any additional details.

Fairfax County, Va., lawsuit involved absentee-ballot applications, not ballots
","With polls of the Virginia gubernatorial race showing a nailbiter on the eve of the election, some social media users shared assertions of election fraud before any votes had even been counted. The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, published an article on Oct. 30 headlined, ""Another Virginia Election, Another Election Steal – Virginia’s Fairfax County Reportedly Not Requiring Last Four Digits of SSN’s on Absentee Ballots."" The story went on to assert that ""Fairfax County is not requiring the last four digits of Social Security Numbers on absentee ballots in this election."" However, this is a garbled and incorrect reading of a lawsuit filed in the closing days of the race. Most importantly, absentee ballots were not called into question; applications for absentee ballots were. (Gateway Pundit did not reply to an inquiry for this article.) The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Virginia Institute for Public Policy, a conservative group, filed a lawsuit in Fairfax County court on Oct. 20. It alleged that Fairfax County — a populous and, in recent elections, Democratic-leaning county in suburban Washington, D.C. — was breaking a provision of Virginia law that requires that absentee ballot applications include the final four digits of the applicant’s Social Security number. Before we go any further, it’s important to note that, despite the assertion in the Gateway Pundit, the suit addressed absentee ballot applications, not absentee ballots.  In fact, there is no requirement for any part of a Social Security number on actual absentee ballots being cast. By law, absentee ballots from any county or jurisdiction in Virginia must include the voter’s name, address, signature, and a witness’ signature. (If there is a problem with any of these elements, a voter can officially clarify, or ""cure,"" the mistake with an elections office through the first Friday following the election.) As for the lawsuit, it’s a bit more complicated. On Oct. 29, the Friday before Election Day, Fairfax County Circuit Judge Michael Devine dismissed the case on procedural grounds, namely that the Virginia Institute for Public Policy didn’t have ""standing"" to file a lawsuit because it couldn’t show direct harm. (A formal ruling was unavailable on Nov. 1, the court told PolitiFact, but WTOP radio reported the ruling based on a journalist who was in the courtroom at the time, and neither side in the case challenged this characterization.) Because the case was dismissed on procedural grounds, the substance of either side’s arguments were not resolved. However, here’s a rundown of what each side argued. The plaintiffs pointed to a provision of Virginia law that says that absentee ballot applications ""shall"" include ""the applicant's printed name and the last four digits of the applicant's Social Security number."" ""When absentee ballots are sent to the wrong individuals, it leads to disenfranchisement,"" said Lauren Bowman, a spokesperson for the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which represented the Virginia Institute for Public Policy.  In its legal response, Fairfax County's election office countered with a different provision of state law that says, ""In reviewing the application for an absentee ballot, the general registrar shall not reject the application of any individual because of an error or omission on any record or paper relating to the application, if such error or omission is not material in determining whether such individual is qualified to vote absentee."" The county argued that the registrar has some discretion in what is considered material. The county office ""need not rely on SSN information for identity verification when Defendant can verify the applicant's name or address and compare his or her signature to the voter's signature on file within the registrar's office,"" its legal filing argued. In a legal document, the county stipulated to having approved some absentee ballot applications this year in cases where the last four digits of a Social Security number was missing. (The stipulation document never made it into the official court record because the case was dismissed before the merits of the suit were considered.) Scott O. Konopasek, the director of elections for Fairfax County, told PolitiFact that 652 applications were approved without inclusion of the four Social Security digits. But Konopasek argued that those approvals were permitted. ""The allegation in the suit was that we were issuing ballots to people who were not entitled to get a ballot because they left the Social Security number blocks blank,"" he said. ""But we determine people’s eligibility to vote every day. When we looked at their address, their name, and their signature, they matched. We knew they were who they said they were without having the Social Security numbers."" The article said that ""Fairfax County is not requiring the last four digits of Social Security Numbers on absentee ballots in this election."" The article garbled the nature of a lawsuit against Fairfax County’s elections office. Under state law, absentee ballots do not require Social Security numbers when they are cast. Instead, the lawsuit challenged voter applications to secure an absentee ballot, rather than the ballots themselves. Fairfax County acknowledges approving some absentee ballot requests that did not include partial Social Security numbers, as long as the applicant’s identity could be confirmed through other information. The county argues that this is within its discretion under the law, while the plaintiffs who filed the suit say the county can’t go around the Social Security number requirement in the law. A county court dismissed the case on procedural grounds before deciding whether the plaintiffs or the defendants had the law on their side. This claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Virginia Democratic party, McAuliffe campaign not involved in white supremacist stunt
","In the closing days of Virginia’s governor race, a group of people carrying tiki torches and wearing white shirts, khaki pants and baseball caps stood outside the bus for Glenn Youngkin, the state’s Republican gubernatorial candidate, at a campaign stop in Charlottesville. The Oct. 29 demonstration, aimed at mimicking torch-carrying white supremacists who came to the city in 2017 for a Unite the Right rally, drew condemnation from both political parties and speculation over who was behind the stunt.  ""All reports are indicating that Virginia Democrat operatives dressed up as white supremacists and stood by Youngkin’s bus,"" one Facebook post claimed that day. ""It’s clear McAuliffe’s campaign is spiraling out of control and they are resorting to last ditch efforts to sneak out a win. These racist acts by the Dems are despicable and this should be covered by the media."" While we don’t know the identities of the people involved, we can clarify who organized them. It wasn’t the Democratic Party of Virginia or the campaign for Youngkin’s Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe. It was the Lincoln Project, a Republican group that actively opposed the re-election campaign of former President Donald Trump.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Shortly after people started pointing fingers over the Youngkin campaign trail incident, the Lincoln Project took responsibility for the demonstration. The stunt came during the second day of the civil trial against far-right extremists associated with the 2017 rally, which ended with a man driving a car through a crowd, killing one woman.  After images of the five people in front of Youngkin’s bus started to circulate on social media — with some reports stating that the group chanted ""we’re all in for Glenn"" — McAuliffe staffers attacked Youngkin over it, suggesting that the images showed Youngkin’s supporters. The Youngkin campaign, in turn, claimed the McAuliffe campaign or the Democratic Party of Virginia were involved.  That’s around the time when the Lincoln Project released a statement. ""Today’s demonstration was our way of reminding Virginians what happened in Charlottesville four years ago, the Republican Party’s embrace of those values, and Glenn Youngkin’s failure to condemn it,"" the statement said.  McAuliffe’s campaign disavowed the stunt that evening, calling it ""distasteful."" ""What happened today in Charlottesville is disgusting and distasteful and the McAuliffe campaign condemns it in the strongest terms,"" campaign manager Chirs Bolling said in a tweet. ""Those involved should immediately apologize."" What happened today in Charlottesville is disgusting and distasteful and the McAuliffe campaign condemns it in the strongest terms. Those involved should immediately apologize. The Democratic Party of Virginia also issued a statement on Twitter, saying neither the party nor its ""coordinated partners and affiliates"" had anything to do with the demonstration. ""What happened in Charlottesville four years ago was a tragedy and one of the darkest moments in our state’s recent memories and is an event not to be taken lightly,"" read the statement shared by the party’s executive director, Andrew Whitley.

During the 2020 presidential election, the Lincoln Project aimed to prevent the re-election of Trump. Today, it prioritizes attacks on Trump-aligned Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, and candidates like Youngkin. The group also supports these candidates’ Democratic challengers. In Virginia, records show it spent $17,100 on pro-McAuliffe efforts and just over $304,000 on anti-Youngkin campaigns.  While the group was founded by former Republican staffers, most of its leadership doesn’t align with the party anymore, with many registered as Independents. Facebook posts claim that a group of people who dressed up as white supremacists at Youngkin’s campaign stop in Charlottesville was a political set-up by ""Virginia Democrat operatives"" and McAuliffe’s campaign. This is inaccurate. The Lincoln Project, a group founded by anti-Trump Republican consultants, assumed responsiblity for the stunt and said that neither McAuliffe’s campaign nor the state’s Democratic party were involved.

Biden administration not planning an international committee to oversee US gun rights
","A TikTok post announced ""urgent news"" about the Second Amendment, using colorful GIFs and graphics to make the case that President Joe Biden is planning to give foreign officials a say in the Second Amendment rights of Americans. ""In short, the Biden administration wants to create an international oversight committee to watch America and decide whether or not our Second Amendment rights need to be altered or even cancelled,"" the TikTok user narrates. ""Since when did foreign officials have a say over the American people?""  TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) ##patriot ##freedom ##nwo ##gun ##2ndadmendment ##hunter ##conspiracy The video shows a letter addressed to Biden by a group of Republican senators. One thing to note: The letter did not make the same claim as the video. The group wrote in asking for clarification about a statement from William Malzahn, the deputy director for the Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction, which is part of the State Department. Malzahn spoke at the Seventh Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty in early September. The senators said that during his statement, Malzahn indicated the Biden administration’s intention to rejoin the United Nations’ Arms Trade Treaty.  The treaty regulates international trade of small arms like rifles and pistols, battle tanks, combat aircraft and warships. The Arms Control Association wrote that it ""requires all states-parties to adopt basic regulations and approval processes for the flow of weapons across international borders,"" among other requirements. In 2013 under the Obama administration, the United States signed the Arms Trade Treaty, but the Senate never ratified it. In 2019, former President Donald Trump ""unsigned"" the treaty in front of a crowd at an annual National Rifle Association convention, an organization that has been against the treaty for years based on their stance that it could affect American gun owners. The Republican senators pointed out a particular sentence in Malzahn’s statement. Malzahn said, ""The United States has long supported strong and effective national controls on the international transfer of conventional arms, and the Arms Trade Treaty is an important tool for promoting those controls internationally.""  ""We find this statement to be most concerning and contrary to the current and historical position of the United States,"" the senators wrote. While the TikTok claim that the Biden administration wants to create an international oversight committee is based on this letter, that doesn’t mean it’s accurate. PolitiFact reached out to the office of Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., who along with other senators signed the letter. A spokesperson for Marshall’s office said the letter does not accuse the Biden administration of trying to create an international committee to oversee Second Amendment rights, but simply asked for clarification if Biden intends to join the treaty. The White House also told PolitiFact that the TikTok claim is wrong.  A State Department spokesperson said the Arms Trade Treaty regulates the international trade of conventional arms — not domestic trade or possession. In his remarks, Malzahn said that the Biden administration is going to finalize the U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, which was revised during both the Obama and Trump administrations.  ""President Biden has made clear that diplomacy and human rights are at the center of U.S. foreign policy,"" Malzahn said in his remarks. ""We believe it’s important to publicly reflect these changes in a new CAT Policy, so we have been working to revise the policy to reflect the new administration’s priorities.""  Malzahn then said when the policy is finalized and released, the U.S. will then address other arms transfer issues, like determining its relationship with the Arms Trade Treaty. But those remarks don’t mean that a decision has already been made to join the treaty — simply that a review of that relationship is going to happen, said the State Department spokesperson.   A TikTok post claimed that the Biden administration wants to create an international oversight committee to oversee U.S. Second Amendment rights and decide if they need to be altered or cancelled. The claim stems from a letter that Republican senators addressed to Biden asking for clarification of comments during a United Nations conference from a State Department official. The senators said these comments indicated that the Biden administration would rejoin the Arms Trade Treaty, which they were concerned could impede American gun owners’ rights. But the letter was not accusing the Biden administration of creating an international oversight committee to regulate U.S. gun rights. The White House affirmed that the creation of such a committee is not in the works.

No evidence that masks cause dangerous carbon dioxide buildup for children
","A Facebook post alluding to COVID-19 carried this admonishment:  ""WARNING UNMASK YOUR KIDS! Any Carbon Dioxide concentrations above 2000ppm is dangerous!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that masks endanger children by trapping carbon dioxide. As evidence for its claim, the Facebook post shares a minute-long TikTok video that purports to show a handheld device measuring carbon dioxide levels inside a paper medical mask being worn by a young girl.  At one point, the readings exceeded 7,100, according to a woman in the video, who adds: ""Remember, anything above 2,000 is unacceptable."" It’s not clear in this claim what 2,000 parts per million refers to, but this is the latest in a series of claims made with demonstrations that don’t actually show what they claim to show.  Here’s what we know based in part from our latest check, on a claim that a similar demonstration with an oxygen sensor  shows that cloth masks are dangerous for children, which we rated False: The air we breathe is made up of about 78% nitrogen by volume, 21% oxygen and much smaller amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and other gases. Kirsten Koehler, an environmental health and engineering professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the kind of sensor seen in this video is not suited to do what the demonstrator suggests its measuring.  ""As with the concentration of O2, the concentration of CO2 in the air in the mask will be changing dramatically, very rapidly with each breath,"" Koehler said. ""These types of sensors are not able to respond to these changes."" The result is that what the sensor measures is not accurate for either inhaled or exhaled air. ""If masks were really dangerous, you would expect to see changes in the oxygen saturation of blood,"" she said. ""However, as numerous videos online and several peer-reviewed publications show, oxygen saturation in blood does not change when wearing a mask, even when exercising."" Biology professor Benjamin Neuman, chief virologist at Texas A&M University’s Global Health Research Complex, said such tests — holding a device just inside a child’s mask — do not tell the difference between exhaled air, which is high in carbon dioxide, from inhaled air, which is low in carbon dioxide, because the monitor is under the mask where the child is both inhaling and exhaling. Holding a meter up to exhaled air would give the result shown. But the mask is porous, and most of the air for each new breath comes in through the mask."" A more accurate way to assess the effect of a mask on oxygen flow is to analyze a blood sample, Neuman said. Or, ""a reasonable do-it-yourself test would be to wear a pulse oximeter while wearing a mask or not wearing a mask for longer periods of time, perhaps half an hour each, and then compare oxygen saturation levels."" The test would have to be repeated several times to get an accurate reading. ""Fortunately, this work has already been done quite carefully in several papers, which demonstrated no significant drop in oxygen content or rise in carbon dioxide content when wearing a mask,"" Neuman said. PolitiFact reporting has found that science shows mask-wearing is largely safe for children.  Scientists have found little evidence that the kind of masks worn by students negatively affect oxygen or carbon dioxide levels, and they say that contamination levels on masks are no worse than on other common objects.  The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency, according to the World Health Organization. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: ""Wearing a mask does not raise the carbon dioxide (CO2) level in the air you breathe. Cloth masks and surgical masks do not provide an airtight fit across the face. The CO2 escapes into the air through the mask when you breathe out or talk. CO2 molecules are small enough to easily pass through mask material. In contrast, the respiratory droplets that carry the virus that causes COVID-19 are much larger than CO2, so they cannot pass as easily through a properly designed and properly worn mask."" Babak Javid, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco, told PolitiFact that the issue ""has been convincingly debunked.""  A Facebook post claimed: ""Unmask your kids! Any carbon dioxide concentrations above"" 2,000 parts per million are ""dangerous!"" There is no evidence that children’s health is endangered by a buildup of carbon dioxide caused by masks.

No, migrant ‘caravan’ from Tapachula, Mexico is not the population of Minneapolis
","A Republican congresswoman from east central Illinois took aim at President Joe Biden’s immigration policies by claiming hundreds of thousands of migrants are preparing to cross the nation’s southern border. ""The Biden-Harris caravan is the population of Minneapolis and will enter our country with no vetting, no criminal background checks, no COVID testing, and no vaccine requirements,"" freshman U.S. Rep. Mary Miller of downstate Oakland tweeted on Oct. 23 atop a video showing a large group of migrants marching from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula. The Biden-Harris caravan is the population of Minneapolis and will enter our country with no vetting, no criminal background checks, no COVID testing, and no vaccine requirements. https://t.co/63e5dOUfxI PolitiFact has debunked numerous claims from others that were part of Miller’s statement, including that the Biden administration would allow anyone to cross the border or skip COVID testing and other public safety measures. So we decided to focus this fact-check on Miller’s claim about the size of the recent Tapachula group. Minneapolis, Minn., is home to nearly 430,000 people, according to the U.S. Census, while the highest estimate we found for the group leaving Tapachula was less than 1% of that total. The congresswoman, who took office in January, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The migrants featured in the video Miller shared set out on Oct. 23 from Tapachula, a city near the Mexico-Guatemala border where tens of thousands of Central Americans and Haitians have been waiting for Mexican authorities to process their asylum claims and permit them to move freely around the country. Reports from news outlets covering the trek have included estimates ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 migrants, including as many as 1,000 children. None of the experts we contacted had seen any estimates on par with Miller’s comparison. ""This is an exaggeration designed to scare people into believing that we are experiencing an ‘invasion’ at the southern border in an attempt to advance anti-immigrant and anti-asylum policies,"" said Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. Arrests of undocumented migrants along the Mexico border reached a record high of nearly 1.7 million from October 2020 through September 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data first reported by The Washington Post. Neither Miller’s tweet nor the video she shared make any reference to total border apprehensions, however. ""It would be fair to say that the number of people encountered at the border was equal to several times Minneapolis’ population,"" said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for low immigration levels. ""But no one caravan could be that size."" As attempts by migrants to cross the border rise, Biden has faced increased criticism from Republicans for overturning some of former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, as well as from migrant advocates for his administration’s continuation of an emergency health provision invoked under Trump to quickly expel migrants during the pandemic. Similar, though larger, caravans also marched through Mexico in 2018 and 2019, according to The Associated Press. Miller claimed the migrant caravan that set off from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula is ""the population of Minneapolis."" Minneapolis has nearly 430,000 residents, while the highest estimate we could find for the group leaving Tapachula was just under 1% of that total. We rate Miller’s claim Pants on Fire!

No evidence that Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine causes blood clots
","An Instagram post that uses excerpts from an interview on Infowars, a conspiracy oriented website run by Alex Jones, claims that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine causes blood clotting ""in a minute or two."" In the interview, a doctor says he added the Pfizer vaccine to human blood and that, using a microscope, within ""a minute or two, you see the blood starts to clot."" Excerpts from the interview were shared in an Instagram post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that the Pfizer vaccine causes blood clots. ""I am not aware of any causally related clotting problem with either"" the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines, which are known as  mRNA vaccines, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, a professor in the infectious diseases division at Emory University’s School of Medicine and associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center. ""I am also not aware of any information published in the medical literature about clotting problems with the mRNA vaccines."" We previously reported that a serious syndrome involving blood clots known as TTS is associated with the third COVID-19 vaccine being administered in the United States, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is a ""plausible causal relationship"" between that vaccine and TTS. The phenomenon is exceedingly rare: More than 15 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been given in the U.S., with 47 confirmed reports of people who later developed TTS. ​​No increased risk of TTS has been detected with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, according to the CDC. The messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology used to create the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use the human body’s natural immune response to their advantage. The shots give cells the directions for how to make a harmless spike protein. Such spike proteins are found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 — and it is these proteins that the virus uses to bind to cells. The immune system of a person who receives the mRNA vaccine then spots the unknown protein and makes antibodies to fight it.  Dr. Shruti Gohil, professor of infectious diseases at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, noted that ""platelets and other clotting factors are naturally in our blood to help us stop bleeding when we get injured, so blood clots very easily naturally, unless you do something to make it not clot. ""For example, even exposure to air will make your blood clot.  In fact, when we draw blood for testing we have to have special tubes with chemicals in them to keep your blood from clotting.""

Japan is still vaccinating people against COVID-19
","Following a summertime surge, Japan’s COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have quickly plummeted, and while experts say vaccines were key to the turnaround, false claims say the opposite.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Japan did not stop its COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The day after the claim was published, the country administered nearly 600,000 COVID-19 vaccines. And ivermectin is not approved by the Japanese government as a medicine to treat COVID-19. Japan’s vaccine rollout was very slow compared with the United States and Britain, with vaccination of those over age 65 beginning in mid-April and most people under age 65 not becoming eligible for vaccination until June 21. The rollout also hit road bumps, making headlines when a batch of Moderna vaccine had to be recalled because of contamination. But Japan’s vaccination rate now has surpassed both the U.S. and Britain. As of Oct. 28, 71% of Japan’s population had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, a rate that puts it among the top three in the Group of Seven nations. In the past two months, Japan has seen COVID-19 cases drop from a high of more than 20,000 a day in August to about 300 per day in late October. As of Oct. 13, the country had 4 cases per 100,000 people. Hospitalizations are now around 3,000 after hitting a high of more than 230,000 in August.

Posts about Virginia voters being forced to sign forms at polls distort state election protocols
","People worried about election fraud or election errors in Virginia’s governor’s race are claiming that voters were being turned away and told they requested absentee ballots when they didn’t. The claim is attributed to a man named Patrick M. Byrne, the CEO of a nonprofit called The America Project, which says it supports election integrity and that it hopes ""patriots around the country who are concerned about the integrity of our elections will rise up and contribute to the cause.""  In the post, Byrne appears to be re-sharing a story on Telegram about an unidentified man and his wife who claim that, in order to vote, they were forced to sign an affidavit that said they lost their absentee ballots when they didn’t request them in the first place. The message has since been replicated on other social media platforms. It starts off the ""Word from Virginia"" before launching into the alleged account. ""My wife and I went for early voting in Virginia today, and something very disturbing happened,"" the post says. ""We were both told we couldn't vote since we had requested and been sent absentee ballots. Since we had done nothing of the sort, we raised hell and they finally produced affidavits we could sign saying that we had lost the ballots we requested. We demanded affidavits saying that we had never requested absentee ballots and absentee ballots had never been received by us. We were told there was no such thing. We could either sign the affidavits saying we had lost the ballots we had requested or go home without voting. We signed. ""During the time we were there and engaged in this dispute, a matter of about 15 minutes, I overheard THREE other people going through exactly the same thing."" The message ends on a conspiratorial note, stating that the couple lives in a ""heavily Democrat-controlled precinct"" in a Democrat-controlled state and suggests this wasn’t a coincidence and that the election process is corrupt. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The names of the people involved or the precinct where the incident allegedly occurred were not listed. We reached out to The American Project for more details but did not hear back. State election officials said that any mix-ups at precincts may be due to a new law that made annual absentee ballot requests permanent, of which people could opt out. Meanwhile, Virginia’s Department of Elections told PolitiFact that it hasn’t received any reports related to the account.  ""We are not aware of any complaints of that type,"" said external affairs manager Andrea Gaines. ""Every absentee ballot must be requested using an application,"" she added. ""You can make that request on paper or online. The paper application can be reviewed. If it is requested online, the applicant must provide date of birth, registration address, (Social Security number), and driver's license number.""  Virginia election officials offer a guide to help poll workers assist voters with uncommon situations and page 28 references the protocol for polling places dealing with such scenarios.  It says that if a voter’s name in the pollbook or final absentee list shows a status of ""issued"" or ""unmarked"" before election day, the worker should call the election office to ask if the voter returned an unmarked ballot.  If the answer is yes, the voter can cast a vote at the precinct. If no ballot was returned, or if the worker can’t reach the office, the voter may complete a form titled, ""Statement of Voter to be Used when Absentee Ballot Not Received or Lost."" This is applicable if the voter says they lost or didn’t receive their ballot.  The guide says if the voter signs and completes this form, they are able to vote using a replacement ballot. If the voter doesn’t want to sign the form, they can cast a provisional ballot, which is used to record a vote when there are questions about a voter's eligibility that must be resolved before the vote can count. Previously, voters in Virginia were able to request absentee ballots not just for the current election, but for all elections in that calendar year.  Scott Konopasek, director of elections for Fairfax County, the largest in the state, said that any mix-ups at precincts may be due to a new law that went into effect in July that made those requests permanent. ""The law changed this year that changed all of those annual absentee ballot requests to a permanent request,"" Konopasek said. ""We sent notices that told voters that this was going to happen and that they could opt out, and we gave instructions to do that."" ""Several thousand did,"" he added ""but these people may not have understood what was going on and their ballot request was retained as a permanent request."" A viral post on social media claims a Virginia couple was told at a voting precinct that they had to sign an affidavit saying they lost their absentee ballots — ones they claim they didn’t apply for — in order to vote in-person. There is no identifying information about the couple or the precinct where this allegedly happened, and Virginia’s Department of Elections said it isn’t aware of any related complaints. An election official said a new state law that made annual absentee ballots requests permanent may be the reason for any mix-ups at precincts.  Regardless, this is not evidence of something nefarious or corrupt. A similar scenario is outlined in a Virginia guide for poll workers. Before an election, if voters are listed in the pollbook as having a voter status of ""issued"" or ""unmarked,"" they can complete a form that says their absentee ballot wasn’t received or is lost. Then, they can vote using a replacement ballot. Voters can also cast a provisional ballot if they refuse to fill out the form. The post presents an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, Atlanta did not lose two-thirds of its police force
","A Facebook post makes the startling claim that the city of Atlanta, Ga. lost two-thirds of its police force as a result of mass resignations. The Oct. 20 post shows a screenshot of a tweet from a person named Chief Jimmy Banks. ""My time as chief, at my current agency, has come to an end,"" the tweet says. ""There are some things worth fighting for, even if it means walking out the door! Please pray for the city, as 75% of the officers left with me."" The Facebook post’s caption claims the tweet is proof that ""Atlanta just lost 75% of its police force."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although the tweet featured in the Facebook post is from a Twitter account, it is real and from a now-former chief of police in Georgia — just not in Atlanta. Jimmy Banks served as chief of the Nahunta Police Department until he resigned on Oct. 12, according to Angela Wirth, Nahunta’s city clerk. Nahunta is located about 250 miles southeast of Atlanta. It appears that Banks’ original tweet has been deleted, but we found a picture of it archived Oct. 19. The comments on the Facebook post suggests Banks’ resignation had to do with COVID-19 and a possible vaccine mandate. Wirth declined to say why Banks resigned, but she disputed accounts that it had to do with COVID-19. Nahunta does not have a vaccine mandate, Wirth said. She also said no other officers have left. Though when we spoke to Darin Jennings, Nahunta’s new police chief, it appeared that was in dispute. Jennings said a majority of the city’s police officers did resign with Banks. At least three officers left the six-officer department, he said. A fourth officer also sent in their resignation, but Jennings said the department was trying to ""work things out"" with them.  The resignations were a result of a dispute on how to properly compensate officers, according to Jennings. ""It was a difference of views between (Banks) and the City Council,"" he said. PolitiFact was unable to reach Banks for comment.  While the Facebook post incorrectly states that 75% of Atlanta lost its police force, Atlanta has been grappling with a shortage of police officers. More than 200 officers have retired or resigned from the Atlanta Police Department since 2020, and an additional 115 people left the department this year for other reasons, according to the Atlanta Constitution-Journal. The department currently has 1,623 officers on staff, 423 people short of what’s considered full staffing by the agency, the paper reported. A Facebook post claims two-thirds of Atlanta’s police officers resigned en masse, and pointed to a tweet made by a police chief announcing the resignations as proof. Although the tweet is real, it was made by the resigning chief of police in Nahunta, Ga., a small town nearly 250 miles away from Atlanta. Atlanta has seen more than 300 employee departures since 2020 but they weren’t ""en masse"" resignations and, even if calculated at its most liberal interpretation, does not equate to anywhere near 75% of the department.

","There’s an echo chamber on social media platforms where news keeps breaking that former President Donald Trump has returned to power while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is continually being arrested, indicted, or executed.  Just this week we checked claims that wrongly said Trump was photographed at the White House on Oct. 24 and that he had been reinstated. In July, we debunked a claim that the military was holding the White House for his return.   Twice we’ve checked baseless allegations that Navy SEALs arrested Clinton, one of which came months after she had been hanged at Guantanamo Bay, per another inaccurate post.  A new, also wrong post has Clinton alive and free but not for long, if Trump has anything to do with it.  ""Breaking!"" says the title of a video posted on Facebook on Oct. 27. ""Trump is in White House! He promises to lock up Hillary!""   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video is about 17 minutes of audio of a woman discussing QAnon conspiracy theories. She says that Trump was photographed at the White House on Oct. 24, which we have already debunked. It was an old photo of Trump at the White House posted on Twitter on Oct. 25.   As for the former president promising to lock up Clinton, the woman talks about how Trump, as a presidential candidate, floated the idea of telling the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. In October 2020, he endorsed his supporters’ calls to jail her. There is nothing in the video to support that Trump is now vowing to lock up Clinton, and certainly not from the White House.  We rate this post Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280978AFB40>],/factchecks/2021/oct/29/facebook-posts/no-trump-isnt-white-house-promising-jail-clinton/
