Don’t worry about Texas poll workers writing on your ballot, it’s the law
","Early voting started in Texas on Oct. 13, and already misinformation is spreading in some communities there.  A screenshot of a warning that was shared in a Facebook group for residents of Haltom City, Tex., claims that poll workers could endanger the validity of election ballots if they write on them.  ""Just finished Poll Manager training!"" the post says. ""I passed all the classes. I want you all to know something...if you are checking in at the polls and they happen to write anything on your ballot before they give it to you to put in the voting machine...a letter, a checkmark, a star, an R or a D any writing of any kind...please request a new ballot. Your ballot could be disqualified if it is written on. Please be on the lookout for this type of behavior.""  This information is incorrect and this post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We reached out to Heider Garcia, elections administrator for Tarrant County, where Haltom City is located near Fort Worth.  The Facebook post is wrong, he said. Texas law requires poll workers to sign the back of voters’ ballots to guarantee their authenticity. They may physically sign it or they might stamp it, he said. During early voting in Tarrant County, for example, Garcia may sign the ballots himself or poll workers may use a stamp with Garcia’s initials on the back of it to authenticate ballots. On Election Day, election judges at every precinct will either sign ballots or use a stamp with their signature, he said. Neither the stamp or the signature — or just an errant marking on the ballot — will disqualify it, Garcia said. ""Don’t get confused — poll workers have to do this.""  It seems that the message in this Facebook post is being copied and pasted in communities around the country. On Oct. 9, Lead Stories fact-checked a nearly identical post in Myrtle Beach, S.C.  There, an election official said, poll workers don’t have a reason to write on a ballot, but it wouldn’t be disqualified if they did.  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097459D00>],/factchecks/2020/oct/13/viral-image/dont-worry-about-texas-poll-workers-writing-your-b/

Donald Trump ad accuses Joe Biden of phantom 14% tax hike
","A new ad for President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign paints Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as eager to raise the average voter’s taxes. ""What would Joe Biden's plan do for you?"" the ad says. ""Biden's plan is a 14% tax hike on middle class families. 82% of Americans would pay more, and Biden's plan gives illegal immigrants amnesty and health care. Joe Biden's a career politician who spent decades raising taxes. … So what would the Biden plan do for you? Raise your taxes? That's it."" Would Biden really raise taxes by 14% on middle-income families? There’s zero evidence of that. (The 82% statistic is also incorrect.) Biden’s proposed changes would repeal provisions in President Donald Trump’s tax law for taxpayers earning over $400,000. Specifically, Biden would: Increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%; Raise the top individual federal income tax rate to 39.6%; Place a 12.4% Social Security tax on incomes above $400,000; Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. All of this is targeted toward the highest earners, those earning $400,000 or more per year. So where does the alleged 14% tax hike on middle-income Americans come from? That’s unclear. A screenshot from the Trump campaign's recent ad. The Trump campaign did not respond to inquiries for this article. The ad footnotes the assertion with a reference to an article from the financial website MarketWatch on March 4, 2020, when Biden was still in the thick of his party’s presidential primary. The MarketWatch article provides no support for the 14% assertion in the Trump ad.  The only mention of 14% in the article refers to the plan offered by one of Biden’s primary opponents, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The article said that Warren would ""assess a 14.8% high-income social security tax on the top bracket."" But not only was that provision not part of Biden’s plan, but it was also specifically targeted at the top tax bracket, not middle-income Americans. Taking a step back from the MarketWatch article, we also see no evidence that Biden’s plan would produce such a big tax hike on middle-income taxpayers. Several independent groups of varied ideologies assessed the impacts of Biden’s tax plan earlier this year.  They projected that some of the burden of Biden’s tax increases would fall to people making less than $400,000 in the form of lower wages or investment returns. This would be a result of Biden’s proposal to hike the corporate tax rate. Unlike direct changes to individual tax rates and income thresholds, the impact of the corporate tax rate on ordinary Americans’ tax returns is indirect and difficult to measure. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that’s hawkish on the federal budget deficit, said that ""overall, Biden’s tax plan would make the tax code more progressive, with the vast majority of increased tax burdens and the entirety of direct tax increases falling on high-income households."" The group summarized four other groups’ assessments of how Biden’s tax plan would affect members of the lowest, second-lowest, middle, second-highest, and highest income quintiles. The four analyses were conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, the Tax Foundation, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. As the following chart shows, no quintile — even the top one — would see anything close to a 14% tax increase due to the Biden plan. Only the top 1% of earners would see anything approaching that degree of increase.  According to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis, the lowest income group would see their incomes drop by $30. The next would see a drop of $110; the middle would see a drop of $260; and the second-highest, with incomes up to $170,000, would see a loss of $590. Meanwhile, Biden has also proposed a number of tax cuts that were not included in the analyses above. Here are some of the bigger cuts being proposed by the campaign:  • A temporarily expanded child tax credit, worth $3,000 per child for children ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under 6. Biden would make the credit fully refundable. • A $15,000 permanent tax credit for first-time homebuyers that could be advanced to the claimant rather than waiting until the following tax year. • A refundable tax credit for health insurance premiums. • Up to $8,000 in tax credits to help pay for child care. It’s entirely possible that these proposed cuts would wipe out the increases from the corporate tax hike, making the assertion in Trump’s ad even more wrong. The initial analysis ""does not provide support for Trump's claim that Biden's plan will raise taxes by 14% for middle-class families,"" said Eric Toder, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""Not even close."" The Trump ad said that ""Biden's plan is a 14% tax hike on middle class families."" There is no evidence for this assertion. The article cited in the ad says nothing about this, and analyses by independent think tanks found a much smaller indirect hit from the corporate tax hike, one that could well be reversed by larger-scale tax cuts that Biden has proposed and that are currently being analyzed.

Mike Pence said Joe Biden copied Trump’s pandemic response plan. Pants on Fire!
","During last week’s vice presidential debate, moderator Susan Page, USA Today’s Washington bureau chief, asked Vice President Mike Pence about the U.S. COVID-19 death toll. Pence replied by touting the Trump administration’s actions to combat the pandemic, such as restrictions on travel from China, steps to expand testing and efforts to accelerate the production of a vaccine. Pence also took a jab at Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a strong critic of the Trump pandemic response. ""The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way,"" Pence said. ""And, quite frankly, when I look at their plan,"" he added, ""it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about."" (Pence’s gibe about plagiarism is likely a reference to Biden copying phrases from a British politician’s speeches during his first run for president in 1987, an issue that caused him to drop out of the race. In 2019, the Biden campaign acknowledged it had inadvertently lifted language in its climate and education plans without attributing the sources.) Because COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States, with nearly 8 million cases and upward of 215,000 deaths, we decided to examine both the Trump and Biden plans to curb the pandemic and investigate whether Pence was on target in his charge that the Biden plan is rooted in Trump’s ideas. We reached out to both presidential campaigns for their candidates’ COVID-19 plans. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request, but we looked at a campaign website timeline of administration actions on COVID-19, as well as a coronavirus fact sheet from the White House. The Biden campaign sent us a link to Biden’s COVID-19 plan. At first glance, there are obvious similarities. Both declare goals like vaccine development and expanding public availability of COVID-19 tests. ""Most pandemic response plans should be at their core fairly similar, if they’re well executed,"" said Nicolette Louissaint, executive director of Healthcare Ready, a nonprofit organization focused on strengthening the U.S. health care supply chain. But public health experts also pointed to significant philosophical differences in how the plans are put into action. ""You ought to think about it as two groups of people trying to make a car,"" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. ""They have to have four wheels, probably have to have a bumper, have some doors,"" he said. It is how you build the car from that point forward that determines what the end product looks like. As Pence pointed out, the Trump administration has focused its efforts to combat COVID-19 along a couple of lines. The administration formed the White House coronavirus task force in January and issued travel restrictions for some people traveling from China and other countries in February. Federal social distancing guidelines were issued in March and expired on April 30. The administration launched Operation Warp Speed in April, with the goal of producing and delivering 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine beginning in January 2021. A more detailed logistics plan to distribute a vaccine was issued later. Trump activated the Defense Production Act for certain protective equipment and ventilators. His administration also has talked about efforts to expand COVID-19 testing in partnership with the private sector, as well as initiatives to help cover costs for COVID-19 treatments and make tests free of charge. Importantly, the administration also shifted significant decision-making responsibility to states, leaving the development of testing plans, procurement of personal protective equipment and decrees on stay-at-home orders and mask mandates to the discretion of the governor or local governments. Despite that, Trump still urged states to reopen beginning in May, though in many areas cases of COVID-19 remained high. Biden’s plan would set out strong national standards for testing, contact tracing and social distancing — words that echo the Trump plan. It proposes working with states on mask mandates, establishing a ""supply commander"" in charge of shoring up PPE, aggressively using the Defense Production Act and accelerating vaccine development. It also outlines plans to extend more fiscal relief, provide enhanced health insurance coverage, eliminate cost sharing for COVID treatments, reestablish a team on the National Security Council to address pandemic response and to maintain membership in the World Health Organization. Trump announced earlier this summer that the U.S. would begin procedures to withdraw from the WHO, effective as of July 6, 2021. Biden has said he would follow scientific advice if indicators pointed to a need to dial up social distancing guidelines in light of another wave of COVID-19 cases. Dr. Rachel Vreeman, director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, noted in an email that a key likeness is that the two plans ""sometimes used similar words, such as testing, PPE and vaccines."" But ""the overall philosophy from the start, from the White House and from Trump, has been to let states and local governments deal with this problem,"" said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at KFF. ""Biden would have a much more forceful role for the federal government in setting strategy and guidelines in regards to the public health response."" (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) Even Pence pointed out this philosophical difference during the debate, saying that Democrats want to exert government control while Trump and Republicans left health choices up to individual Americans. Vreeman and others pointed to another contrast — that the Trump administration has yet to issue a comprehensive COVID-19 response plan. ""What plan? I would really love it if someone could show me a plan. A press release is not a plan,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University. Wen is right that the Trump administration has not issued a detailed plan, such as Biden’s document. The Trump administration has, however, offered a road map for how vaccines would be distributed. Another major distinction emerged in the way the candidates have communicated the threat of the coronavirus to the public and reacted to public health guidelines, such as those issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During most public outings and campaign rallies, Trump has chosen not to wear a mask — even after he tested positive and was treated for COVID-19. He has been known to mock others, including reporters and Biden, for wearing masks. And, Trump and members of his administration have not adhered to social distancing guidelines at official events. The White House indoor reception and outdoor Rose Garden event held to mark the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court -- at each one, few attendees followed these precautions -- have been associated with the transmission of at least 11 cases of coronavirus, according to a website tracking the cases from public reports. There are also multiple reported cases among White House and Trump campaign staff members. Throughout the pandemic, Trump has downplayed the threat of COVID-19, touted unproven treatments for the disease such as bleach, hydroxychloroquine or UV light, questioned the effectiveness of face masks and criticized or contradicted public health officials’ statements about the pandemic. In comparison, Biden has worn masks during his public campaign events and has encouraged Americans to do so as well. His events strictly adhere to public health guidelines, including wearing masks, social distancing and limiting the number of attendees. The two candidates’ approaches to listening to scientists is also different. ""Biden has said he is going to look at science and value the best scientists,"" said Benjamin. ""The Trump administration has not walked the talk; they have said one thing and done something else. If you go on the Trump administration website, you see guidelines that they didn’t follow themselves."" In the end, the Biden campaign has the distinction of being able to learn from the Trump administration’s early missteps, said the experts. There’s also a reality check: if Biden wins and attempts to implement his COVID-19 plan, it’s important to consider that no matter how well thought out it looks on paper, he may not be able to accomplish everything. ""There’s a lot of words in this plan,"" said Joseph Antos, a resident scholar in health care policy at the American Enterprise Institute. ""But until you’re in the job, a lot of this doesn’t really matter."" Pence claimed the Biden plan to address COVID-19 was similar to the Trump administration’s plan ""every step of the way."" A cursory, side-by-side look at the Trump administration’s COVID-19 actions — no actual comprehensive plan has been released — and the Biden plan indicates some big picture overlap on securing a vaccine and ramping up testing. But that’s where the similarities end. Biden’s plan includes proposed actions the Trump administration has not pursued. It also is focused on federal rather than state authority, a significant distinction Pence himself pointed out during the debate. Additionally, the candidates’ behaviors toward COVID-19 and views on science have been diametrically opposed, with Trump eschewing the use of face masks and social distancing, and Biden closely adhering to both. Pence’s statement ignores critical facts and realities, making it inaccurate and ridiculous.

CDC hasn’t canceled Halloween but it has advice for how to celebrate safely
","The coronavirus has killed more than 200,000 people in the United States and hampered American lives in ways big and small. As the holiday season approaches, experts and news stories are already advising people on the best ways to stay safe in the coming months.  But one holiday, fast approaching, has been called off, according to a recent Facebook post. ""CDC just cancelled Halloween for kids, but BLM & Antifa riots and protests… they are of course fine. This 2 standards of ‘covid safety’ is ridiculous,"" reads a screenshot of an Oct. 12 tweet from Amber Smith, the former deputy assistant to then-U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a page on its website dedicated to the holidays. But it is not publishing any decrees there — just advice. ""As many people in the United States begin to plan for fall and winter holiday celebrations, CDC offers the following considerations to help protect individuals, their families, friends, and communities from COVID-19,"" the page says.  Many traditional Halloween activities can be high-risk for spreading viruses, including the coronavirus, according to the CDC, and anyone who may have COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone with COVID-19 shouldn’t participate in in-person Halloween plans or hand out candy to trick-or-treaters. But, the agency offers ideas for lower risk activities that could be safe alternatives to, say, attending a crowded, indoor Halloween party.  These safer activities include: carving or decorating pumpkins outside at a safe distance with neighbors or friends, decorating your home, doing a Halloween scavenger hunt, and having a virtual Halloween costume contest. The CDC also lists moderate risk activities and high risk activities.  Moderate risk activities include attending a costume party outdoors where people wear face coverings and stay physically distant and putting out individually-wrapped candy bags for families to grab while trick-or-treating. If you’re planning to prepare such candy bags, the CDC advises washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds beforehand and placing the bags somewhere families can maintain physical distance, like at the end of a driveway or the edge of a yard. High risk activities include traditional trick-or-treating, where treats are handed to children who go door to door, or going to an indoor haunted house. So the CDC has provided guidance on how to celebrate Halloween safely — it hasn’t canceled the holiday. It also didn’t rubberstamp racial justice protests that followed the May death of George Floyd, a Black man who died as a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck in Minneapolis. In June, CDC Director Robert Redfield told lawmakers that protesters should get tested for COVID-19 and that demonstrations could cause the disease to spread.  Later that month, the CDC issued new guidelines concerning the risk of spreading COVID-19 at large gatherings. The agency recommended organizers of large events that involve shouting, chanting or singing ""strongly encourage"" the use of face coverings.  Like the CDC’s advice related to the holidays, these guidelines were not mandates.  ""They are not regulations. They are not commands,"" said Jay Butler, the CDC’s deputy director of infectious diseases. ""But they are recommendations or even suggestions (on) how you can have a gathering that will keep people as safe as possible.""

No, masks don't collect the coronavirus
","Health researchers have consistently found strong correlations between wearing a face mask and reducing the spread of disease like COVID-19. But new posts on Facebook inaccurately claim that wearing a mask makes you more likely to contract COVID-19, misinterpreting a survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along the way.  The post features a screenshot of a data table from the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. A highlighted row shows that 70.6% of these people who tested positive for the virus reported that they ""always"" wore masks or cloth face mask coverings.  ""This is really REALLY BIG,"" the post reads. ""HUGE… From the CDC… 70.6% of those testing positive wore masks ALWAYS. 3.9% of those testing positive wore masks NEVER. This means that people who wear masks, are actually ‘collecting’ the virus in their masks. The airborne particles are being absorbed into the Masks and staying on our faces rather than dissipating. A clear indication there is a correlation to more infected people wearing masks than those who do not."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist Ben Neuman evaluated the post and the CDC report from which it’s purportedly sourced for PolitiFact.  ""There’s nothing in this (report) that indicates that mask wearing is associated with more coronavirus,"" he said. ""Honestly, I don’t even know how that could be possible."" The CDC paper never claims that mask use increases your likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. The CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their home.  Instead, the paper summarizes findings from a survey of 314 people. 154 of these people had tested positive for the coronavirus. The other 160 participants (the study’s control group) had tested negative for the coronavirus. From the results of the survey, the CDC report found that two activities were linked to a positive COVID-19 test: close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as bars and restaurants. The correlation between frequenting on-site eating locations and a positive COVID-19 test probably indicates that masks play a role in preventing the spread of the virus. The paper notes that masks ""cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking,"" so diners and bar-goers are likely exposed to infectious respiratory droplets when they lower their masks to take a drink or a bite of food.  The table featured in the Facebook post doesn’t show that mask use is correlated with the spread of the coronavirus. In fact, it shows the opposite: more people who tested negative for the coronavirus reported that they ""always"" wore masks than people who tested positive.  Of the 160 survey participants who tested negative, 74.2% reported that they ""always"" wore a face mask or cloth face covering. Of the 154 participants who tested positive, 70.6% reported that they ""always"" wore a mask or face covering.  Neuman took issue with the survey asking participants to self-report their rates of mask use. ""Conducting science by survey has problems,"" he said. ""There are certain things that are embarrassing or politically and socially sensitive, and you generally won’t get honest answers if you just ask them on a questionnaire because (participants) don’t know if they can trust the person on the other end, don’t know if they’ll be repercussions, or may just be embarrassed about telling the truth."" The CDC did not respond to our request for comment by deadline. The Facebook post’s claim that masks are ""collecting"" infectious airborne particles mischaracterizes the science behind masks and how they stop viral spread.  Masks are most effective as ""source control,"" preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people. Although masks do provide the wearer some protection, people can still be infected while having them on.  Respiratory droplets with the virus are expelled into the air when infected people cough, talk, sneeze, or breathe. These droplets quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles, which are extremely difficult to remove. However, if an infected person is wearing a mask, it will catch and contain the larger droplets in the humid space between the person’s mouth and the mask. In this environment, droplets take nearly a hundred times as long to transform into airborne particles.  Neuman shared three studies of hundreds of thousands of infected people that all found that mask-wearing reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. Unlike the CDC report, these studies didn’t rely on survey data and self-reported rates of mask use.  The first paper, which analyzed trends in infections in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, found that face mask mandates were ""the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission."" The researchers found that a mask mandate reduced infections by over 75,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9.  The second paper, which reviewed 172 studies conducted on a total of 25,697 patients with COVID-19, SARS, or MERS across 16 countries and six continents, found that face masks ""were associated with a much lower risk of infection."" The third paper, which analyzed 15 U.S. states found that daily infection rates decreased significantly after mask mandates were introduced. In seven of the 15 states, researchers from UC San Diego and Texas A&M found that the number of new infections per day increased steadily only to fall after face-mask requirements were implemented.

No, US government didn’t promote video of Joe Biden ‘calling for a Muslim jihad’
","An article by a far-right news site recently renewed interest in a months-old speech Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden made to appeal to Muslim Americans.  An Oct. 9 article by The Gateway Pundit, liked and shared on Facebook thousands of times, referred to a speech Biden made to Emgage Action, a Muslim advocacy group, in which he quoted a saying by the Prophet Muhammed. The article went on to claim that he called on Muslim voters to ""wage jihad,"" and that a video promoting the message was created, translated and endorsed by the U.S. government.  The headline read, ""EXCLUSIVE UPDATE: Video of Joe Biden Calling for a Muslim Jihad Was Created, Translated, Promoted and Endorsed by the US Government."" ""Yesterday The Gateway Pundit reported that most Americans didn’t realize it or see it but Democrat Joe Biden in a recent ad called for Muslim Voters to wage jihad,"" the article goes on. ""The former Obama vice president called for Muslim voters to wage jihad while attacking the police."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The video, which is embedded in the article, shows clips of Biden first promising to ""end the Muslim ban on Day One,"" then quoting the Prophet Muhammed. After that, it plays a political ad Emgage created for its campaign to turn out one million Muslim votes. The entire video is accompanied by subtitles and a Voice of America logo in the corner. The article claims that the video was translated into Urdu and aired on U.S.-sponsored sites ""to promote jihad and the Biden campaign. What is our government doing?"" Here’s what we know. The clips of Biden in the video all came from Emgage’s Million Muslim Votes Summit conducted virtually on Zoom in July. It was followed by a clip of Emgage’s political ad to galvanize Muslim votes, which was also played at the same summit.  Biden’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment. But in his speech that clocked in over 11 minutes, Biden quoted the Prophet Muhammed after encouraging Muslims to vote: ""Whomever among you sees wrong, let him change it with his hand. If he is not able, then with his tongue. If he is not able, then with his heart."" Biden went on to say that ""so many"" Muslims are living these values by acting to ""make life better"" for their communities and promoting peace.  Yasir Qadhi, a prominent cleric and dean of the Islamic Seminary of America, said the hadith encourages Muslims to act if they see something that goes against their moral values. If they can’t, they should say something about it or in the very least disagree with it in their hearts, Qadhi said.  ""Even the radical jihadists don't use this particular hadith to justify their misinterpretations,"" Qadhi wrote to PolitiFact by email. ""Jihad"" in Arabic literally means ""struggle.""  Voice of America, a U.S. government-sponsored broadcast that airs stories to international audiences, took a copy of the video, created captions in Urdu and promoted it as part of its Urdu-language news report. Voice of America said in a July statement that senior journalists removed the video after it had been published on VOA’s Urdu language service and social media sites. The U.S. Agency for Global Media was investigating whether the video violated editorial standards or laws about government employees, the statement said.  VOA’s spokesperson directed PolitiFact’s inquiry to the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which didn’t respond to requests for comment. Politico reported on the controversy in July and said four contractors at VOA’s Urdu language service had been responsible for publishing the video.  It’s not the first time Biden’s words from the Muslim outreach event was taken out of context; PolitiFact in July debunked a claim that Biden wants Islam to be taught in schools.  The Gateway Pundit article claims that a video of Joe Biden ""calling for a Muslim jihad was created, translated, promoted and endorsed by the U.S. government."" Biden did not promote ""a Muslim jihad."" He was encouraging Muslim Americans to vote. He said many of them lived Muhammed’s teachings by advocating for their communities and preaching peace. ""Jihad,"" while often used to mean terrorism, is a broad word that can simply mean ""struggle."" The Biden video cited by the Gateway Pundit was translated by contractors of Voice of America, a U.S.-sponsored site, for its Urdu language service. But the video was deleted shortly afterward by VOA’s senior journalists. And the incident was being investigated.

Fact-check: Biden’s wrong claim that Senate GOP’s Supreme Court move is ‘not constitutional’
","Asked whether he would consider adding justices to the Supreme Court if elected, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden claimed Senate Republicans’ move to install Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the vacant seat less than a month before Election Day was ""not constitutional."" ""Look, the only court packing is going on right now,"" Biden told reporters Oct. 10. ""It's going on with the Republicans packing the court now. It's not constitutional what they're doing.""  Joe Biden: ""The only court packing is going on right now -- it's going on with Republicans packing the court now. It's not constitutional."" pic.twitter.com/nSySmeVdkv The rush to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in September, is a departure from the GOP’s position in 2016, when the Republican-led Senate blocked President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland months before that year’s election.  Biden, the former vice president who served two terms with Obama, has argued that the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election should pick the next nominee.  The term ""court packing"" — a phrase that invokes President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1937 proposal to expand the size of the Supreme Court — means increasing the number of justices on the court. Doing that would require legislation, and Biden has not said whether he’d consider it as president. But Republicans are not currently pursuing that.  As for the move to seat Barrett before the election, two constitutional scholars said that in a general sense, the Senate Republicans’ actions seem at odds with some of the democratic principles underlying the Constitution. But the Republicans’ move to add Barrett to the bench with a fast-paced confirmation process is not a violation of any specific clause in the Constitution, legal experts agreed. ""There is nothing unconstitutional about nominating a judge in an election year,"" said Saikrishna Prakash, a professor of law at the University of Virginia, in an email to PolitiFact. ""And there is nothing unconstitutional about giving consent to a president to appoint a judge (or justice).""  ""In the modern era, whether to proceed on a nomination during (or after) an election year is wholly a matter of politics,"" Prakash said. Article II of the Constitution says that the president ""shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint … judges of the Supreme Court."" The Constitution doesn’t spell out procedures for nominating justices, nor does it require that the high court stay at a certain size. The number of seats on the Supreme Court is determined by legislation and has changed over the years. It has been set at nine justices since 1869. A handful of historical precedents and informal rules have been cited for the handling of election-year Supreme Court nominations, but they carry no official force.   Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett sits before a confirmation hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Oct. 13, 2020, at Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP) As far as the Constitution goes, legal experts said there’s no specific prohibition in the Constitution that would prevent Barrett’s confirmation from moving forward. ""There is no constitutional prohibition on the confirmation of judicial nominees, or declining to confirm judicial nominees, close to a presidential election — or any other time,"" said Ilya Shapiro, director of the Cato Institute’s Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies. ""If ‘unconstitutional’ means that a court would find what the Republicans are doing to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the answer is no, no court would make such a holding,"" added Mark Tushnet, a professor of law emeritus at Harvard Law School. Biden did not elaborate on his claim when he made it. He previously accused Republicans of ""denying the American people the one shot they have, under constitutional law, to be able to have their input,"" according to the Associated Press.  Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, made a similar point when CNN’ Jake Tapper pressed her on Biden’s claim about the Republicans’ move being ""not constitutional.""  CNN’s @jaketapper presses Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield on Biden’s claim that confirming President Trump’s Supreme Court pick before the election would be “unconstitutional.” pic.twitter.com/v4ny343qCv ""Ramming through this nomination after millions of Americans have already voted is contemptuous of the essential democratic structure that is the bedrock of the Constitution,"" said Andrew Bates, the Biden campaign’s director of rapid response, in a statement to PolitiFact. Laurence Tribe, a professor emeritus of constitutional law at Harvard University and a fierce critic of the Trump administration on Twitter, argued that Senate Republicans have run afoul of basic constitutional principles, even if there’s no specific clause to condemn their actions. ""There is no anti-hypocrisy clause in the Constitution, but the hypocritical use of constitutional powers can undermine the presuppositions of a constitutional system,"" Tribe said. A fast-tracked confirmation battle so close to the election, for example, isn’t honoring the principle requiring the consent of the governed, Tribe said. And the Senate’s race to fill the newly vacant seat is an abdication of its duty to give meaningful advice and consent. ""This Senate is committed right now under the leadership of (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell not to give its advice and consent, but to give its rubber stamp,"" Tribe said. Tushnet, also from Harvard, said that while no court of law would strike down the course of action Republicans are charting, ""what they are doing is inconsistent with what some people reasonably view as fundamental principles underlying the constitutional order"" — namely, the idea that ""the political system should operate over time to ensure that overall, all of our institutions are roughly in line with what the American people want."" Still, what they’re doing is not expressly prohibited by the language of the Constitution. The requirement for the Senate to give its advice and consent ""is a political prerogative that duly elected senators can determine how to exercise,"" Shapiro said. Biden said Senate Republicans’ move to confirm Barrett to the Supreme Court in an election year is ""not constitutional."" Some legal experts said the move to fast-track Barrett seems to conflict with some of the Constitution’s basic underlying principles, such as the idea that there should be consent of the governed. But there is no clause in the Constitution that would prevent Senate Republicans from moving forward, legal experts said.  We rate Biden’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3C8EC0>],/factchecks/2020/oct/13/joe-biden/fact-check-bidens-misleading-claim-senate-gops-sup/

Social Media Posts Push False Claims About Kamala Harris And Planned Parenthood
","Widely-shared Facebook posts claimed on Monday that Democratic vice presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris, during her time as state attorney general, prosecuted two pro-life ""journalists"" who ""exposed"" Planned Parenthood for ""selling baby parts.""  We found there’s a major flaw in these posts: A dozen states investigated Planned Parenthood but never reached a criminal finding against the organization for tissue sales. Planned Parenthood has denied the accusations.  We also found the term ""baby parts"" is wrong and greatly misleading. Scientists use donated fetal tissue as a source of fetal cells. These cells have been used for research since the 1930s, and the government has funded such research since the 1950s, ""when it was used to create one of the biggest medical advances of the 20th century: the polio vaccine,"" according to a recent NBC news report.  Pro-life groups circulated the claims on the same day abortion and women’s reproductive rights took center stage during the start of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on President Donald Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats view Barrett as a conservative ideologue who could vote to eliminate abortion rights. Originally published in August, this headline from LifeNews.com was viewed nearly 500,000 times on Facebook the day before the hearings began: ""Kamala Harris Tried to Put Pro-Lifers in Jail Who Exposed Planned Parenthood Selling Baby Parts."" The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s effort to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.)  Several text memes such as the one below also circulated online:   In this fact check, we focused on whether Harris really failed to prosecute Planned Parenthood for ""selling baby parts"" and then went after two ""journalists."" Background On Accusations Against Planned Parenthood  Planned Parenthood provides reproductive health care services, including abortions, birth control, testing for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, along with sex education programs.  In 2014 and 2015, the organization was accused of illegal fetal tissue sales. The allegations came after two anti-abortion activists from the Center for Medical Progress released edited and undercover videos purporting to show Planned Parenthood staff discussing the transactions.  Though sales are illegal, fetal tissue donations for medical research are allowed under state and federal laws, including the 1993 federal Statute on Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research.  Before a donation is allowed, the federal statute requires that the woman involved must provide written consent. Providers can receive payment to cover the cost of transportation, processing and storage of the tissue.  In 2015, FactCheck.org took a close look at the full, unedited video released by CMP. They found it shows ""shows a Planned Parenthood executive repeatedly saying its clinics want to cover their costs, not make money, when donating fetal tissue from abortions for scientific research."" Criminal Findings?  As NPR outlined in 2016, Republican governors from Texas to Florida to Indiana, where now Vice President Mike Pence was governor at the time, all ordered investigations into the accusations against Planned Parenthood after the videos were released, but found no evidence of the illegal activity.  ""Despite all the worry, state investigations have yet to find any evidence that Planned Parenthood was selling or profiting off fetal tissue,"" NPR reported. In 2019, The New York Times reported the allegations remained unfounded after ""numerous congressional and state investigations."" Ederlina Co, an associate professor at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento who studies reproductive rights, said on Monday she was not aware of any state concluding that Planned Parenthood violated the law for selling fetal tissue.  In a recent fact check, Snopes.com described the claims in the text meme as ""both inaccurate and misleading."" ""It is true that no charges were brought against Planned Parenthood in California — for the sound reason that Planned Parenthood was investigated by multiple states — but none of them found sufficient evidence to support a prosecution over claims that the organization had unlawfully sold (or offered to sell) human fetal tissue."" Several months after the release of the videos, Planned Parenthood said it would no longer accept any sort of payment to cover the costs of making fetal tissue available for research. Did Kamala Harris Try To 'Put Pro-Lifers In Jail'?  While there’s no evidence to back up the claim that Planned Parenthood was ""selling baby parts,"" the second part about Harris going after two pro-life ""journalists"" is more muddled.  David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt of the Center for Medical Progress posed as fetal researchers for a made-up company when they surreptitiously recorded Planned Parenthood staff members.  In March 2017, Daleiden and Merritt were charged in California with 15 counts of violating state invasion of privacy laws that prohibit the recording of conversations without consent, according to Snopes. By that time, Harris had won election to the U.S. Senate and left her post as California attorney general.  However, Harris was attorney general in 2015 when she announced she would investigate Daleiden and when her agency seized his laptop and hard drives from his Orange County apartment in 2016.  Anti-abortion groups called for Harris to resign, citing her support for Planned Parenthood, accusing her of a ""conflict of interest and abuse of government power."" Planned Parenthood’s political arm recently spotlighted Harris ""as a defender of reproductive rights and health care."" She has received tens of thousands of dollars in campaign finance contributions from Planned Parenthood affiliated groups, including $15,000 during her 2014 campaign for re-election as attorney general, according to the California Secretary of State’s website. Last year, Planned Parenthood was awarded up to $2.2 million in damages caused by the videos, according to The New York Times. That award came after a federal jury in San Francisco ruled that Daleiden had broken federal and state laws when he secretly recorded workers for the organization. An attorney for the group said the Center for Medical Progress would appeal the ruling.  Our ruling Popular social media posts claimed Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris failed to prosecute Planned Parenthood for ""selling baby parts,"" and went after two ""pro-life journalists"" instead.  It’s correct that Harris as California’s attorney general never brought charges against Planned Parenthood for this activity. But it’s also correct to say the accusations against the organization were unfounded. A dozen states, many led by Republican governors, investigated the Planned Parenthood after edited videos were released by anti-abortion activists, allegedly showing staffers discussing fetal tissue sales. The full video shows staffers discussed covering the cost of legal fetal tissue donations for medical research. No criminal findings were ever made. Harris was California attorney general when her office started investigating the activities of the anti-abortion activists. She had moved on to the U.S. Senate by the time charges were brought against them for violating state privacy laws.  In the end, we found these posts are misleading and their central premise is wrong: Planned Parenthood was never found to have ""sold baby parts.""  We rate the claims False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096889540>],/factchecks/2020/oct/13/facebook-posts/social-media-posts-push-false-claims-about-kamala-/

Deal makes arresting claim about Georgia prisons
","
Crime may not pay, but it sure costs Georgia a lot of money.

In some cases, too much, says Gov. Nathan Deal.

During his second State of the State address earlier this month, Deal said Georgia has one of the biggest prison populations in the nation. Housing those prisoners costs money, which troubles state leaders as Georgia wades through an uncertain economy.

Still, Deal said far too many of these inmates are former Georgia inmates who are committing crimes and being sent back to prison.

""[H]istory has shown that offenders simply return to the prison population,"" the governor said. ""Right now in Georgia, nearly one in three leaving our prisons are re-convicted within three years.""

One in three are re-convicted within three years? We decided to fact-check this claim.

Criminal justice reform will be one of the top items on the menu for state lawmakers to chew on this legislative session. Georgia currently spends about $1 billion a year on corrections, state officials say. That is more than double the $492 million the state spent on correctional services in 1990. The growth in corrections spending is second behind Medicaid, state officials said. Many believe it is unsustainable.

During the past two decades, Georgia’s prison population has more than doubled to 56,000 inmates despite a decrease in crime rates in the past 10 years, according to a state report released in November.

""If current policies remain in place, analysis indicates that Georgia’s prison population will rise by another 8 percent to reach nearly 60,000 inmates by 2016, presenting the state with the need to spend an additional $264 million to expand capacity,"" the report said.

Last year, the Pew Center on the States released a widely reported study on recidivism rates. In 1999, nearly 17,000 people were released from Georgia state prisons, the study reported. Thirty-eight percent of those released were incarcerated again within three years, Pew found.

In 2004, about 19,000 men and women were released from state prisons in Georgia. About 35 percent of them were back in prison by 2007, Pew found.

Those numbers seemed dated, so PolitiFact Georgia searched for some more recent information. The Georgia Department of Corrections website’s most recent data is through fiscal year 2008. The recidivism rate within three years for state prisons, where the largest percentage of Georgia prisoners is held, was 27.5 percent, the state’s website says. The recidivism rate in most of the other categories of prisons ranged from 22 to 25 percent. Probation boot camps were the only types of prisons with a recidivism rate of one-third.

In Georgia, most of the people who were sent back to prison went for a technical violation, according to the Pew report. Georgia’s probation sentences -- about seven years -- are almost twice the national average, the state report found.

In 2010, state courts sent more than 5,000 lower-risk drug and property offenders to prison who had never been to prison before, accounting for 25 percent of all admissions, according to the state report. The state report suggested giving judges more sentencing options -- such as probation -- for low-level, nonviolent drug possession offenders -- which might reduce the recidivism rate.

""This option would reduce the growth of the prison population by approximately 300 to 900 additional beds,"" the state report said.

The Pew report on recidivism is more than one-third, which helps any argument that Deal would make that his statement is correct. The most recent state data shows the recidivism rate is slightly less than one-third.

The governor said in his speech that the rate was ""nearly"" one in three. We believe all of the numbers we saw support his statement. Our rating: True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967ECC00>],/factchecks/2012/jan/25/nathan-deal/deal-makes-arresting-claim-about-ga-prisons/
"['Ohio', 'Voting Record', 'Ohio Republican Party']","
Ohio Republicans say Sherrod Brown has voted with Obama 95 percent of the time
","
Republicans in Washington, D.C., and Ohio have vast ideological differences with U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.

Brown says the government plays a positive role in people’s lives when it provides a safety net (new health insurance programs, financial regulation, help for cash-strapped cities and schools) while supporting the private sector. Republicans say the government needs to step back to propel the economic engine that is the private sector.

While lofty, that makes for a poor sound bite. But the GOP knows this, and is prepared to frame its November election effort against Brown like this: ""When you look at his voting record, what's going to stick with voters is that he has voted with Barack Obama 95 percent of the time. He can talk about differences some of the time, but you've got to look at the record.""

That quote comes from Christopher Maloney, communications director for the Ohio Republican Party. Maloney made the claim to The Plain Dealer during a telephone interview in December 2011, and again with a slight variation on Jan. 22, 2012, that we’ll discuss in a moment. It is that variation that we're checking here.

The interview was for a story, published Jan. 23, on how Republicans plan to campaign against Brown in the coming political season. While the newspaper checked out the figure and had reason to believe it was accurate, it also believed -- for purposes of PolitiFact Ohio -- that the figure deserved further examination, and a ruling on the Truth-O-Meter. After all, voters are likely to hear the claim a lot this year.

Maloney said his figure came from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan journalism organization that reports on Capitol Hill lawmaking dispassionately. CQ, as it is known, serves as a bit of a bible for journalists, congressional offices and even lobbyists, because it goes into the weeds of legislating like few other publications do. Its reporting winds up in CQ Today, CQ Weekly, CQ online products, and an annual hard-bound political almanac, ""Politics in America.""

Besides covering hearings and more, CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is through an annual examination of presidential support, or the number and percentage of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position.

So, for example, CQ counted a vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the economic stimulus bill, as a vote in support of the president. The same principle applied to the health care reform vote of 2010, to votes on taxes, the debt ceiling, and so on. Presidents weigh in on fewer than half of all Senate votes (Obama had a position on 39 percent of the Senate’s 235 votes last year), and some bills have broad bipartisan support no matter who is in the White House.

No lawmaker winds up with a presidential support score of zero -- not even such small-government fans as Republicans Jim DeMint of South Carolina or Rand Paul of Kentucky. But the closer to zero, or to 100, a score is, the higher the lawmaker’s opposition or support for the president’s agenda.

Back to the figure Maloney cited: He stated from the start that his source was CQ. He originally said the figure for Brown was 97 percent -- that is, that Brown has voted with President Obama 97 percent of the time. That was based on an average of CQ ratings, for 2009 (Obama’s first year, when Brown scored 96 percent) and 2010 (98 percent). Maloney was accurate when he made the statement because CQ Weekly had not yet published its ratings for 2011.

That changed, just before The Plain Dealer was about to publish its story. A new issue of CQ Weekly came out, with new numbers covering 2011. And the positions of Brown and Obama, it turns out, diverged slightly more often in 2011 than in the previous two years.

Brown’s presidential support rating dropped to 92 percent in 2011 -- matching, it turns out, the 92 percent support rate that other Democratic senators had on average for the president last year. In contrast, Brown’s Ohio colleague, Republican freshman Rob Portman, voted with the president 59.5 percent of the time in 2011 -- which while not as high as the 71.90 percent rate of Maine Republican Susan Collins, still put Portman in the top tier, at 13th, of Republicans voting most often for Obama’s positions. DeMint and Paul, by contrast, each had presidential support ratings of 41 percent in 2011.

When averaged for the three years of Obama’s presidency so far, then, Brown’s support fell from 97 percent to 95 percent. (Do the math: 96 plus 98 plus 92, divided by 3, equals 95.3.) Maloney, when told by The Plain Dealer that CQ had had just put out brand new figures, updated his statement to reflect that 95 percent rate.

We report this without judgment on whether it is good or bad to support the Obama agenda. Brown has disagreed with Obama on foreign trade and on some greenhouse gas-regulation issues. But Maloney says that ""you’ve got to look at the record.""

President Barack Obama says that after bailout, GM is now the world's top automaker
","
President Barack Obama used his 2012 State of the Union address to tout the success of the federal auto bailout — not that he called it that.

""We got the industry to retool and restructure,"" he said. ""Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker.""

We wondered: Is an American car manufacturer again ruling the roost? 
The claim 
Here's how the president set up his claim:

""On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back."" 
The U.S. government did sink billions of dollars into the auto industry through the Troubled Asset Relief Program to keep GM and Chrysler from going under. (Though not Ford, which refused that federal money.) In return, it got an ownership stake in GM, now down to about one-third of the company's common stock. And while the automakers haven't exactly repaid the government in full, as executives claimed this summer, overall, a senior editor at Fortune has calculated that TARP has made taxpayers money. 

Meanwhile, U.S. automakers' sales, including Ford's, are rising.

Who's No. 1

Obama's speech used a statistic reported just days earlier: GM and its partners, by selling 9 million vehicles in 2011, once again became the world's top-selling automaker. (GM automobiles include Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.)

The company edged out Toyota, which grabbed the top spot in 2008 as the U.S. economy struggled.

Analysts said the turnaround stems from the popularity of its latest vehicles, such as the Chevy Cruze, according to the Washington Post and others. Sales worldwide rose 7.6 percent, an increase of 640,000 more cars and trucks in 2011 from the year before, according to ABC News and the Los Angeles Times. Nearly 4.8 million of the 9 million were sold by Chevrolet.

""It is an accomplishment that GM has been able to reverse the tide in the U.S. and Asia, and they are doing very well in emerging markets considering just a few years ago the company was in real challenging straights,"" said John F. Hoffecker, an auto industry consultant with AlixPartners, told the Los Angeles Times.

But there are a few caveats to Obama's claim that the bailout put GM back on top.

""Luck is incredibly important — as we've seen for GM these last 12 months,"" said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of auto information site Edmunds.com. ""They were really able to benefit from conditions in the marketplace."" 
Consider:

• GM's sales number is based on sales by both GM and its joint ventures in China, which aren't wholly owned subsidiaries. That's led Volkswagen, which says it sold 8.2 million vehicles last year, to challenge GM's claim to the top spot. ""Rankings are mostly about bragging rights, but there has been a long-running and robust debate over how to account for vehicles sold through affiliates,"" Reuters reported. ""... Some analysts extract those sales from GM's results.""

• Toyota, which hasn't yet reported results for the full year, had to grapple with an earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand. So GM's main competition saw its production and sales decrease. It predicts its sales are down about 6 percent, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, merely the news that Toyota might experience shortages drove up summer demand for American vehicles, Anwyl said.

• GM, in addition to getting TARP funds, also went through bankruptcy in 2009. ""Companies typically rebound as they exit bankruptcy,"" Anwyl said. (Of course, it's important to note that the bankruptcy reorganization was made possible by taxpayer funds.) 
• Ford, which didn't accept TARP funds, has seen its sales increase 11 percent — without Obama's help to ""retool and restructure."" (It didn't need the bailout in large part because of good timing — it had raised significant money while money was still easy to get, before the credit crunch created by the economic crisis, Anwyl said.)

""I think if we're really being fair about the bailouts ... you almost have to wait another two or three years to see how this plays out,"" Anwyl said.

And it won't be easy next year for GM to hold onto its top spot. Its midsize Cruze, for example, will face competition from recent models from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and Volkswagen.

""That's a staggering amount of competition,"" Anwyl said.

Our ruling 
Obama's right that GM's sales, along with sales by its affiliates, were No. 1 in the world in 2011. But getting full credit for those affiliates isn't without controversy. Meanwhile, crediting the bailout with GM's No. 1 spot is a stretch in a year when GM also benefited from challenges faced by its key competition. It's also telling that Ford, which wasn't part of the bailout, also has thriving sales. Obama's claim is partially accurate, but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True. 
UPDATE: Thanks to a sharp reader, we've updated this item to reflect that while Ford didn't take any of the $85 billion in TARP money for automakers that went mostly to GM and Chrysler, it did get other federal support, such as $5.9 billion in federal loans in 2009 to retool its vehicles, and a $250 million loan guarantee from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance export sales in 2010.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F3F1C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/Barack-Obama-bailout-GM-number-one/

Barack Obama says U.S. oil production is at eight-year high
","
In his State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production. 
""Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy,"" Obama said. ""Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years. That’s right – eight years. Not only that – last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years."" 
This passage includes a number of claims, but here we’ll focus on the one that ""right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years."" 
We looked at a similar claim on March 15, 2011, and rated it Mostly True. But we will update our assessment based on new data. 
We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said ""oil production,"" we will only look at crude oil extracted from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products. 
Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003: 
2003: 2,073,453,000
2004: 1,983,302,000
2005: 1,890,106,000
2006: 1,862,259,000
2007: 1,848,450,000
2008: 1,811,817,000
2009: 1,956,596,000
2010: 1,998,137,000 
The full-year data is available only through 2010, but 10 months of data from 2011 have been made public. Through the end of October 2011, production totaled 1,713,038,000 barrels. If that pace continues, the year-end total should be around 2,055,646,000 barrels -- higher than any year since 2003. That’s eight years ago, just as Obama said. 
The last time we looked at this question in March 2011, we noted that production levels actually have been quite stable over the period in question. The estimated level for 2011 is only about 13 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic. In addition, levels of production were typically higher from the 1950s to the 1990s. 
However, one caveat we mentioned in our last analysis -- that the Energy Information Administration projected that production totals were poised to fall over the subsequent two years -- no longer appears to be accurate. 
The most recent ""Short-Term Energy Outlook,"" published on Jan. 12, 2012, forecast increases in total crude oil production in 2012 and 2013, thanks to increases in onshore production in the Lower 48, which overshadow declines in production in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. 
The last issue is whether Obama and his administration claimed credit for this achievement and whether they deserve it. 
The government does play a role in shaping oil production, but many other factors, including private-sector business imperatives and the domestic and international energy market, are factors as well. 
We think Obama’s phrasing suggests that he thinks the administration’s policies have played a role, saying, for instance, that ""over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration."" But we also think he does so cautiously. 
Our ruling 
Obama was correct when he said that ""right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years."" We think he may have overstated his administration’s role in achieving that, but not wildly so. We rate the claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E2C8C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-eight-year-hig/

Barack Obama says he eliminated EPA rule treating spilled milk like it was oil
","
In making the case for sensible federal regulations, President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address pointed to a rule that he eliminated because it was about as antiquated as a milkmaid.

""We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill – because milk was somehow classified as an oil,"" Obama said in the Jan. 24, 2012, speech.

Absurd as it may sound, the Environmental Protection Agency has long regulated milk the same way it does petroleum because of milk’s butter fat content. Vegetable oils fall in the same category.

According to the EPA’s website, milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of President Richard Nixon.
   
The EPA site says ""since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act.""
   
In February 2009, the EPA announced that it intended to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. Here’s what the announcement said:
   
""EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade ""A"" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,"" or similar state laws.
   
In simple English, that means large milk storage containers will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws.

The change took effect in April 2011.

""EPA determined that this unintended result of the current regulations – which were designed to prevent oil spill damage to inland waters and shorelines – placed unjustifiable burdens on dairy farmers,"" the agency said in a press release.

We’re not addressing Obama’s projection of costs of $10,000 to some farmers, but we note that the EPA estimated that the rule change would save the industry $140 million a year.

Our ruling

Obama said his administration got rid of a rule that regulated milk in the same manner as oil, as an environmental hazard when spilled.

The original regulation had been in effect since 1973, and the EPA under Obama moooooooved it out in April 2011. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C2B240>],/factchecks/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-he-eliminated-epa-rule-treating-/

Democrats say Rob Cornilles supports privatizing Medicare.
","
Turning Medicare over to profit-minded insurance companies hasn’t been too popular an idea with seniors, or soon-to-be seniors, who want to make sure the government health care program is around for them when they need it most.

So it’s no wonder that Democrats here and nationally are claiming that Republican Rob Cornilles, in the 1st Congressional District special election, wants to privatize Medicare. He faces Democrat Suzanne Bonamici in the Jan. 31 election.

Democrats’ statements have ranged from the specific to the general. Here’s an example: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tweeted Jan. 10, ""Did you know Cornilles said he'd support turning parts of Medicare over to private insurance companies?""

The committee’s first ad against Cornilles showed these words on screen -- ""Turning over Medicare to private insurance companies"" -- while the announcer says that Cornilles supports ""Turning over some of Medicare to private insurance companies.""  

And finally, a Jan. 18 press statement from the Bonamici campaign includes a quote from the Oregon State Council for Retired Citizens PAC:

""To set the record straight: Suzanne Bonamici is the only candidate in this election that Oregon seniors can count on to stand up for them in Congress and to protect – not privatize – Medicare and Social Security.""

See?

For the record, Cornilles denies he wants to privatize Medicare. Also, he does not support a system where the government would give seniors ""voucher"" money to get health insurance on their own a la the 2011 plan from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.,which was essentially a privatization plan.

What Cornilles has said is that he supports the new Medicare reform plan that Ryan has with Oregon’s Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, which calls for more private competition. Earlier, Cornilles also said that he supports a ""hybrid"" approach of both traditional Medicare and a private option.

But is that fair to call it outright privatization? And is offering a private option the same thing as turning over part of Medicare to private insurance companies?

Let’s not forget that Medicare currently contains a private option: It’s called Medicare Advantage. Seniors can buy plans from private insurers that wrap prescription, hospital and doctor coverage into one tidy package. Traditional Medicare, on the other hand, is a fee-for-services plan.

There are many reasons seniors may opt for one or the other, says Joe Baker, president of the nonpartisan advocacy Medicare Rights Center. In Oregon, about 40 percent of seniors have Medicare Advantage.

So if current Medicare already has a private option -- or is partially privatized -- what’s the big deal with what Cornilles has said?

Well, he likes the proposal put forth by Ryan and Wyden. Bonamici and other Democrats do not. And there seems to be some genuine debate over whether the proposal moves toward privatization.

""Basically, the Wyden-Ryan proposal would significantly privatize the Medicare program; it would retain the original government-run Medicare program as a plan you would choose, but that doesn’t mean that’s not privatizing Medicare,"" said Baker of the Medicare Rights Center.

""It would turn Medicare into a voucher-like program and move it away from a defined benefit (system) to defined contribution (system).""

Max Richtman is president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, whose political action committee has endorsed Bonamici.

He agrees with Baker that the Wyden-Ryan plan does not preserve traditional Medicare, because it offers vouchers for seniors to buy health care insurance, including traditional Medicare. The value of the vouchers would be capped, leaving seniors to shoulder the costs of any health care costs that outpace inflation, he said.

But Jennifer Hoelzer, Wyden’s press secretary, strenuously disputes the privatization assertion.

The proposal calls for a new system, sometime in the future, where private insurers would submit health plans with monthly premiums for review to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. The amount of money seniors would receive in ""premium support"" to pay for Medicare plans would be based on the second-cheapest plan or traditional Medicare, whichever is less expensive.

Should seniors pick a cheaper plan, they’d get to keep the difference, Hoelzer said. Should they pick a pricier plan, they would pay out of pocket as they do now.

Any legislation would retain strict controls over what private insurers can offer and traditional Medicare would be guaranteed one of the choices, she said.

We’ve digressed a bit but understanding the plan is important since so many people see it as a sign of Cornilles’ support of privatization.

Steve Weiss, president of the Oregon State Council for Retired Citizens PAC, acknowledges that Medicare Advantage is ""partial privatization, but I think that Cornilles has upped the ante in that with his support of the Wyden-Ryan plan.""

In the debate over the Wyden-Ryan plan, we see increased private options for Medicare, a program that already includes private options. We do not see the proposal as removing the government from providing Medicare.

Democrats assert that Cornilles wants to privatize Medicare -- all or part of it -- and turn it over to insurance companies while Bonamici wants to protect it. Nowhere has Cornilles said that he wants to privatize Medicare, and he has rejected a plan that calls for vouchers.

The statement contains a nugget of truth: Cornilles certainly wants more private competition in Medicare and it’s probably fair to say that he’s more enthusiastic than Bonamici about introducing even more private elements into Medicare.

But that doesn’t mean he wants to privatize Medicare. And his encouraging private competition doesn’t change the fact that Medicare currently has a private option. Those two factors are what we call critical facts that would give a different impression.

We rule the statement Mostly False.

Mitt Romney said he fought cap and trade while Newt Gingrich supported it
","Mitt Romney fought back against surging rival Newt Gingrich, fresh off a South Carolina primary win, during the Jan. 23 debate in Tampa. To emphasize his credibility as a conservative leader, Romney brought up how Gingrich resigned as speaker of the House ""in disgrace,"" and that he's been ""working as an influence peddler in Washington"" in the years since. And another thing...

""When I was fighting against cap and trade, the speaker was sitting down with Nancy Pelosi on a sofa encouraging it,"" Romney said.

Ouch. If you're a GOP presidential contender, it'd be hard to think of a more toxic couch-fellow than Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and a former speaker herself.

But the bipartisan canoodling happened.

We know because we've examined this line in some form twice this campaign season. It's been used by super PACs supporting Romney and departed candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry.

Back in 2008 in a television ad, Pelosi and Gingrich sat on a couch and had a smiley chat about climate change:

""We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?"" Pelosi says.

""No,"" Gingrich answers, ""but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change.""

Pelosi: ""We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast.""

Gingrich: ""If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need.""

The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, ""Together, we can do this.""

The commercial was created by a climate-change awareness organization now known as the Climate Reality Project, which former vice president Al Gore founded. (WeCanSolveIt.org is the old name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org.)

Gingrich and Pelosi were asked to do the bit as part of a larger campaign featuring unlikely pairs who can agree on the need to act on climate change, Gore said in an interview with The Young Turks, an online news show, in December 2011.

Gingrich has since renounced the collaboration, saying in a Fox News interview in November that it was ""probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done."" A section of his website called ""Answering the Attacks"" says, ""Newt absolutely opposes 'cap and trade' as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions.""

What is cap and trade? The idea is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon different companies can emit. The government then issues permits to businesses - typically electric utilities and manufacturers - and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those that lower emissions most effectively.

The Gingrich and Pelosi ad didn't specifically mention cap and trade, but our previous research has shown Gingrich supported cap and trade as recently as 2007. Romney said that Gingrich was sitting on the couch encouraging cap and trade, but Gingrich didn't specifically mention the policy in that ad.

This brings us to the second part of the claim, that while Gingrich was couch sitting, Romney was ""fighting against cap and trade.""

Like Gingrich, Romney has changed his public statements on cap and trade. As Massachusetts governor in 2003, Romney joined in support of a compact among several northeastern states to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. In a letter to then-New York Gov. George Pataki, he said, ""I concur that climate change is beginning to affect our natural resources and that now is the time to take action toward climate protection."" The Economist named him a ""Climate-Friendly"" Republican in 2004.

But in 2005, the same day he announced he would not seek re-election, Romney abruptly pulled out of the regional cap-and-trade agreement. He told the New York Times the pact did not protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs. Environmental advocates fumed.

Let's recap: Gingrich certainly appeared in a 2008 video with Pelosi and said ""we must take action to address climate change."" He didn't specifically promote cap and trade, though he had supported it in the past. It's also true that Romney rejected what was hailed as a landmark regional cap-and-trade agreement among several northeastern states in 2005 -- although it came after two years of him touting its merit. Both facets of Romney's claim are factual, though they did not occur simultaneously, as his use ""while"" would suggest. They actually were three years apart. We rate Romney's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BE7800>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-fought-cap-and-trade-newt-gingrich/

Mitt Romney says U.S. median income has declined 10 percent in the last four years
","
During the Jan. 23, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Mitt Romney offered an ominous statistic about how family finances have declined since the start of the last recession. 
He made the assertion when moderator Brian Williams of NBC News asked him, ""Gov. Romney, you talk about restoring America's greatness. Given that, in your view when was America last great?"" 
Romney responded, ""America still is great, but we have a lot of people suffering. We have people that are underemployed that shouldn't be, unemployed that shouldn't be. Home values continue to go down. We have the median income in this country has declined 10 percent in the last four years. We're still a great nation, but a great nation doesn't have so many people suffering."" 
We wondered whether he was correct that ""the median income in this country has declined 10 percent in the last four years."" 
As we awaited a response from the Romney camp, we looked at the official government statistics, which come from a data set of the U.S. Census Bureau called the Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. 
We looked at the trend for inflation-adjusted median incomes for households between 2007 and 2010, and between 2006 and 2010, both of which could be considered as the ""last four years."" The figures are produced annually and are not yet available for 2011 -- a key point we’ll return to in a moment. 
Between 2007 and 2010, the median declined by 6.3 percent, while between 2006 and 2010, the median declined by 5.1 percent. Both figures amount to considerably less than the 10 percent decline Romney specified. What gives? 
The Romney camp explained that they had taken the statistic from a report published by a private agency, Sentier Research, based on other Census Bureau data. Last year, Sentier initiated a new statistic -- a ""household income index"" that tracks upticks and downticks in median income on a monthly basis, rather than annually. 
The Census Bureau ""will not issue an official estimate for 2011 until this coming September,"" said Gordon Green, one of the firm’s principals and a co-author of the report Romney referenced. But with the economy struggling and a presidential election looming, he said, ""people want to know."" The index allows economists to pinpoint income studies more narrowly than they can with annual figures, since the beginnings and ends of recessions do not typically track the calendar year. 
To create the index, Green and his colleague John Coder took data from the Census Bureau’s monthly household survey -- the one that’s used to determine the national unemployment rate. This sample reaches approximately 50,000 households and 130,000 household members each month, asking a variety of questions, including the sum of income earned by household members during previous 12 months. 
When Green and Coder released their October report, the finding was striking enough to be written about prominently in the New York Times. 
Between December 2007 -- the official beginning of the last recession -- and June 2011, ""real median annual household income has declined by 9.8 percent,"" the authors wrote. ""A decline of this magnitude represents a significant reduction in the American standard of living."" 
This finding -- a nearly 10 percent decline -- was what Romney was referring to in the debate, his campaign confirmed to PolitiFact. 
But that isn’t the end of the story. 
Green told us that the 9.8 percent figure is now outdated. In July, the index fell again, but in August 2011 it began ticking up and has continued increasing through November 2011. The new decline is 8.2 percent, rather than 9.8. The new figures for December are due out within days, Green said. 
So by not referring to the most recent report, Romney overstates the scale of the decline. 
There are two other issues we think are worth mentioning. 
First, both the Sentier data and the annual median income data from the Census Bureau that we cited earlier refer to pre-tax income and exclude ""near-cash"" benefits such as food stamps and housing assistance. However, several economists told PolitiFact that using post-tax income and including food stamps and housing assistance in the calculation (data that is generally hard to come by) would likely show smaller declines than the ones recorded by either the Sentier or official Census Bureau data, and would offer a more useful picture of what was actually happening economically on the household level. The difference would stem in part from payroll tax cuts and tax credits signed by President Barack Obama, as well as growing numbers of Americans receiving food stamps in recent years -- neither of which are reflected in the figures Romney cited. 
Second, the Sentier data set is new, and lacks the outside scrutiny that comes with a years-long track record. 
On the plus side, Green and Coder came to Sentier after long careers at the Census Bureau -- Green as chief of the governments division and Coder as chief of the income statistics branch -- and their firm’s client list, according to its website, includes such prominent institutions as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Social Security Administration, the Urban Institute, the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, several universities and the Census Bureau itself. 
Still, outside economists said the new index is going to have to prove its accuracy over the long term. Due to the limitations in the available census data, Sentier’s methodology includes a series of complicated adjustments, and it uses a four-month ""moving"" average for its data, in which one-quarter of the data every month is new, with the oldest one-fourth of the data jettisoned. The co-authors wrote that they did this because ""estimates based solely on the 25-percent sample entering in a single month exhibit an unacceptable level of sampling variability."" 
""Assuming it’s been matched against previous, authoritative measures of median income based on detailed questionnaires or income tax data,"" the new household income index ""may provide a useful, up-to-date indicator of current money income trends,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""All I know for sure is that the Green-Coder estimate is not yet considered authoritative by any income expert that I know."" 
Our ruling 
In the debate, Romney used a relatively new measurement to make his point -- one that shows higher declines in income than the standard statistics do. The statistics Romney used were created by two veteran Census Bureau number crunchers, and experts say that their approach includes both advantages (notably, timeliness) and disadvantages (most importantly, a short track record). 
More important for our analysis, though, is also the numbers Romney used are outdated. Over the most recent four months, the statistics show median income rebounding, making the decline since the start of the last recession smaller than Romney said it was. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970098C0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-median-income-has-declined-10-/

Newt Gingrich says Miami Dade College students speak 86 languages
","Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are trying to woo Spanish-speaking voters despite taking stances that have alienated some Hispanics.

One of the debate moderators pounced on that hypocrisy at the Jan. 23, 2012, debate in Tampa.

Here’s how Beth Reinhard of the National Journal (and a former Miami Herald politics writer) posed her question:

""All of you favor making English the official language of the United States, which could mean that ballots and other government documents would not be available in Spanish. But, Speaker Gingrich, you’re sending out press releases in Spanish; Governor Romney, you’re advertising in Spanish. Why is it okay for you to court voters in Spanish, but not okay for the government to serve them in Spanish? Speaker Gingrich?""

""Well, first of all, you immediately jump down to a very important language, but not the only language,"" Gingrich answered. ""The challenge of the United States is simple. There are 86 languages in Miami Dade College, 86. There are over 200 languages spoken in Chicago. Now, how do you unify the country? What is the common bond that enables people to be both citizens and to rise commercially and have a better life and a greater opportunity?""

To unify the country, Gingrich said, ""I think it is essential to have a central language that we expect people to learn and to be able to communicate with each other in.""

Reinhard: ""So to be clear, you would only have ballots in English?""

Gingrich: ""I would have ballots in English. And I think you could have programs where virtually everybody would be able to read the ballots.""

We couldn’t resist checking Gingrich’s detail that ""there are 86 languages in Miami Dade College."" Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond told us in an email that Gingrich was referring to the number of languages spoken by students.

First, a word about Miami Dade College. The school calls itself the ""largest and most diverse college in the nation."" Its website states that it enrolls more minorities than any other college or university in the country, including the most Hispanics.

Miami Dade College spokesman Juan Mendieta told us that the 174,000 students speak 85 languages in addition to English, for a total of 86 languages for the 2010-11 year. Those students come from 181 countries. Both numbers are based on what students reported during the admissions process, he said.

""It could be potentially more languages -- these are the languages students said they speak,"" Mendieta said. Mendieta said: ""It’s basically representing every one of the four corners of the earth. At graduation we parade across the stage the flags representing the study body. … The last flag on stage, which brings down the house, is the American flag.""

The college reported in 2010 that English was the native language of half the students, Spanish was the native language of 43 percent, and Creole/French was the third-most common. Among the less common: Assamese (a language spoken in India), Breton (a Celtic language spoken in parts of France) and Wolof (an African language). The 86 languages spoken by students at Miami Dade College were also cited in a proposed 2010 U.S. Senate resolution congratulating Miami Dade College on its 50th anniversary.

The college’s diversity and size make it a common stop in recent years for presidents and presidential candidates from both parties. The college was expecting a visit from Romney on Jan. 25, 2012, and a group of students were planning to attend an event with Gingrich at the Univision studio on Jan. 25, said Mendieta. Gingrich said, ""There are 86 languages in Miami Dade College, 86."" We found that in this case Gingrich has a good memory for detail. We rate this claim Verdad, or Vrai, or True.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea16445b-aab3-4ec2-b95e-f7a440067dbb",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BC8600>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-miami-dade-college-students-speak-86/

Rick Santorum says a 2008 spike in oil prices caused Florida's economy to falter
","
In a Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., candidate Rick Santorum said building oil rigs and pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico was ""the best way to create a good economy for the state.""

In fact, high oil prices were what had weakened the state's economy in the first place, he said at the Jan. 23, 2012, debate.

""What threatens the tourist industry in Florida, as we've seen, is a very bad economy, and a very bad economy that became a bad economy why?"" he said. ""Because of a huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008.""

We remember 2008 — that was the year that housing prices were falling, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch collapsed, Lehman Bros. filed for bankruptcy, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were on life support, credit dried up and the Dow Jones index dropped nearly 800 points in a day. Average Americans started to hear terms like ""credit default swap"" for the first time.

Meanwhile, the average price for a gallon of gas jumped above $4. In July, oil hit $150 a barrel.

We wondered: Did Florida's economy falter because of a ""huge huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008?""

Tourism vs. drilling

The subject arose in the debate in Tampa — an area where a gulf oil rig gusher off the coast of Louisiana in 2010 had idled fishing boats and scared off tourists — when panelist Beth Reinhard of the National Journal asked about oil drilling and the economy. 
""The state's most optimistic estimates say more drilling would create 5,000 jobs, but an oil spill would threaten Florida's tourism industry, which employs nearly 1 million people,"" she said. ""Is that worth the risk?""

Santorum replied:

""What threatens the tourist industry in Florida, as we've seen, is a very bad economy, and a very bad economy that became a bad economy why? Because of a huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008. So energy is absolutely key to keep all of our country healthy, specifically Florida, which is a destination place.""

What role did volatile oil prices in 2008 play in Florida's economy?

""Oil price spikes clearly hurt, but Florida was already mired in recession by then,"" said Mark Vitner, senior economist with Wells Fargo, who tracks trends in the state. ""Florida's housing markets began to weaken considerably in 2006, and the recession likely began in the state by the spring of 2007.""

Even during a wider economic downturn, energy markets still managed to attract attention. The Palm Beach Post named ""oil prices"" one of its top 10 national stories of the year, along with ""economic meltdown."" But oil prices didn't make its list of top local and state stories. Two that did make it? ""Florida budget crisis, economy worsen,"" and ""foreclosure, credit crunch hurt state's real-estate market.""

In June, economists credited higher gas prices for rising unemployment. Higher fuel costs were pushing up prices on food and other goods. That might have been driving more teens and stay-at-home mothers to re-enter the workforce, University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith told the Times.

At the time, the unemployment rate in April 2008 was 4.9 percent and rising. Oil prices peaked in July.

In Snaith's August 2008 forecast, oil prices were mentioned only as a welcome development — they were falling.

The state's long-range financial outlook, released in the fall, noted the flagging economy, saying: ""Largely, these changes were related to Florida’s troubled housing market and the worsening national outlook.""

The only mention of oil or gasoline prices in the report were gas prices' causing a downturn in Lottery ticket sales.

By October, as the wider economy worsened enough to invite comparisons with the early 1970s, another Times story noted differences between the two downturns: ""The 1973 turndown was fueled by a crippling oil embargo and extended by surging inflation. This one had its roots in a housing bust and the ripple of bad mortgage loans. It was pushed into overdrive by fearful financial institutions that cut off the flow of credit.""

At the time of the article, gas was already expected to drop below $3 a gallon.

By December, that $150-a-barrel oil had dropped to $33 a barrel. But the state's unemployment rate had soared to 8.1 percent.

The biggest culprit noted in a story by the Times? The housing downturn.

We sought out Scott Brown, chief economist for Raymond James Equity Research in St. Petersburg, Fla.

""Higher gasoline prices were a factor in the economic downturn, but the collapse of the housing bubble and deleveraging were much bigger issues,"" he said.

(As for gas prices' influence on tourism, there is some, Brown said. ""However,"" he concluded, ""the 2010 oil spill had a clear negative impact."")

Economist Tony Villamil, dean of the business school at St. Thomas University, called oil prices ""a minor factor.""

Our ruling 
Rick Santorum said Florida's economy ""became a bad economy ... because of a huge spike in oil prices in the summer of 2008.""

He's right that an oil price peak in July 2008 did drive up other costs and perhaps bumped up the unemployment rate as more strapped Floridians sought to work to help cover prices at the pump.

But a burst housing bubble already had Florida's economy flailing.

And as oil prices dove the second half of the year, collapses in housing and banking drove Florida unemployment into far more dire territory, creating the ""bad economy"" Floridians still face.

Were oil prices a factor? Sure. But scarcely a significant one, as Santorum made it sound. We rate his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097823BC0>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-2008-spike-oil-prices-caused-fl/

Rick Santorum calls Newt Gingrich a longtime supporter of insurance mandate
","
In the ongoing contest to determine which Republican presidential candidate is ""sufficiently conservative,"" former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum rattled off a list of issues where Newt Gingrich comes up short.

One of the marks against the former House speaker, Santorum said in a primary debate on Jan. 23, 2012: Gingrich ""for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate.""

The individual mandate is a requirement that people buy health insurance and is the centerpiece of the national health reform legislation signed by President Barack Obama. It is now almost universally maligned by Republicans.

But, as PolitiFact has found before, it wasn’t always the target of Gingrich’s scorn.

Going back to 1993

When we first looked into this, we were checking a statement made by Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann in a December 2011 debate. Bachmann, who later bowed out of the presidential race, said Gingrich backed the mandate at two different times -- in 1993 and in 2011.

Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Oct. 3, 1993, at a time when the Clinton administration was trying to pass a health-care overhaul. On the May 15, 2011, edition of Meet the Press, host David Gregory replayed a clip from Gingrich’s 1993 appearance that addressed the individual mandate.

""I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance.""

He went on to criticize Clinton’s plan as ""destructively big-government."" But he also said, ""I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that.""

And since then

Gingrich has addressed the individual mandate numerous times since 1993.

In 2005, he took part in a health care discussion with none other than Hillary Clinton, saying people should have to buy insurance or post a bond to pay for future care. (Check out the video here.)

Quick comparison: an individual mandate requires people to buy insurance or pay a fine in the form of tax penalties. The bond idea also requires people to buy insurance, and if they don’t, to put up money to be set aside to pay for their future medical care.

Gingrich repeated his support for a bond in a 2007 column for his think tank Health Transformation, writing, ""in order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond.""

And again in his 2009 book ""Real Change: the Fight for America’s Future"": ""Those who oppose the concept of insurance should be forced to post a bond to cover costs. Allowing individuals to pass their health costs on to others reinforces the attitude that their health is not their problem and adds to the irresponsible, unhealthy behaviors that bankrupt the current system.""  

By the time he appeared on Meet the Press in May 2011, he was calling this concept ""a variation"" on the individual mandate.

""Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care . And, and I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond … or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable,"" he said.

(That remark stirred up so much controversy in Republican circles that Gingrich was compelled to issue a video statement the next day clarifying that he is ""completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals. ... I'm against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone, because it is fundamentally wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional."")
   
Working out the details of a bond system to pay for future health care -- such as how much would need to be set aside and how -- poses challenges.

""A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in (Mitt) Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game,"" said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable.""

Our ruling

Santorum said Gingrich ""for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate."" We found no references earlier than 1993, when Gingrich said ""I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance.""

In the years since, he made repeated statements asserting that people who don’t purchase insurance should have to do so or to post a bond, a concept he calls ""a variation"" on the mandate.

While the specifics of Gingrich’s viewpoint on the individual mandate have shifted -- ending with his opposition to it now -- it’s clear that for most of two decades he planted himself comfortably on the spectrum of compelling people to have health insurance. That’s enough to rate Santorum’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972BA240>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-calls-newt-gingrich-longtime-support/

Eddie Lucio says Texas does not regulate the appearance of some kinds of imitation firearms sold in Texas
","
A Democratic state senator called for regulations after police fatally shot a 15-year-old boy who was brandishing what turned out to be a non-lethal air pistol.

In an interview posted online Jan. 6, 2012, by KRGV-TV, Channel 5, Eddie Lucio of Brownsville said: ""First of all I think that there should be a prohibition of some kind on the appearance of these pellet guns and airsoft guns that are sold in the state of Texas."" At least, Lucio said, such guns should visibly stand out so ""we understand exactly what they are.""

In the same segment, reporter Eddie Flores said Lucio told him that ""right now, there are no known regulations or prohibitions in the appearance of pellet guns or airsoft guns in the state of Texas."" 
No regulations in Texas? 
When we inquired, Lucio’s legislative director, Sara González,said the senator intended to stress the lack of state, not federal, regulations of the facsimile firearms’ appearances.

Airsoft guns, she said, are required by federal law to display a 6-millimeter orange tip, a mandate that doesn’t apply to pellet or BB guns. ""What (Lucio) meant is there is nothing in the state that we know of,"" she said. ""There’s federal regulation on airsoft guns, but that doesn’t apply necessarily to metal pellet-type guns or BB guns.""

In the Jan. 4, 2012, incident at a Brownsville middle school, the student was wielding a Umarex SA177, according to news accounts. The device solely fires steel BBs, Justin Biddle, a marketing manager at Umarex USA, told us in an interview.

González helped us isolate the federal law that regulates the appearance of imitation firearms, stipulating the 6-millimeter orange marking requirement for airsoft guns. Those guns shoot projectiles at a lower speed than pellet or BB guns, according to Jeffrey Welty, an assistant professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina School of Government, who specializes in criminal law and procedure.

But the marking requirement does not apply to ""traditional BB, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure,"" the law says.

So, the gun used in Brownsville was exempt from federal marking requirements.

In the wake of the shooting, the office of Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, also examined legal issues related to facsimile firearms, said J.J. Garza, Oliveira’s chief of staff. Garza pointed us to another part of the U.S. Code, Section G, which states that federal provisions on imitation gun identification supersede such local or state laws and ordinances.

But are there state and local restrictions anyway?  

Meagan Dorsch, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of State Legislatures, emailed us the organization’s July 2011 list showing states with imitation firearm statutes:  Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin.

We wondered how any state statutes survive without conflicting with the superseding federal law. By addressing aspects not included in the federal provisions, advised David Kopel, an expert on firearms policy and research director at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank in Colorado. For instance, he said by email, ""Louisiana’s statutes only applies to guns that fire blanks, and those aren't covered by the federal law.""

Separately, experts at the Texas Legislative Library said that some Texas cities, including Plano, Horseshoe Bay, Farmers Branch and Carrollton have local ordinances that regulate how people display facsimile firearms--no reckless displays of imitation guns in public places, for example--but these statutes don’t regulate the appearance of the guns.

Our ruling

There are no state-level regulations of the appearance of pellet/BB or airsoft guns sold in Texas, but federal law requires airsoft guns to have special markings -- a wrinkle Lucio did not clarify.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Tom Price']","
Congressman's claim about Medicare mostly rings true
","
Seniors, if you’re struggling to find a doctor that takes Medicare, U.S. Rep. Tom Price has diagnosed your problem.

Doctors won’t take patients covered by the federal health insurance program for seniors because Medicare pays them less than what the care actually costs, Price said in a recent op-ed in the Boston Herald.

""Already, nearly one in three primary care doctors are forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see,"" said Price, who worked as an orthopedic surgeon.

We thought the Roswell Republican’s number was worth a closer look. If there is a problem, it could get worse Feb. 29.

That’s when Medicare will cut doctor pay by some 27 percent, unless Congress does something about it.

Medicare calculates how much it pays doctors according to a special formula set up in 1997 to keep the federal deficit in check. In 2002, that formula gave doctors a pay cut, but physician backlash was so bad that lawmakers have put off reductions ever since.

Each time Congress puts off the problem, the cost of fixing it grows.

We asked Price spokesman Ryan Murphy for more information on the congressman’s Medicare figure. He said it was confirmed by a May 2010 survey by the American Medical Association, a group that represents doctors’ interests and promotes medicine and public health.

The AMA’s online survey of more than 9,000 physicians found that 31 percent of primary care doctors ""restrict"" the number of Medicare patients in their practice.

Some of these doctors don’t accept new Medicare patients, and only treat the ones they already have. Others have stopped treating them at all.

Some 83 percent said they did so because Medicare payment rates are too low, the AMA survey said. And 82 percent said they made the move because they were concerned about the threat of future payment cuts.

We asked the AMA for the poll’s methodology and found it has a major shortcoming. It wasn’t scientific. Also, the AMA is a powerful lobbying group with its own set of interests.

We therefore sought out data from independent sources that took a scientific approach.

The data we found was not strictly comparable to the AMA’s, but it did tell us that the findings of the physicians group did not clash with other research.

For instance, there’s a 2008 survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change, which provides research used by the federal government and policymakers on both sides of the aisle. The center conducted a nationally representative mail survey of 4,700 physicians.  

It found that among primary care physicians, 37 percent said they accept some or no new Medicare patients. Of those, more than 56 percent said that inadequate reimbursements were a moderately important or very important reason why.

About 48 percent of those who restricted how many Medicare patients they took on said a moderately important or very important reason why was that their practices were already at capacity.

There’s also 2009 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that some 19 percent of primary care physicians did not accept any new Medicare patients. This number is a lot lower than the AMA’s figure, but it doesn’t mean the doctors group is incorrect.

About 10 percent of the CDC’s respondents said they did not know if they accepted new Medicare patients. Also, the data did not specify whether the doctors who accept new ones limit how many they bring on.

On its face, the AMA data is not unreasonable. None of the data we reviewed expressly contradicts the finding that 31 percent of primary care doctors ""restrict"" the number of Medicare patients in their practice.

Furthermore, data from the Center for Studying Health System Change appear to support the AMA’s finding.

So, is Dr. Price right? Are nearly one in three primary care doctors ""forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see""?

The congressman’s number seems sensible, but his language is overheated. It’s not clear that the physicians who drop or restrict Medicare were ""forced"" to do so because of declining reimbursements or red tape.

Nearly half of the primary care physicians responding to the Center for Studying Health System Change survey said one of the reasons they accept so few new Medicare patients is that their practices are full.

We recommend Price give his feverish rhetoric an aspirin. And it wouldn’t hurt if he got a second or third opinion on the American Medical Association’s data.

Price earns a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809781D900>],/factchecks/2012/jan/24/tom-price/congressmans-claim-about-medicare-mostly-rings-tru/

Robert Hagan says Youngstown never had an earthquake until John Kasich was elected governor
","
When a 4.0 earthquake likely caused by fracking waste injected into a fault line occurred in Youngstown on New Year's Eve, one of the residents whose home was shaken by the quake was state Rep. Robert Hagan.

The veteran Democratic lawmaker from Youngstown has a well-earned reputation for being outspoken so it's no surprise that Hagan has taken the lead in calling for a moratorium on injecting waste deep into the ground and asking pointed questions about the incident..

At a Jan. 10 statehouse protest to support the moratorium on waste disposal wells, Hagan told the crowd that the earthquake had raised a number of questions including why Gov. John Kasich's administration did not react more quickly to 10 smaller earthquakes which had struck the Youngstown area in the 10 months preceding the New Year’s Eve shake-up.

The Democratic lawmaker even seemed to lay the blame for the quake at the feet of Kasich.

""We never had an earthquake in Youngstown until John Kasich was elected Governor,"" Hagan said.

Hagan's claim shook up the sensors at the Politifact Ohio monitoring center. Was Youngstown really earthquake-free until John Kasich became the state's chief executive on Jan. 10, 2011?

We contacted Hagan who said he consulted a map of earthquakes in Ohio produced by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources before he made his comment. ""Sure, there's been some minor seismic activity, but earthquakes -- which is a 2.0 (on the Richter Scale) or better -- haven't happened until the past year,"" Hagan said. ""That's what ODNR's own map shows.""

We checked with ODNR and the state's seismic monitoring system -- which has only been in place since about 1999 hasn't detected any earthquakes in the Youngstown area prior to March 2011. ""We have not recorded a significantly felt seismic event in Youngstown since the networks were put in place about 1999,"" said Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokesman Carlo LoParo.

Prior to the monitoring equipment being in place, ODNR’s record of historical earthquakes in Ohio relies on other monitoring systems such as those done by the U.S. Geological Survey and accounts from newspaper reports. And those don't show any earthquakes in Youngstown.

However, LoParo said there have been other earthquakes nearby that were felt in Youngstown. ""There have been some significant earthquakes in Ashtabula, Summit County and Mercer County, Pennsylvania that were felt across northeast Ohio and in Youngstown,"" LoParo said.

Youngstown State professor Jeffrey Dick, the chair of the school’s Geological and Environmental Sciences Department, also confirmed that Youngstown itself has been a quiet zone seismically before the recent series of earthquakes thought to be linked to the injection well.

""Earthquakes in this part of Ohio are pretty uncommon,"" he said. ""The reason is that underneath the ground in this part of the state is what's known as the Grenville Province -- it's a body of rock that is sometimes known as the Precambrian basement rock of Ohio. And it doesn't have major structural features that would cause earthquakes."" Dick said he wasn't aware of any earthquakes centered in Youngstown prior to the recent series linked to the injection well.

He said most earthquakes in Ohio run along major fault lines, such as one running under eastern Lake Erie waters or another in western Ohio centered around Shelby County, not far from the Indiana border.

Indeed, it looks like Hagan is right that earthquakes haven't come to Youngstown before March 2011 when Kasich was governor.

But regardless of the timing of the quakes, Hagan makes a rhetorical stretch to imply that the earthquake happened because Kasich was governor.

The injection wells are not something that Kasich is the first governor to allow -- they have been around for several decades. And Kasich did not weaken regulations on drilling regulations or do anything that could be construed as making it more likely the earthquake would happen.

In fact, state regulators have said the company that owns the Youngstown well -- D&L Energy -- was not violating its permit by injecting too much waste or injecting it too quickly into the ground.

So let’s drill down to the core here:
  
Earthquakes linked to injection wells are relatively rare occurrences, so it seems that the Kasich administration is probably more unlucky than anything to be in charge when it happened.

We’ll give Hagan a point for his geologic accuracy, but he can’t shake the fact that Kasich isn’t the cause of the quakes.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate his claim Half True.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Newt Gingrich's contract was with Freddie Mac's lobbyists
","
With the Republican primary battle moving into Florida, Mitt Romney went on the attack against the winner of the South Carolina primary, Newt Gingrich.

At a debate in Tampa, Romney criticized Gingrich for advising Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant that backs housing loans around the country.

Gingrich has said he was never a lobbyist for Freddie Mac, a statement we’ve rated Half True. Gingrich never had to register as a lobbyist, but it appears he took pains to avoid being subject to the rules.

Romney said during the debate that Gingrich’s contract ""was provided by the lobbyists at Freddie Mac."" We decided to check it out.

Gingrich’s consulting group was retained by Freddie Mac in 2006. The Gingrich campaign released a statement in November addressing Gingrich’s work.

""To be clear, Speaker Gingrich did no lobbying of any kind, nor did his firm. This was expressly written into the Gingrich Group contracts. Instead, the Gingrich Group was hired to offer strategic advice to Freddie Mac on a number of issues,"" the statement said.

The statement said Gingrich advised Freddie that it was dangerous to buy mortgage-backed securities based on questionable home loans. He also told Freddie on how to lower prescription drug costs for its employees. Finally, Freddie Mac ""was interested in advice on how to reach out to more conservatives.""

On the evening of the Tampa debate, the Gingrich Group released its contract with Freddie Mac for the year 2006. That contract shows that the Gingrich Group’s primary contact within Freddie Mac was Craig Thomas, who is named in the document as Freddie’s director of public policy. Thomas was also a registered lobbyist for Freddie Mac in 2006.

The 2006 contract doesn’t appear to cover all the work that the Gingrich Group did for Freddie Mac. Bloomberg News reported that Gingrich received between $1.6 million and $1.8 million in fees from two separate contracts. The number came from unnamed sources, though, so we can’t independently confirm or refute it. The contract released before the debate in Tampa showed Gingrich Group was to be paid $25,000 per month in 2006.

To be a registered lobbyist, one has to meet a number of detailed rules laid out in federal law. One of the main rules is that a person has to register if he or she holds two or more meetings with elected officials or staff in any quarter of the year on behalf of a client. Also, lobbying activities must constitute 20 percent or more of the lobbyist’s time during any three-month period. (Want more detail? Read 27 pages of guidance on disclosing lobbying activities via the U.S. Senate website.)

Experts we spoke with and the research we reviewed showed the ""strategic advice"" category is a way of using influence without having to register as a lobbyist.

They said strategic advisers can do quite a bit for clients like Freddie Mac without acquiring the lobbyist label. They can stay at the client’s office and give their best advice on with whom to meet and what to say. They can give instructions to someone who is a registered lobbyist, again telling the lobbyist with whom to meet and what points to address. They can take their clients to meetings with groups that aren’t part of the government, such as grassroots political groups. They can even have one big meeting with an elected official to make a case for a client.

""There’s a lot of activity that ordinary people would think of as lobbying that doesn’t trigger the obligation to register as a lobbyist under federal law. Strategic advice is one of those kinds of things that doesn’t,"" said Joseph Sandler, an attorney with the Washington law firm Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb, when we spoke with him in December.

Sandler was one of four co-chairs of an American Bar Association task force that recommended changes to federal lobbying laws to improve disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest. One of its recommendations was that people who give strategic advice disclose their work under a new category of ""lobbying support.""

We should also note that people from both parties play this game. Former U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was a ""policy adviser"" at the lobbying firms Alston & Bird and DLA Piper. He had to answer questions about his work when President Barack Obama selected him to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. (Daschle ended up withdrawing over tax issues connected to another client giving him the use of a car and driver.)

""Newt Gingrich is certainly not alone among well-heeled political players who say they just offer consulting services or strategic advice -- without needing to register as lobbyists. But it's a stretch to claim that they aren't part of the influence game,"" said Michael Beckel, a spokesman with the Center for Responsive Politics, via email. The nonpartisan group monitors lobbying and campaign spending.

Our ruling
