Brooks claims that preventive care will cost the government
","The logic behind preventive care seems simple enough: stopping illnesses before they happen will mean fewer pricey procedures at the hospital and lower health care costs for all.
 
Not so, says columnist David Brooks, who was interviewed on the Aug. 14, 2009, edition of the  NewsHour with Jim Lehrer  .
 
He said President Barack Obama claims that ""preventive care saves money,"" but the reality is ""that's not true. ... If you're testing people, say, for an illness, you have to give 100 people a test to get five people — to find five people. Now, preventive care is good for health. Everyone agrees on that. But if you look at the CBO studies and the other research, it doesn't save you money. We should do it. But because you have to test so many people to get the few you're really going to prevent serious illness from, you're really not adding up to a lot of cost saving.""
 
Brooks was talking about a core principle of Obama's health care overhaul: That many costly procedures and treatments can be prevented by catching disease earlier or preventing it all together. Operating under that logic, the House health care bill expands access to procedures such as hypertension screening and vaccines. 
 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer sang the praises of preventive care in an Aug. 10  USA Today  op-ed. ""Reform will also mean higher-quality care by promoting preventive care so health problems can be addressed before they become crises,"" they wrote. ""This, too, will save money. We'll be a much healthier country if all patients can receive regular checkups and tests, such as mammograms and diabetes exams, without paying a dime out-of-pocket.""
 
Brooks's critique relied on new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office that indicate that preventive care isn't as cost-effective as Pelosi and Hoyer claim.
 
""The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall,"" CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. 
 
Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive:
 
""But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. ... Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it.""
 
In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on.

The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in the House bills because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the  New England Journal of Medicine  that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care.

""Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching,"" according to the paper. ""Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs.""

And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, ""as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs.""

So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it's a stretch to say that it will save government spending on health care. As a result, we give Brooks a True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9C0A80>],/factchecks/2009/aug/17/david-brooks/brooks-claims-preventive-care-will-cost-government/

U.S. Chamber of Commerce Ad says health reform plan would mean big tax increases
","
The Campaign for Responsible Health Reform, sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, released a 30-second TV commercial that warns the health plans kicking around in Congress will translate to ""big tax increases.""
 
With the visual of a red balloon expanding until it pops, the announcer says: ""Washington's latest health reform idea: a trillion-dollar health plan, and a government-run public option, with big tax increases, even on health benefits. And the federal deficit? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the deficit will grow $239 billion. Inflated taxes. Swelling deficits. And expanded government control over your health. Tell Congress, 'Let's slow down and reform health care the right way.'""
 
There's no denying the health care plans being considered in Congress would be expensive. In order to meet the plan's goal of reducing the number of uninsured, the government would be providing more in health care subsidies. That costs money. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the plan would cost in the neighborhood of $1 trillion over 10 years.
 
But would it mean ""big tax increases, even on health benefits?""
 
The answer: It depends. There is not a single health care plan, there are several versions kicking around various committees in the House and Senate. And they have different approaches on how the plan would be paid for.
 
Most of the discussion has focused on the the House plans because there is not a detailed Senate version yet. In the House plan, the tax increases are targeted at the wealthy. So if you make $1 million a year, yes, the plan would mean a big tax increase.
 
We can be even more precise. The House versions of the bill would help pay for the health plan with a surtax on high earners that would break down as follows: for couples making between $350,000 and $500,000 (or $280,000 to $400,000 for individuals), a new 1 percent tax; between $500,000 and $1 million ($400,000 to $800,000 for individuals), 1.5 percent; and over $1 million (or over $800,000 for individuals), 5.4 percent. In other words, a family making $1 million would have to pay $9,000.
 
Small businesses filing as individuals would face the same levies at those income levels.
 
In all, that is estimated to bring in about $540 billion over 10 years.
 
""That hits the very top earners,"" said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""But that proposal would not affect many people.""
 
In fact, he said, less than 2 percent of the population fall into those income categories.
 
But according to the Chamber, the high earners aren't the only ones who will see tax increases.
 
In the House versions of the health plan, there's a tax penalty — anywhere from 2 percent to 8 percent on payroll taxes — for large companies that do not provide government-approved health care plans. There's also a tax penalty on uninsured people who refuse to buy insurance (that's the incentive to get everyone on some health plan).
 
As for the Chamber of Commerce claim that the plans would even include taxes on health benefits, you need to go to the Senate side for that discussion. Although there's nothing currently in writing in a bill, the Senate Finance Committee is mulling a tax on so-called ""Cadillac"" or ""gold-plated"" health plans, plans that cost well above average. Essentially it would tax any amount paid for insurance plans over a certain threshold — perhaps $8,000 for an individual, or $21,000 for a family, said James Galfand, senior manager of health policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. While it would not directly tax employees' health benefits, he said, it would amount to the same thing, as those costs would be passed on by the insurance company or employer.
 
We think the Chamber of Commerce ad is a bit premature in warning that the health plan would include taxes on health benefits. It might, but so far, that's not in any published version of the bill, and the House specifically did not include it in its plan.
 
The Chamber of Commerce ad does raise some legitimate concerns about how the health care plan would be paid for. But we think it's slightly misleading to say it would lead to ""big tax increases."" That's true for some high earners. But it's not true for the vast majority of people who do not make that level of income. Uninsured people who decline to purchase insurance will see a tax hit, but that's also expected to be a small minority.
 
Things may change as these bills seek to solve the question of paying for the plan, but as the plans are now, some people would see a big tax increase, but most would not. That leaves us at a Half True.

Reform plan caps out-of-pocket expenses
","
The White House is fighting chain e-mails with chain e-mails. 


After spending days responding to inaccurate e-mails about the health care reform plan, the White House responded with its own e-mail from David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. The subject line was ""Something worth forwarding.""
 
Axelrod began his e-mail with a list of ways that reform provides ""security and stability to those with or without coverage.""
 
One of his claims is that refom ""ends exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays: Insurance companies will have to abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses.""
 
We recognize that ""exorbitant"" is subjective, but we thought it would be helpful to research whether Axelrod is right that the plan limits charges that a typical person or family would find excessive.
 
The main health care reform bill in Congress does set annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses. That means there's a cap on what people would have to pay in a year for medical costs. And insurance companies won't be allowed to require patients to pay for preventive treatments such as check-ups.
 
In the House legislation, outlined in section 122, the annual cap on out-of-pocket expenses is $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. Those numbers are indexed for inflation.
 
The policy would be phased in. Employer-provided policies would have a grace period of five years, as outlined in section 102, before they are required to comply with the caps. If you get a new individual policy through the health care exchange, it would have to comply right away.
 
We asked Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund about the caps. The Commonwealth Fund is a nonpartisan private foundation that advocates for a better health care system. She said the caps are a good form of consumer protection.
 
Axelrod is correct that the main health care reform bill requires insurance companies to ""abide by yearly caps on how much they can charge for out-of-pocket expenses."" But ending ""exorbitant"" out-of-pocket expenses, deductibles or co-pays? 'Exorbitant' may be in the eye of the beholder. For a family, $10,000 in the course of a year can be a serious financial hit. (The median income for a family of four is $67,000.) Still, the new limits are better than nothing, and health care advocates praise them as an important safeguard for consumers. So we rate Axelrod's statement Mostly True.

Axelrod gets it right on vet benefits
","
The White House is fighting chain e-mails with chain e-mails. 


After spending days responding to inaccurate e-mails about the health care reform plan, the White House responded with its own e-mail from David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama. The subject line was ""Something worth forwarding.""
 
""This is probably one of the longest e-mails I’ve ever sent, but it could be the most important,"" Axelrod wrote. ""Across the country we are seeing vigorous debate about health insurance reform. Unfortunately, some of the old tactics we know so well are back — even the viral e-mails that fly unchecked and under the radar, spreading all sorts of lies and distortions.”


One such distortion, Axelrod said, is the suggestion that veterans' access to health care will be blocked by the bill. ""It’s a myth that health insurance reform will affect veterans' access to the care they get now,"" Axelrod wrote. ""To the contrary, the president's budget significantly expands coverage under the VA, extending care to 500,000 more veterans who were previously excluded. The VA health care system will continue to be available for all eligible veterans.""


The White House has also

posted a video

about the issue on its Web site.


The rumor may have started when a coalition of six veterans groups wrote a letter on July 30, 2009, to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing concern that the bill might penalize vets who get health coverage through the VA but don't have private health insurance.


The House version of the bill mandates coverage by requiring individuals to have a health insurance plan or pay a penalty based on their income. And businesses would have to contribute 65 percent of workers' family insurance premiums or pay an 8 percent penalty.


""We wanted to make sure that, if someone is enrolled with the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs], they didn't fall into this category"" of having to pay a fine because they didn't have private coverage, said David Autry, a spokesman for the Disabled American Veterans.


""Businesses might have been less willing to hire vets who may be enrolled in the VA health care plan,"" said Tom Zampieri, director of government relations for the Blinded Veterans Association.

 

Those concerns have since been addressed through a series of amendments to the House bill, according to Zampieri and Autry.


Nothing in the House bill would affect veterans' current coverage, they both said. Vets will continue to get those services from the VA.


""What the White House is saying is true,"" said Bernard Edelman, deputy director for policy and government affairs for the Vietnam Veterans of America.


Edelman said that another part of the White House claim – that “the president's budget significantly expands coverage under the VA, extending care to 500,000 more veterans who were previously excluded” – also adds up. Obama’s first budget plan opened the VA’s doors to about that many vets previously excluded from care.


So, by all accounts, the administration is correct that health care reform will not keep veterans from getting the care they currently receive. So for this one, Axelrod earns a True.

Obama claims Medicare benefits will not be cut under the health care bill
","
""I just want to assure [you] we're not talking about cutting Medicare benefits.""

Those were President Barack Obama's words to a town hall audience in Portsmouth, N.H; they were meant to ease fears that health care reform will slash Medicare benefits and deprive seniors of the treatments and procedures they need.

A ""myth that we've been hearing about is this notion that somehow we're going to be cutting your Medicare benefits,"" Obama said on Aug. 11, 2009. ""We are not. AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare, okay? So I just want seniors to be clear about this, because if you look at the polling, it turns out seniors are the ones who are most worried about health care reform. And that's understandable, because they use a lot of care, they've got Medicare, and it's already hard for a lot of people even on Medicare because of the supplements and all the other costs out of pocket that they're still paying.""

""So I just want to assure we're not talking about cutting Medicare benefits,"" Obama said.

Listening to Obama, you'd think that Medicare will remain intact. Yet, others claim Medicare spending will be trimmed quite a bit. AARP  has said  about $231.4 billion could come out of Medicare's budget, while the 60Plus Association, a group that opposes the bill,  says  cuts could top out at $500 billion.

Confused?
 
We were, too.

There are three versions of health care reform floating around the House, and each dedicates hundreds of pages to Medicare. For this Truth-O-Meter item, we're going to be focusing on the biggest changes to the program. (So far, the Senate Finance Committee, which holds the purse strings to all things health care, hasn't put any ideas on paper.)
 
Before delving into the bill and Obama's claim, a little Medicare 101: 
There are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage. They enroll in traditional Medicare and a prescription drug plan through the government and maybe buy a supplemental policy to cover most out-of-pocket costs. Or they enroll in Medicare Advantage programs (they include drug plan), which are run by private insurers. They typically have more generous benefits such as dental and vision coverage. Some plans even pay the patient’s monthly Medicare premium, which can amount to about $100. 
We found some disagreement about whether Obama is correct that Medicare benefits would not be cut.

The House bill will not cut any benefits, said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
 
""What it will do is cut growth in Medicare spending,"" Neuman said.  
Indeed, some of the biggest savings in the bill — about $196 billion — would come from a permanent reduction in the annual payment adjustments for some Medicare services, including inpatient hospital services and ambulatory care, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That doesn't mean health care providers will stop being paid for taking care of the elderly; rather, they won't see pay increases in the future. 
Obama also wants to save money on the Medicare Advantage program, which covers about one-fifth of all Medicare patients.
 
""We do think that systems like Medicare are very inefficient right now, but it has nothing to do at the moment with issues of benefits,"" Obama said in his speech in New Hampshire. ""The inefficiencies all come from things like paying $177 billion to insurance companies in subsidies for something called Medicare Advantage that is not competitively bid, so insurance companies basically get a $177 billion of taxpayer money to provide services that Medicare already provides. And it's no better — it doesn't result in better health care for seniors. It is a giveaway of $177 billion.""

Indeed, a June 2009 MedPAC analysis said that the Advantage plan costs taxpayers on average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan.

The House bills propose to change the benchmarks that set the payments, making them equal to what the government pays for traditional Medicare services. According to the Congressional Budget Office, those changes would translate to a savings of $156 billion over 10 years.
 
We asked experts from both sides of the debate whether all these changes constituted a cut, and most had the same answer: yes and no.
 
On one hand, they might not be considered cuts because nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, they said. And other parts of the bill expand coverage for seniors and ultimately make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. For instance, the bill would require the pharmaceutical industry to help pay for prescription drugs. That savings will ultimately help the government cover more drug benefits for more patients.
 
But experts told us the cuts in the Advantage program could lead to some changes. The basic benefits that mirror regular Medicare will stay the same, but the extra benefits that people receive under Advantage could be changed.

""The core benefits of Medicare won't change,"" said Marc Steinberg, deputy director of health policy for Families USA, an advocate for health care consumers. ""Most [Medicare Advantage] plans are solid and resemble traditional Medicare."" However, some insurance plans have entered the program ""to make a quick buck. They may have to reconsider their budget, which could mean some patients will see changes in the services provided above and beyond traditional Medicare.""
 
Stuart Guterman, assistant vice president for the Commonwealth Fund’s program on payment system reform, had a similar view.
 
""People enrolled in (Medicare Advantage) get services that people in traditional care do not get under Medicare,"" he said. ""Insurance companies can afford to cover these services because taxpayer money is subsidizing them. Plans will most likely not offer those extra services, but in no case will [patients] get less Medicare benefits than people in the rest of the program.""
 
Another example involving regular Medicare coverage: The House bill proposes a $20 billion cut in hospital readmission subsidies. This has to do with patients who re-enter the hospital to be retreated or have procedures fixed. Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, said this is just one example of how cuts to Medicare payments could ultimately trickle down to patients.
 
""Most of the ways to get money with any certainty is to have it happen quickly, which you do by either raising taxes or whacking prices,"" said Wilensky, now an economist and senior fellow with Project Hope, a health care advocacy group. ""In this case they're whacking prices. ... Are these patients in jeopardy? You can't guarantee they're not.""
 
That leaves us with Obama's claim that, under the health care reform proposal, Medicare benefits will not be cut. He's right that the bill does not directly trim Medicare benefits; instead, the government is proposing ways to slow or eliminate some Medicare spending to beef up other aspects of the plan. But experts told us it's conceivable or even likely that those financial changes could lead to reduced benefits, particularly for people in the Advantage program. From that perspective, it's a stretch for Obama say that Medicare patients won't see changes in their plans as a result. We give Obama a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB3F200>],/factchecks/2009/aug/14/barack-obama/obama-claims-medicare-benefits-will-not-be-cut-und/

Palin claims Obama misled when he said end-of-life counseling is voluntary
","
After wide denunciation (

including here

) of Sarah Palin's claims last week that the proposed health care reform bill would create ""death panels,"" the former Alaska governor again went to her Facebook page to answer the critics and reassert her claim that end-of-life counseling authorized in the House version of the health plan is not ""entirely voluntary.""
 
We've looked at this claim before when Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York, went on the radio show of former Sen. Fred Thompson on July 16, 2009, and said, ""Congress would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner."" We gave that statement got our lowest rating,

Pants on Fire!

 
But the issue has hardly dissipated.
 
In fact, on Aug. 13, 2009, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, announced that the Senate Finance Committee has ""dropped end-of-life provisions from consideration entirely"" from its version of health care overhaul legislation because it could be ""misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly."" But it remains in the House bill.
 
Palin may have stepped down as Alaska governor last month, but she remains a prominent Republican voice.
 
In a town hall meeting on health care on Aug. 11, President Barack Obama specifically referenced Palin's ""death panel"" phrase when discussing what he said was incorrect information that has been circulating about the health care bill.
 
""It turns out that I guess this arose out of a provision in one of the House bills that allowed Medicare to reimburse people for consultations about end-of-life care, setting up living wills, the availability of hospice, etc.,"" Obama said.  ""So the intention of the members of Congress was to give people more information so that they could handle issues of end-of-life care when they’re ready on their own terms. It wasn’t forcing anybody to do anything.""
 
In her Facebook response the following day, Palin accused Obama of fudging the truth.
 
""With all due respect, it’s misleading for the president to describe this section as an entirely voluntary provision that simply increases the information offered to Medicare recipients. The issue is the context in which that information is provided and the coercive effect these consultations will have in that context.""
 
Palin then accurately cited some of the language Section 1233 of the House version of the health care plan, which is titled ""Advanced Care Planning Consultation.""
 
As Palin says, the provision ""authorizes advanced care planning consultations for senior citizens on Medicare every five years, and more often 'if there is a significant change in the health condition of the individual ... or upon admission to a skilled nursing facility, a long-term care facility... or a hospice program.' During those consultations, practitioners must explain 'the continuum of end-of-life services and supports available, including palliative care and hospice,' and the government benefits available to pay for such services.""
 
Palin then argues that this provision must be viewed in the context of a health care bill whose stated purpose is ""to reduce the growth in health care spending.""
 
""Is it any wonder,"" Palin writes, ""that senior citizens might view such consultations as attempts to convince them to help reduce health care costs by accepting minimal end-of-life care?""
 
That's an opinion. What we're trying to get at here is Palin's claim that the end-of-life counseling is not ""entirely voluntary.""
 
When we wrote about McCaughey's claim that the end-of-life counseling was mandatory, we cited several health care experts who said McCaughey was simply misreading the provision, that the bill would make the counseling available, but voluntary.
 
In no way would these sessions be designed to encourage patients to end their lives, said Jim Dau, national spokesman for AARP, a group that represents people over 50 and has lobbied in support of the advanced planning provision.


Dau called McCaughey's comments ""not just wrong, they are cruel. ... We want to make sure people are making the right decision. If some one wants to take every life-saving measure, that's their call. Others will decide it's not worth going through this trauma just for themselves and their families, and that's their decision, too.""
 
When Palin reasserted the not ""entirely voluntary"" claim on Aug. 12, we spoke with Dr. Gail Wilensky, who was administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, directing the Medicare and Medicaid programs, under President George H.W. Bush. She is now a health care policy researcher who focuses on health care for the military and veterans.


""There are a lot of things not to like about the House bill,"" she said. ""I don't think this is one of them.""


Wilensky also confirmed that the end-of-life counseling sessions in the House bill are voluntary.


""If you want to be in a position to determine your own fate, this is what you want to do,"" she said. ""If you don't want to deal with that, or think about that, that's fine, too.""


The legislation ensures that people do not have wait until they become ill to get an appointment with their doctor paid for by Medicare, she said.


""This is the kind of conversation you'd like people to have when they're not under physical duress or emotional duress and with their physicians and their families,"" she said.
 
Later in her Facebook post, Palin seems to acknowledge that the counseling isn't explicitly mandatory, but that in practice it would be.
 
She cites an opinion piece from the

Washington Post's

Charles Lane, in which he writes, ""Though not mandatory, as some on the right have claimed, the consultations envisioned in Section 1233 aren't quite 'purely voluntary,' as Rep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich., asserts. To me, 'purely voluntary' means 'not unless the patient requests one.' Section 1233, however, lets doctors initiate the chat and gives them an incentive — money — to do so. Indeed, that's an incentive to insist.


""Patients may refuse without penalty,"" Lane wrote, ""but many will bow to white-coated authority.""
 
The bill would, in fact, authorize Medicare to reimburse doctors who provide this kind of counseling. And we think it's fair to opine that this creates an ""incentive"" for doctors to provide end-of-life counseling. We also think it's fair to argue that a frail elderly person in poor health might ""bow to white-coated authority.""
 
But given the leaps in logic that have been popular in some conservative circles in recent weeks that this provision translates to government-mandated euthanasia, we think it's important to be clear about what the bill says.
 
The fact is that there is nothing in the health care bill that would

require

people to get the end-of-life counseling. Perhaps, as Lane — and by extension Palin — argues, patients might feel some subtle pressure from a doctor to get the counseling. But

the patients

make the call. That's the definition of voluntary. We've said in our previous item that it was voluntary, and we see nothing in Palin's argument that proves otherwise. And so we rule her claim False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama goes too far when he says health reform bills have AARP endorsement
","
With polls showing seniors are the most skeptical about the health care reform bills working their way through Congress, President Barack Obama sought to ease some of their concerns during a town hall meeting with a little high-powered name-dropping.
 
The name: AARP.
 
Several times at the town hall in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, Obama specifically mentioned AARP's support for health care reform. It's little wonder why: The AARP is the country's largest and most powerful advocate for seniors.
 
""We have the AARP on board because they know this is a good deal for our seniors,"" Obama said at one point.
 
And later, in response to a question about whether the health care plan would reduce the availability of medications through Medicare, Obama said, ""Well, first of all, another myth that we've been hearing about is this notion that somehow we're going to be cutting your Medicare benefits. We are not. AARP would not be endorsing a bill if it was undermining Medicare, okay?""
 
It was that last comment that caught the attention of AARP executives. Not the part that AARP would not support a bill that undermines Medicare benefits. That's true. It was the suggestion that AARP had formally endorsed any particular version of the still-evolving health care plan working its way through Congress.
 
AARP chief operating officer Tom Nelson immediately fired off a press release saying that ""indications that we have endorsed any of the major health care reform bills currently under consideration in Congress are inaccurate.""
 
The rebuke likely confused a lot of AARP members who have read or heard numerous AARP statements in recent weeks that have supported various aspects of the health care plan.
 
Just a few weeks ago, on July 14, the AARP issued a press release gushing about the introduction of the House health care reform bill saying, ""This bill would make great strides for all of our members and their families."" The group said it was pleased with the legislation for giving ""every American has access to affordable, quality health care choices.""
 
Specifically, the release said the bill would make prescription drugs less expensive for seniors, would block insurance companies from denying coverage based on age, and for capping out-of-pocket expenses for some insurance plans. AARP did not explicitly say it was endorsing the bill, but there was not a single negative comment in the statement. 

 

In a July 14 ad sponsored by Healthy Economy Now — a coalition including AARP, the American Medical Association and the pharmaceutical industry, among others —  the tone was decidedly upbeat. ""The president and Congress have a plan to lower costs and stop denials for pre-existing conditions,"" the ad says. ""It's time to act.""
 
The following day, AARP released a statement about the version of the bill being debated in the Senate. This time, the group was slightly less complimentary; while it said most parts of the legislation were good, AARP remained concerned about a provision in the bill that would prevent some generic drugs from entering the market faster.
 
Since then, the climate in the health care debate has taken a decided nasty turn, with a deep and clear divide between Republicans and Democrats. But AARP spokesman Jim Dau said AARP was not reacting by tempering its stance.
 
He said AARP supports a lot of changes that both the House and Senate bills would make, such as making drugs cheaper for seniors and ending discriminatory practices against the elderly, but the group has been clear all along that it has not endorsed any of the big bills.

 

""We have endorsed specific measures,"" Dau said. ""We're praising the pieces that we think are good for members.""

 

Dau pointed to a statement made by AARP CEO Barry Rand during a July 28 town hall meeting with Obama.

 

""I want to make it clear that AARP has not endorsed any particular bill, any of the bills that are being circulated around Congress today and debated in Congress today,"" Rand said. ""We continue to work with the members on both sides of the aisle, and we continue to work with the administration to achieve what is right for health care reform.""
 
Nelson echoed that bipartisan tone in his statement after Obama's town hall this week.
 
""AARP has been working with Democrats and Republicans to fix our broken health care system,"" Nelson stated.
 
""AARP supports specific measures that would help older Americans and their families – including bipartisan proposals to create a new follow-up care benefit in Medicare that would help prevent hospital readmissions, as well as to address the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap known as the ‘doughnut hole.’ We also support the need for lawmakers and the administration to act this year to fix what doesn’t work in the health care system.""
 
So was Obama incorrect to say the AARP had endorsed the bill?
 
The July 14 statement sure sounds to us like an endorsement, even if it didn't specifically contain that word. But in Washington, the word ""endorse"" means you have put the weight of your name behind an official stamp of approval for a bill, candidate or policy.
 
And the fact is, AARP has not formally endorsed any specific bill. It strongly supports some aspects of the bills. But that's not a formal endorsement. And in fact, Obama was present two weeks ago when AARP's CEO said the group ""has not endorsed any particular bill."" So we rate Obama's statement Barely True.

Bachmann says Obama health adviser thinks health care ought not to be extended to the disabled
","

Update: After we published this item, Ezekiel Emanuel responded at length to these claims in an interview with ABC News. See the interview

here

.

 
You know Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama's intense chief of staff. And maybe you've heard of his brother, Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood talent agent who provided the inspiration for the Ari Gold character on HBO's

Entourage

. Now a third Emanuel brother, Ezekiel Emanuel, has been thrust into the spotlight.
 
Ezekiel Emanuel is a health policy adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget, and is a member of the Federal Council on Comparative Effectiveness Research, but until last week, he had largely flown under radar of the national political media.
 
That changed when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a statement from the floor of the House on July 27 in which she said the American public needed to know what the people who advise Obama about health care reform think. Specifically, she said, Dr. Emanuel ""says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled.""
 
Emanuel is a well-known oncologist and bioethicist, which means he ponders such moral questions as ""You have three people who need a liver, but you've got just one liver, who gets it?""
 
Like other academics (see our article on claims about science czar

John Holdren

), Emanuel has found that highbrow articles for academic journals make great fodder for opponents trying to score political points. Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them.
 
Bachmann's comments from the House floor substantially repeat claims made in a July 24, 2009,

New York Post

op-ed piece written by Betsy McCaughey, former lieutenant governor of New York.
 
Under the headline, ""Deadly Doctors: O Advisers Want to Ration Care,"" McCaughey argues that ""Emanuel wants doctors to look beyond the needs of their patients and consider social justice, such as whether the money could be better spent on somebody else.


""Many doctors are horrified by this notion; they'll tell you that a doctor's job is to achieve social justice one patient at a time.


""Emanuel, however, believes that 'communitarianism' should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled, not given to those 'who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens. . . . An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.' (Hastings Center Report, Nov.-Dec. '96).


""Translation: Don't give much care to a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy.""


Bachmann quoted heavily from McCaughey's op-ed in her floor statement, and sprinkled in her own two cents.
 
Here's what Bachmann said:
 
""The president's adviser, Dr. Emanuel, believes communitarianism should guide decisions on who gets care. He says medical care should be reserved for the nondisabled. So watch out if you're disabled.""
 
She noted, ""We just lost my father-in-law to dementia two months ago. I thank God that the doctors were able to alleviate my poor father-in-law's symptoms at the end of his life at age 85. Apparently, under the Democrats' health care plan, my father-in-law would not have received the high quality of care that he received in his last two months of life. Or if you're a grandmother with Parkinson's or a child with cerebral palsy, watch out.""
 
The quote in question comes from an essay Emanuel wrote for the

Hastings Center Report

in the November-December 1996 issue. It ran under the title, ""Where Civic Republicanism and Deliberative Democracy Meet."" The title alone should give you an idea of the kind of academic, philosophical discussion that will ensue.
 
In the article, he addresses the idea of what's good for society at large when it comes to allocating health care resources, and that it ""suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be guaranteed."" Under that philosophy, he writes, health services would be guaranteed to ensure the health of future generations as well as for ""full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations.""
 
That's the lead-in to the part that contains the stuff McCaughey cited:
 
""Conversely, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia. A less obvious example is guaranteeing neuropsychological services to ensure children with learning disabilities can read and learn to reason.""
 
So the question is, is Emanuel saying that he thinks health services ought not to be guaranteed to patients with dementia?
 
No, said Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the White House Office of Budget and Management. ""He just unequivocally doesn't believe that.""
 
In fact, he said, one need look only as far as the next paragraph:
 
""Clearly more needs to be done to elucidate what specific health care services are basic; however, the overlap between liberalism and communitarianism points to a way of introducing the good back into medical ethics and devising a principled way of distinguishing basic from discretionary health care services.""
 
Yeah, we sorta got lost there too.
 
What it means, Baer said, is that Emanuel was exploring different views of political theory as they apply to health care decisions and following one school of thought through to the point where he notes that it would lead to ""potentially disturbing types of policy ramifications.""
 
Furthermore, he said, you need to balance McCaughey's claim against Emanuel's 25-year record of caring for very sick people, and specifically providing quality care to very ill patients at the end of their life.
 
""He's a little surprised at how his record is being twisted and turned,"" Baer said. ""It is preposterous that Ezekiel Emanuel would deny care to someone who needed it, or that he believes we should be making the sort of horrific medical decisions he's been accused of.""
 
Some of Emanuel's academic writing is confusing for nonacademics. But Emanuel has also written extensively in more mainstream media — the

Atlantic

and

Wall Street Journal

, for example — about his opposition to euthanasia and his belief in appropriate end-of-life care.
 
Here's a quote from a Jan. 7, 1997, commentary written by Emanuel for the

Wall Street Journal

: ""For the millions of others, legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide would be of no benefit. To the contrary, it would be a way of avoiding the complex and arduous efforts required of doctors and other health-care providers to ensure that dying patients receive humane, dignified care.""
 
There's no question Emanuel has written some things that some would consider controversial. For example, in another paper cited by McCaughey, a June 18, 2008 commentary for the

Journal of the American Medical Association

, Emanuel talks about how overutilization of health care is the most important contributor to the cost of health care in America. He takes aim at a medical culture that rewards ""meticulousness, not effectiveness"" and leads to a mindset in which doctors view it as ""imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of cost or effect on others."" He concludes that in order to rein in costs, we ought to ""devise financial incentives for physicians and patients that result in greater health care value.""
 
Those kinds of opinions are fair game for political debate. And we certainly think it's fair to question where such ideas might lead in a practical sense. Emanuel is a key health care adviser.
 
But to make the sensational claim that Emanuel says health care should not be extended to the disabled is a gross distortion of his position, lifted out of context from an academic paper in which he poses philosophical ideas but doesn't necessary endorse them. Emanuel's hefty medical record also counts for something, as well his unequivocal public position against euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide. We rule Bachmann's statement False.

Obama has praised single-payer plans in the past
","
At a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., President Barack Obama was asked about his support of a ""universal"" health coverage and whether his plan would result in the government taking over health care.
 
In his answer, Obama made a point that caught our attention: ""I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter,"" Obama said.
 
That raised some eyebrows here in the PolitiFact newsroom because we recently spent a fair amount of time analyzing Obama's statements on single-payer. Before we delve into that, here's the exchange in Portsmouth:
 
Question: ""Mr. President, you've been quoted over the years — when you were a senator and perhaps even before then — that you were essentially a supporter of a universal plan. I'm beginning to see that you're changing that.  Do you honestly believe that? Because that is my concern.  I'm on Medicare, but I still worry that if we go to a public option, period, that the private companies, the insurance companies, rather than competing — because who can compete with the government; the answer is nobody.  So my question is do you still — as yourself, now — support a universal plan?  Or are you open to the private industry still being maintained?""

 

Obama: ""Well, I think it's an excellent question, so I appreciate the chance to respond.  First of all, I want to make a distinction between a universal plan versus a single-payer plan, because those are two different things. 

 

""A single-payer plan would be a plan like Medicare for all, or the kind of plan that they have in Canada, where basically government is the only person — is the only entity that pays for all health care.  Everybody has a government-paid-for plan, even though in, depending on which country, the doctors are still private or the hospitals might still be private.  In some countries, the doctors work for the government and the hospitals are owned by the government.  But the point is, is that government pays for everything, like Medicare for all.  That is a single-payer plan.
 
""I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive.  So what would end up happening would be, a lot of people who currently have employer-based health care would suddenly find themselves dropped, and they would have to go into an entirely new system that had not been fully set up yet.  And I would be concerned about the potential destructiveness of that kind of transition.
 
""All right?  So I'm not promoting a single-payer plan."" (His answer continued at some length as he explained his plan. You can read the full transcript of the town hall

here

.)
 
We see two major points that contradict Obama's statement in different ways.
 
First, at several town halls this year, Obama has been asked by single-payer

supporters

why he doesn't propose a single-payer system. Obama's consistent answer has been that if he were designing a health care system ""from scratch,"" he would go with a single payer system. So that certainly indicates philosophical support for the idea, even if Obama has also consistently concluded that single-payer is not politically feasible.
 
But there's also the matter of a

YouTube video

from June 2003, when Obama was a state senator in Illinois and a longshot candidate for the U.S. Senate. Back then, he plainly indicated he supported a single-payer system.
 
""I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care program,"" Obama said. ""I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. And that's what Jim is talking about when he says everybody in, nobody out. A single-payer health care plan, a universal health care plan. That's what I’d like to see. But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we've got to take back the White House, we've got to take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House.""
 
We previously delved into this video in great — some might say excruciating —  detail, even discovering the identity of ""Jim."" You can read more about the politics of health care in Illinois from that time by reading our complete item, ""

Obama statements on single-payer have changed a bit.

""
 
Suffice to say, Obama's public remarks and statements have moderated since 2003.


In other statements, Obama has spoken favorably of single-payer in concept, but always adding qualifiers.
 
But the 2003 video strikes a very different tone from the remarks above. After weighing all the evidence, we concluded that Obama, as a candidate who was trying to appeal to a liberal electorate, took a strong position on single payer, but then over the years moderated his position to appeal to a broader national audience. We rated him a

Half Flip

on our Flip-O-Meter, a tool we use to gauge when political leaders and others change positions.
 
Getting back to Obama's statement in Portsmouth, he said, ""I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because, frankly, we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers, and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive.""
 
But he

has

said in the past he supports a single-payer plan, and the questioner was correct that Obama's thinking has evolved over the years. Obama's answer strikes us as too artful. The 2003 YouTube video shows at one time he supported a single-payer system with little to no reservation. We agree that Obama does not support single payer now, but it's not correct to say that he has never supported it, which is certainly the impression you get from the answer he gave at the town hall. We rate his statement False.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama promises you can keep your health insurance, but there's no guarantee
","
At a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, President Barack Obama repeated a line he's used many times in describing his health care proposal: ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.""
 
On one level, Obama is correct. His plan seeks to build on the system we have now, where most people get health insurance through their employers. The plan also aims to cover the uninsured and reduce costs for everyone. Back during the campaign, we rated a similar statement

True

, based on the fact that his plan does seek to build on the existing system, where about 60 percent of Americans get health insurance through work.
 
Now, close to a year later, we finally have detailed bills to examine. They closely mirror what Obama promised during the campaign.
 
But the plans also introduce new ways of regulating health insurance companies that will surely change the current health care system. That could prompt employers to change their health plans, and we find Obama's statement less clear-cut now than it once seemed.
 
At a news conference on June 23, 2009, Jake Tapper of ABC News asked Obama about the possibility of changes in coverage.
 
Tapper's question centered on the public option on the health care exchange. Before we go any further, we want to explain in the plainest terms possible what the exchange is and what the public option is.
 
The health insurance exchange is a virtual marketplace where individuals and small businesses can go to buy health insurance. Employer-provided insurance offered by large companies, on the other hand, will continue as is, though Democrats have ideas on lowering costs that they hope will end up benefiting these plans, too. (In the interests of brevity, we're not going to go into all the cost-saving aspects here.)
 
The government would regulate the exchange so that insurance companies can't discriminate against people who have pre-existing conditions, or charge wildly different amounts for similar coverage.
 
One of the options on the exchange will be a public option that offers basic coverage. Obama has said the public option will keep private insurers honest by competing with them and not allowing them to charge unfair rates for the basics. Many experts believe that the public option will be the least expensive option on the exchange.
 

Jake Tapper's hypothetical


 
Back to Tapper's question: If the public option is cheapest, Tapper said, ""then lots of employers will want to have their employees covered by that cheaper plan, which will not have to be for-profit, unlike private plans, and may, possibly, benefit from some government subsidies, who knows. And then their employees would be signed up for this public plan, which would violate what you're promising the American people, that they will not have to change health care plans if they like the plan they have.""
 
So Tapper is suggesting that many employers will be allowed onto the exchange and will pick the public option, which would clearly change some people's health plans.
 
Here is the core of Obama's somewhat lengthy answer: ""When I say if you have your plan and you like it, or you have a doctor and you like your doctor, that you don't have to change plans, what I'm saying is the government is not going to make you change plans under health reform. ... Let's say that we take the advice of some folks who are out there and say, 'Oh, this is not the time to do health care. We can't afford it. It's too complicated. Let's take our time,' et cetera. So let's assume that nothing happened. I can guarantee you that there's the possibility for a whole lot of Americans out there that they're not going to end up having the same health care they have. Because what's going to happen is, as costs keep on going up, employers are going to start making decisions: 'We've got to raise premiums on our employees. In some cases, we can't provide health insurance at all.' And so there are going to be a whole set of changes out there. That's exactly why health reform is so important.""
 
So Obama's saying that the government will not force employers to change their health plans. Fair enough. But Tapper's hypothetical isn't wrong either, and we want to explain it in more detail.
 
As we've already noted, the health insurance exchange is where individuals and small businesses go to shop for health insurance. The government intends to regulate it, and the exchange will have a public option that includes basic coverage. But there are many things about the exchange and the public option that have yet to be finalized in Congress. For starters, it's not clear whether the public option will be subsidized by the government or if it will have to finance itself with only patient premiums. (Note that Tapper said it would ""possibly benefit from some government subsidies, who knows."")
 
Obama has said that the public option should be self-sustaining, but this is not settled. In the House, fiscally conservative Democrats known as Blue Dogs won a concession from other Democrats that the public option will have to negotiate payments to doctors. This would tend to put the public option on more equal footing with private health insurance companies.
 
Another implication of Tapper's question is that ""lots"" of employers would be able to have access to the exchange. But we don't know if this is so. Pending legislation in the House says that only individuals and small businesses of fewer than 10 employees would be able to use the exchange during the first year, and only individuals and small businesses with fewer than 20 employees in the second year. In the third year, businesses are allowed in ""based on the number of full-time employees of an employer and such other considerations as the Commissioner deems appropriate."" This sounds like employers will gradually be allowed into the exchange based on size, as well as ""other considerations as the (health exchange) Commissioner deems appropriate."" This obviously gives tremendous leeway to the commissioner, who is presidential appointee in charge of the health exchange. So year three becomes a question mark as to how many businesses will be allowed into the exchange.
 

Questions about the public option


 
Conservative critics of the Democratic plans believe these questions surrounding the public option and the exchange are critical to determining whether people will indeed keep their coverage.
 
""The two most important factors are who is eligible for the public plan, and what are premiums in the public plan, compared with private insurers,"" said Greg D'Angelo, a policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
 
The foundation believes that the reform package will encourage employers to change or drop their health insurance and send their employees into the exchange to buy their own insurance.
 
""Any change in policy will change the incentives in the system, and you have to understand what is likely to happen,"" D'Angelo said. ""Employers will change or drop coverage, and individuals will have little to no say in the matter.""
 
If you accept the premise that employers will opt for the least expensive plan available, then millions of people should expect that their employers will change plans under the reform bill, he said.
 
The main response to this objection from supporters of reform is just what Obama said during the press conference: Employers can change health care plans right now, and they often do.
 
Still, the legislative details that have emerged on health care reform indicate that if reform passes, we're headed for some significant changes in how health care operates. Obama certainly intends to leave the current system intact. But at this point, it seems too pat to say, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan."" It seems likely that at least some people will have employers who decide to change plans when different plans become available, most likely any small businesses that currently offer health insurance. They will be allowed into the exchange right away, and it seems likely some might find a better deal there and change plans.
 
Until the legislation gets closer to a final stage, it's difficult to say how many employers will likely opt to change coverage. But clearly some change is coming. It's not realistic for Obama to make blanket statements that ""you"" will be able to ""keep your health care plan."" It seems like rhetoric intended to soothe people that health care reform will not be overly disruptive. But one of the points of reform is to change the way health care works right now. So we rate Obama's statement Half True.

Obama is right on federal health care for janitors and senators
","
During a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, 2009, an audience member asked President Barack Obama why members of Congress have a different health care plan than the rest of us.
 
""Why have you not used the bully pulpit to chastise Congress for having two systems of health care, one for all of us and one for them,"" an audience member asked.
 
Obama answered that lawmakers get a good deal on health care, but that ""their deal is no better than the janitor that cleans their offices because they are part of a federal employee plan. It is a huge pool. You've got millions of people who are part of the pool which means they have enormous leverage with the insurance companies. ... That drives down their costs, and they get a better deal.""
 
Republican critics of the president's plan have made an issue of coverage for members of Congress, saying that lawmakers should be forced to take the public option, the most basic government-run plan under Obama's proposal. We found Newt Gingrich was largely

correct

that Democrats have voted against that idea.
 
The administration has studied the federal benefits program, which gets high marks for efficiency, to get ideas for its own health care proposal.
 
Obama's description of the federal plan is accurate. Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, federal employees and elected officials can choose from an array of plans, ranging from very basic options that have high deductibles and only carry catastrophic coverage to more expensive coverage that is more comprehensive. It is the largest employer-sponsored program in the world, covering over 9 million employees, retirees, former employees, family members and former spouses, according to the Office of Personnel Management's Web site.
 
People who opt for the same package will get the same treatment, said Michael Ornstein, a spokesman for the Office of Personnel Management.
 
""The benefits, co-pays and deductibles are no different whether you are a career employee like myself or an elected official,"" he said.
 
For the most part, janitorial staff on Capitol Hill are federal employees, said Eva Malecki, communications officer for the Architect of the Capitol, the office involved in the day-to-day operations of the Capitol complex.
 
""We do have a few contract workers,"" she said. ""But the majority are federal employees and are therefore covered by the federal employee benefits program. The custodial staff has access to the same benefits as members of Congress.""
 
We should note that while janitors and members of Congress can choose from the same menu of plans, members of Congress generally have more money to spend on, well, anything. Many members of Congress are millionaires.
 
But Obama is right that lawmakers and janitors are eligible for the same benefits, deductibles and co-pays. We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Most Democrats are opposed to giving up their health care plans
","
To build opposition to a public health insurance option, Republicans have been challenging Democratic lawmakers and White House officials to enroll in the government-run plan.

 

""If Members of Congress believe so strongly that government-run health care is the best solution for hard working American families, I think it only fitting that Americans see them lead the way,"" said Republican Rep. John Fleming, who is sponsoring a resolution encouraging lawmakers to enroll in the public option, in a statement on his Web site.

 

On the Aug. 9, 2009, episode of

This Week

, Former Speaker Newt Gingrich told host George Stephanopoulos that Democrats are squarely against the idea.

 

""An amendment was offered in every committee to ... have the members of Congress and their staff in any government option as a mandate. And if this is good enough for the American people, it's good enough for the politicians,"" Gingrich said. ""In every committee, the Democrats voted no. Now, why is it they want to insist on a government-run system for ... people other than the Congress, but the Congress and their staff would be exempt?""

 

We wondered whether Gingrich's vote count was correct. To find out, we sifted through all the health care amendments offered in the House and the Senate committees.
 
Currently, members of Congress receive health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which offers plans that range from basic coverage to plans that pay for special treatments and drugs. The system has earned high markets for efficiency, making it one of the models the White House has studied in coming up with its own ideas for health care reform.
 
It's important to note that under the Democrats' plan, the public option is just one choice that people would have in the health care exchange. The public option would provide basic coverage, but other plans would offer more extensive coverage likely at a higher price. Under the legislation now pending in Congress, no one would be forced to take the public option.
 
An amendment offered during the House Ways and Means Committee July 16 debate of the bill would have changed all that — but just for members of Congress and their staffs. Nevada Republican Dean Heller offered an amendment that would have required them to take the public plan. His amendment was rejected 18-21, with 21 of the 26 Democrats on the committee voting against it.
 
On the same day, members of the Education and Labor Committee adopted a resolution — code for ""nonbinding"" in congressional parlance — by Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina that expresses Congress' support that any member voting in favor of the public plan drop his or her federal employee benefits and enroll in the new program. Because the committee approved the resolution by voice vote — meaning members on the panel simply said ""aye"" or ""nay"" to express their support for the bill — it's impossible to tell who voted for or against Wilson's amendment.
 
The Energy and Commerce Committee heard a similar argument from Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who wanted to make the public plan mandatory for the president and the vice president as well as members of Congress. But Blunt's amendment never came to a vote because the Democratic leaders panel ruled it irrelevant to the overall bill.
 
Senators have been working on their own version of the health care bill, legislation that only the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has debated so far. On July 14, that committee adopted 12-11 a requirement by Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma that would require all members of Congress to enroll in the public plan. Nine of the committee's 12 Democrats voted against it.


That brings us back to Gingrich's claim. He's correct that Democrats in the House and Senate have generally voted against proposals to make the public plan mandatory for members of Congress. Even when Coburn's motion narrowly passed, nine of 12 Democrats voted against it. We can't assess the Democrats' positions on the voice vote in the House education committee or the energy and commerce panel where the motion was ruled irrelevant. So we can't be sure that Democrats voted against it in every committee. But based on the counts that are available, Gingrich's underlying point is correct that Democrats have generally opposed it. So we find his claim Mostly True.

Sarah Palin falsely claims Barack Obama runs a 'death panel'
","
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, urged her supporters to oppose Democratic plans for health care reform on her Facebook page. 
""As more Americans delve into the disturbing details of the nationalized health care plan that the current administration is rushing through Congress, our collective jaw is dropping, and we’re saying not just no, but hell no!"" wrote Palin in  a note  posted Aug. 7, 2009. 
She said that the Democrats plan to reduce health care costs by simply refusing to pay for care. 
""And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil."" 
We agree with Palin that such a system would be evil. But it's definitely not what President Barack Obama or any other Democrat has proposed. 
We have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's ""level of productivity in society"" to determine whether they are ""worthy"" of health care. 
Palin's claim sounds a little like another statement making the rounds, which says that health care reform would mandate counseling for seniors on how to end their lives sooner. We rated this claim  Pants on Fire  ! The truth is that the health bill allows Medicare, for the first time, to pay for doctors' appointments for patients to discuss living wills and other end-of-life issues with their physicians. These types of appointments are completely optional, and AARP supports the measure. 
Palin also may have also jumped to conclusions about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for ""worthiness."" Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others. 
The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall ""conduct, support, and synthesize research"" that looks at ""outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically."" 
The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research. 
Obama has said he believes a comparative effectiveness commission should advise health care workers, not require them to follow certain treatments. 
""I actually think that most doctors want to do right by their patients. And if they’ve got good information, I think they will act on that good information,"" Obama said during an interview with the  New York Times  on April 28, 2009. 
He also specifically addressed end-of-life care for seniors, discussing the last week of his grandmother's life in 2008, and how her family and doctors decided on treatment for her.  
""It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels,"" Obama said. ""And that's part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It's not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance. And that's part of what I suspect you'll see emerging out of the various health care conversations that are taking place on the Hill right now."" 
And in fact, the House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission, ""Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer."" In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select. 
Palin's statement seems extreme, but other Republicans, like Newt Gingrich, are backing her up. ""You're asking us to trust turning power over to the government, when there clearly are people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards,"" Gingrich said in an interview on  This Week with George Stephanopolous  on Aug. 9, 2009. 
We've looked at the inflammatory claims that the health care bill encourages euthanasia. It doesn't. There's certainly no ""death board"" that determines the worthiness of individuals to receive care. Conservatives might make a case that Palin is justified in fearing that the current reform could one day morph into such a board. 
But that's not what Palin said. She said that the Democratic plan will ration care and ""my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care."" Palin's statement sounds more like a science fiction movie (  Soylent Green  , anyone?) than part of an actual bill before Congress. We rate her statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEF9400>],/factchecks/2009/aug/10/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-barack-obama-death-panel/

Recycled rumor: Syrian dead children cast as victims of Asian organ trafficking
","A post on Facebook showed a grim photo of children’s bodies laid out in rows. Above it were the words, ""Thailand police found this in a container vehicle. Dead bodies of children.

Pritzker misleads in dismissing revenue alternatives
","During last year’s campaign for governor we took then-Republican incumbent Bruce Rauner to task for a False claim about a tax plan being pushed by Democratic rival J.B. Pritzker. Pritzker said he wanted to replace Illinois’ flat income tax with graduated rates requiring the wealthy to pay more. Rauner said working families would get soaked because all states with graduated tax systems — 32 at last count — impose higher tax rates on middle-income earners than what they currently pay in Illinois. While there are many examples of graduated tax states that impose higher rates on the middle class than does Illinois, there are also several states that charge less. Now, Pritzker is the state’s chief executive — and the one painting tax policies in overly broad strokes. In his first budget address late last month, Pritzker, as expected, talked up graduated taxes — a switch that is politically difficult and would take time to implement because it requires a constitutional amendment. At the same time, he dismissed quicker-to-achieve revenue raising schemes like broadening the sales tax to include services; eliminating a decades-old exemption from the income tax for retirement income; or raising the current flat-rate income tax. Such actions, he argued, would ""fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class."" Is Pritzker’s sweeping assertion on more solid ground than Rauner’s? Just barely. The sales tax is considered inherently regressive because everyone, rich, poor or in-between, pays the same rate when they make a retail purchase. But experts told us that extending the tax to cover an array of services, such as landscaping, hair styling and laundry, could not only bring in more revenue but help make the sales tax less regressive and benefit those with less disposable income by providing a cushion to lower rates overall. ""As income rises, the share of your expenditures that are spent on services generally rises,"" said David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois. Iowa taxes far more services than Illinois, yet the composite of state and local sales taxes tops out at 7 percent throughout much of our neighboring state and in the largest city, Des Moines, it’s 6 percent. In Wisconsin, which also taxes more services than Illinois, the sales tax tops out at 5.6 percent in Milwaukee. In Chicago, the combined tax rate currently sits at 10.25 percent. If Illinois taxed the same array of services as neighboring Iowa, it could boost annual revenue by $1.2 billion, according to projections from the Illinois legislature’s bipartisan fiscal forecaster. Following a more modest Wisconsin model would raise an extra $588 million, the forecaster said. Most states tax income, but Illinois is one of the few that exempts all forms of retirement income — including Social Security, pensions and withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA retirement savings plans. The Illinois comptroller’s office estimated the tax break cost the state $2.3 billion in revenue in 2014 when the income tax rate was close to the current 4.95 percent. The retirement exemption dates back to 1972 amid concerns of high poverty rates among seniors. Today, less than 10 percent of seniors live in poverty. Pritzker would be correct about harming the poor and middle class if Illinois simply did away with the retirement income break in its entirety. But that’s not how it’s done by most states. In general, states that tax retirement income nonetheless shield some of it from taxation. That’s the case in neighboring Indiana and Michigan, which, like Illinois, have flat-rate income taxes. Both states exempt Social Security income, and Michigan also allows thousands of dollars in deductions on pension and annuity benefits. ""You can do it in a way that’s not the least bit regressive,"" said Carol Portman, president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers’ Federation of Illinois. The Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning Chicago-based fiscal watchdog, has proposed taxing retirement income but suggests leaving the exemption in place for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $50,000. Doing so could still net the state more than $1 billion in additional annual revenue, data from the Illinois Department of Revenue indicate. In his budget speech, Pritzker held out his graduated tax push as the only way to inject more fairness into a tax system currently charging everyone at the same flat rate. But during last year’s primary campaign, Pritzker himself floated a revenue-raising plan to make the single-rate system more progressive that would require legislative approval but no constitutional change. In essence, it would have hiked the current 4.95 percent flat rate tax but then softened the blow for those of modest means with increased or new exemptions and credits as a temporary measure while Pritzker pushed for a formal graduated tax. ""We can do what other states have done with a flat income tax and that is to put exemptions in place, to raise the overall rate but protect the middle class and those striving to get there with those exemptions,"" Pritzker said at a candidate forum in February of 2018. It’s less than clear what that would look like for Illinois. But Merriman, the University of Illinois economist, said he thinks the state could explore it — especially since Illinois already offers an earned-income tax credit to low-income taxpayers. ""That option is very much under-discussed, in my view, as a possibility,"" Merriman said. Still, the governor’s office maintains Pritzker’s graduated-tax plan is the only way forward. ""The governor proposed a realistic plan to serve as a bridge to the future, with the ultimate goal of a fair tax system that will transform state finances in a momentous way without burdening the middle class,"" spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh wrote in an email. ""The alternative to this plan is doing more of the same: namely, raising taxes on the middle class."" Pritzker said that raising revenue for cash-strapped Illinois by taxing more services, taxing retirement income and increasing the state’s current flat-rate income tax would ""fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class."" Those are indeed possibilities, but examples from some other states show they don’t have to be realities. There are states with broader, less regressive sales taxes. There are flat tax states that tax retirement income without burdening the poor and middle class. And, as Pritzker himself once pointed out, there may even be ways to wring more revenue from a flat tax system without harming taxpayers of more modest means. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Gillibrand raises issue of racial disparity in maternal health care
","On the campaign trail, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has spoken frequently about her experiences as a mother and how that role informs her policy positions. She has been talking about maternal health for some time, and she has raised the issue of racial disparities in the health care system. In a recent tweet, the presidential candidate wrote: ""A black woman in New York City is 12 times more likely to die in childbirth than a white woman. This isn’t an accident — it's a failure of policy and justice, and one we can’t accept. We have a moral responsibility to right it."" Is Gillibrand’s claim true? Gillibrand’s spokesperson, Whitney Mitchell Brennan, referred us to a report from the pharmaceutical company Merck, as well as several news stories and editorials that repeat this statistic. A ""Merck for mothers"" report on maternal mortality and morbidity in New York notes that the United States is one of the ""very few developed countries where deaths related to pregnancy or childbirth is increasing."" A report from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Bureau of Maternal, Infant, and Reproductive Health is the source of the statistic in question. The bureau used ""enhanced surveillance"" to gather the data on pregnancy-associated deaths in New York City between 2006 and 2010. That means that the bureau used ""multiple data sources to identify and review deaths that occur during pregnancy or within one year from the end of pregnancy."" This is the most updated data available, according to Danielle De Souza, spokeswoman for the department. From 2006 to 2010, the pregnancy-related mortality ratio for black, non-Hispanic women was 12 times higher than that of white, non-Hispanic women, according to the report. ""This represents a widening of the pregnancy-related mortality gap from 2001 to 2005, when the (pregnancy-related mortality ratio) among Black, non-Hispanic women was seven times greater,"" researchers wrote. The gap grew largely because the pregnancy-related mortality rate fell by 45 percent among white, non-Hispanic women. From 2006 to 2010 in New York City, there were 56.3 deaths of black, non-Hispanic pregnant women per 100,000 live births. During the same period, there were 4.7 deaths of white, non-Hispanic pregnant women per 100,000 live births. The rates for both groups decreased from 2001-2005, when 61.7 black women died and 8.6 white women died per 100,000 live births. From 2006 to 2010, Asian/Pacific Islander women were more than four times as likely and Hispanic women were more than three times as likely as a white woman to die from pregnancy-related causes, researchers found. The report defines pregnancy-related death as ""the death of a woman while pregnant or within one year of the end of pregnancy from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management. In these cases, the pregnancy and death are causally related."" Though Gillibrand said ""childbirth"" in this tweet, her spokeswoman sent us examples of the Senator using ""pregnancy and childbirth"" or ""pregnancy-related complications"" to describe the statistic in question, or related issues. These examples included other tweets and a news release.    The reasons why there are such large health disparities between black and white mothers are ""not well established,"" researchers wrote. However, pregnancy-related deaths are associated with obesity, underlying chronic illness and poverty, which affect the city’s black population at greater rates. Researchers also wrote that the ""chronic stress of racism and social inequality also likely contribute to racial disparities in health."" Government and health officials in New York City are trying to address the issue. Gillibrand said that in New York City, a black woman is 12 times as likely to die in childbirth than a white woman. Data analysis from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene show that black women are 12 times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women during pregnancy or within one year of the end of pregnancy. Because the researchers use a broader timeframe for analyzing pregnancy-related deaths than just during ""childbirth,"" Gillibrand’s characterization needs more context. We rate Gililbrand’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA7DCC0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/02/kirsten-gillibrand/gillibrand-raises-issue-racial-disparity-maternal-/

Old meme is wrong on Bernie Sanders' resume, finances
","Bernie Sanders has announced his second presidential run and it didn’t take long for critics to start spreading their own internet claims about the Vermont senator. A refurbished meme that makes a myriad of assertions about Sanders’ lack of money and experience is circulating again, having first surfaced during his 2016 presidential bid. The full post reads: ""Bernie Sanders. Never opened a business. Never invented anything. Never had a 9-5 job. Never proposed a single bill that passed (25 years in office). Lived off welfare before he was elected office. 74 years old - net worth $300,000. Says he can fix healthcare and the economy. Wants to be President. Just like his hero Karl Marx, succeeded at nothing."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The first couple of claims – that Sanders never opened a business or invented anything – are accurate. He did found the American People’s Historical Society, a nonprofit that, according to Politico, made ""low-budget films about people, places and events in Vermont and New England.""  But this wasn’t a ""business"" in the strictest sense. While voters may certainly like candidates with business ownership on their resumes (and perhaps patented inventions, too), it’s not a requirement nor a path most presidents have taken on their way to the White House. Only seven presidents, including President Trump, were businessmen before they were elected. At the bottom of the post, it also says he is 74 years old and has a net worth of $300,000. This meme hasn’t been updated since it was first shared in 2016, when Sanders actually was 74. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Sanders’ net worth is estimated to be around $2 million as of 2017. We will look more closely at the other claims – that Sanders hasn’t held a ""9-5 job,"" hasn’t proposed any enacted bills, and that he lived off welfare before being elected. This claim could be read literally as meaning he never held a job that required him working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It could also suggest he has never held a steady, full-time job. According to several reports, Sanders didn’t collect a steady paycheck before being elected to office as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in 1981. After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964, though, Sanders did work a series of odd jobs before his political career began. Some of the positions he held include: an aide at a psychiatric hospital, a freelance writer, a preschool teacher and a carpenter. Many of these jobs were likely part time, as Sanders ran for office a few times before winning, but we could not find evidence that proves none were full time, either. And the Sanders campaign did not respond when we asked if any of these jobs were considered full-time positions. That said, Sanders held office for over 30 years in positions that, some would argue, are probably worth the designation full-time positions. Sanders was the primary sponsor of seven pieces of legislation that were enacted, according to records: H.J.Res. 132 (102nd): To designate March 4, 1991, as ""Vermont Bicentennial Day."" H.R. 1353 (102nd): Entitled the ""Taconic Mountains Protection Act of 1991."" H.J.Res. 129 (104th): Granting the consent of Congress to the Vermont-New Hampshire Interstate Public Water Supply Compact. H.R. 5245 (109th): To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1 Marble Street in Fair Haven, Vermont, as the ""Matthew Lyon Post Office Building."" S. 893 (113th): Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013. S. 2782 (113th): A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to improve the Federal charter for the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. S. 885 (113th): A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 35 Park Street in Danville, Vermont, as the ""Thaddeus Stevens Post Office."" There is no evidence to support the notion that Sanders lived off welfare before he was elected. A spokesperson for his campaign also told us the claim is fictitious. It has been reported, however, that, in 1974, Sanders did run for political office while collecting unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are paid to individuals previously employed who are out of work  through no fault of their own. They are funded by taxes paid by employers into unemployment funds to be used specifically for this purpose. ""Welfare,"" as traditionally defined in the United States, consists of a number of government programs designed to help low-income individuals and families buy food, find affordable housing and help pay for medical care. An old meme suggests Sanders is not fit to be president because he hasn’t held a ""9-5 job,"" never proposed a single bill that passed and lived off welfare before he was elected to public office. Sanders didn’t collect a steady paycheck before he was elected, and at one point he ran while he was collecting unemployment. But the meme ignores other positions he held throughout the years as well as his decades serving as an elected official. Sanders has sponsored multiple bills that were eventually enacted and there is no evidence to support the claim that he once lived off welfare. We rate these claims False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD7EEC0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/01/facebook-posts/old-meme-wrong-bernie-sanders-resume-financ/

Fact-checking Bernie Sanders on a $15 minimum wage
","Supporting a $15 minimum wage has become something of a litmus test for Democratic candidates these days -- strikingly so, since as recently as his 2013 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama supported a far more modest increase, a raise from $7.25 to $9. Later that year, he increased his proposal to $10.10. In a Feb. 26 tweet, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. -- who had recently announced his second presidential bid -- touted the benefits of raising the minimum wage to $15. ""We must follow cities and states across the country and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and index it to median wage growth thereafter,"" he wrote. ""Doing so would give more than 40 million low-wage workers a raise, more than 25 percent of the U.S. workforce."" We must follow cities and states across the country and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and index it to median wage growth thereafter. Doing so would give more than 40 million low-wage workers a raise, more than 25 percent of the U.S. workforce. We found that Sanders was close on describing a study released Feb. 5 by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. But it’s important to note that this study assumes that no net jobs will be lost as a result of a minimum wage -- an assumption that is speculative and, in some corners, controversial. The report looks at the potential impact of the Raise the Wage Act of 2019, which was sponsored by Sanders and other Democrats. The bill would phase in increases to the minimum wage so that it reaches $15 by 2024. It would also index future minimum wage increases to median wage growth. The study took into account the projected natural growth of wages between now and 2024 and only counted as gains the amount above that baseline wage growth. It also excluded workers who would not be affected by a minimum wage hike, such as self-employed workers. We should note that Sanders said ""more than 40 million low-wage workers"" would benefit, but the study itself said 39.7 million, which is slightly less than 40 million. In addition, the tweet glosses over the fact that the study looked at the bill’s full phase-in period, from 2019 to 2024. The study does say that 39.7 million Americans will benefit once the $15 level is reached by 2024, but prior to that, the numbers are smaller.     As the chart above shows, the study referred to workers who are ""directly"" impacted by the minimum wage hike as well as workers who are ""indirectly"" affected by it. Indirectly affected workers were defined as having a wage rate just above the new minimum wage. The study assumes that these workers will receive a raise as employers adjust their pay scales upward to reflect the new minimum wage. The biggest concern with the Economic Policy Institute study, though, is that it assumes no net change in employment status as a result of the minimum wage increase. For years, some economists have expressed caution about raising the minimum wage to $15, saying it could raise employers’ costs so much that it leads to higher unemployment. Supporters of a higher minimum wage point to a recent study that indicated that minimum wages between $10 and $13 did not generally lead to negative labor-force impacts. The study didn’t test a $15 minimum wage, however, since that level hasn’t been enacted anywhere yet. We reached out to several economists who had told us in 2016 that they were at least somewhat wary of increasing the wage that high. Timothy Smeeding, a professor of public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin, said the study is incomplete because it only counts the benefits and not the drawbacks. While conservatives ""look only at job losses,"" liberals ""look only at higher pay. The truth is that both will happen."" A particular problem is that a national minimum wage will pack a bigger wallop -- and potentially harm employment levels more -- in states with lower wage scales. In 2016, three states had median wages below $15, another 11 had median wages between $15 and $16, and another nine had median wages between $16 and $17. In these states, mandating a $15 minimum wage could immediately raise wages for close to half of workers, with some seeing their pay roughly double overnight. This could have untold impacts on employment, consumer prices and other aspects of the economy. ""I can’t see how a rapid increase of the minimum to $15 would be in the best interest of such areas, since I’m afraid employment opportunities for the low-skilled might suffer real harm,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. One of the economists we checked back with, Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, said he finally ended his opposition to a $15 minimum wage this week, because Sanders’ bill phases in the increase over several years and because it indexes future increases, removing it from the realm of politics. ""In the past, we have had a minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, as high as the one that is proposed at a period when real labor productivity was lower, on average, than it is today or will be five years hence,"" Aaron said. ""Will there be some employment effects in some places from establishing a $15 minimum wage in 2024? Probably. But the effects will be small and the boost in earnings for relatively low-wage workers will be high."" Ultimately, it’s impossible to know how many jobs will be lost due to a minimum wage hike to $15. What we do know is that Sanders’ tweet focuses on the benefits but not the potential downside, expressing certainty where uncertainty prevails. Sanders said that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 ""would give more than 40 million low-wage workers a raise, more than 25 percent of the U.S. workforce."" That sticks closely to the top-line findings of a study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group. Still, it’s important to note that the study assumed no change in unemployment. That’s a big assumption, and one that is not certain to pan out. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDDA0C0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/01/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-15-minimum-wage/

Cohen and Abrams: A double standard on lying to Congress?
","When Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer and convicted felon testified before a House committee, his Republican questioners had one main line of attack: He was a confessed liar who could never be believed. Near the end of Cohen’s testimony, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., compared him to another confessed liar who later appeared before Congress — Special Representative to Venezuela Elliott Abrams. Omar tweeted this: ""#MichaelCohen: -Convicted of lying to Congress re: Russia investigation -Going to jail -'Don't believe a word he says!' #ElliottAbrams: -Convicted of lying to Congress re: arming Contra death squads -Pardoned, then appointed Envoy to Venezuela -'Don't dare question his past!'

Cohen has been a New York lawyer, a self-described fixer, and investor in a fleet of taxi medallions. Abrams has been a fixture in Republican foreign policy circles for decades. He was assistant Secretary of State during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and served as a special assistant to President George. W. Bush.

Both men pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, but Cohen also pleaded guilty to tax evasion, filing false statements on a loan application and hiding an illegal campaign contribution. That last one involved payments to porn star Stephanie Clifford (also known as Stormy Daniels) to buy her silence in the closing weeks of Trump’s presidential campaign. As for lying to Congress as the tweet claims, Cohen told Senate and House committees in August and October 2017 that discussions over a Trump Moscow development project ended in January 2016, before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. In his pleading, Cohen said that talks continued for months beyond that. ""The defendant’s false statements obscured the fact that the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government,"" government prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo. ""If the project was completed, the Company (the Trump organization) could have received hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues."" On the stump, Trump repeatedly insisted that he had no business ties inside Russia, though he did say he had sold plenty of high-end properties to Russians in America. Abrams’ offense dates to the mid-1980s. The Reagan administration was keen to stifle the leftist government that held power in the Central American nation of Nicaragua. To that end, the United States funded the Contras, an armed insurgency that battled for control of Nicaraguan territory. Congress objected, and in 1982, it banned support for the Contras. The Reagan administration carried on through a covert operation that sold arms to Iran, itself subject to an embargo, and used the proceeds to buy weapons the Contras needed. Abrams supplemented that cash with a $10 million contribution from the sultan of Brunei. Abrams gave the sultan’s representative a Swiss bank account number to complete the transaction. The crash of a small plane helping supply the Contras exposed the operation. Congress investigated. When asked by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence if any foreign government had helped supply the Contras, Abrams said, ""No."" Abrams pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of lying to Congress on the matter. He was later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush. In comparing the two, John Q. Barrett, a law professor at St. John’s University who helped prosecute the Iran-Contra investigation, said, ""Both Abrams and Cohen pleaded guilty and cooperated with law enforcement."" He added, ""Convicted criminals provide truthful and valuable information to government, both law enforcement and legislative oversight, all the time."" The turmoil in Venezuela, with two men claiming to be the country’s rightful leader, widespread protests and economic collapse, brought Abrams back before a congressional committee recently in his role as the administration's Special Representative, a diplomatic post. Omar attacked him (her own word), saying, ""I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful."" Right now, the main difference vis-à-vis false congressional testimony, is that Abrams has been pardoned and Cohen has not. That gives more support for challenging Cohen’s testimony, said Harvard law professor Alex Whiting. But Whiting cautioned that such distinctions are subjective. ""When it comes to convictions for perjury, it is often the case that how one feels about the seriousness of the crime and conviction depends on what one thinks of the person,"" Whiting said. Barrett did object to one part of Omar’s tweet. The Contras, he said, weren’t death squads. They were insurgents. Labels aside, there is credible and corroborated reporting that the Contras killed unarmed men, women and children, committed rape and torture, attacked civilian facilities, such as hospitals and food warehouses, and conducted mass kidnappings. While not all Contra groups were human rights violators, some acted with extreme brutality. Omar tweeted, ""Michael Cohen: Convicted of lying to Congress re: Russia investigation … Elliott Abrams: Convicted of lying to Congress re: arming Contra death squads.""  She was correct that both Cohen and Abrams were guilty of lying to Congress, although her comparison overlooks that Cohen admitted to other violations, including tax and loan fraud. Abrams received a pardon, and whether the Contras are accurately described as ""death squads"" is a complex issue. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA9DC80>],/factchecks/2019/mar/01/ilhan-omar/cohen-and-abrams-double-standard-lying-congress/

Fact-checking Texas congressman on Border Patrol hiring under Trump administration contract
","The Trump administration paid a company millions of dollars to help the government hire Border Patrol agents, but only two agents were employed, claimed U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas. ""(President Donald Trump) put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two, "" Cuellar said during a Feb. 22 press conference in Laredo, Texas. Were only two Border Patrol agents hired under a $14.8 million initial payment of a $297 million contract? Cuellar’s broad claim of a troubled hiring process is accurate. But his statement overlooks some details, and the dollar figure he cited is slightly higher than the initial payment. The federal government has had problems finding and keeping people to work as Border Patrol agents, so it decided to turn to the private sector for help. U.S. Customs and Border Protection in November 2017 awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture Federal Services, so it could help the government recruit and hire 7,500 qualified candidates over five years. The jobs to fill are for Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, and Air and Marine Interdiction agents. The Office of Inspector General within the Department of Homeland Security audited the contract in response to hotline complaints about the contract. The inspector general’s office in a December 2018 report said that Accenture had not delivered the promised hiring process or results and relied on government resources to fulfill its obligations. It detailed several other concerns. ""CBP risks wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a hastily approved contract that is not meeting its proposed performance expectations,"" the report said. ""CBP must hold the contractor accountable, mitigate risk, and devise a strategy to ensure results without additional costs to the government."" As of Oct. 1, 2018 — 10 months into the contract — Customs and Border Protection had paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. ""In return, Accenture has processed two accepted job offers,"" the report said. Cuellar’s office said his claim was based on this finding. The inspector general’s office told PolitiFact that those two accepted job offers processed by Accenture were for a Border Patrol agent and for a Customs and Border Protection officer. (CBP officers work at ports of entry and don’t necessarily go out on patrol duties.) Customs and Border Protection referred PolitiFact to a statement it issued after the report’s publication. ""While we take some exception to the OIG’s characterization of the contract, we do agree the contract has been a challenge, primarily due to the innovative efforts by both parties, and we are reviewing how best to use it moving forward,"" said part of the statement. The inspector general’s report also included Customs and Border Protection’s response to the audit. The agency said it was inaccurate to say that the $13.6 million only yielded two accepted job offers, because Accenture also ""created a hiring structure, tailored technology solutions to support and manage the hiring process, stood up an applicant care center, marketed and recruited thousands of new applicants, and conducted many of the hiring steps for several thousand applicants."" The inspector general’s officer countered that response, saying, ""While we recognize that CBP has worked with Accenture to establish hiring activities, we stand by our statement that such activities have resulted in only two accepted job offers as of Oct. 1, 2018."" One of the issues flagged by the report was a period when neither Accenture nor Customs and Border Protection could determine which applicants were recruited by Accenture, due to Office of Management and Budget restrictions and privacy concerns. Accenture also did not always provide human resource personnel and the people needed to conduct background investigations. And even though Accenture said it could provide an innovative applicant tracking system, it used the government’s hiring system instead, the inspector general report said. Due to those shortcomings, the government modified the contract and gave the company a three-month interim period (March through June 2018) to fix those issues. During this period, Customs and Border Protection did a lot of the work Accenture was supposed to be doing. And because Accenture couldn’t determine which applicants it recruited, the government agreed to give them credit and ""temporarily pay Accenture for a percentage of all applicants regardless of whether CBP or Accenture processed the applicants."" ""As of Oct. 1, 2018, CBP had processed 14 applicants on behalf of Accenture. All 14 applicants accepted job offers, and seven of the 14 entered on duty, which translated to payment of approximately $500,000 to Accenture for work CBP had completed,"" the report said. So, even though there were these additional hires, it’s unclear if they were employed due to Accenture’s recruitment efforts. The inspector general’s report said Accenture was ""nowhere near satisfying its 7,500-person hiring goal over the next 5 years."" Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact there were ""new hires from Accenture"" brought onboard and others who had accepted job offers since the Oct. 1, 2018 date referenced in the report. It’s unclear how many were Border Patrol agents, how many were exclusively recruited and processed by Accenture, and whether they were covered in the initial payment to Accenture. Cuellar said, Trump ""put out a $297 million contract to a vendor to show him how to hire Border Patrol. So, the first payment they made was $14.8 million. You know how many Border Patrol they hired with $14.8 million? Two."" The Trump administration awarded a $297 million contract to Accenture to help Customs and Border Protection hire 7,500 new employees over five years. That includes Border Patrol agents. An inspector general report said that as of Oct. 1, 2018, Customs and Border Protection paid Accenture about $13.6 million for startup costs, security requirements, recruiting, and applicant support. The company to that date had processed two accepted job offers, the report said. One of them was a Border Patrol agent, the other a Customs and Border Protection officer. The report mentioned 14 other accepted job offers processed by Customs and Border Protection on behalf of Accenture. But due to deficiencies in the contract, it’s unclear if those 14 were hired because of Accenture’s recruitment. Cuellar’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBB4040>],/factchecks/2019/mar/01/henry-cuellar/fact-checking-texas-congressman-border-patrol-hiri/

Facebook post claims CNN uses same girl in photos of separate refugee crises
","We’ve seen many social media posts challenge news organizations’ use of war photos. Recently, the Facebook account Defend the Jewish Nation posted a photo collage captioned, ""When CNN uses the same girl in 3 different Refugee Crisis pictures being saved by 3 different men."" In the pictures, a little girl can be seen wearing the same outfit in the hands of three different men, all of whom appear to be evacuating a scene after a bombing. Did CNN use the girl’s photo three times to pass off as three separate occasions of refugee crises? Could they have, as the post post insinuates, staged the photos using a child actor playing the role of someone who was rescued three times by three different men? The answer to both of these questions: No. Here's how we know. We ran a reverse image search on the collage using the online tool TinEye and found the collage meme spread online as early as December 2016. But we could find no instance where the meme specified what on what three occasions CNN supposedly used the photos to illustrate separate crises. So, we decided to look at each image individually. We discovered that CNN has used two of them in their web content. One image (the one on the left) was included in a CNN web story about a barrel bomb airstrike of a funeral in rebel-controlled eastern Aleppo published on Aug. 27, 2016. It was also used as the cover page for a video of CNN on Sept. 17, 2016, according to a search on Wayback Machine. Another photo (the one in the middle) was first included in a CNN web article in early September 2016 in a text story about the agreement between the United States and Russia for Syrian ceasefire. Under the photo, the caption read, ""A Syrian man carries a wounded child in eastern Aleppo in August."" That caption is accurate. The same photos were used in many other news stories by other news organizations reflecting the same event, including NBC and Foreign Policy, according to our search. A reverse image search shows that the photo on the right-hand side appeared in a news article published on Aug. 28, 2016, on AOL about the same event. Our image search found no evidence that CNN used  the photos on its website in a misleading way as to illustrate any other refugee crisis. We also saw no indication that the photos were used in video on the CNN cable channel. The photo versions used by CNN included watermarks on the right-hand side of the images. They were attributed to Ameer Alhalbi (a pseudonym used by Syrian freelance Mashhadiphotographer Walid Mashhadi) for the international news agency Agence France-Presse and visual media company Getty Images. AFP, the agency that distributed the photo confirmed in a fact-check that the three photos involved in the claim were actually taken on the same day — Aug. 27, 2016, in eastern Aleppo, Syria. The photos show a girl being rescued by Syria Civil Defence volunteers, also known as the White Helmets. AFP’s fact-check also stated that the girl was passed along from one volunteer to another, which is why she is pictured wearing the same clothes with three different people holding her. In the first picture, the girl was carried by a rescue worker in a white helmet together with another boy. In other photos, she was moved farther away from the building. In a Washington Post news story on Aug. 27, 2016, about the funeral bombing, we could see that the child was passed over from the rescue worker in the leftmost photo to the man in the plaid shirt in the rightmost photo. That the three photos capture a sequence of rescue action makes sense. Defend the Jewish Nation shared a viral image that accused CNN of using ""the same girl in 3 different Refugee Crisis pictures being saved by 3 different men."" The accusation is unfounded. CNN did not ""use"" the girl or take part in the creation of the photos, and there’s a lack of evidence to prove that the photos were used to refer incorrectly to three different wars. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB3FB00>],/factchecks/2019/mar/01/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-cnn-uses-same-girl-photos-sep/
"['Debt', 'Texas', 'Chip Roy']","
In 2019, the United States will rack up about $100 million in debt every hour
","As Democrats on the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee grilled Michael Cohen, the former personal lawyer of President Donald Trump, many Republicans on the panel described the hearing as a waste of time and suggested government resources could be better spent tackling other issues. Among those members was U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin. Roy posed a series of rapid-fire questions to Cohen before offering his perspective on where lawmakers should really focus their attention. ""Real Americans in my district and across the country wanted the president to be president not in any way because he is perfect, but rather because they are sick and tired of this hellhole,"" Roy said at the hearing. ""They supported this president because they are sick and tired of the games we're seeing here today. They are sick and tired of politicians who refuse to secure the border, balance our budget, restore healthcare freedom and then get the hell out of their way so they can lead their life."" ""They are mystified that we amass about $100 million in debt per hour, which means we've blown through 300, 400, 450 million dollars during this charade in amassing debt,"" he said. ""$450 million."" After hearing his remarks, we had to ask: Is it possible to measure how much the national debt grows per hour? How much did debt amass during Wednesday’s hearing? Math behind the claim uses projections, not historical data Roy’s spokesman Robert Donachie said the congressman claimed that ""we amass $100 million in debt per hour"" by using data from a report published by the Congressional Budget Office in January of this year. The Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, is a nonpartisan agency that offers independent federal fiscal projections for budget writers at the Capitol. The report, titled ""The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2019 to 2029,"" states that the projected federal deficit for 2019 is about $900 billion. From there, Donachie said the congressman’s office did the math by dividing $900 billion by 8,760, the number of hours in a year, and found that the deficit would grow by $102,739,726.03 per hour this year. Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, said the math the congressman used is right, but Roy could have used different values other than projections in his calculation. ""How you want to calculate (the value) is part of your game,"" Harkins said. Using projections for the current year, instead of actual figures from the past calendar year, is a fine way to develop an estimate of debt accrued by the hour. But projections are just estimates, meaning things could change based on outside factors like shifts in economic activity, unexpected expenses like from natural disasters or new legislation affecting taxes or expenses. ""The CBO is trying to estimate what tax receipts are going to be in April -- no way,"" Harkins said. ""Good luck with that. They’re educated people and they have a shot, a better shot than most, but it’s still a dartboard."" Harkins said Roy could have come to a more concrete number by using the actual deficit from 2018 to see how much debt amassed per hour last year. That number wouldn’t necessarily tell you about what the rate looks like in 2019, but it’s a more fixed value than the one Roy calculated using the projected deficit. The actual deficit of calendar year 2018 was nearly $873 billion, which means the deficit grew by an average of about $99 million every hour last year. The federal deficit is seasonal Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University, said Roy’s claim is right only if he is speaking generally about the average growth per hour and not about  growth at a specific time on a specific day. ""The way I would have revised the quote would have been to say that, ‘the CBO projects that we will amass, on average, $100 million per hour over the next year,’"" she said. ""That’s a perfectly precise and correct quote."" But without that clarifying language, things start to get dicey. ""I would be concerned about the debt-per-hour concept because of seasonality,"" Sinclair said, referencing the idea that the federal deficit is constantly changing, depending on the time of year and whether taxes are due. This means it’s not a great idea to use annual projections of the deficit to try to calculate how much debt was amassed at a specific time on a specific day, because the deficit and its growth rate change at every moment. Instead, Sinclair said looking at the U.S. Treasury Department’s value of the national debt on a specific day will paint a more accurate picture of debt amassed over a certain time period. But these daily values are not published until several days after the fact, making it near impossible to do a real-time estimation. So when Roy said that ""we’ve blown through 300, 400, 450 million dollars"" since the start of Wednesday’s hearing, he’s likely off base. ""That’s almost certainly not correct,"" Sinclair said of his claim. ""But is it a good approximation of about how much it could have been? I’d say it’s a fair illustration of if you took four hours out of 2019 and tried to calculate debt amassed based on CBO projections."" Our rating Roy said Wednesday that, ""we amass about $100 million in debt per hour, which means we’ve blown through 300, 400, 450 million dollars during this charade in amassing debt,"" referencing a house committee hearing featuring testimony from Cohen. While reviewing this claim, we learned that there is no one right way to calculate how much the national debt grows by the hour. There are different ways to show the relationship between the national debt and time, but each calculation is different. Roy’s assessment of debt accrued by the hour is correct if he’s speaking generally about the average growth per hour, but not if he’s trying to literally calculate how much debt was amassed between 10 a.m. EST and 2:25 p.m. EST on Feb. 27 of this year. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB28D40>],/factchecks/2019/feb/28/chip-roy/2019-united-states-will-rack-about-100-million-deb/

Kamala Harris tries to ‘rewrite history’ with False claim on San Francisco ICE policy
","Presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has made protecting undocumented youth a top priority during her time in the Senate. She’s been a vocal supporter, for example, of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which gives temporary protections to more than 700,000 young undocumented immigrants, or Dreamers, brought to the country as children. But on the campaign trail in Iowa this past weekend, Harris made some questionable statements about a 2008 San Francisco policy that reported undocumented youth to federal immigration officials upon their arrest by local police. Harris, San Francisco’s District Attorney at the time, supported the policy, which didn’t take into account whether the youth were actually found guilty of a crime. Speaking on an Iowa politics podcast on Sunday, Harris said handing over undocumented youth to U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, or ICE, was ""an unintended consequence"" of the policy. Here’s the exchange: Question: ""Could you kind of give us some insight on how, from that time, when for whatever reason you were supporting this policy that was essentially handing over undocumented people to ICE before they had been convicted to now -- kind of what's changed on that and how you came to those changes?""  Harris’ response: ""That ended up being an unintended consequence of the policy and I did not support that consequence of that policy. And that policy I believe has since changed because it was not the intended purpose of that policy."" We decided to fact-check her claim that turning over undocumented youth to ICE was ""an unintended consequence"" of this strategy.   Background on San Francisco policy  Before 2008, San Francisco’s policy was to not report arrested undocumented youth to ICE at all, as part of its sanctuary city protections. Then Mayor and current California Gov. Gavin Newsom changed that approach in 2008 after a 21-year-old undocumented man was arrested for killing three members of a family in San Francisco. The man had been arrested before, at age 17, and convicted of attempted robbery and assault but was not reported to federal immigration authorities. Former San Francisco County Supervisor David Campos strongly opposed the policy change. Asked about Harris’ statement, he said ""it just doesn’t fly."" ""With all due respect to Sen. Harris, who has been a friend, I don’t understand how she can say that,"" said Campos, who led the board’s effort to reverse the policy, and is now chairperson of the San Francisco Democratic Party. ""Turning over young people and children who were accused of a crime that later turned out they did not commit was not an unintended consequence of what was going on. It was precisely what was going on and what we were trying to avoid,"" Campos said. ""You can’t rewrite history."" The Board of Supervisors voted to overturn Newsom’s policy in October 2009 and overrode his veto the next month, according to a Mercury-News article. But that wasn’t the end of the controversy. Newsom refused to enforce the reversal. ""His administration cited a memo from City Attorney Dennis Herrera, which argued that the supervisors’ reform would be ""likely to result in a federal legal challenge,"" potentially to the sanctuary city law as a whole — although it also noted that ""the law in this area is not well developed,"" the paper reported. Harris expressed the same concerns in a speech at Stanford University in 2009, as cited in a CNN.com article that reviewed Harris’ support for the policy. Harris explained her position this way: ""There was then an initiative that was written by the board of supervisors that was passed and there was opposition to that but it did pass,"" Harris said in the 2009 speech. ""And so we're gonna have to wait to see how the courts interpret what it means. From my perspective, I think that it would be in conflict with federal law, and we have to follow the law. We have to follow that law. You may not agree with it, but you know, that's why we have a process where you can challenge laws. And it is the law."" Newsom’s policy was eventually changed by his successor in the mayor’s office, Ed Lee, who ordered in May 2011 that most juveniles with family ties to the Bay Area not be reported to ICE, the Mercury-News added. It ""was the purpose of this troubling policy""  Angela Chan, a San Francisco immigration attorney who opposed the mayor’s policy, told PolitiFact California this week in an email that referring youth to ICE ""wasn't an unintended consequence, it was the purpose of this troubling policy."" Chan is policy director at Advancing Justice Asian Law Caucus. She represented a family whose 13-year-old son was referred to ICE under Newsom’s strategy. The mayor’s approach ""was a pretty drastic change,"" she told us last year, when we reported on the policy during the gubernatorial campaign. ""Prior to that point, the focus was on rehabilitation and on the appropriate placement of the child and also on reunification with the family."" Last summer, then-Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox claimed Newsom ""separated families and deported children before he was against it,"" comparing what Newsom did to the the Trump administration’s separation of migrant children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border. We found Cox was partially correct but that his statement also unfairly conflated Newsom’s policy with Trump’s, despite some stark differences in detail and circumstance. Even so, some undocumented youth were deported due to Newsom’s policy. Chan said ""dozens"" of juveniles between the ages of 12 and 18 were reported to ICE each month, both on felony and misdemeanor charges and ""some kids were actually deported as a result of that policy."" She said her legal efforts blocked the deportation of a 13-year-old she represented who was nearly deported for punching a classmate and stealing 46 cents. Harris didn’t lead the charge on the new strategy, Chan added, but was ""a tacit supporter."" Harris has subsequently said the policy ""could have been applied more fairly."" Asked about the senator’s claim on the podcast, her campaign spokesman issued a written statement: ""As Governor Newsom has said, his initial policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of San Francisco, which Senator Harris has always supported and defended. In Iowa, Senator Harris was clearly talking about how she believes the policy shouldn’t have been done the way it was done."" We asked Campos and Chan about that response. Campos said the claim that Newsom’s policy was necessary to protect the city’s sanctuary status ""doesn’t pass the straight-face test."" Chan, who listened to the podcast, said San Francisco’s sanctuary status, which is decided by city leaders, was never in jeopardy. ""That makes no sense whatsoever,"" she said of the campaign’s explanation. An in-depth look at Harris’ statement by CNN.com this week also found the senator ""mischaracterized"" the policy, finding multiple inaccuracies. Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris claimed on a recent podcast that turning over arrested undocumented youth to immigration officials was ""an unintended consequence"" of a 2008 San Francisco policy she supported. That, in fact, was the very purpose of the policy. It was specifically designed by then San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom to allow local police to report arrested undocumented youth to ICE, according to news reports and those who opposed the policy. Previously, the city did not refer arrested undocumented youth to ICE. Harris also stated she ""did not support that consequence of the policy,"" which is also dubious given past news articles that cite her support for Newsom’s change.   Additionally, Harris said the policy was only changed because of an ""unintended consequence."" That’s also wrong. Newsom resisted changing it, and it was only reformed after a new mayor was elected. On the podcast, Harris said she feels strongly that undocumented residents should be protected by and able to trust local law enforcement ""without having to worry about"" whether they will be deported. That sentiment, however, doesn’t take away from her mischaracterization of the goal and fraught history of the 2008 policy she supported. We rate Harris' claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said San Francisco’s policy, before Newsom’s change in 2008, was to refer arrested undocumented youth to ICE only after a criminal conviction. In fact, before the change, the city’s policy was to not refer undocumented youth to ICE at all.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA9DF40>],/factchecks/2019/feb/28/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-tries-rewrite-history-false-claim-sa/
"['Education', 'North Carolina', 'Various media reports 2']","
NC education bill won't change student or school grades
","Don’t let anyone fool you: your kid’s 85 score is still a B and his 50 is still an F.  But you might not know that from the media coverage of a recently filed bill on education policy in North Carolina. Parents and news consumers were left confused by vague headlines and misleading tweets. House Bill 145 deals with the state’s method for assessing the effectiveness of individual public schools — and doesn’t affect student grade scales at all. The state currently assesses schools on a 15-point scale and the bill aims to re-establish that method next year. So, why the confusion? The bill uses a letter-based measurement system and language — grade, scale, performance — often associated with student grades and report cards. The bill also gives the impression things are changing because it shows a 10-point scale with the numbers crossed-out. Still, the bill never uses the word ""student."" And it clearly refers to a system that’s meant to offer a glimpse of the effectiveness of a school’s administration and teachers by calculating academic achievement and growth. Unfortunately, some of the media coverage didn’t convey that reality. MISLEADING REPORTS Many TV stations reported on the bill with misleading headlines or descriptions. The first line of a WNCN story says the bill might change the grading scale used ""in state public schools."" This gives the impression the scale is applied by teachers to students, not by the state to the school. Anchor Angela Taylor then described the bill by saying it would change ""your child’s school performance scores."" The NBC affiliate in Charlotte, WCNC, used a WRAL story to report on the bill. WCNC’s headline says ""NC lawmakers consider bill that would change school grades."" The Charlotte station’s tweet may have added to the confusion. The tweet included a photo of a person holding a pencil accompanied by the caption: ""The new bill under consideration would adjust the current grading scale, making a score of 85 an A and a score of 70 a B."" The station has 215,000 followers. The tweet didn’t specifically say the bill affected students. But it was so vague that readers might come to that conclusion. The story now includes an editor’s note on both WCNC and WRAL websites. It says: ""This new scale applies to the grades schools receive based on performance. It would not change the scale used to grade students."" WRAL later changed its headline to say: ""Bill would keep school performance grades on 15-point scale."" Fox affiliates used similar headlines in stories about the bill. Charlotte-based Fox 46 used a bare-bones headline saying the bill ""would change grading scale."" REACTION Reaction to the stories was also misleading. Lt. Gov. Dan Forest tweeted a WBTV story with the headline, ""NC General Assembly mulling over changing school grading scales."" Forest tweeted a comment about the story that mentioned students. ""Instead of lowering our expectations for our education system, we should be raising our standards for our students so that they can compete in a 21st Century global economy,"" he said. Andrew Siciliano, the host of an NFL show on DirecTV, tweeted that the bill directly affects students. He has 157,000 followers on Twitter. ""North Carolina wants to give your kid an ""A"" with an 85. Embarrassing,"" he tweeted, along with a link to a story by WRAL. Karen Zatkulak, a reporter at Asheville-based WLOS, asked NC Education Superintendent Mark Johnson about the bill during an interview. Her question, which comes around the 7:45 mark of a Facebook video, doesn’t clarify whether the bill affects students or schools. Johnson says he’s not aware of the bill and wants to talk to legislators about it. But he adds: ""I don’t know if we necessarily want to make our grading scale less rigorous in order to give more students As,"" Johnson responds. Thursday afternoon, pundits on the Fox News show, ""The Five,"" also talked about the bill as if it would affect students. ""I think failing is good for character,"" host Jesse Watters said. ""Now you can pass with what, a 40 percent? That’s pathetic. That’s why the Chinese are taking over."" WHAT THE BILL SAYS Not only is the bill inconsequential for students, it also makes no major changes to the state’s grading scale for schools. The bill’s effects — and some of the public’s misinterpretations on social media — are detailed on a blog operated by Justin Parmenter, a teacher in Charlotte. The North Carolina State Board of Education assesses school effectiveness on a 100-point scale. Current law requires the state to grade schools on a 15-point scale: The bill makes it seem like the state currently operates on a 10-point grading scale. That’s because HB 145 is a version of a bill passed several years ago granting the state permission to operate a 15-point scale for schools, said Drew Elliot, communications director for NC DPI. A law from 2013 ""originally set out a 10-point scale for school report cards. However, that scale was never used because it has been superseded by an annual waiver, usually in the budget bill, since the inception of the School Performance Grades,"" Elliot said. HB 145 would make the 15-point scale permanent, ""obviating the need for the annual waiver,"" Elliot said. OUR RULING A lot of people — some media outlets, politicians, pundits and a sports reporter — got this one wrong. Not only does the bill not affect students’ grades, it also makes no major changes to the state system used to give parents an idea of a school’s effectiveness. We rate this claim False.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Terry Katsma']","
Wisconsin lawmaker's claim about rainy day fund is on the money
","Fiscal responsibility has been stressed by Republican leadership over the years. Indeed, state Rep. Terry Katsma (R-Oostburg) claims that under GOP leadership, Wisconsin accumulated much more money than it has in the past in its ""rainy day fund"" -- essentially a piggy bank to be used for emergencies. ""The rainy day fund that we have is $320 million. That's much more than what it has been in the past,"" Katsma said Feb. 17, 2019 on WISN-TV’s UpFront with Mike Gousha. Katsma, a member of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, made the claim while defending his stance that the state should return money accumulated in the surplus to taxpayers. Is Katsma accurate on the size of the fund? The backup Let’s start with what rainy day funds cover and what they can be used for. ""What a rainy day fund is is money that’s set aside in case of a fiscal problem or fiscal crisis and different states have different mechanisms for triggering the rainy day fund,"" said Randall Holcombe, an economics professor at Florida State University, who studies the effect of government activity on economic growth. ""For example, if the budget falls before a certain percentage of forecast revenues, that might trigger access to a rainy day fund."" At the end of the 2018 fiscal year, the state had a surplus of $588.5 million in its general fund and a transfer of $33.1 million was made to the rainy day fund, according to the 2018 State of Wisconsin Annual Fiscal Report. ""This transfer increased the budget stabilization (rainy day) fund to $320.1 million, its largest balance in state history,"" the report reads. As a point of reference, in 2008, Wisconsin’s rainy day fund was only $1.3 million, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. When asked for backup on the claim, Nick Krueger, Katsma’s communications director, pointed to both the annual report and the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. ""When Rep. Katsma has referenced the Rainy Day Fund in the context of a conversation about income tax cuts, the point he is making is that the state government can afford to cut taxes because the government still has money left over even after making a new deposit in our ‘savings account,’"" Krueger said. So, Katsma’s numbers add up. But in his claim is he offering the full picture? Rainy Day Funds across the country In 2017, state rainy day funds were at their highest overall level in almost 20 years, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers, with a tally of $54.7 billion for all 50 states. Sounds like a lot. But Pew Charitable Trusts reports that the $54.7 billion would only cover a median of 20.5 days, or 5.6 percent of general fund spending. In 2017, Alaska, Wyoming and Texas were in the lead for how many days they could cover with a rainy day fund -- Alaska would be able to fund 376.6 days, Wyoming 366.9 days, Texas 70 days. The four states coming at the bottom -- Montana, Kansas, Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- would be able to fund zero days relying on their rainy day funds. Wisconsin fell on the lower end -- able to only fund six days using its rainy day fund. With its total reserves, Wisconsin could fund up to 18.4 days. That compares to the national median of 30.3 days. ""A typical reason you would want to have a rainy day fund is a recession appears, you weren’t expecting it, and so you need to make up the revenues because of the recession, but I don’t think any states have enough revenue set aside so you can make up for the entire recession,"" Holcombe said. So while Wisconsin’s fund may be at its peak, the figure does not compare favorably with other states. That was missing from the claim. Our rating Katsma claimed that Wisconsin accumulated much more money than it has in the past in its ""rainy day fund,"" with $320 million. The claim is on target, though that is relative. Wisconsin is far below the national average on the relative size of its fund. The definition for Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA80800>],/factchecks/2019/feb/28/terry-katsma/state-lawmakers-claim-about-rainy-day-fund-money/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Fact-checking Donald Trump's tweet saying Democrats 'don’t mind executing' babies after birth
","On Feb. 25, the Senate took up a bill backed by anti-abortion advocates called the ""Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act."" Under the bill, ""any infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient within its care."" The bill goes on to say that anyone (except the mother) who ""intentionally performs or attempts to perform an overt act that kills a child born alive"" can be prosecuted for ""intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being."" The bill failed on a procedural motion, with 53 votes in favor when 60 were needed to advance it. The only senators who crossed party lines were Democrats who voted in favor of the measure: Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Doug Jones of Alabama, and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Later that day, President Donald Trump registered his disappointment in a pair of linked tweets: ""Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth. This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, it’s protecting the lives of innocent babies."" Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth.... Those are strong words. We wondered: Is it true that the Democrats vote against the bill mean that they ""don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth""? After interviewing a range of experts on both sides of the abortion-policy divide, we concluded that while Democrats have left themselves open to this line of attack, Trump’s claim is inaccurate. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Broadly, critics of the bill said that it would take decisions out of the hands of parents and medical professionals and hand it to politicians. Democrats also argued that the number of relevant cases is vanishingly small, and usually involve heartbreaking situations that often have specific, unusual factors at play that are hard to accommodate in advance. Because of this, they saw the bill as a chance for Republicans to embarrass Democrats rather than as a genuine piece of legislation aiming to solve a significant problem. Perhaps the Democrats’ most basic argument in the context of Trump’s charge, however, is that laws already exist to cover the scenario the bill would seek to prevent, making the new bill redundant. In a floor speech before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ""It has always been illegal to harm a newborn infant. This vote has nothing—nothing—to do with that. Read the language."" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, echoed that argument. ""This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed, because that is not up for debate and it is already the law,"" she said. Most legal experts we contacted agreed with this much of the Democrats’ argument: Killing a baby after birth is already against the law. ""Actively killing an infant born alive is a crime,"" said Lois Shepherd, a professor of law and biomedical ethics at the University of Virginia and author of the books Rationing Health Care at the End of Life and If That Ever Happens to Me: Making Life and Death Decisions After Terri Schiavo. ""Under the law, living infants are just like other living people. They are children. Children are people."" Legal experts pointed to several specific laws relevant to newborns: • The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, first passed in 1974 and subsequently revised, including major updates in the 1980s. The relevant portion of the law makes certain types of federal funding for states conditional on their adoption of policies to prevent improper withholding of treatment from newborns, including those with disabilities. • The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 established that federal legal protections that applied to ""persons"" also covered children born at any stage of development, including after an abortion. The law did not directly create civil or criminal penalties, however -- something the 2019 bill would have added. Filling that omission was a key motivator for supporters of the bill. The 2002 law is ""toothless and purely symbolic,"" said Dwight Duncan, a University of Massachusetts law professor who serves on the the boards of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund and Massachusetts Citizens for Life. • State laws. State, rather than federal, laws ""are the primary source of protection against active or negligent killing of infants born during the process of abortion,"" said Teresa S. Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas and director of the university’s Prolife Center. In 2002, Collett said, Congress identified 30 states that had some statutory protection for infants surviving an attempted abortion. ""Most states would allow prosecution of doctors for killing or failing to resuscitate after a live birth,"" said Douglas O. Linder, an emeritus law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In fact, the highest-profile case of this type was prosecuted under state laws: The 2013 trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who was sentenced to three life terms for killing a series of late-term newborns in gruesome fashion. ""Not to provide standard newborn care for those infants that happen to survive an abortion and emerge breathing could be considered a form of negligent killing or homicide,"" Duncan said. Part of the reason that tensions over abortion have been heightened this year is the consideration of bills in two states -- New York and Virginia -- to ease some of the state-level rules governing abortions, particularly late-term abortions. (We previously fact-checked a statement by Trump about the Virginia bill and another about the New York bill.) Critics of the Democratic position on the Senate bill say the redundancy argument is a fig leaf for political considerations. If Democrats agree with the overall principle, the argument goes, there is little harm in passing a law that reinforces existing statutes. ""Personally, I do not think it credible for Democrats to say they are against ‘executing babies after birth’ if they are unwilling to provide criminal and civil penalties to abortion doctors that kill babies that survive abortions, nor provide equal standard of medical care for such babies,"" Duncan said. ""It is a largely rhetorical strategy to get out of an embarrassing position."" There is a long tradition in Congress by both parties of putting forward bills that seek to force the other party into casting awkward votes. This law would fall into that category, said Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor and author of the books Beyond Abortion: Roe v. Wade and the Fight for Privacy and After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate. The Senate bill ""mostly appealed to Republicans because it would put Democrats in a difficult political situation,"" Ziegler said. ""Polls show that most Americans are uncomfortable with later abortions, much less anything after a live birth. Focusing on this issue is strategically savvy, even if it would make very little difference to the overall number of abortions."" On the other hand, experts agreed that Trump’s use of the word ""executing"" grossly exaggerated the Democratic position. ""My impression is that the term ‘execution’ is generally reserved for public application of the death penalty,"" Duncan said. Merriam-Webster’s definition of ""execution"" agrees. It says the word refers to ""a putting to death, especially as a legal penalty."" Certainly the deaths envisioned by the recent bill aren’t carried out as a legal penalty. In reality, both sides agree that active killing of a breathing newborn is -- and should be -- illegal. ""There is a broad consensus that a child that takes its first breath has crossed a bright line from fetus to child and should be protected by the law,"" Collett said. ""This is a clear-cut concept that we can all agree upon,"" said Gretchen Ely, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo’s School of Social Work and a board member for Social Workers for Reproductive Justice. ""The notion that anyone supports executing infants after birth is preposterous."" More complicated are cases in which the newborn is so severely disabled that they may not survive beyond a few days. ""Many abortions that occur later in pregnancy involve fetal anomalies incompatible with life, such as anencephaly, the absence of the brain and cranium above the base of the skull, or limb-body wall complex, when the organs develop outside of the body cavity,"" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has written. A failure to resuscitate, which is typical in such cases, ""is a much more contentious issue,"" said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. ""Babies born post-abortion, spontaneous or induced, with horrible and potentially painful conditions incompatible with life, would not be routinely resuscitated or aggressively treated by most medical teams. In fact some would not even know how to try, or lack the technology to do so, especially in rural areas."" Caplan said he is unaware of examples of ""medically active killing,"" and that while ""allowing to die does happen,"" it occurs ""very rarely—say, a baby born with no lungs at 20 weeks."" In such a scenario, Trump’s image of an ""execution"" is hyperbole, experts said. ""I do not have a clue what is meant by ‘executing’ after birth,"" said Leslie Francis, director of the Center for Law and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Utah who also serves as a member of the ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and previously served as a director of the Disability Law Center. Trump said, ""The Democrat(ic) position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth."" There’s little question that the vote on the Senate bill was uncomfortable for Democrats: They effectively voted against a bill whose principles they said they support, arguing that the bill would be redundant because those principles are already enshrined in law. However, Trump overreached when he described Democrats as tolerating ""executing"" newborns. No one supports actively killing newborns, much less ""executing"" them; the contested terrain concerns what efforts should be made to extend the lives of babies who are not expected to survive long with severe disabilities.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Bernie Sanders']","
Bernie Sanders has numbers to show Donald Trump wanted to cut health care for 32 million
","The first question Sen. Bernie Sanders faced in a CNN town hall meeting with voters was what he would do to make sure President Donald Trump would be defeated. Sanders began by saying why it was important to unseat Trump. ""It's not only that we have a president who wanted to throw 32 million people off of the health care they had, after promising that he'd provide health care to everybody,"" said the Vermont Independent Feb. 25. ""This president is the first president in the modern history of our country who is trying to divide our people up, based on the color of their skin, the country they were born in, their sexual orientation, their gender, their religion."" In this fact-check, we examine whether Trump wanted 32 million people to lose the health care they had. Trump has talked about his health care goals in broad sweeping terms, at times even contradicting himself. But ultimately, governing comes down to legislative and executive action. Sanders bases his number on Trump’s ongoing attempts to overturn the Affordable Care Act. We'll put Sanders’ claim into context. In the Republican presidential primary, Trump offered two pillars of his health care plan. ""We're getting rid of Obamacare,"" he said at a March 5, 2016 rally. ""It's a total disaster that's being replaced. And we'll have great health care at a fraction of the cost."" In general, Trump talked of increasing competition and using the private market to deliver better insurance. He also said his goal was to meet the needs of the poorest. ""There's going to a group of people at the bottom, people that haven't done well,"" he said Feb. 18, 2016. ""We're going to take care of them through, maybe, concepts of Medicare."" (Medicare is primarily for seniors, while Medicaid is for the poor, so Trump’s meaning is unclear.) After the election, with Republicans in control of the White House and Congress, the legislative process began. Trump exhorted Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. The first victory came when the House passed the American Health Care Act. House Republicans gathered with Trump at the White House to celebrate. Trump said, ""What we have is something very, very incredibly well-crafted."" ""This is a great plan,"" Trump said May 4, 2017. ""I actually think it will get even better. And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and replace of Obamacare."" The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the House bill would reduce the number of people who would otherwise be insured by 23 million by 2026. Trump later called the House bill ""mean"" and said he hoped the Senate version would add more money. The Senate struggled to pass health care legislation. Trump pressed Republicans to unify around a bill. At a July 24, 2017, White House meeting with senators, he said the Senate version ""will deliver truly great health care."" The Congressional Budget Office estimated that under the Senate bill, 15 million people would lose insurance after one year and 22 million by 2026. With a late night dramatic thumbs-down vote from the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, the measure failed. Trump often voiced regret over that moment. ""We had health care, it was done,"" he said in an Oct. 17, 2017, radio interview. ""And then a hand went up and then the hand was — went up in the wrong direction at two o'clock in the morning, and everybody was shocked by it and disappointed."" One other proposal had been in play in the Senate. It would have repealed large pieces of Obamacare, including the requirement to have insurance, expanded Medicaid and premium subsidies, but it wouldn’t have replaced those with any new programs. Trump voiced support for that sort of hardball approach. ""If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date,"" he tweeted June 30, 2017. If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date! Two weeks later, he repeated that line. ""Republicans should just REPEAL failing Obamacare now and work on a new health care plan that will start from a clean slate,"" Trump tweeted July 17, 2017. ""Dems will join in!"" Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in! The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the repeal bill would lead to 32 million more people without insurance by 2026. The impact wouldn’t come immediately, but it would rise quickly, from 17 million in the first year, to 27 million after three years, then adding another 5 million by the end of the period. The Sanders campaign pointed to that estimate as proof that Trump wanted to deny 32 million people the health care they otherwise would have. But some portion of that 32 million would have chosen not to buy insurance due to the end of the individual mandate. The CBO doesn't estimate how many exactly because there are two ways this plays out. Some people wouldn't buy solely because they no longer face a penalty, and others would drop coverage because premiums would rise or insurers would pull out of the markets where they live. (The end of the mandate would encourage healthier people to stop buying, leaving sicker people in the insurance pool, producing higher rates.) For that unknown fraction of people who could have afforded insurance and simply chose not to buy because they didn't have to, their insurance wasn't taken away. It was something they didn't want. Ultimately, no health care bill passed. Sanders said that Trump ""wanted to throw 32 million people off of the health care they had."" This is based on Trump’s encouraging Senate Republicans to vote for a repeal bill. After three years, the measure would have reduced the ranks of the insured by 27 million, and 32 million after nine years. Those are government estimates of the future, and not people who would immediately lose insurance, as some might understand Sanders’ words. In addition, the 32 million includes some unknown number of people who would choose not to buy insurance soley due to the end of the individual mandate. Plus, Trump also supported measures that would reduce the number of insured people by 23 million and 22 million. This makes it more difficult to tie him to a specific reduction in the number of insured. It is reasonable to say that Trump backed the loss of insurance for tens of milllions of people over time, but not more than that. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC023C40>],/factchecks/2019/feb/28/bernie-sanders/sanders-trump-wanted-cut-health-care-32-million/

No, the Green New Deal doesn't aim to end air travel, as Florida Sen. Rick Scott says
","After U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., unveiled the Green New Deal, Republican critics said it would eventually ground air travel. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., outlined his opposition to the Democrats’ Green New Deal in a Feb. 25th Orlando Sentinel op-ed: ""If you are not familiar with it, here’s the cliff notes version: It calls for rebuilding or retrofitting every building in America in the next 10 years, eliminating all fossil fuels in 10 years, eliminating nuclear power, and working towards ending air travel (to be replaced with high-speed rail)."" Scott described mayhem if a Democrat wins the presidency; some 2020 presidential candidates are co-sponsors of the Green New Deal. ""What then? Tear down all buildings, eliminate oil and gas, and stop air travel?"" Let’s hit the brakes right there -- do the Democrats want to end air travel?  We found that Scott is ignoring the actual text of the resolution. The resolution does not ground airplanes, either now or in the future. And climate advocates told us the elimination of air travel isn’t a practical goal. The ""Green New Deal,"" resolution was introduced by Ocasio-Cortez on Feb. 7 and has 89 Democratic co-sponsors. A companion measure in the Senate, introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., has nearly a dozen sponsors -- all Democrats -- including presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Broadly, these resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Even if it were to pass both chambers, the resolution would be nonbinding. So what does the House resolution say about air travel? In a word, nothing. It makes no mention of airplanes at all. It does call for ""overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" We reached out to Scott’s press office and did not hear back by deadline, but the senator was probably referring to some supporting documents released by Ocasio-Cortez’s staff. A frequently asked questions, or FAQ, document mentioned airplanes twice, stating (emphasis ours) ""we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero."" The FAQ also called for the United States to ""totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle."" (For the record, according to the UC Santa Barbara ScienceLine, ""cows do contribute to global warming, although in fact they mostly do so by burping rather than farting."") As soon as the the FAQ document became public, the idea that the Democrats wanted to make air travel obsolete was picked up by Fox News and some Republican politicians, including President Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez’s press office did not reply for this fact-check, but her chief of staff previously said that there were many shared documents among various interest groups, and that the release of this particular document was a mistake. Experts on climate change say it’s important to focus on the language in the actual resolution and not the FAQ, which carries no weight. ""It seems to me those lines from the FAQ were lighthearted and ill-considered, and it’s not clear why they were posted,"" said Sean Hecht, Co-Executive Director, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA law school. Hecht noted that the FAQ doesn’t include any regulatory strategy to ban or even reduce air travel. ""It’s framed even in the FAQ as creating conditions where ‘air travel stops becoming necessary’ because alternatives are available -- not limiting or ending air travel,"" he said. David Weiskopf, climate policy director for NextGen Climate America, said the Green New Deal calls for a ""net-zero"" goal, which recognizes that emissions -- including from air travel -- won’t be eliminated in 10 years, so there would need to find negative emissions to balance them out. (NextGen Climate America was started by billionaire Tom Steyer. In 2018, the PAC supported Scott’s Democratic opponent, Bill Nelson.) ""The comment about cows and planes is not at all an expression of a policy goal to actually eliminate either. It is delivering information that some supporters may not want to hear -- that we will not zero out emissions completely, so we need some additional negative emissions -- expressed in what I take to be a colloquial tone that unfortunately left it open to misconstrual by critics,"" he said. ""No serious observer, supporter of the Green New Deal, climate scientist, or other climate advocate would take these statements as expressing a policy aim to eliminate cows or planes."" Air travel retains a unique role in moving people long distances. ""When people rank the difficulty of finding structural solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in various sectors, air travel is one of the hardest both technologically and practically, and there aren’t serious policy proposals yet that would solve the issue through limiting air travel or changing the energy sources for commercial aircraft on a significant scale,"" Hecht said. ""So it’s not a priority for policy."" Serious steps that the United States could take to reduce emissions from air travel emissions would include more efficient planes, more direct routes and alternative bio-based low-carbon fuels. In the long run, electric planes may be feasible, said Paul Bledsoe, a strategic advisor at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer on environmental policy at American University. ""No serious climate experts advocate ending air travel -- that's simply a red-herring,"" said Bledsoe, who was a climate change advisor to the Clinton White House. Time to bring this fact-check in for a landing. Scott wrote in an op-ed that the Democrats’ Green New Deal includes ""working towards ending air travel."" The resolution makes no mention of ending air travel. Instead, it calls for ""overhauling transportation systems,"" which includes ""investment in high-speed rail."" Scott seized on a messaging document from Democrats that mentioned, perhaps in jest, getting rid of ""farting cows and airplanes."" But we found no evidence that getting rid of airplanes is a serious policy idea from climate advocates.

"['Supreme Court', 'North Carolina', 'North Carolina Republican Party']","
Republicans mostly wrong about NC governor breaking Supreme Court tradition
","After the chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court announced his plans to resign, Republicans called on Gov. Roy Cooper to hand the gavel to a Republican. State law mandates that the governor fill judicial vacancies. And Chief Justice Mark Martin is one of only two Republicans on the bench. But Cooper, a Democrat, announced on Feb. 12 his intention to move Supreme Court justice Cheri Beasley, a Democrat, into the chief justice seat. Republicans immediately criticized the move as partisan, arguing that Cooper should’ve appointed Republican Paul Newby, the senior associate justice, to the chief justice position. Many said it’s a ""tradition"" to appoint the senior associate justice. Newby himself criticized the move as ""raw partisan politics."" NC Senate leader Phil Berger said it’s ""reasonable"" to conclude that Cooper passed over Newby ""because of his party affiliation"" and mentioned the appointment on Feb. 25 when he responded to Cooper’s State of the State address. NC GOP chairman Robin Hayes released a statement about the issue, suggesting that previous governors appointed chief justices from across the political aisle as part of a ""tradition."" ""One can only believe the reason Cooper decided to ignore the longstanding, nonpartisan tradition of the Court was purely politics,"" Hayes is quoted saying. Several media outlets — including the Associated Press, WRAL and WTVD — referred to a ""tradition"" of appointing the senior associate justice in their reporting but didn’t provide a history of the appointments. When it comes to replacing a chief justice, is there a tradition? Has the governor always appointed the senior associate justice? And has the governor’s pick always been nonpartisan? PolitiFact consulted news stories and staff in the N.C. Supreme Court Library to review chief justice appointments dating back 50 years — finding that, while many chief justices were replaced by the longest-serving associate justice, the appointments were hardly nonpartisan. A PARTISAN TRADITION Prior to Cooper’s appointment of Beasley, North Carolina’s governors made seven appointments to the chief justice position over the last five decades. In six of the seven cases, the appointees were previously the senior associate justice. The last governor to break tradition? Republican Gov. Jim Martin in 1986, who skipped over a Democrat to appoint a Republican. In fact, in each of the seven instances since 1969 that the chief justice seat became vacant, the governor appointed a member from his own party. So by calling on Cooper to appoint Newby, Republicans asked Cooper to do something no governor had done in the last 50 years. Nor have Republican governors passed up opportunities to replace a member of the opposing party with a member of their own. They did so twice since 1986, including as recently as 2014. Contacted by PolitiFact, Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, said Hayes’ statement was mostly intended to highlight the trend of appointing senior associate justices. Republican governors have had far fewer chances to appoint chief justices from across the aisle because Democrats dominated North Carolina politics for about 100 years, Woodhouse argued. THE TIMELINE In 2014, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory replaced Chief Justice Sarah Parker, a Democrat, with Martin (the Republican who just announced his resignation in 2019). In 2006, Democratic Gov. Mike Easley appointed Parker to replace I. Beverly Lake Jr., a Republican. (Lake won his seat as chief justice in the 2000 election) In 1999, Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt appointed Henry Frye, a Democrat, as chief justice to replace Burley Mitchell, also a Democrat. In 1994, Hunt swapped a Democrat for a Democrat when he appointed Mitchell to replace Chief Justice Jim Exum. In 1986, Republican Gov. Martin appointed Republican Rhoda Billings to replace Chief Justice Joseph Branch, a Democrat. Cooper’s pick aside, this is the only time in the last 50 years that a governor passed over the senior associate justice. Exum, a Democrat, was the senior associate at the time. In 1979, Hunt appointed Branch (Democrat) to replace Democratic Chief Justice Susie Sharp. (Sharp had gained the seat by beating Republican James M. Newcomb and Labor Party Candidate Stanley Ezrol in the 1974 election.) In 1969, Democratic Gov. Bob Scott replaced Chief Justice R. Hunt Parker, a Democrat, with Democrat William Bobbitt. POLITIFACT RULING The NC GOP said that Cooper, by appointing Beasley over Newby, ignored a ""longstanding, nonpartisan tradition."" This statement suggests that North Carolina’s governors have always replaced an outgoing chief justice by appointing the senior associate justice —even if he or she was a member of a different political party. Over the past 50 years, governors picked senior associates on six out of seven occasions. But in every case, they picked someone from their own political party — often replacing a member of another party. The NC GOP claim has a kernel of truth, but distorts the partisan nature of chief justice appointments over the last 50 years. We rate this claim Mostly False.
