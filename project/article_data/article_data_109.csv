Tillis: gas prices more in North Carolina than any other state
","U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis says his state was recently the hardest-hit by rising gas prices. ""Gas in North Carolina increased 14 cents per gallon this past week, the highest in the nation,"" Tillis tweeted on Oct. 26. Because of the way Tillis’ tweet is phrased, it could be interpreted a couple ways. Did he mean North Carolina’s increase was the highest in the nation? Or that the state’s gas price was the highest in the nation? A Tillis spokesperson told PolitiFact the senator’s tweet was meant to compare North Carolina’s price increase to those in other states. And he said it’s based on data from AAA, one of the largest vehicle and travel organizations in the country.  Experts told PolitiFact that North Carolina’s gas situation isn’t necessarily worse than other states. But Tillis’ tweet appears to accurately reflect price fluctuations over the previous seven days. AAA tracks gas prices across America to see how they compare to previous weeks, months, and years. The group announced in an Oct. 25 press release that the national average price for a gallon of gasoline had risen six cents since Oct. 18 to hit $3.38 for a gallon of unleaded. AAA singled out North Carolina and Florida as states that experienced the largest increase in gas prices, 14 cents. North Carolina’s average price increase between Oct. 17 and Oct. 24 was also the largest of any state tracked by GasBuddy.com, which collects data from more than 100,000 stations across the country. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said the average gas price in North Carolina rose 15 cents per gallon. While groups such as AAA capture accurate data, De Haan noted that the weekly snapshots can quickly become outdated.  ""Gas prices fluctuate throughout the course of the day,"" he said. ""Just like the stock market constantly moves, gas prices constantly move."" Thus, other snapshots can yield different results, De Haan said. For example, De Haan said GasBuddy data from Oct. 27 showed North Carolina with the 11th-largest price increase over the most recent seven days, and the third-largest increase over the previous month. AAA’s reports list the 10 states with the largest gas price increases. North Carolina’s price hikes didn’t make the list in AAA’s Oct. 18, Oct. 14, or Oct. 11 reports. ""Yes, over the last month North Carolina has seen one of the biggest increases in average prices. Basically everyone, North Carolina included, has seen a sharp uptick in prices,"" De Haan said. Experts have repeatedly said gas prices are rising across the country because there’s not enough supply for increasing demand. ""The cost of crude oil, a global commodity, accounts for more than 50% of the price at the pump,"" Andrew Gross, AAA’s public relations manager, told PolitiFact NC in an email. He added that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, known as OPEC, ""still isn't producing at pre-pandemic levels, and it is leading to the higher cost."" Experts have told PolitiFact and PolitiFact North Carolina that the increase isn’t tied to presidential policies. ""The bulk of what we’re dealing with is COVID-related. It’s not presidential policy. If we didn’t have covid, we wouldn’t be sitting here right now talking about $3 gas,"" De Haan said. Why did North Carolina, of all states, have the largest price increase over the course of last week? The answer isn’t clear. AAA didn’t identify a specific cause for North Carolina’s increase in its report or in emails with PolitiFact NC. A state’s proximity to a major fuel pipeline can play a role in a state’s gas prices, Gross said. ""And with a shortage of drivers, gas stations may be accounting for higher transportation costs."" Gross also noted that North Carolina still pays ""quite a bit less"" for gas than the average national price. North Carolinians on average paid $3.25 per gallon on Oct. 27, while the national average was $3.39 per gallon. Anna Mikulska, a nonresident fellow in energy studies for the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, said the surge is related to lingering issues at the Colonial Pipeline. She said the pipeline, which was hacked this May, delivers 75% of North Carolina’s fuel. De Haan suggested states may simply be adjusting market conditions at different speeds. ""Everyone is going to get to the same spot, some states are just going to get there faster,"" he said. Tillis tweeted that ""gas in North Carolina increased 14 cents per gallon this past week, the highest in the nation."" That appears to be accurate, according to AAA and GasBuddy data. Experts clarified that North Carolina’s gas situation, overall, isn’t the worst in the country. They also warned that gas prices can change rapidly, so weekly snapshots may not always represent the latest fluctuations across the country. The statement is accurate but could use additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2021/oct/29/thom-tillis/tillis-gas-prices-more-north-carolina-any-other-st/

Vaccine boosters mean vaccines failed? Wrong
","A viral image claimed that COVID-19 vaccines are a ""failed product"" and, therefore, the vaccines’ booster shots are more of the same. ""There is no such thing as a booster,"" read text in an image shared on Instagram. ""There is a failed product that is sometimes used again in hopes of a different outcome, which is the definition of insanity."" The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No vaccine is 100% effective. And while vaccines have not eradicated COVID-19, they have provided significant protection. The aim of booster shots is to extend the protection the vaccines provide. Other vaccines, such as the tetanus vaccine, come with standard timetables for recommended boosters.  One way to measure the vaccines’ success is the greater impact COVID-19 has had on the unvaccinated. Here’s a look, based on our past fact-checks. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in September that the range of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness remained high in the United States, even though it had decreased since the onset in late June of the delta variant, which the agency said is more than twice as contagious as previous variants. The effectiveness against infection ranged from 39% to 84%, and against hospitalization ranged from 75% to 95%.  A study in the Netherlands published in August said that the COVID-19 vaccines not only protect the vaccinated person, ""but also offer protection against transmission to close contacts."" A study led by University of Oxford researchers that was posted Oct. 15 found among cases in England that vaccinated people who get breakthrough infections are less likely than unvaccinated people to infect others with the delta variant.  A study in China published in August also found that the unvaccinated were more likely to spread infection. A third study, done in Singapore and published in July, found that vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral load, a possible indicator of declining infectiousness. None of the studies had been peer reviewed. The alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants were first detected in unvaccinated populations. Most variants were detected before vaccines were approved for use. Studies show that unvaccinated people are far more likely to spread the delta variant than vaccinated people. In September, the CDC analyzed vaccine effectiveness across 13 U.S. jurisdictions from April 4 to July 17 and matched that data to vaccine registries from those areas. It found that after delta became dominant, unvaccinated people were five times more likely to be infected than fully vaccinated people, and more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized or die.  As of Oct. 18, more than 189 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the latest CDC statistics. Of them, 41,127 got COVID-19 and were hospitalized or died. That is 0.021%. About 85% of the deaths and 66% of the hospitalizations were among those 65 or older. It’s also important to understand that boosters are a standard part of administering vaccines generally, since the immunity they provide can wane over time. For example, the CDC recommends that adults get a Tdap vaccine once if they did not receive it as an adolescent to protect against pertussis (whooping cough), and then a Td (tetanus, diphtheria) or Tdap booster shot every 10 years.  An initial vaccine ""educates your body's immune system about what's in it, building immunity just as a natural infection would but without the disease,"" according to Dr. Suzanne Cassel, an immunologist at the Cedars-Sinai healthcare organization. ""Booster shots strengthen or maintain those immune responses."" An Instagram post read, ""There is no such thing as a booster. There is a failed product that is sometimes used again in hopes of a different outcome."" Boosters are a standard means of extending protection that a vaccine provides. No vaccine is 100% effective but the vaccines against COVID-19 have been proven to be quite effective at staving off serious infection and death.  We rate the post False.",/factchecks/2021/oct/29/viral-image/claim-vaccines-failed-ignores-greater-impact-covid/

Old hoax about Muslims demanding pork-free menus is still false
","Social media users have revisited a falsehood about Muslims that has already been debunked. A Facebook post’s headline says, ""Muslim Figure: We must have Pork-Free Menus or We Will Leave U.S.,"" with a photo of a woman wearing a head covering, an American flag with stripes fashioned from strips of bacon and the words, ""Bacon America great again!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

The problematic claim originated in July 2017 on a site called All News 4 USA, which is no longer in operation but had been a purveyor of fake news. That story mentioned Muslims in the United States, but then gave an account of a situation that occurred in Chevigny-Saint-Sauveur, a city in France. A June 28, 2017, report from conservative news site Breitbart that said the mayor of Chevigny-Saint-Sauveur said he would ban school menus that did not include pork ""to promote secular values in schools."" The Breitbart story did not mention any demands by Muslims, but its headline says the French mayor demanded pork in school lunches. The new Facebook post does not include all of those details, but it mimics the style of the 2017 post, including using pilfered photos from CNN stories on unrelated subjects. The All News 4 USA story used a photo of a woman wearing a head covering that had been published with a CNN story in 2016. This latest Facebook claim used a photo of a different woman wearing a head covering that had aired on CNN in 2015. Neither CNN story was related to Muslims and pork. A Facebook post’s headline says, ""Muslim Figure: We must have Pork-Free Menus or We Will Leave U.S.,"" with a photo of a woman wearing a head covering. There is no evidence to support the claim that a Muslim person made this demand. The claim originated in 2017 on a fake-news website and has been debunked by multiple outlets. The original story references a situation that happened in France, not in the United States, and it involved a mayor demanding that pork be kept on menus, not Muslims demanding that pork be removed from menus.

COVID-19 death rate in England much higher among unvaccinated than vaccinated
","A dramatic claim about the pandemic in the United Kingdom was made by Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter who has questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and whose posts are sometimes cited for misinformation. ""I have to keep saying this to people because they almost don’t believe it,"" Berenson said to podcast host Joe Rogan.  ""In the U.K., 70-plus percent of the people who die now from COVID are fully vaccinated."" Video excerpts from the podcast were included in an article widely shared on Facebook. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The data Berenson cited apply only to England, not the entire U.K. And while a high percentage of COVID-19 deaths occurred among vaccinated Englanders, according to a mid-September report, that’s largely because such high percentages of the population are vaccinated.  Moreover, the same data show that unvaccinated people in England are far more likely than vaccinated people to die from COVID-19. Berenson in the interview cited a report from Public Health England, a government agency. But he misstated the scope of the data. The report’s figures apply only to England, a spokesperson for the agency told PolitiFact, and not the rest of the U.K., which also includes Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Berenson highlighted a table in the report that showed COVID-19 deaths in England, broken down by age group, for the four-week period ended Sept. 19. Deaths are counted as COVID-19 deaths if they occurred within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Totaling the figures in the table shows that 2,284 of the 3,158 deaths during the period, or 72%, occurred among fully vaccinated people. But the same table, along with another graphic in the report, show that deaths occurred at a far higher rate among unvaccinated people. The table reports the rate of deaths — that is, the number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people. The rate for people under age 18 was zero for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. But for each of the other seven age groups, the rate of death was higher for unvaccinated people than for vaccinated people. For example, for people age 80 and over, the rate among unvaccinated people was 156 deaths per 100,000 people — more than three times higher than the 49.5 for the vaccinated. The difference was highest among people age 50 to 59. In that group, the rate was 12.4 deaths per 100,000 people among the unvaccinated, compared with 1.4 deaths among the vaccinated, or more than eight times higher. The report also says estimates suggest that vaccinations prevented 123,000 deaths as of Sept. 17. ""In the context of very high vaccine coverage in the population, even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalizations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective,"" the report says. ""This is especially true because vaccination has been prioritized in individuals who are more susceptible or more at risk of severe disease."" The report shows vaccination rates exceeding 90% among certain age groups, including those age 70 and above. ""The important thing is the percentage of vaccinated people who get severe disease versus unvaccinated people who get severe disease, and we know from those statistics that the vaccines are protecting people really well,"" said virologist Emily Bruce, a professor in microbiology and molecular genetics at the University of Vermont. Berenson said that in the United Kingdom, ""70-plus percent of the people who die now from COVID are fully vaccinated."" The figure he cited does not apply to the entire U.K., only England. But a high percentage of COVID-19 deaths in England occurred among fully vaccinated people largely because high percentages of Englanders are vaccinated, especially older people who are more likely to die from illness.  Moreover, the report Berenson cited shows that the unvaccinated are still much more likely to die from COVID-19: The COVID-19 death rate — the number of deaths per 100,000 people — is much higher among unvaccinated people than vaccinated people.

Biden Administration predicted liquid fuel for cars to outlast 2050
","President Joe Biden was in Michigan’s auto industry hub on Oct. 5 when he said, ""the whole world knows that the future of the auto industry is electric."" Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, had a quick response, writing on Twitter: "".@POTUS no it’s not — in fact, your own administration published a study concluding 4/5 new cars on the road by 2050 will still require liquid fuels ... ""It’s past time Biden lives up to his promise to expand clean-burning #biofuels. Don’t mess with the RFS!"" Feenstra is correct about the share of cars in the United States projected to use liquid fuels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2021 Annual Energy Outlook report, which projects the nation’s environmental plans through 2050, says about 79% of new vehicle sales will be powered by liquid fuels — gasoline and blends that include up to 85% ethanol — in 2050. They accounted for 95% of sales in 2020, the report states. PolitiFact contacted Feenstra’s communications staff over 10 times for comment but did not receive a response. However, Feenstra’s tweet shared the link to his sourcing, and on page 15, the federal report notes that, while electric energy’s biggest demand growth area is transportation, the share will be small — less than 3%: ""Current laws and regulations are not projected to induce much market growth, despite continuing improvements in electric vehicles (EVs) through evolutionary market developments. Both vehicle sales and utilization (miles driven) would need to increase substantially for EVs to raise electric power demand growth rates by more than a fraction of a percentage point per year."" And, on the report’s page 26: ""Because most light-duty vehicles have internal combustion engines, motor gasoline remains the major transportation fuel through 2050 as personal travel returns to pre-pandemic per-driver levels in the longer term.""  While 2050 is 29 years down the road, Biden did not state in Michigan a time limit on when he thinks electric power would come close to liquid fuels’ share of the automobile market. Nor did he state in detail what that future for electric power for automobiles would be. His administration’s Annual Energy Outlook reports that it is not predicting future energy use; rather it is a projection based on assumptions and methodologies that can be changed when subjected to changes in technology, demographics and resources. The report also notes that it is a response to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. That law requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration to produce annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply, the report notes. But Feenstra was precise with his facts, and is not alone reminding Biden to support biofuels. Other Iowa congressional members, Republican and Democrat, have pushed for biofuels support, regardless of who is president. So has the biofuels industry. The reason? Iowa leads the nation when it comes to producing biofuels from farm crops. It has capacity to produce 4.6 billion gallons, double the 2.3 billion in the No. 2 state, Nebraska. While we focused this story on predicted biofuels use in vehicles, it’s worth noting that Biden promised support for biofuels in a Sept. 9, 2020, campaign statement that criticized a pre-election policy reversal by then-President Donald Trump on biofuels. Trump’s reversal led to his administration’s rejection of oil refinery industry requests to be exempt from requirements to blend certain amounts of ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline: ""A Biden-Harris Administration will fight for family farmers and revitalize rural economies — from keeping our promises to farmers by ushering in a new era of biofuels, to investing in the broadband infrastructure and rural health care access that families and communities need,"" the Biden statement read. Trump reversed course again and approved on Jan. 19, 2021, just before leaving office, three biofuel waivers for refineries. Feenstra said the Biden Administration predicts that four out of five new cars on the road will require liquid fuels in 2050 and he cites the source. That source, a report from the Biden Administration, states that 79% of vehicles on the road will require liquid fuels by 2050.  We rate Feenstra’s statement to be True. ",/factchecks/2021/oct/28/randy-feenstra/biden-administration-predicted-liquid-fuel-cars-ou/

Brown overstates Walton tax increase
","Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, waging a write-in campaign to win a fifth term, tried to discourage support for Democratic nominee India Walton by saying she wants to raise taxes. Walton’s tax plan would increase taxes by $300 for people whose homes are assessed at $100,000, Brown said in a debate.  Walton, who defeated Brown in the Democratic primary, has said she would raise homeowners' property taxes by 3 percent incrementally over a four-year term, with increases of a half-percent or 1 percent every year. Walton’s spokesperson, Jesse Myerson, confirmed that her plan calls for a half percent to 1 percent increase in taxes yearly in her first term, until it adds up to a 3 percent increase. Brown’s number didn’t seem right. His campaign didn't respond to our request for math that supports his claim, so we don't know if he misinterpreted Walton's tax plan or made a miscalculation. We ran the numbers to see how much a 3 percent increase would affect the city property tax bill for someone who owns a house assessed at $100,000.  The homestead tax rate in Buffalo is $5.24 per $1,000 of assessed valuation, and the homestead school tax rate is $4.75, for a combined rate of $9.99. For a house assessed at $100,000, the tax bill for these taxes would be $999.  If the $9.99 rate was increased by 3 percent, it would rise to $10.29. If that rate is applied to a house assessed at $100,000, the tax bill for these taxes would be $1,029, or an increase of $30 - not $300.  We reached out to the Tax Foundation, which studies tax policies of local and state governments, and shared Brown’s claim, as well as Walton’s tweets about her proposed increase, with Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects. Walczak said an increase of three percentage points would result in a $300 increase for a $100,000 house, as Brown claims. But a 3 percent increase of the existing tax rate would result in an increase of $30 on a $100,000 house.  ""Based on her tweets, it does seem that Ms. Walton is proposing a 3 percent increase in tax liability,"" to about 10.29 per $1,000, Walczak said. ""This would yield a tax increase of about $30 per $100,000 in assessed value, not $300."" We also spoke with Peter Warren, director of research at the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank. He said Brown could have been confusing adding three percentage points to the tax rate. In an interview on the Bad Faith Podcast on Sept. 30, Walton said that she does not plan for a 3 percent increase in one year. A state tax cap prohibits increases of more than 2 percent. ""It’s an incremental tax increase that’s like a half-percent a year,"" she said.  Under the cap, the tax levy can rise by 2 percent or the level of inflation, whichever is lower. To override the cap, 60 percent or more members of a local governing board must approve. Regardless of the cap, tax bills are influenced by whether properties are assessed at full value.  Our ruling Brown said Walton’s proposed increase in property taxes would lead to an additional $300 for a house assessed at $100,000.  That might be true if Walton intended to add three percentage points to the property tax. But Walton proposes increasing the tax rate by 3 percent over her first term, which would lead to an eventual increase of about $30 for a home assessed at $100,000. We rate Brown’s claim False.",/factchecks/2021/oct/28/byron-brown/brown-overstates-walton-tax-increase/

Testing Paul Ryan's damning attack on the Affordable Care Act: 'Obamacare has failed'
","When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan describes repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, he gives the signature legislation of President Barack Obama a damning assessment. Here’s a typical version, from his weekly press briefing on Jan. 5, 2017: ""We’re going to get this law repealed, we’re going to get this law replaced, and we’re going to have a transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from underneath them while we get to a better place. Obamacare has failed, is getting worse, and we have to provide relief. And we will have a transition period so that people don’t get hurt."" Ryan earned a Mostly True rating for his November 2016 claim that Obamacare ""is not a popular law"" -- though it’s worth noting that a January 2017 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonprofit research group on health care, found a split, with 49 percent saying Congress should repeal the law and 47 percent saying Congress should not. Our rating was False when the Wisconsin Republican in January 2017 said Obamacare ""is in what the actuaries call a death spiral,"" given that conditions didn’t match the definition of what is an established term. But perhaps no Ryan attack on the law has been as audacious as ""Obamacare has failed,"" a declaration he has made several times. He even went so far as to say on Jan. 27, 2017 that it is ""basically a spectacular failure,"" though three days later he went softer, saying in a tweet: ""For many Americans, it has already failed."" So, let’s put Ryan’s claim to the test. There are many ways, of course, to evaluate the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010 though many changes were phased in later. But two of the major ones are coverage (Do more people have health insurance?) and costs (How much do you pay for insurance and what does it cover?) ""There were things that succeeded and there things that didn't go as planned,"" said Donna Friedsam, health policy programs director at the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Said economist Gail Wilensky, a senior health and welfare adviser to Republican President George H.W. Bush: ""To say it’s a failure is problematic because it requires a more nuanced answer."" This table highlights some of our findings. It’s followed by a more detailed analysis. Coverage Costs 20 million Americans gained health insurance Total health expenditures grew at record low rates in first three years after Obamacare 8.9% of Americans did not have health insurance in 2016, down from 16% in 2010 Employer plans: Family premiums up 99% under George W. Bush, 59% under Barack Obama Millions no longer at risk of being denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions 22% in 2017 in cost of the average mid-level Obamacare plan ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it"": 2013 Lie of the Year Cut the typical family's health insurance premium up to $2,500: Promise Broken The coverage More gained coverage: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that during the first six years of Obamacare, 20 million Americans gained health insurance as a result of the law -- a figure acknowledged by Donald Trump’s administration. Similarly, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected in January 2017 that a 2015 bill that would have repealed key portions of the law would have increased the number of uninsured by 18 million in one year. On a related note, the President’s Council of Economic Advisers credits the law for what it says is a one-third drop nationally since 2010 in the share of Americans reporting that they have forgone medical care due to cost. Fewer are uninsured: As one might expect, far fewer people are uninsured. Defending Obamacare during the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton said a record 90 percent of Americans had health insurance. PolitiFact National rated that True. A month later, in November 2016, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, based on its annual survey, found 8.9 percent of Americans did not have health insurance in 2016. That was down from 16 percent in 2010, the year the ACA was passed. How it’s been done: The 20 million who have gained insurance includes people covered through the law’s expansion of Medicaid, the creation of the Health Insurance Marketplace, where individuals buy policies, and changes in private insurance -- one that allows young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans and one that requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing health conditions. When former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said in a Milwaukee debate in December 2015 that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone,"" she earned a Pants on Fire. At the time, 10 million people had been put on Medicaid as a result of Medicaid’s expansion under the law; and 9.5 million were enrolled in policies bought on the marketplace (including 8 million who were receiving subsidies under the law). In addition, the law as it stands now has meant millions of Americans are no longer at risk of being denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions (a Promise Kept for Obama); or are no longer at risk of being kicked off policies for developing expensive medical conditions. Broken promises: It’s worth noting that the gains in coverage have not all gone as planned. Obama and others had said repeatedly about the ACA -- ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it"" -- and that became PolitiFact National’s 2013 Lie of the Year. Obamacare rules were strict, so that even if existing plans deviated a little, the plans were not grandfathered in under the law, and by the fall of 2013 insurers canceled coverage for millions of Americans. ""Access to a ‘no-frills’ plan is a huge improvement on what low-income people experienced prior to the marketplaces,"" said a Vox critique of the ACA. ""But it's still a far cry from what health wonks envisioned just a few years ago when they saw the health care marketplaces reshaping the industry. Referring to the 20 million, Wilensky, now a senior fellow at Project HOPE, an international health foundation, said of the ACA: ""Saying it’s a failure is too harsh because it got that part done.""   The costs An Obama pledge made during the 2008 campaign to cut the cost of a typical family's health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year was rated a Promise Broken. As they have for years, health care costs have continued to increase, but there has been some moderating. Premiums rising: Premiums have gone up -- a cumulative 11 percent between 2013 and 2016 for the average full-family, employee-sponsored plan; and 38 percent between 2014 and 2017 for Obamacare plans. But the results are mixed, if you consider how much premiums went up before the ACA: On employer-sponsored plans, family premiums increased by a cumulative 99 percent under the eight years of Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush, while under eight years of Obama, the increase was smaller -- 59 percent -- according to Kaiser. Kaiser’s latest annual employers survey found that the average family premium in 2016 for their plans rose just 3 percent from 2015, while the premium for single coverage stayed essentially flat. That’s not to say the premiums aren’t substantial: Workers on average contribute $5,277 annually toward their family premiums. For individual market policies, in the three years before the ACA, premiums rose on average 9.9 percent in 2008, 10.8 percent in 2009 and 11.7 percent in 2010, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund. The higher increases under Obamacare include a projected 22 percent increase nationally in 2017 in the cost of the average mid-level Obamacare plan, which is the most popular choice, though Kaiser says the increase would be as high as 145 percent (for customers in Phoenix). Critics have also pointed out that people who buy insurance on their own in the federal marketplace have fewer choices. Some major insurers, because they suffered losses, have dropped out of the marketplace, leaving nearly one in five Americans who are eligible for Obamacare with only one insurer in 2017, according to research done by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform for the New York Times. Big picture-wise, total expenditures on health care nationally grew at record low rates in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the first three years after the ACA was adopted, according to the President’s Council of Economic Advisers -- even if there is debate over a number of factors as to why. Health care costs are rising much more slowly than they did during the past 50 years, two former Obama health care advisers wrote in the Washington Post. But Wilensky said much of the slowdown can be attributed to the global recession, given that increases in health spending were even lower on average in other industrialized nations. Deductibles rising: Ryan and other Republicans have said many people feel they don’t really have health insurance because their deductibles are so high. It’s worth noting that one ACA provision ensures that nearly all Americans with employer coverage have a limit on their annual out-of-pocket spending. But the Kaiser survey of employers found the average deductible for workers covered by an employer plan was $1,221 in 2016, up 13 percent from $1,077 in 2015. And deductibles can run high for Obamacare plans. In a story headlined, ""Many Say High Deductibles Make Their Health Law Insurance All but Useless,"" the New York Times found that in many states, more than half the plans offered through HealthCare.gov had a deductible of $3,000 or more. Our rating Ryan said: ""Obamacare has failed."" The Affordable Care Act did not meet all its promises, including a big one -- that you could keep your insurance plan if you liked it. But health care costs have risen more slowly since the law took effect and the law has met its major goal of getting more people insured -- an estimated 20 million. That’s not a failure. The biggest problem with Ryan’s statement is that he, and Obamacare critics, take a nuanced situation and turn it into a black-and-white statement. The same problem would face those who say Obamacare is a great success. Our definition of Mostly False is ""a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.

Spicer's misleading claim that Trump's National Security Council is 'identical' to Bush's, Obama's
","Following outcry over a reported shakeup of the National Security Council, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said stories about demoting the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence were ""utter nonsense."" President Donald Trump has been criticized in the media for politicizing the council by adding chief strategist Steve Bannon. Spicer, in his daily press briefing on Jan. 30, 2017, pushed back by claiming that the presidential memorandum announcing the makeup of the council hadn’t really changed dramatically. ""The language that's part of the president's memo is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001,"" Spicer said, holding up copies of the various memos (around the 6:55 mark of this video). ""The only thing that's changed in this is the addition of the Director of National Intelligence as a position that didn't exist in 2001. For what it's worth, it's the same as Obama's, save for the word ‘also.’ "" For those who don’t know, the National Security Council was established in 1947 and gathers foreign and domestic policy and military officials to advise the president on national security. The two issues with Trump’s restructuring concern the makeup of the full council and its principals committee, a subset of senior officials that is also ""literally 100 percent the same,"" according to Spicer. So is Spicer right that the Bush, Obama and Trump memos are nearly ""identical""? We read Bush’s 2001 memo, Obama’s 2009 memo and Trump’s 2017 memo, and found that Spicer’s claim is misleading. The regular council Spicer is right about the makeup of the full National Security Council, albeit in a limited way. This sentence — ""The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings"" — appears pretty much verbatim in each president’s memo. (The Director of National Intelligence was a position created in 2004, so Bush’s memo says the CIA Director instead.) But in a broader sense, Spicer is off the mark. Each president has invited different government officials to sit on the council, but neither Bush nor Obama added his chief strategist. Trump appears to be the only president since the establishment of the council to include his, Bannon, according to a Congressional Research Service report. By statute, the members of the council are the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of defense and, as of 2007, secretary of energy. As noted in the memos, the chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor are statutory advisers. Here are the additional members each president has requested to join the council (positions unique to each president are bolded): Bush 2001 Obama 2009 Trump 2017 ""Regular attendees"" or ""members"" • Secretary of treasury • National security adviser • Secretary of treasury • National security adviser • Secretary of homeland security • Homeland security adviser • Representative to the United Nations • Chief of staff • Deputy national security adviser • Secretary of treasury • National security adviser • Secretary of homeland security • Homeland security adviser • Representative to the United Nations ""Invited to attend any meeting"" • Chief of staff • Economic adviser • Counsel to the president • Chief of staff • Chief strategist (Bannon) • Counsel to the president • Deputy counsel for national security • Director of the Office of Management and Budget Invited when appropriate • Counsel to president • Attorney general • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Secretary of  commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser • Chair of Council of Economic Advisors • Homeland security adviser • Director of the Office of Science and Technology • Secretary of  commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser The principals committee Similarly, Bannon’s addition to the principals committee undercuts Spicer’s claim that the senior interagency group, first established by former President George H.W. Bush in 1989, is ""literally 100 percent the same."" Trump’s memo reads: ""The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed."" Again, barring the inclusion of the Director of National Intelligence, that is verbatim the language of Bush’s 2001 memo: ""The Director of Central Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed."" But Obama’s 2009 memo makes clear that Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are ""regular members"" of the committee. And again, the chief strategist was not a member in either Bush’s or Obama’s committees (or George H.W. Bush’s or Bill Clinton’s). Here’s a breakdown of the organization of the principals committee under each president (positions unique to each president are bolded): Bush 2001 Obama 2009 Trump 2017 ""Regular attendees"" or ""members"" • Secretary of state • Secretary of treasury • Secretary of defense • National security adviser • Chief of staff • Secretary of state • Secretary of treasury • Secretary of defense • National security adviser • Chief of staff • Secretary of homeland security • Representative to the United Nations • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Director of national intelligence • Chairman of the joint chief of staff   • Secretary of state • Secretary of treasury • Secretary of defense • National security adviser • Chief of staff • Secretary of homeland security • Chief strategist (Bannon) • Homeland security adviser Invited to or shall attend all meetings • Vice president • Deputy national security adviser • Deputy national security adviser   • Deputy secretary of state • Counsel to the president • National security adviser to the Vice President • Deputy national security adviser • Counsel to the president • National security adviser to the Vice President • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Deputy counsel for national security • Executive secretary Invited when appropriate • CIA director • Chairman of the joint chief of staff • Attorney general • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Counsel to President • Secretary of commerce • U.S. Trade Representative • Economic adviser • Secretary of Agriculture • Secretary of  commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser • Chair of Council of Economic Advisors • Homeland security adviser • Director of the Office of Science and Technology • Director of national intelligence • Chairman of the joint chief of staff • Secretary of commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser • Representative to the United Nations • Intergovernmental and technology initiatives adviser Our ruling Spicer said, ""The language that's part of the president's memo (on the National Security Council) is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001"" as well as President Obama’s 2009. We reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back. Spicer is right in a limited sense: each memo specifies that the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence are statutory advisers to the regular council. While both the Bush and Trump memos stipulated they attend principals committee meetings when appropriate, both were regular members of the subcommittee under Obama. Trump also includes one major departure from both Bush and Obama: adding the position of chief strategist as a member of both the regular council and principals committee. Spicer’s claim that the memos are identical rates Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b66fd71-c0f3-4b31-863b-eefc0a689f2e",/factchecks/2017/jan/31/sean-spicer/spicers-misleading-claim-trumps-national-security-/

No, Meryl Streep's anti-Trump award speech didn't cost her a 'Happy Days' job
","Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep’s harsh political words during a speech at the Golden Globes made her a target for fake news purveyors, who are falsely claiming she lost a movie deal for complaining about Donald Trump. ""Meryl Streep just got fired from a major project for lying about Trump,"" read the headline on posts on multiple sites starting Jan. 9, 2017. The posts were flagged as being potentially fabricated by Facebook, as part of its efforts to crack down on made-up Internet posts masquerading as true information. This one, keyed off Streep’s acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding achievement at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, is as fictional as any Hollywood creation. Streep did excoriate then-President-elect Trump’s policies and past actions in her speech, without ever mentioning his name. She said she was stunned when Trump imitated a disabled reporter, a claim Trump has falsely denied. Trump took to Twitter the next day to lambast Streep for criticizing him, calling her ""over-rated"" and a ""Hillary flunky,"" again denying he mocked a reporter. Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a..... Hillary flunky who lost big. For the 100th time, I never ""mocked"" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him....... ""groveling"" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media! The fake blog posts claim Streep’s speech was enough for Ron Howard to kick her off a reboot of the TV show Happy Days. That’s odd on its own, because Howard took to Twitter himself to chide Trump and defend Streep’s freedom of speech. trump used his fame to speak out on issues years before he ran 4 office. why was he allowed & Ms Streep should keep quiet? no hypocrisy pls https://t.co/CrpSCREcrw Trump takes the bait & calls #MerylStreep overrated?! Please Pres-Elect. Don't make this into the WWF which is fun but not presidential The article is pretty light on most details, such as whether this was to be a TV series or a film, but Streep was allegedly going to play Mrs. Cunningham. Plenty of passages in the fake story — such as saying Streep ""hasn’t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes"" — hint that this is an attempt at humor. The story appears to have first appeared on a Jan. 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that describes itself as being opposed to President Barack Obama and ""whiny politically correct liberal masses."" We therefore don’t suspect they were fans of Florence Foster Jenkins. The ""About Us"" portion of their site reads, ""All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" But this disclaimer isn’t obvious on the story itself, and certainly isn’t apparent reading other websites to which the post was shared. For fans of the Fonz, we must also note that the suggestion of a Happy Days reboot (with or without Streep) also appears fake. There has been no verified report of any kind of reboot of Happy Days. RadioTimes.com wrote last year that series creator Garry Marshall said the show may one day be revived by Paramount, but there’s little to suggest that’s been greenlit. The only other mention of a new Happy Days series was a story that said Netflix was creating one, but that post, too, came from a fake news website trying to be funny.

John Cornyn joins Texans saying Obama administration didn't request border surveillance from air
","Last year, Texas officials including Sen. John Cornyn charged the federal government with surprisingly not requesting continued aerial checks of the U.S.-Mexico border as of January 2017. At issue: An element of Operation Phalanx, a border surveillance program launched in 2010 in which National Guard officers assist U.S. agents monitoring the border. Cornyn, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, said in a Nov. 22, 2016, letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson: ""It has come to our attention that for calendar year 2017 the Department of Homeland Security has not requested any flight hours for Operation Phalanx from the Department of Defense."" Their letter, which came to our attention thanks to a reader inquiry, went on: ""Given the continuing surge of migrants along the Southern Border beyond the FY15 numbers and a large uptick in apprehensions already for the month of November 2016, we believe DHS should be requesting more surveillance and security resources, not less."" Also, the letter called the described cut ""extremely imprudent."" Some history: President Barack Obama issued an executive order in 2010 authorizing 1,200 soldiers and airmen to join Customs and Border Protection efforts along the southwest border. According to a May 2011 U.S. Army web post, the Army National Guard then established Operation Phalanx in July 2010, with soldiers working to spot border intrusions and providing technical support. In 2012, notably, the mission switched from ground operations to ""aviation focused support,"" according to the Texas Military Department, which is part of Texas state government. So, did the Obama administration not request additional flight hours just before 2017? In the end, we found, this claim didn’t pan out. Along the way, too, neither the Texans who sent the letter nor federal officials came through with what we’d consider to-the-point factual replies. Over several weeks, neither Cornyn nor Cuellar offered confirmable evidence for their declaration that no flight hours were requested. Cornyn deferred to Cuellar, who told us by phone that he’d heard about the move not to request more flight hours from a Texas official involved in the operation--someone we subsequently couldn’t reach. Customs and Border Patrol letter Meantime, Cuellar brought to our attention a letter sent by a border security official indicating support for the operation. Cuellar’s press secretary, Rafael Benavides, emailed us a copy of the letter, which was dated six days before the Texas officials leveled their claim, The letter from R. Gil Kerlikowske, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, to Brian McKeon, who was a Department of Defense undersecretary, opened: ""This letter serves to identify those Department of Defense activities most critical to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Border Security Operations."" ""Over the last decade,"" the letter continued, ""Congress has consistently appropriated"" DoD ""funds to the Army National Guard and other supporting elements for the express purposes of assisting"" CBP ""in securing the Southwest border."" Kerlikowske went on: ""I believe this support, whether under Operation Jump Start or Operation Phalanx, or other DoD activities, has continued to provide tangible benefits to border security both in countering illegal immigration and in preventing the flow of drugs and other illicit goods."" Next, Kelikowske wrote that with Congress likely to continue such funding for fiscal 2017, which began in October 2016, he wanted to ""provide you with a general prioritization of those rotary-wing assets that have proven most critical to supporting our operations."" That term, ""rotary-wing asset,"" refers to helicopters. ""Specifically,"" the letter continued, ""the allocation of appropriated resources for rotary wing operation in the following manner will most positively impact our operations,"" Kerlikowske wrote, including a prioritized list of areas he thought most important to focus on, with the Laredo sector prioritized, the Rio Grande Valley sector ranked second and the Tucson sector set third. Our initial attempts to verify the claim resulted in email circularity: After emailing Cornyn’s press secretary, since the senator’s name was listed first on the letter, we were told to check with Cuellar’s office for factual backup of the claim. Cuellar’s press secretary, Benavides, first emailed us contact information for a director with the Texas National Guard, Malcolm Warbrick, who would ""verify Operation Phalanx is shutting down due to a lack of request for support hours from DHS."" When we emailed the director, though, we heard back by email from a National Guard spokeswoman, Laura Lopez, who told us to contact Homeland Security as ""Operation Phalanx is a federal mission under their direct control."" Otherwise, Daniel Hetlage, a CBP spokesman, also referred to Kerlikowske’s letter, saying: ""This support is important, the commissioner has indicated such, and U.S. Customs & Border Protection will take any hours the Department of Defense can provide."" Our calls to the Department of Defense for information on requested flight hours didn’t draw replies. By phone on Dec. 16, 2016, Cuellar responded to our requests for backup by describing what he said he’d heard. On Nov. 14, 2016, Cuellar said, Warbrick, director of government affairs for the Texas Military Department, which is based at Camp Mabry in Austin, told Ryan Ehly, legislative director for Cuellar’s office, about the lack of hours requested for aerial surveillance during a meeting in Washington. Cuellar’s press secretary, Rafael Benavides, provided contact information for Warbrick, but our attempts to email and call Warbrick didn’t yield factual fruit. Next, Cuellar told us, Brig. Gen. Patrick M. Hamilton, a commander of the Domestic Operations Task Force of the Texas Military Department, told Cuellar in a Dec. 7, 2016 meeting that Operation Phalanx was being discontinued since no 2017 flight hours had been requested from the National Guard. Precisely, Cuellar said, Hamilton told him ""that the program was going to go away,"" despite the fact that Congress had approved funding for the program in its Fiscal Year 2016 budget. Cuellar also brought up the mid-November Kerlikowske letter though Cuellar said the letter of support wasn’t high-level enough to serve as a request for additional flight hours. That is, Cuellar maintained, such a letter needs to come from a secretary to a secretary to be meaningful. Cuellar told us he November letter, from a commissioner to an undersecretary, was ""just a feel-good request"" that wouldn’t result in more flight hours. December 2016 letter While we were checking this claim, Benavides told us that Cornyn, Cuellar and Abbott had gotten a reply from Kerlikowske on Dec. 21, 2016. In that letter, Kerlikowske said he was writing on Johnson’s behalf and that ""CBP welcomes the opportunity to maintain DoD (Department of Defense) aviation and associated support capabilities should funding be made available. We value our strong relationship with DoD and wish to continue our efforts in order to maximize the impact of any appropriations or any other DoD activities along the Southwest border."" By email, Benavides told us that this response also didn’t add up to a request for additional hours in the air. ""No official request for flight hours has been made that we are aware of,"" Benavides said. Our ruling Cornyn, Cuellar and Abbott said the federal government didn’t seek any 2017 flight hours to surveil the Texas-Mexico border via Operation Phalanx. Neither Cornyn or Cuellar provided factual documentation for this claim, which Cuellar otherwise attributed to a Texas official who didn’t respond to our inquiries. Separately when we asked, federal authorities didn’t document a specific request for 2017 surveillance hours. Regardless, the CBP commissioner’s letter to a Defense Department underling, sent before the Texans leveled their claim, endorsed continued flights over the border, even specifying priority sectors. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:41 p.m., Jan. 31, 2017: After we posted this fact check, Drew Brandewie of Cornyn’s office emailed to say Cuellar initiated the letter--a characterization echoed by Victoria Glynn, a Cuellar spokeswoman. We then amended our headline and story to make more clear the claim wasn’t Cornyn’s alone. These changes didn’t affect our ruling. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/91c159e1-66b1-4738-9598-502444bfe949",/factchecks/2017/jan/31/john-cornyn/texans-led-john-cornyn-claim-obama-administration-/

Is Trump's immigration ban comparable to Obama's Cuba rule change?
","President Donald Trump’s executive order banning entry of people from seven countries prompted a wave of protests from immigration activists and Democrats in South Florida. U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Cuban-American Republican whose district includes parts of Miami-Dade, defended Trump’s ban by comparing it with an action President Barack Obama took on Cuban refugees in his final days in office. ""I am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees; especially since President Obama’s action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons,"" Diaz-Balart wrote in a statement to the press Jan. 30. Obama’s rule change was about the ""wet foot dry foot policy,"" which Diaz-Balart criticized at the time as a ""concession to the Castro regime."" Was Diaz-Balart accurate when he said Trump’s action was similar to Obama’s? In a word, no. Trump’s order, which singled out immigrants from seven countries and refugees from everywhere, was far more broad than Obama’s administrative rule change to put Cubans on more equal footing with arrivals from other countries. Trump’s order and Obama’s rule change Trump’s Jan. 27 order states: ""I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order."" Administration officials said that the order applied to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- countries identified by the Obama administration as terrorist hotbeds. ""In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles,"" Trump’s order stated. Trump also put processing of all refugees -- which would include Cubans -- on hold for three months and suspended the vetting of Syrian refugees indefinitely, ""until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest."" Obama’s rule change, which came through a Department of Homeland Security regulation, applied to one group of people: Cubans. Obama’s Jan. 12 announcement ended the so-called ""wet foot-dry foot"" policy that had allowed Cubans without visas who reached U.S. shores (typically Florida) to gain automatic entry to the United States to ask for political asylum. Under the policy, those caught at sea, however, were sent back to Cuba. The policy was started in 1995 under President Bill Clinton in an effort to end the rafter crisis and had a major impact in shaping immigrant-rich Miami-Dade County.  Obama also eliminated the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program that allowed doctors to apply for parole at a U.S. embassy or consulate. The ""wet foot-dry foot"" policy, along with the Cuban Adjustment Act -- which remains on the books -- permitted those who reached dry land in the United States to get permanent residency and green cards after living in the U.S. for a year and a day. ""With this change, we will continue to welcome Cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws,"" Obama said. The rule change, announced in the final days of his presidency, followed his announcement in 2014 to normalize relations with Cuba. Obama’s rule change did not cut off immigration from Cuba. A Department of Homeland Security official told the Miami Herald that an immigration lottery allowed at least 20,000 Cubans to emigrate to the United States legally each year would remain in effect. Also a program that allows legal residents in the United States to apply for Cuban relatives to join them was expected to continue. We interviewed several experts on immigration who said Diaz-Balart’s comparison was misleading because of the different scope of the directives. While Obama eliminated special treatment for Cubans, Trump’s order singled out specific nationalities of immigrants for additional restrictions. ""President Obama decided that applying the same generally applicable standards for all nationalities should apply to Cuban noncitizens,"" said University of California Davis School of Law immigration law professor Kevin Johnson. ""In contrast, President Trump singled out citizens of seven nations for special treatment more harsh than that generally applicable to all other noncitizens."" University of Miami immigration law professor Kunal Parker also said that Diaz-Balart’s comparison is invalid. ""President Trump's order singles out certain countries for special treatment and specifically bans Syrian refugees from entering the United States,"" he said. ""Nationals of the seven targeted countries are henceforth going to be treated differently from immigrants and nonimmigrants from all other countries."" Ted Henken, a Latin American studies professor at Baruch College, said that Trump’s order reintroduces preferential treatment since it established a loophole for religious minorities. Trump’s order states that when refugee admissions resume, that the federal government will ""prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality."" (The order doesn’t specifically identify religions but the clause about religious minorities has been interpreted to refer to Christians who are minorities in Muslim countries.)   Obama’s rule change was about how to process people arriving from one country -- Cuba -- and wasn’t related to vetting them for security threats. Trump’s order specifically states that it is an order ""protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States."" Diaz-Balart’s spokeswoman Katrina Valdes told PolitiFact Florida in an email that the point of his statement was not to compare Trump’s order and Obama’s rule change ""but to highlight the hypocrisy"" of those who disagreed with Trump’s order but supported Obama’s rule change. ""President Obama, without warning, introduced chaos into the system for Cuban refugees,"" he said in a statement to PolitiFact Florida. ""Where was the outrage as they were waiting at the border, having traveled for miles in horrible conditions, to have the door slammed in their faces? Obama ended the special parole for the Cuban Adjustment Act and eradicated the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program. He didn't just more strongly vet them, and he didn't put on the brakes for the programs for three months. He ended them."" Our ruling Diaz-Balart said that Obama ""took similar action against Cuban refugees"" as Trump did in his executive order. Experts said that Diaz-Balart is comparing two very different actions. Obama’s rule change ended ""wet foot-dry foot"" -- a policy that provided special treatment to Cubans who arrived on U.S. shores without a visa. Obama didn’t entirely halt immigration for Cubans; his rule change meant that they had to apply just like people from other countries. Trump’s order is far more broad and temporarily suspended entry for people from seven specific countries, as well as refugees from everywhere.

Is Philly’s sanctuary city status putting residents in danger?
","Has Philly released dangerous undocumented criminals in recent years? Conservatives continue to point to examples. ""From the release of a child rapist from the Dominican Republican (sic) to that of an Italian drug smuggler,"" Philly GOP chair Joe DeFelice said in an emailed statement last Wednesday, ""Philadelphians have already been put in direct danger by Mayor Kenney’s policy of blocking local law enforcement from participating with federal immigration authorities."" According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, there indeed has been an alleged child rapist of Dominican origin, and an Italian man who pleaded guilty to possession of and intent to deliver illicit drugs. One by one: Winston Enrique Perez Pilarte, who was charged in Philadelphia under the name Josue Duran-Cortes with various child sexual assault charges, was released after posting $25,000 bail two months before Kenney entered office.  Fabio Dalloco, after authorities say they busted him with 14 pounds of cocaine at the airport, was incarcerated for roughly 14 months and released on time served through his plea deal in August 2016. ICE said that detainer requests were sent but not honored for either of these men, and that the agency rearrested both themselves. Of note: While Dalloco was released during Kenney’s time as mayor, Perez Pilarte was not — he was released during Mayor Michael Nutter’s tenure. Philadelphia first became a sanctuary city in 2014. Nutter signed an executive order that barred Philadelphia Police and Prisons from honoring ICE detainer requests, unless they came with a judicial warrant for a first- or second-degree felon convicted of a violent crime. He rescinded the order during his last two weeks in office. Kenney swiftly reinstated Philly’s ""sanctuary status"" on the day of his inauguration. We put ""sanctuary status"" in quotes because what makes a city a sanctuary is heavily debated. Kenney himself uses the term Fourth Amendment city; many legal experts argue that local authorities holding an undocumented resident without civil charges is unreasonable search and seizure, and therefore a violation of constitutional rights. But cooperation with federal immigration authorities is a common test for deciding whether a jurisdiction or, more recently, campus is a ""sanctuary."" ICE declined to comment on Philadelphia’s current or pre-existing policies. Lauren Hitt, spokeswoman for Mayor Kenney, reacted to DeFelice’s statement in an email. ""Republicans point to these inflammatory anecdotes in order to justify defunding cities whose only crime is refusing to enact policies that the courts have found to be unconstitutional,"" she wrote. ""The reality is that numerous research studies show that the City's immigration policy makes Philadelphians safer. Philadelphia's crime rate is at a 40-year-low at the same time our immigrant growth is on the rise. This drop in crime is due in no small part to the fact that our immigration policy has strengthened trust between communities and police."" The notion that sanctuary policies are safer is supported in research. According to a Center for American Progress report published late last week, sanctuary counties have lower crime rates. As we explained in an earlier report, looking at sanctuary policies alone wouldn’t account for other factors that could be influencing crime rates, but the CAP’s report compared nearly 2,500 counties, based on ICE’s designations. Another 2016 study, led by researchers out of the University of California Riverside and Highline College, found that sanctuary designations have ""no statistically meaningful effect[s] on crime."" The majority of local police departments, according the 2009 report ""Immigration and Local Policing: Results from a National Survey of Law Enforcement Executives,"" do not routinely check immigration status. ""The great majority of chiefs (72 percent) regard immigration enforcement as the responsibility of federal government,"" the report reads. ""In general, the more serious the violation, the more likely they believe that their officers are to check immigration status."" In addition to this, many reports show that there is a concern among local police that seeking out residents for their status could damage trust in immigrant neighborhoods, and therefore make them tougher to police and lower the likelihood of immigrants sharing information when they witness crime. (For more information on this, see PolitiFact Pennsylvania’s sanctuary explainer.) 
  Our ruling Philly GOP Chair Joe DeFelice said in a statement, ""From the release of a child rapist from the Dominican Republican (sic) to that of an Italian drug smuggler, Philadelphians have already been put in direct danger by Mayor Kenney’s policy of blocking local law enforcement from participating with federal immigration authorities."" Of the two examples given, one man who DeFelice is referring  was released before Kenney’s time. Plus, whether the release of these men poses a ""direct danger"" raises questions. Recent data analysis shows that sanctuary counties are not more dangerous. Can we extrapolate that Dalloco returned to drug smuggling? According to court records, Dalloco wasn’t charged with any crimes in Philadelphia before ICE rearrested him in August 2016, which was two months after his release. ICE confirmed that Dalloco was deported that September. DeFelice’s statement is presumptive.

Don Willett: Elite universites mostly don't require history majors to take American history
","Sounding a tad exasperated, a Texas Supreme Court justice told participants at a legislative forum that many young Americans have too little knowledge about basic U.S. civics and history. ""Get this,"" Don Willett said at the January 2017 event hosted by the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. ""The overwhelming majority of America’s elite universities, they no longer require history majors to take a single course in American history."" At first pass, we can imagine a student possibly majoring in history without studying American history. After all, if you’re seeking expertise in what’s happened someplace beyond North America, you probably didn’t get steeped in it before college. Still, do most American colleges not require that history majors take even one American history course? Willett cites report We asked Willett, whose name appeared on a 2016 Donald Trump list of U.S. Supreme Court prospects, the basis of his claim. Willett, known for his oft-humorous Twitter account, answered with an email pointing out a report, closing his reply: ""Gotta avoid that dreaded Robe on Fire rating."" The July 2016 report --  issued by the Washington-based American Council of Trustees and Alumni, which says it’s an independent group ""committed to academic freedom, excellence, and accountability at America's colleges and universities"" -- states that 23 of the 76 U.S. colleges and universities ranked most highly by U.S. News & World Report were requiring students seeking a history degree to take courses in American history--so 70 percent were not. Do Top-Ranked U.S. Universities Require History Majors to take American History?        SOURCE: Report, ""No U.S. History?,"" the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, July 1, 2016 Also, the report says that among the high-ranked institutions requiring a course in American history, ""11 allow courses so narrow in scope—such as ‘History of Sexualities’ or ‘History of the FBI’—that it takes a leap of the imagination to see these as an adequate fulfillment of an undergraduate history requirement."" At the council, the study's lead author, Michael Poliakoff, told us by email that the focus was on university requirements ""based on the understanding that it is through requirements that a program articulates its own concept of academic priorities."" Poliakoff said the research did not try to gauge how many history students take at least one U.S. history course. Texas universities We checked some of the report’s accounts, starting with the two Texas universities included in the review. Rice University, the report says, previously required history majors to take a U.S. history course, ""but their new set of requirements makes it merely optional."" On a web page, Rice says that each history major matriculating after fall 2014 must take 10 history courses including one each in four of five fields: Premodern; Europe; U.S.; Asia, Latin America, Africa; and transnational history--perhaps an indication there’s a good chance a Rice history major takes American history. But it’s not required. Also, according to the report, the University of Texas requires history majors to take two U.S. history courses though, the study says, a class on Jews in American entertainment can count. To our inquiry, a UT spokesman, J.B. Bird, noted by email that by state law, every degree-seeking student at public colleges and universities--regardless of major--must take a couple American history courses. We confirmed that: The relevant state law, tracing to 1955, states that ""a college or university receiving state support or state aid from public funds may not grant a baccalaureate degree or a lesser degree or academic certificate to any person unless the person has credit for six semester hours or its equivalent in American History."" Bird also guided us to Jacqueline Jones, who chairs the university’s history department. By email, Jones said most UT undergraduates take the department’s survey courses, one covering American history before 1865, the other picking up from there. Jones also said it would be highly unlikely for a student to take an upper-level history course, including the one on Jews in American entertainment, toward complying with the state mandate. Jones further offered that she takes issue with ""the premise that if a college student does not take history-department courses, s/he has learned no American history. My colleagues in the American Studies department teach many different history courses. Faculty in the Government department who teach U.S. politics and political institutions also teach American history. I could go on and list other relevant departments here—Mexican-American and Latino/Latina Studies and African and African Diaspora Studies, for example."" Checking universities outside Texas We went on to check the requirements placed upon history majors at very-high-ranked Yale University, which the report singles out for creating a ""specialist track"" history degree, starting with the class of 2017, enabling students to ""forgo a requirement in U.S. history whereas previous students were required to take at least two courses in the history of the United States or Canada."" That’s correct, we confirmed on a Yale web page stating that students with the specialist track major may take up to eight courses within a chosen world region plus two courses from outside that region--with one of the possible five regions being the U.S. ""Their overall coursework must include courses from at least 3 geographic regions,"" the university says. Then again, Yalies may alternatively seek a history degree on the ""global track,"" which requires each major to take at least one U.S. history course. Harvard University, similarly listed in the report as not requiring history majors to take U.S. history, says on a web page that it requires students concentrating in history to take 10 history ""half-courses,"" which we take to mean one-semester courses. According to the web page, Harvard’s requirements of history majors include a half-course in  U.S. or European History (western). In spring 2017, about when Willett spoke, we noticed more than 25 course options in this category including nine courses centered on American history such as one on the American Revolution; another introducing American history with an emphasis on democratic political institutions; a course on the New Deal; and a course on U.S. legal history from 1776 to 1865. The University of Michigan, the highest-ranked public university identified in the report as not requiring history majors to take American history, says on a web page that each major must take 10 history courses--including one each from four of seven regions/categories including U.S./Canada. At the University of North Carolina, also listed in the report as not requiring history majors to take an American history course, history majors also must take 10 history courses, according to a university web page. Up to six of the courses can be in the student’s chosen ""concentration,"" the page says; the university’s eight history concentrations include one in U.S. history. National expert We asked UT’s Jones to suggest a national expert who might speak to what universities require of history majors. Jones pointed us to Jim Grossman of the Washington-based American Historical Association, which describes itself as the nation’s largest professional organization serving historians in all fields and professions. Grossman, who said in a May 2016 commentary that the percentage of students earning history degrees has lately declined, noted by email that the council study didn’t give a lot of credit to colleges that require all undergraduates to take U.S history nor did it sort out the history courses that students actually take. ""I wish I had such data,"" Grossman wrote. Grossman also told us that  most institutions don't have a major in American history. ""A student majors in history,"" Grossman wrote, ""and in the best programs that major includes a wide variety of courses, enabling a student to develop the skills and habits of thought that a history major provides, but from a wide variety of angles."" When we circled back to Poliakoff, he said the only recent research on what students actually take suggests that less than half of respondents in 1992, more than 20 years ago, took a U.S. history course. Poliakoff noted too that another council study, titled ""What Will They Learn?,"" found 18 percent of American universities requiring all students to take U.S. government or history. The September 2016 version of that report states the council reached its conclusions about curricular requirements based on reviewing course catalogs and other publicly available materials for more than 1,100 colleges and universities. Our ruling Willett said the ""overwhelming majority of America’s elite universities"" don’t require history majors to take a course in American history. In 2016, some 70 percent of the country’s 76 colleges and universities most highly-ranked by U.S. News & World Report did not require history majors to take American history, a study shows, though clarifications are missing. There's evidently no current research on what students actually take while in places including Texas, every degree-seeking undergraduate at a public college must take American history.

Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

Kellyanne Conway incorrect that worker remittances to Mexico are 'No. 1' income flow
","White House counselor Kellyanne Conway offered several possibilities for how President Donald Trump will build a wall across the southern border, including a tax on goods crossing from Mexico to the United States. Conway went on to decry the United States’ trade deficit with Mexico during an interview with CBS’ Charlie Rose, calling ""repatriation of funds"" a ""very big piece of President Trump’s vision for this country."" ""Here's the fact,"" Conway said on Jan. 27, 2017. ""The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back."" This would be more appropriately considered an alternative fact. Conway does have a point that ""remittances"" (as they are officially called) from individuals in the United States constitute a significant boost to the Mexican economy, and they may be of enormous importance to the individual families on the receiving end. However, they are far from the country’s No. 1 source of income. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) BBVA Bancomer, a Mexican economic forecaster, has projected that once all the data for 2016 is tallied, Mexicans will have sent $27 billion in remittances into Mexico in 2016 -- a one-year record, and an increase of more than $2 billion over 2015. (Part of the reason for the uptick, the group says, was a surge in remittances in November with Trump’s election, driven by widespread concerns that he may cut off remittances in the future.) These totals are in line with U.S. government data. However, we found at least two different types of money flows from the United States to Mexico that are bigger than remittances. Ranking first is the money spent by United States consumers and companies on good old-fashioned Mexican exports -- everything from manufactured goods to oil to agricultural products. According to federal data, the United States in 2015 imported Mexican goods totaling $295 billion. That pot of money is more than 10 times bigger than the amount of remittances.  The biggest category of Mexican exports to the United States -- auto vehicles and parts -- was by itself north of $100 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. In addition, foreign direct investment by the United States totaled $28 billion in 2015 -- a bit higher than the projected remittances for 2016 and clearly higher than the total of remittances for 2015, which was $24.8 billion. Foreign direct investment is defined as ""investment from one country into another, normally by companies rather than governments, that involves establishing operations or acquiring tangible assets, including stakes in other businesses."" Three experts in U.S.-Mexico economic ties -- Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; Mary C. King, a Portland State University economist; and Robert A. Blecker, an American University economist -- concurred with our analysis of the data. ""Remittances are important -- just far from No. 1,"" Blecker said. ""And from a Mexican point of view, it’s a huge disappointment that remittances are so high relative to foreign direct investment and tourism, which would be much more positive sources of income. Nevertheless, they are not the biggest -- not nearly."" Our ruling Conway said, ""Here's the fact. The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back."" A projected $27 billion influx of cash from the United States into Mexico is nothing to sneeze at, and this money makes a real difference in the lives of many Mexicans who have relatives living and working in the United States, whether legally or illegally. However, contrary to what Conway said, remittances do not rank No. 1 on the U.S.-Mexico income flow list. Rather, U.S. purchases of Mexican goods -- to say nothing of services -- are more than 10 times the size of remittances. And remittances also trail foreign direct investment as a source of income in Mexico.

Why comparing Trump's and Obama's immigration restrictions is flawed
","After a weekend of nationwide demonstrations in protest of immigration restrictions on entry from seven nations, President Donald Trump blamed the media for misreporting his controversial executive order and said it was an extension of former President Barack Obama’s policies. ""My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,"" Trump wrote in a Jan. 29 statement. ""To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting."" To refresh, Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days. It also puts Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. (We go over some of the key issues in this explainer.) In 2011, Obama’s state department stopped processing Iraqi refugee requests for six months, though it didn’t disclose the policy like Trump did, ABC reported in 2013. So, are the policies similar as Trump claimed? In the most superficial of ways, yes. They both limit immigration into the United States on a temporary basis. But there are two significant differences that Trump omits. In 2011, there was a specific threat First, Obama’s suspension was in direct response to a failed plot by Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green, Ky., to send money, explosives and weapons to al-Qaida. The two men were arrested by the FBI in May 2011 for actions committed in Iraq and trying to assist overseas terrorist groups. Both had entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork. One man worked as a bombmaker in Iraq, and the FBI even matched his fingerprints to an unexploded IED discovered in 2005 in Iraq, raising questions about the thoroughness of the vetting process. Trump’s ban, meanwhile, is more preemptive. As PolitiFact reported, no refugee or immigrant from any of the seven countries targeted by the ban has been implicated in any fatal terrorist attack in the United States, though perpetrators of at least three non-deadly cases were connected to Iran or Somalia. Obama’s order was narrower in scope Second, the scope of the two policies is slightly different. Obama’s 2011 order put a pause on refugee processing, whereas Trump’s halt in entries applies to all non-U.S. visitors. It should also be noted that Iraqi refugees were still admitted to the United States every month in 2011, though there was a significant drop after May of that year. Here’s a chart with data from the state department: According to the New York Times, the Obama administration also required new background checks for visa applicants from Iraq after the Bowling Green incident. Lawmakers at a 2012 congressional hearing also indicated that the Department of Homeland Security expanded screening to the Iraqi refugees already settled in the United States. But again, these are different from a blanket ban on visitors. Obama, speaking through a spokesperson, disagreed with the comparison in a statement. There are other precedents for temporary halts in immigration. A 2016 Congressional Research Service report notes that refugee admissions were also briefly suspended after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack to review the security procedures, leading to an overhaul of the system. A special subset of refugee admissions for reuniting families was suspended in 2008 in certain locations in Africa after higher rates of fraud.   So like Obama’s 2011 suspension, both the post-9/11 and African cases were in reaction to immediate issues and limited to refugees. Trump’s order is broader, and his administration has provided no evidence it is in response to any particular event. The seven countries on Trump’s list While not necessarily part of this fact-check, Trump’s suggestion that he selected the seven countries as a continuation of Obama’s policy is imprecise. According to the executive order, Trump’s action applies to ""countries designated pursuant to Division O, Title II, Section 203 of the 2016 consolidated Appropriations Act."" That refers to a 2015 act, signed into law by Obama, revising the United States’ visa waiver program. The visa waiver program allows citizens from 38 countries to enter the United States without a visa for up to 90 days. Under the legislation, citizens of those 38 countries who had traveled to Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan after March 2011 were no longer eligible for the visa waiver. Libya, Yemen, and Somalia were later added to the list. In other words, Obama’s actions dealt with people who had visited Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, not citizens of those countries, and it did not prohibit them from entering the United States. Our ruling Trump said, ""My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months."" The Obama administration in 2011 delayed processing Iraqi refugees for six months following evidence of a failed plot by two Iraqi refugees. Trump’s executive order temporarily bars travel to the United States for all citizens from seven countries, and it is not in direct response to actions from citizens of those countries. Furthermore, Iraqi refugees were nonetheless admitted to the United States during the 2011 suspension while Trump has put an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.

New York's definition of when a fetus becomes a person
","Assembly Democrats want to guarantee access to abortion for New York state residents if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. A bill, commonly referred to as the Reproductive Health Act, would change state law to guarantee women the choice to have or refuse an abortion or contraception if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade. Different versions of the bill have been introduced for at least seven years in the Legislature. This year’s debate over the measure included tough questions to the bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Deborah J. Glick, from members opposed to the bill. ""So, if a baby is born intact and alive but has not yet taken its first breath, it has no rights?"" Assemblymember Steven F. McLaughlin asked. ""Is that the position you are taking?"" ""New York state law says you are alive when you begin to breathe,"" Glick said. ""That’s not me, that’s just the law."" Is Glick right? Is that the law? State abortion law Glick said her definition comes from the current state law on abortion. The definition is included in the state’s penal law, or criminal code, which defines the crime of abortion, where someone intentionally causes a pregnancy to be terminated without consent or justification. The law says a person, ""when referring to the victim of a homicide, means a human being who has been born and is alive."" So a fetus inside the womb is not considered a person, and therefore does not have rights under state law. That is why someone can legally have an abortion after being pregnant for 24 weeks to preserve the life of the mother. State health law State health law goes a step further in defining when someone is considered born. Under Public Health Law, live birth is defined as ""the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live born."" It is up to a medical professional to determine if there is evidence of life in the infant. If the medical professional finds evidence, it is legally considered the birth of a person. ""The reality is that if they are born and alive they are a person and have full rights,"" Glick said in a phone interview. ""And that is the determination of a medical person at the time."" Our ruling Glick said during an Assembly debate that ""New York state law says you are alive when you begin to breathe."" State law says a person has been born alive when the fetus has exited the woman’s body and shows signs of life. The law specifically mentions breathing as one of the signs. But the law also mentions other evidence of life, such as a beating heart.  We rate this claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jan/30/deborah-glick/new-yorks-definition-when-fetus-becomes-person/

","President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily suspending the admission into the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries and indefinitely banning refugees from war-torn Syria stirred an uproar across the nation, with protesters gathering at the nation’s largest airports. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a CNN interview from New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport that it was important to protect the United States from people who want to harm the country. But he argued that refugees are heavily vetted by the U.S. government and that recent attacks have not been from nationals of the countries singled out by Trump. ""The various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the president's executive order,"" Nadler said in a CNN interview Jan. 28. ""If you really want to protect this country, why are Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey left out of the order? Most of the 9/11 conspirators came from Saudi Arabia."" Trump’s executive order signed Jan. 27, called ""Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States,"" suspended for 90 days the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry of people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Individuals from those seven countries who are U.S. lawful permanent residents are also stopped from re-entering the country (though exemptions may apply), the New York Times reported, attributing the information to the Department of Homeland Security. We wondered if Nadler was correct by saying that since 9/11, terrorist acts in the United States have not been carried out by people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Experts told us no fatal attack has been attributed to nationals from those countries, but that there have been a few non-deadly acts by individuals from two of those countries. Increased homegrown terrorism According to New America, a think tank compiling information on terrorist activities in the United States since 9/11, 94 people have been killed by jihadists in the past 15 years. But in its overview of who are the individuals committing the attacks, New America says the majority of attackers come from within. ""Far from being foreign infiltrators, the large majority of jihadist terrorists in the United States have been American citizens or legal residents. Moreover, while a range of citizenship statuses are represented, every jihadist who conducted a lethal attack inside the United States since 9/11 was a citizen or legal resident,"" the New America study says. ""In addition about a quarter of the extremists are converts, further confirming that the challenge cannot be reduced to one of immigration."" ""It's certainly the case that none of the major, deadly attacks carried out in the United States were carried out by people from these countries,"" said Erin Miller, who manages the Global Terrorism Database for the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. Other experts agreed. ""Since 9/11, no one has been killed in this country in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from any of the seven countries,"" added William C. Banks, director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University College of Law. In June 2016, Omar Mateen, born in the United States to Afghan parents, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in an Orlando nightclub shooting. In December 2015, a Pakistani woman, Tashfeen Malik, and her husband killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. The husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was born in the United States to Pakistani parents. However, there have been at least three non-deadly attacks in which the perpetrators were from Iran or Somalia, said John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State University, expert on terrorism and a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. One of those examples includes the November 2016 attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who had lived in Pakistan before coming to the United States. Abdul Razak Ali Artan, 18, was shot dead by a police officer after he slammed his car into pedestrians and injured others with a butcher knife. The FBI said it would investigate the attack as a ""potential act of terrorism."" In September 2016, Dahir Adan was shot dead after stabbing nine people in a Minnesota shopping mall. Adan was identified by his father as Somali but born in Kenya, moving to the United States when he was a child. Another incident was in 2006, when Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar ran a Jeep Cherokee into a crowd of people at his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. Thinking he would be killed during the attack, Taheri-Azar left a letter in his apartment saying he wanted revenge for the deaths of Muslims across the world caused by the United States, the AP reported. A naturalized citizen born in Iran, Taheri-Azar in 2008 plead guilty to nine counts of attempted first-degree murder and was sentenced for up to 33 years in prison. On ABC’s This Week, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the president’s order covered countries that the Obama administration had identified as needing further travel restrictions. ""What the president did was take the first step through this executive order of insuring that we're looking at the entire system of who's coming in, refugees that are coming in, people who are coming in from places that have a history or that our intelligence suggests that we need to have further extreme vetting for,"" Spicer said Jan. 29. Starting in early 2016, individuals from countries that participate in the visa waiver program (that is, people allowed to travel to the United States without a visa) and who had also been in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Libya or Somalia recently (with exceptions for diplomatic or military purposes) were no longer permitted to come to the United States without a visa. They were not banned from traveling, but they did need to apply for a visa and be vetted. People who were nationals of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria were also no longer able to come to the United States without a visa. Our ruling Nadler said, ""The various people who have, in fact, committed terrorist acts in this country, from 9/11 on, none of them came from any of the seven countries that are the subject of the president's executive order."" Experts on terrorism tell us that since 9/11 no one in the United States has been killed in a terrorist attack by someone from the seven countries for which Trump’s executive order temporarily suspends admission. Those countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. But there have been at least three non-deadly cases in which the perpetrator was connected to Iran or Somalia.

No evidence for Trump claim that it was 'impossible' for Syrian Christians to enter U.S.
","On the same day as he announced a halt on entries from Syria and six other predominantly Muslim countries, President Donald Trump claimed the United States was discriminating against Christians in its refugee admission policy. Trump’s executive order declaring the ban includes an exemption for persecuted religious minorities. In an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, Trump explained: ""If you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very, very tough to get into the United States. If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible."" This is a claim we heard from Trump during the 2016 election, and it’s inaccurate. Christians make up a very small fraction of Syrians admitted under the refugee program, but they have been able to enter the United States. There is no evidence that this is an outcome of discriminatory policy. Refugee admissions skew in favor of Christians in other countries. Admissions numbers From Jan. 1, 2012 (the year the first Syrian refugees began arriving) to Jan. 29, 2017, the United States admitted 19,324 refugees from Syria. According to federal data, this included 19,025 Muslims and 199 Christians. (Another 86 belonged to other religions or no religion at all.) So, right off the bat, Trump is wrong that it was ""impossible"" to enter the United States as a Christian.   Christians do make up a small fraction of refugee admissions compared with their makeup in the overall population of Syria. (We’ll explain why that may be later.) But they did come in; it was not ""impossible,"" as Trump said. Muslims made up about 98 percent of Syrian refugees, compared with about 87 percent of Syria’s population, as of Jan. 12, 2017, according to the CIA World Factbook. Christians, meanwhile, were 10 percent of the population but just 1 percent of refugees. (The Pew Research Center meanwhile says about 5 percent of Syrians are Christians.) This pattern, however, doesn’t exist for the other countries targeted by Trump’s ban. In some cases, the reverse is true: The proportion of Christian refugee admissions are greater than the proportion of Christians living the country. Here’s a breakdown of refugee admissions by country and religion in the time frame (Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 29, 2017): Christian refugees Christian population Muslim refugees Muslim population Syria 1% 10% 98% 87% Iran 49% 0.9%* 9% 99%* Iraq 26% 0.8% 71% 99% Sudan 13% 5%* 79% 91%* Somalia 0.2% 0.2%* 99.8% 99.8%* Libya 0%** 2.7% 100%** 97% Yemen 27% 0.2%* 60% 99.1%*   Experts say no evidence of religious discrimination When we looked into Trump’s claim in July 2015, all the experts we spoke with said Trump’s accusation is off base. A year and half later, there’s still no evidence that Christians have a higher bar to clear for entry. David Martin, an immigration law expert at the University of Virginia who previously held posts at the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security, acknowledged that Christian Syrians make up a smaller number of admissions than they do the overall population. But he said, ""there are many possible explanations and this certainly doesn’t reflect a general hostility to Christians."" One possible explanation for the few number of Christian Syrians admitted, the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker reported, is an initial religious disparity at the United Nations’ refugee programs. (The long vetting process for refugees seeking entry to the United States begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee.) The UNHCR reports that 1.5 percent of the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees it has registered are Christian. Agency spokespeople have warned against speculation but suggested this may be because Syrian Christians have the means to move without seeking assistance from the United Nations. In October 2015, then-U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and current U.N. Secretary General António Guterres offered a few other theories. Christians in Syria ""have been less systematically victimized than they were in Iraq,"" he said. ""Most of the Syrian Christians have moved to Lebanon. And in Lebanon, the first thing that happened to me when I met with the Lebanese president ... when I asked him to start a resettlement program from Lebanon, (he said), don’t resettle Christians because they are vital for us."" Ann Richard, then-assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration, suggested in a congressional hearing in December 2015 that Christian Syrians aren’t looking to move out of the country. ""A disproportionate number of Syrians staying in the country are Christian. Now why is this? It’s because a higher percentage of them support Assad and feel safer with him there,"" she said (around 2:23:50 mark). Regardless of the disparity in Syria, experts did not agree with Trump’s suggestion that Christians face additional hurdles. ""The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims,"" Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, told us previously. Martin pointed out that since 2004, Christians have made up about 46 percent of refugee admissions from Iraq. That’s disportionate to the country’s total Christian population by a factor of about 58. Geoffrey Mock, a Middle East specialist for Amnesty International USA, said Amnesty has documented a myriad of human rights violations in the refugee resettlement process, but not religious discrimination ""because we haven’t see any of it from the U.S. side."" Our ruling Trump said, ""If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible."" Hundreds of Syrian Christians have entered the United States through the refugee admissions program. Thousands more Christians from other countries targeted by Trump’s ban have also entered. During former President Barack Obama's tenure, there was no formal policy that discriminated against Christians. People who watch the refugee process closely said there was no actual discrimination against Christians, either. With nothing to support this claim, we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e1da0489-11fc-4450-bf0d-6d8317cfd7a4",/factchecks/2017/jan/29/donald-trump/no-evidence-trump-claim-it-was-impossible-syrian-c/

The U.S. no longer has the highest proportion of college-educated adults
","The U.S. used to have the highest proportion of college-educated adults in the world. But that is not the case anymore, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. ""Thirty years ago we were the most college-educated country on the globe. Today we are No. 11,"" Cuomo said during his executive budget presentation. Cuomo’s claim comes as he pushes for free public college tuition to students from families in New York state earning less than $125,000 a year. He wants to give low-income students more access to a higher education. His plan would cost taxpayers $163 million a year once fully phased in, he said. Is he right about the U.S. ranking for college graduates? Tracking the data Cuomo’s claim would be true if he was speaking exclusively about young adults. The U.S. did rank 11th for college education for citizens 25 to 34 years old in 2015. When you add in 2013 data from Russia, our ranking drops to 12th. But the U.S. ranked higher when including people of all ages. The U.S. in 1992 ranked highest in the world for the percentage of its population with a college degree, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international data-tracking partnership among more than 35 countries. Thirty percent of the American population, ages 25 to 64, had a college degree that year. In 2015, the nation ranked sixth among 43 countries for the percent of the population, ages 25 to 64, with an associate degree or higher. The U.S., at 44.6 percent, ranked behind Canada, Russia, Japan, Israel and South Korea. Canada ranked as the most college-educated country, with 55.2 percent of its population, ages 25 to 64, obtaining an education higher than a high school level. The organization included 2013 data for Russia in the overall rankings for 2015. Without the Russia included, the U.S. ranks fifth in 2015. The Cuomo administration did not respond to our request for more information to back up the governor’s claim Why? A recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the rate of people with a higher education in the U.S. continues to grow, but the rates in other countries are climbing faster. So other countries are catching up to where the U.S. was 30 years ago, said Elizabeth Berman, an associate professor of sociology at the University at Albany. In some cases, a college education is also more accessible in other countries. ""The U.S. does expect students and families to bear the cost of higher education compared to comparable countries,"" Berman said. The cost of college in Canada, for example, is lower on average than in the U.S. Cliff Adelman from the Institute for Higher Education Policy says the organization’s data should be taken with a grain of salt. The data is based on population ratios. The U.S. population has grown, and the populations in some other countries have declined, remained flat or grown at a slower rate, so that affects the percentage of people with a college education. Our ruling Cuomo claimed the U.S. ranks ""No. 11"" among college-educated countries. The U.S. did rank 11th in 2015 for those 25 to 34 years old. But the U.S. ranking for those ages 25 to 64 did not fall by as much as Cuomo claims, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. The U.S. ranked sixth in the world for that age category.

Raise The Age: Could juvenile justice reform save North Carolina millions?
","At least one North Carolina legislator is saying the state could save millions of dollars if it would stop prosecuting all 16- and 17-year-olds in the adult criminal justice system. Only two states – North Carolina and New York – consider everyone as young as 16 to be adults if they commit a crime, no matter the severity or circumstances. But that might change this year. Legislators and law enforcement officers are campaigning to treat those youthful offenders as juveniles (except for serious crimes), like most of the country already does. Both the liberal N.C. Justice Center and the conservative John Locke Foundation support it. But in recent years, several similar attempts to change the law have failed. So why do supporters think things are different now? ""One of the objections to the bills I had was, obviously, cost,"" Rep. Duane Hall, a Raleigh Democrat, told the N.C. Courts Commission in December. ""But all the studies and all other states have shown that juvenile systems save states literally tens of millions of dollars."" Hall has co-sponsored ""Raise The Age"" bills in years past and was speaking last month to drum up support for another bill he plans to file this year. Since the legislature is now back in session, we thought it was time to revisit Hall’s claim. His meaning is clear: He says ""all other states"" have saved millions, implying North Carolina would, too. But why has cost been a concern in the past? Expanding the juvenile-justice system isn’t free. It’s more personalized to focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment, so the costs per person can sometimes be greater than in the prison system. Yet there is a wealth of evidence that keeping teens out of adult prisons leads to lower recidivism, which is the term for when someone commits another crime after being released. That lowers the burden on courts and prisons, and society benefits, too – there are fewer crime victims, and people who would have been committing crimes are instead at school or work. But could those benefits really lead to ""literally tens of millions of dollars"" in savings, like Hall said? Spend money to make money William Lassiter, North Carolina’s head of juvenile justice, said that past reforms to the juvenile-justice system have led to short-term cost increases but long-term savings – to the tune of more than $40 million. Lassiter pointed to reforms for youth offenders in the late 1990s. He said they were largely responsible for decreasing juvenile infractions from 48,089 in 2006 to 29,542 in 2015 – a nearly 40 percent drop. ""In 2008 our budget was $178 million,"" he said. ""Last year it was $132 million. So already we have saved the taxpayers a significant amount of money."" There’s a large body of evidence that juvenile programs lead to lower recidivism rates than adult programs. Moving teens from adult prisons and into the juvenile system, Lassiter said, would lead to future savings. ""It's an evidence-based decision,"" Lassiter said. A study from Princeton University and the Brookings Institute backs up that line of thinking. ""While it costs states billions of dollars a year to arrest, prosecute, incarcerate, and treat offenders, investing in successful delinquency-prevention programs can save taxpayers seven to 10 dollars for every dollar invested, primarily in the form of reduced spending on prisons,"" the study concluded. NC costs, benefits In North Carolina specifically, the most recent study on a potential ""Raise The Age"" law is several years old. In 2009, the N.C. General Assembly created the Youth Accountability Planning Task Force, which hired The Vera Institute of Justice to conduct a cost-benefit study. It made several key findings about treating 16- and 17-year-olds as juveniles. Some back up Hall’s claim; other’s don’t. The study found it would increase the state’s costs by $49 million per year at the start. That’s a knock against Hall’s claim. But it also found the changes would benefit the state economy (by reducing crime, hospital visits, lost days at work and more) to the tune of $102 million per year due to an expected 10 percent drop in recidivism – certainly a point in Hall’s favor. Overall, the study reached a favorable conclusion: ""These results indicate that the benefits of the plan outweigh the costs and that, from a cost-benefit standpoint, the policy change merits consideration."" North Carolina might receive other benefits from the law as well.  A legislative report in 2013 said the change would create 450 jobs. And Lassiter said the state is currently ineligible for potentially millions in public safety grants because it’s noncompliant with federal rules for dealing with teenage offenders. And Hall said there are also intangible economic benefits to consider. ""Kids in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, all around us, they could do the exact same act and not get the (criminal) record,"" he said. ""And that’s going to make it so much easier for them to get into college or get a job than our kids."" He's also right that other states have seen substantial savings. A few examples: Connecticut’s juvenile budget decreased $2 million after it passed a ""Raise The Age"" law. Texas was able to cut $100 million from its prisons – which researchers attributed, in part, to the substantial reduction in recidivism that new juvenile justice reforms were responsible for. University of Arizona researchers found that sending teen drug offenders through special treatment courts rather than the criminal justice system resulted in net benefits of $84,000 per teen. And in Wisconsin, a study found that ""for every 1,000 youth returned to the juvenile system there will be $5.8 million in direct savings each year through reduced law enforcement costs, court costs, and losses to victims."" Our ruling Rep. Duane Hall said that despite concerns over the cost of moving youthful offenders in North Carolina from the adult justice system to the juvenile justice system, the move could save the state ""literally tens of millions of dollars."" The state government would actually see increased costs according to one study – although the same study found the economy would reap a net benefit of tens of millions of dollars. Furthermore, the head of the state’s juvenile justice system said while previous reforms did cost millions to implement, they have since led to fewer youths in the system and corresponding savings of more than $40 million.

Hall is also right that other states have found juvenile justice reforms including taking teenage offenders out of adult prisons do lead to less crime and long-term savings – possibly as much as $10 for every $1 spent on reform. Yet despite all the evidence about long-term savings, there’s also no denying there would be short-term cost increases for state government. For that reason we rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9a456e6f-a40d-4b4c-be0f-f39fc85aeab2",/factchecks/2017/jan/27/duane-hall/raise-age-could-juvenile-justice-reform-save-north/

Chuck Schumer wrongly tweets 'Tillerson won't divest from Exxon'
","Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he won’t vote to confirm Rex Tillerson as secretary of state — in part because Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, won’t divest from his former employer. ""Tillerson won't divest from #Exxon, won't recuse himself, doesn't display values of American foreign policy--I'm voting no,"" Schumer tweeted Jan. 27, 2017. Tillerson won't divest from #Exxon, won't recuse himself, doesn't display values of American foreign policy--I'm voting no. That’s incorrect. Tillerson divested from Exxon, where he worked for 40 years, in early January. An hour later, Schumer tweeted: ""Rex Tillerson won’t lift a finger on climate change, won’t rule out a Muslim ban, won’t divest from Exxon, won’t recuse himself. He doesn’t display values of American foreign policy."" To Schumer’s credit, spokesman Matt House acknowledged the mistake and said his staff would correct the tweets. House said the tweets were supposed to just say Tillerson wouldn’t commit to recusing himself from issues that involve Exxon. But that’s also wrong, as we’ll explain. We still wanted to put Schumer’s claim that ""Tillerson won’t divest from Exxon"" on the Truth-O-Meter and set the record straight. Tillerson has agreed to sell his more than 600,000 shares in Exxon, and Exxon drew up an additional agreement with federal ethics regulators. Tillerson retired from Exxon on Dec. 31 and is entitled to 2 million Exxon shares paid out over 10 years — a package worth more than $170 million as of Jan. 27. However, under the ethics agreement, Exxon will pay out those shares in cash, and they will be put in an independently managed trust that will not be allowed to invest in Exxon. If Tillerson violates the agreement, he will forfeit the trust, and the money will go to a charity not chosen by Exxon or Tillerson. Tillerson is also giving up $4.1 million in bonuses, as well as retiree benefits. In order to comply with ethics requirements, Tillerson is ultimately forgoing about $7 million in compensation he would otherwise receive, according to Exxon. Walter Shaub, director of the Office on Government Ethics, gave Tillerson’s divestment plan a glowing review, calling it a ""clean break from Exxon."" ""I’m especially proud of the ethics agreement we developed for the intended nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson,"" Shaub said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution on Jan. 11. ""Mr. Tillerson is making a clean break from Exxon. He’s also forfeiting bonus payments worth millions. As a result of OGE’s work, he’s now free of financial conflicts of interest. His ethics agreement serves as a sterling model for what we’d like to see with other nominees. He clearly recognizes that public service sometimes comes at a cost."" In contrast, Shaub criticized President Donald Trump’s plan for severing ties with his businesses because it is not a complete divestiture. In his Brookings remarks, Shaub said he ""was glad in November when the president-elect tweeted that he wanted to, as he put it, ‘in no way have a conflict of interest’ with his businesses. Unfortunately, his current plan cannot achieve that goal. It’s easy to see that the current plan does not achieve anything like the clean break Rex Tillerson is making from Exxon."" Regarding Schumer’s claim that Tillerson hasn’t committed to recusing himself from any decisions involving Exxon, federal law requires that Tillerson, if confirmed, stay out of any such decisions for one year. That could pose problems given Exxon’s extensive international business interests. In his Jan. 11 confirmation hearing, senators asked Tillerson if he would agree to continue recusing himself after that year is up. ""I will honor, obviously, the statutory recusal period and then after that, any matter that might involve ExxonMobil or has the appearance that it could lead to some type of conflict, I will seek the guidance of the Ethics Council,"" Tillerson said. ""A review by them, and if it is the view that it would be proper for me to recuse, I'll honor that."" Our ruling Schumer said, ""Tillerson won't divest from Exxon."" But that’s not even close to the truth. Tillerson retired from Exxon on Dec. 31 and laid out a plan for full divestment in the following week. The director of the Office of Government Ethics called it a ""clean break from Exxon.""

Fake news alert: There's no bronze statue of Obama in the White House's front door
","A fake story that claimed President Barack Obama was installing a pricey statue of himself in the White House before he left office has gone bust under a smidge of scrutiny. ""Obama orders life-sized bronze statue of himself to be permanently installed in White House,"" read headlines across several websites in January. The latest version we saw was on Jan. 18, 2017, two days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, but there were many other examples. The story was flagged by Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of Facebook’s effort to limit the impact of fake news on readers’ news feeds. In the posts, Obama is quoted as praising his own record and saying he commissioned the $200,000 bronze statue (repeatedly spelled ""statute,"" as in a law or rule) to preserve his legacy. He wanted the statue ""permanently erected in the entryway of the White House,"" the article asserted. Some versions included the image above, purportedly of the statue standing watch in the Oval Office. Clearly, the article is contrived. We could find no credible mention of an Obama statue being put in or near the front door of the White House. The source of this false account is a Dec. 31, 2016, post on EmpireNews.net. The website says it is ""intended for entertainment purposes only,"" and that its content can’t be reproduced without consent. We didn’t hear back from the website when we asked whether permission had been granted to any other outlets. There is a real Obama statue, and it is actually bronze. But it’s not anywhere in the White House. It’s along the ""avenue of heroes"" near Puerto Rico’s Capitol building in San Juan, where the statue was installed in 2012. Every president who has visited Puerto Rico gets a statue there; Obama took a trip to the commonwealth in 2011. The image currently on the original EmpireNews.net post is a photo from the Flickr account of a photographer named Paul Sableman, and is dated Jan. 8, 2013. But even the background is not the Oval Office. It’s really a photo from the U.K.’s Mirror of a replica created by a Longview, Texas, man named Ron Wade. Wade reportedly spent $250,000 to build a facsimile of the Oval Office at 80 percent scale. The composite doesn’t even feature Obama’s decor — the absence of his chunky mica coffee table was the giveaway. While EmpireNews.net labels itself a joke website in a disclaimer, there’s no evidence of that in the faux story. That’s doubly true when other sites then share the story. The addition of the composite image made from misappropriated photographs only heightens the deceit. We’ve chiseled out the details to cast our own decision.

Is labeling imitation dairy products milk or cheese or yogurt 'against the law'?
","Hostilities between the dairy industry and its competitors are flaring anew as alternatives to cow’s milk take up more space in the dairy case. That means the politicians can’t be far behind. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, spoke up Jan. 12, 2017 in a news release lauding herself as somebody who ""stands up for Wisconsin dairy farmers."" Baldwin wants Congress to pass the Dairy PRIDE Act -- officially known (at least to a few) as the ""Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act."" After two years of falling milk prices, she and other federal lawmakers want the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to enforce consumer regulations defining ""milk."" Is Baldwin right that imitation dairy products -- for instance, soy milk -- often differ nutritionally from dairy item? And is labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" against the law? To back that up, Baldwin’s office pointed us to nutritional labels, and to FDA regulations that plainly state: ""Milk is the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows."" 'Against the law' To dairy officials, inclusion of the word ""milk"" on non-dairy products is a misappropriation of the popularity of cow’s milk. But competitors say coconut milk and soy milk have long histories and aren’t confused with dairy. What’s more, they note, the FDA doesn’t punish ""peanut butter"" for using the dairy term ""butter."" But the FDA in 2008 and 2012 did tell two makers of drinks labeled ""soy milk"" that under its regulations, such labeling was inappropriate because the products did not contain ""milk"" as defined by the agency. ""Soy drink"" or ""Soy beverage"" would be better, the agency said at the time. That -- and regulatory language allowing the FDA to declare a product misbranded and try to block its sale -- help Baldwin’s case. Federal regulations are part of the United States Code that is the law of the land. But to the frustration of the dairy industry, the agency has not consistently enforced that line of reasoning, allowing use of ""soy milk"" and ""almond milk"" and many others. Rebecca Cross, a San Francisco-based regulatory lawyer for food product companies, said the FDA may be viewing labels on a case-by-case basis and allowing use of dairy terms on plant-based products so long as the use is not misleading. Nathan Beaver, a food and drug lawyer with Foley & Lardner in Washington, D.C., explained that foods such as soy milk that have no FDA-written ""standard of identity"" must choose a ""common or usual"" name for their products. Courts, though, have jurisdiction over disputes on the issue and therefore get final say on the meaning of the FDA rules. On milk, courts so far have found that cow’s milk competitors are not misbranded if their names don’t confuse consumers, said Cross. The nutrition comparison Dairy alternatives, Baldwin said, ""contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products."" This is a bit tricky to evaluate given that beverages labeled as some kind of ""milk"" now come from such diverse sources as soy, almonds, cashews, hemp, rice, oats, coconut and sunflowers. For help, we turned to Vandana Sheth, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a leading organization of food and nutrition professionals. For starters, Sheth noted that dairy products can be a good source of calcium, vitamin D, protein and other essential nutrients. Soy milk provides close to the same amount of protein as cow’s milk. Rice milk typically provides minimal protein and is higher in carbohydrates. Almond milk is usually quite low in protein and also less calorically dense, she said. Plant protein tends to be of a lower quality than dairy proteins, though soy is close, said John Lucey, a food scientist who directs the Center for Dairy Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our own review of labels found that soy and almond beverages, like cow’s milk, are all relatively low calorie, low carbohydrate, low sodium drinks. They are all heavy with calcium. But they feature a different mix of vitamins and minerals, and fat content. Examples: soy milk has a lot of folate, while cow’s milk typically has none; cow’s milk contains some Vitamin C, but the soy, almond and hemp drinks we examined have none. Almond and soy milks feature some iron and fiber -- nutrients typically not found in cow’s milk. ""All the products profile differently,"" said Susan Levin, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition education for the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. Bottom line: Baldwin’s nutrition observation is on target, based on a comparison of milk products. Our rating Baldwin claimed that imitation dairy products made from plants often differ nutritionally from the real thing, and labeling them ""milk"" or ""cheese"" or ""yogurt"" is ""against the law."" The nutrition point is accurate, and the legal point is partially so. Overall we rate her claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jan/27/tammy-baldwin/labeling-imitation-dairy-products-milk-or-cheese-o/
