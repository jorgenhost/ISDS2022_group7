Rick Scott opposed Medicaid expansion before he supported it
","States across the country are still debating whether to expand Medicaid to serve the poor as part of the federal health care law. Florida Gov. Rick Scott is on record supporting an expansion, but he did not always hold that view. Scott’s critics continue to argue he isn’t pushing for the expansion hard enough. It’s sure to be an issue in the governor’s race, so we wanted to look at the evolution of Scott’s position on the issue on our Flip-O-Meter, which evaluates whether a politician changed their stance -- we leave it up to voters to make judgments about any such changes. (Scott is expected face former Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat -- we have evaluated several  Crist stances on our Flip-O-Meter.) Medicaid and the health care law Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. The federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The Medicaid expansion would allow states to offer health insurance to all of the poor. Before the law, you had to be poor as well as either disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child to qualify. The law says the federal government will cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, gradually declining to 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond. Even before he ran for governor Scott was a persistent critic of President Barack Obama""s federal health care push. In 2009, Scott spent $5 million of his own money to form Conservatives for Patients' Rights and oppose the law. But on June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obamacare.  At the time, about 3.8 million people -- or about 21 percent -- of the state’s population was uninsured. The Supreme Court’s ruling said that states could skip the Medicaid expansion without facing financial penalties. In response to the ruling, Scott said on Fox News that Florida would not expand Medicaid, adding that it ""just doesn’t make any sense"" and that it was too costly. Then a change of position On Feb. 20, 2013, Scott summoned the media to the governor’s mansion where he announced that he still opposed setting up a state exchange but now supported a three-year Medicaid expansion. Scott said that a three year expansion would allow the state to then judge if it was working before deciding whether to re-authorize it. ""On the question of Medicaid expansion, there are no perfect options. To be clear, our options are either having Floridians pay to fund this program in other states while denying health care to our citizens, or using federal funding to help some of the poorest in our state with the Medicaid program as we explore other health care reforms...,"" he said. ""While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care."" At the time, Scott said that his mother’s recent death gave him a new perspective. ""As I wrestled with this decision, I thought about my Mom’s struggles raising five kids with very little money,"" he said. The tea party crowd pounced on Scott’s flip-flop. ""This is just another example of Republicans lying to Floridians,"" said Everett Wilkinson, a tea party activist, calling Scott ""the Benedict Arnold to the patriot and tea party movement in Florida."" Though Scott supported the Medicaid expansion, he also made it clear it wasn’t one of his legislative priorities. The Legislature ended up rejecting the expansion, which included $51 billion in federal dollars over 10 years. In an interview with reporters in Washington on Feb. 24, Scott was asked about his opinion on Medicaid expansion and said he still supports it.   Our ruling Scott fought the health care law before he became governor, and after the law passed, he continued to fight it. After the Supreme Court upheld the law, Scott said definitively that he opposed the Medicaid expansion. But several months later, in February 2013, Scott announced that he supported Medicaid expansion. He qualified that position by saying he wanted to try it for three years, so Florida could then judge how it was working. But he didn’t push the Legislature to approve it, and legislators ultimately rejected the expansion. In 2013, Scott completely reversed his stance on Medicaid expansion. So we rate this a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966C1640>],/factchecks/2014/feb/25/rick-scott/rick-scott-opposed-medicaid-expansion-he-supported/

Conservative ad says Begich supports carbon tax
","Conservative political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity is spending $400,000 into a TV ad attacking U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, for his position on a potential carbon tax. ""Sen. Begich hasn’t always been straight with us,"" the narrator claims as footage of him supporting Obamacare flashes across the screen. ""And now he’s at it again. Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority."" PolitiFact wanted to find out if the ad accurately reflects Begich’s position on the carbon tax. A carbon tax would impose a tax or fee on oil, gas and coal usage. The idea is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Because Congress hasn’t come close to passing such a tax, many of the logistics are still up in the air. How Begich has voted Americans For Prosperity pointed us to a couple of amendments to Senate budget resolutions from 2013 as examples of Begich supporting a carbon tax. Begich voted in favor of an amendment to last year’s budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. That amendment failed, but it would’ve called for revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form. Nothing in that amendment would actually enact a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were enacted, would be put to use. ""I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are,"" Whitehouse told reporters in September. ""So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds."" So although Begich’s vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax, he was allying himself with a carbon tax supporter’s amendment that could make such a tax more politically palatable. The other vote Americans For Prosperity cited is from an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., which also failed. This amendment would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within the budget resolution to 60 votes. Begich voted against this amendment, even as some of his Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, by voting against this, he wasn’t directly expressing support for a carbon tax. Begich’s letter to Reid As for ""pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority,"" Americans For Prosperity pointed to a letter Begich and other Democratic senators wrote to Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in 2010. Generally speaking, the letter calls for reform to U.S. energy policy to encourage clean energy: ""While fossil fuels are and will continue to be an important part of our economy, we believe the transition to a clean energy economy -- one that includes an all-of-the-above approach -- is an economic, national security and environmental priority."" The term ""carbon tax"" doesn’t appear in the letter. However, Americans for Prosperity zeroed in on the following line: ""We believe the scale of this challenge dictates the need for a comprehensive solution that includes making polluters pay through a price on greenhouse gas emissions."" A carbon tax could be one way to levy ""a price on greenhouse gas emissions."" Another way, though, would be through a cap-and-trade program. Begich’s campaign spokesman told PolitiFact that the letter he signed was meant to further a general conversation about climate change. The Hill reported that Begich has ""expressed skepticism"" about a carbon tax without expressing either explicit support or opposition. Begich acknowledges climate change in general is real and should be addressed by Congress. We’ve also noted that he sometimes breaks with the White House when it comes to taxes on the oil and gas industry. His campaign office put it this way to PolitiFact: ""Begich has not supported a carbon tax in the past."" Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said ""Begich is on record supporting a carbon tax, even pushing Harry Reid to make it a priority."" Begich voted on an amendment that said if there is a carbon tax, the revenue generated by a carbon tax to be given back to the public in some form.The letter to Reid said that energy policy should be aimed at putting some sort of price on greenhouse gas emissions, without specifically saying it should be a carbon tax. Begich’s campaign said he’s never explicitly supported a carbon tax. If you were counting votes in the U.S. Senate for a straightforward carbon tax and looked at Begich's record for how he might vote, you'd likely put Begich in the ""maybe"" column. Americans for Prosperity exaggerated in saying that Begich is ""on record"" supporting a carbon tax. So we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C4F380>],/factchecks/2014/feb/25/americans-prosperity/conservative-ad-says-begich-supports-carbon-tax/
"['National', 'Debt', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Richard Durbin']","
Dick Durbin says U.S. debt is on track to fall by $3 trillion in next 10 years
","When you hear discussion of the federal debt, the trendlines usually go only one way: up. That’s why our ears perked up when we heard the Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, say on the Feb. 23, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday that the debt is headed downward over the next 10 years. Durbin told host Chris Wallace, ""I can just tell you this, Chris. Since President Obama has been in office, we've reached the point we're cutting the annual deficits in half, and we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years."" On first glance, the data doesn’t seem to back up the claim that ""the overall debt of the United States"" is poised to drop by $3 trillion -- or even by a dime -- over the next decade. A quick refresher: The deficit is a fiscal shortfall for one year, while the debt is the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus any surpluses. The most widely trusted source for federal fiscal projections -- the independent Congressional Budget Office -- recently released an annual report, ""The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2014 to 2024."" In it, CBO estimated the amount of publicly held federal debt for each of the next 10 years. In 2014, the debt is pegged to be $12.7 trillion. By 2024, the debt is set to rise to almost $21.3 trillion. That’s an $8.6 trillion increase, not a $3 trillion decrease. We also checked to see whether Durbin was talking about a decrease in what CBO projected the debt to be 10 years out. In the equivalent ""Budget and Economic Outlook"" report that was released in 2009, just days before Obama took office, CBO projected that in 2019 -- the final year of that report’s 10-year window -- the debt would be $9.3 trillion. By contrast, in the report released a few weeks ago, CBO projected that the debt level in 2019 would be $16 trillion. So again, the future projection of debt is going up, not down. When we checked with Durbin’s office, spokesman Max Gleischman said the senator was referring to ""the amount of deficit reduction Congress has already enacted,"" adding that ""he actually understates it by about a trillion dollars."" He pointed us to projections by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which estimated that such measures as the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2013 American Taxpayer Relief Act are collectively poised to ""shrink deficits by nearly $4 trillion over the 2014-2023 period,"" as long as the deep, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration remain in place. This figure includes spending cuts, revenue increases, and reductions in the amount of interest on the debt. But look closely at the language: The center’s report consistently refers to the ""deficit,"" not the ""debt."" As we noted earlier, the deficit is a single year’s shortfall, while the debt is total money owed. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tallied up all the expected reductions in the annual deficit from these laws over the next 10 years, and it found that they combined to equal $4 trillion. But while these reductions in the deficit, if they materialize, would hardly be trivial, they would not be big enough to actually create annual surpluses -- and surpluses are the only thing that can reduce the cumulative debt, rather than adding to the debt at a slower pace. Our ruling Durbin said that under current policies, ""we're going to reduce the overall debt of the United States by $3 trillion over the next 10 years."" It's obvious now that Durbin meant deficits, not debt. But that doesn't mean it was obvious to everyone watching Fox News Sunday. And Durbin, who has been in Congress for 30 years, certainly should know and be able to articulate the difference. The fact is that people remember the national debt -- there's a whole clock for it -- and it's expected to continue increasing, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Instead of going down $3 trillion, the best estimate is it will rise by $8.6 trillion. That's a difference of ... $11.6 trillion. That's real money to anyone. We rate Durbin's claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1A9740>],/factchecks/2014/feb/25/richard-durbin/dick-durbin-says-us-debt-track-fall-3-trillion-nex/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Republican Party of Florida']","
Alex Sink supported 'higher property taxes,' Florida GOP says
","Alex Sink’s campaign for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat has been under attack by Republicans resurrecting her positions on Florida taxes over the years. One such claim is rooted in Sink’s record as the state’s chief financial officer. A Republican Party of Florida campaign mailer that reached Pinellas County homes by Feb. 10 accused her of leaving out ""some key facts"" in one of her TV ads. The flier read, ""Alex Sink supported higher taxes. She has a long record of supporting higher taxes -- higher property taxes, higher sales taxes, even higher taxes on water and TV."" We’ve checked many of these claims before; we found the sales tax attack Mostly False, and the water and TV taxes claim Mostly True. But what about the property taxes? Back on the homestead The GOP said it was basing their accusation on a Jan. 23, 2008, story in the Tampa Bay Times in which then-CFO Sink voiced her opposition to Amendment 1, a ballot measure focusing on how the state’s homestead exemption would be applied to property taxes. The amendment aimed to increase the exemption, saving homeowners an average of $240 on property taxes annually. It also allowed homeowners to transfer their tax benefits under the 1992 Save Our Homes Amendment, which capped assessment increases on homes, to a new residence. The amendment further created a new $25,000 exemption for some business properties and limited assessment increases for non-homesteaded properties to 10 percent annually. In the story, Sink was briefly mentioned as not supporting the measure because she was afraid of the potential loss of services that might happen if tax revenues fell. Specifically, she mentioned firefighters losing jobs, because they are paid with property taxes. She said her constituents largely shared her opposition. ""They're really more concerned about the little amount of money (they would get back) and the possible broader implications for our quality of life,"" Sink said. The GOP did not make any reference to a statement Sink made a day earlier, which clarified her stance on the measure. ""For 20 dollars a month, I'm not willing to take the risk that my fire service is going to be deteriorated, my schools aren't going to be supported, and I'm not going to get my potholes fixed,"" Sink told the Times Jan. 22, 2008, prior to the article Republicans cited. The piece noted that as Florida’s fire marshal, a role the CFO assumes, she was hearing from fire chiefs statewide that they were worried about losing firefighters. Fire agencies relied solely on ad valorem taxes for their budgets. She said in the piece that she shared the views of Florida TaxWatch, which opposed Amendment 1. She also noted she didn’t think tax policy should be a part of the state Constitution. ""If the policy's in the Constitution and it's not working right, how do you unwind it?"" Sink added. Her public position on the measure, which passed on Jan. 29, 2008, with 64 percent of the vote, came up in June 2009 when she spoke before the Latin Builders Association in Miami to ramp up her campaign for governor. She said then that she couldn’t recall how she voted on the amendment, drawing criticism from conservatives. Combined with a plunging real estate market during the Great Recession, the amendment led to a precipitous drop in tax revenues statewide. The expanded homestead exemption alone, which was retroactive to Jan. 1, 2008, took $93 billion out of coffers statewide in the first year, according to state records. The resultant budget cuts did eventually force many fire agencies to institute hiring freezes or cut personnel, including first responders, and delay or kill equipment purchases and capital improvements. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida says Sink supported ""higher property taxes,"" referring to her somewhat lukewarm opposition to 2008’s Save Our Homes Amendment 1, which adjusted property taxes in a way that lowered them for most homeowners. The claim is misleading in that it implies to voters she wanted to raise property taxes across the board. That wasn’t the case; Sink wanted to keep taxes at the same level, not raise them. There’s an element of truth here, but it leaves out context that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C5BD00>],/factchecks/2014/feb/24/republican-party-florida/alex-sink-supported-higher-property-taxes-florida-/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Guns', 'Matt Bevin']","
Republican challenger Matt Bevin attacks Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's gun record
","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell may have the backing of the National Rifle Association in his quest for a sixth term as Kentucky’s U.S. Senator, but his Republican primary opponent insists McConnell is weak on Second Amendment issues. Businessman Matt Bevin released a 15-second TV ad on Feb. 19, 2014, that not only attacked McConnell’s record on guns, but claimed McConnell’s positions were closely aligned with his Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. ""Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights,"" the ad said. ""Matt Bevin always support the Second Amendment. The choice is clear."" We were surprised to see McConnell attacked on his support of the Second Amendment, having just won the ""Defender of Freedom"" award from the NRA. So we took a deeper dive into this ad to see what it’s getting at. Dissecting the 1991 crime bill The ad isn’t referencing the gun debate of the last two years — or even of the last two decades. Instead, Bevin’s campaign points to a Senate vote from 1991, when McConnell was just starting his second term in office, to support the claim. Back then, President George H.W. Bush sent an anti-crime bill to Congress that would ""toughen a number of laws to cover more violent crimes and would impose the death penalty for certain federal offenses,"" according to a Boston Globe report from the time. Democrats, who controlled both chambers of Congress, were critical of the bill for not addressing ownership of assault weapons and other gun control measures. And though Bush called for the bill to be passed within 100 days, a contentious showdown ensued. The Senate version of the bill, called the Violent Crime Control Act of 1991 and proposed by then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., included an assault weapons ban from the outset and a seven-day waiting period to purchase handguns. The sprawling bill also sent $1 billion to local law enforcement agencies and courts, and expanded mandatory minimum sentencing and use of the death penalty. Senators filed hundreds of amendments to the legislation. Two of the most controversial dealt with gun ownership. A compromise measure shrunk the waiting period to purchase a handgun to five days and laid out parameters for a speedy federal background check. It passed with significant Republican support. But not from McConnell, who opposed any wait period on background checks, his campaign said. The Kentucky senator joined 23 Republicans and eight Democrats to vote against the five-day waiting period. (Reid voted for the measure). The other notable amendment was an NRA-backed measure that would have completely eliminated the waiting period to buy handguns. Before the vote, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a proponent of the amendment, told his colleagues, ""Everybody here better understand this is the key vote"" that will tell whether ""you're either for or against the Second Amendment right to buy arms."" McConnell voted for the NRA’s amendment. Reid did as well. But it did not pass, only mustering 44 votes. The vote that Bevin’s ad singled out was neither of those, but a vote on final passage of the Senate version of the omnibus crime bill, which passed 71-36. McConnell joined Reid in voting for the measure. McConnell also voted to invoke cloture and end debate on the bill earlier in the day. McConnell’s campaign said he only backed the bill because he supported the tougher sentences and money for local police, and to push the bill into a conference committee with the House, where he hoped the gun measures would be removed. Bevin’s campaign said that ""is the classic Washington way of pretending you are against something in your state, but support the measure in Washington"" and he should have worked to defeat the measure entirely. Killing the bill But in fact, McConnell did work to defeat the final bill. Though the Senate crime bill had support from President Bush, House and Senate Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree to a comprehensive measure in the conference committee. Instead, the Democratic majority forced through a bill that had less bipartisan support. The conference bill passed the House by two votes but stalled in the Senate for the rest of 1991 and 1992 under the threat of veto from Bush. With a filibuster in place, Senate Democrats couldn’t reach the 60 votes needed to pass the bill, despite three attempts, in part because the compromise bill had tighter gun restrictions. All three times the bill came up for a cloture vote to end debate, McConnell voted against it. Reid, however, voted to invoke cloture twice and once did not vote at all. So that was 1991. In 2013, McConnell held his caucus firmly together against attempts to restrict and regulate gun purchases after the December 2012 Connecticut school shooting at Newtown. The Senate failed to reach the 60 votes needed on measures to expand background checks on gun purchases, to ban assault weapons and to restrict high capacity magazines. McConnell voted no each time and under his stewardship, Republicans blocked the bills from passing. Reid voted in favor of the assault weapon and high capacity magazine bans. He voted against the expanded background checks, a procedural move that allowed him to bring the amendment up for vote again in the future. Our ruling Bevin’s ad says ""Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights."" The ad focuses on a vote McConnell took more than 22 years ago on a massive crime bill that included dozens of votes and amendments and didn’t even pass Congress. The law failed, with McConnell voting against it, and Reid voting for it. On amendments, McConnell sided with firearm lobbyists when a closely watched provision came up for a vote. The only evidence the Bevin campaign offered was that McConnell voted to advance the bill to a conference committee (as did Reid), but that was a brief point in the legislative process. To hang this attack on a handful of long-ago votes — when he much more recently helped kill gun control legislation — is absurd. So overall, Bevin’s add goes back to 1991 to cherry-pick votes and make it seem like McConnell and Reid were on the same side. Actually, McConnell repeatedly voted against the 1991 bill, on both its gun restrictions and the overall measure. The claim that McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe gun rights is contradicted by many other votes, both then and now. The claim is not only wrong, but ridiculous, and we rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809733E7C0>],/factchecks/2014/feb/24/matt-bevin/republican-challenger-matt-bevin-attacks-senate-mi/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Americans for Prosperity Georgia chapter']","
Details reveal distinction in Obamacare jobs claim
","Opponents of the federal health care law recently got what they believe supports their argument that Congress should pull the plug on the legislation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the law will push many Americans from the workforce. The Georgia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a longtime critic of the law, held a rally at the state Capitol calling for the repeal of the controversial law, citing the CBO’s projections. ""The Affordable Care Act has been disastrous for Georgians, causing premiums around the state to shoot up dramatically and causing many Georgians to lose their previous insurance. All this, despite the president’s promise that ‘if you like your plan, you can keep it,’"" AFP Communications Director Joel Aaron Foster said. ""The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will mean 2.1 million fewer jobs by 2021."" PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the Georgia chapter was correct in its interpretation about the potential number of jobs lost as a result of the law. Our partners at PolitiFact in Washington had looked at a similar claim and found one major flaw. The National Republican Congressional Committee claimed in a television ad that ""Nonpartisan government analysts say Obamacare will cost our economy up to 2.5 million jobs."" PolitiFact noted that the CBO report did not use the word ""jobs."" ""CBO’s updated estimate of the decrease in hours worked translates to a reduction in full-time-equivalent employment of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA,"" the CBO report said. The CBO report suggested some people will choose to work fewer hours, others may quit their jobs in order to get health care subsidies they would not receive if they continued to work their regular schedule. ""Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million,"" the CBO report said. PolitiFact noted: ""An important distinction in the report is that labor force will reduce by the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time workers over the next decade. That doesn’t mean 2.5 million people will leave their jobs. Some people will only cut back a few hours or leave a second part-time job while others may stop working entirely."" PolitiFact rated the National Republican Congressional Committee’s claim Mostly False. We contacted Americans for Prosperity Georgia to see whether there was any additional context it has that may show it should earn a better rating on the Truth-O-Meter. The group’s spokesman, Foster, said the chapter stands by its statement. He pointed to other news coverage that used the same terminology to describe the conclusion the CBO reached in its report. ""The CBO report said the health care law will cause Americans to cut their work hours, equating to 2 million fewer jobs in 2017. That number is predicted to eventually rise to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs in 2024,"" Politico reported. We found other prominent news outlets used similar language in their initial coverage. ""Several million American workers will reduce their hours on the job or leave the workforce entirely because of incentives built into President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday,"" The Associated Press reported in an article that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""That would mean losses equal to 2.3 million full-time jobs by 2021, in large part because people would opt to keep their income low to stay eligible for federal health care subsidies or Medicaid, the agency said. It had estimated previously that the law would lead to 800,000 fewer jobs by that year."" Some major news outlets described it differently, sticking closer to the CBO’s description of its projection. The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, though, explained there is a difference. ""[W]e should note that the figures (2 million, etc.) are shorthand for full-time equivalent workers — a combination of two conclusions: fewer people looking for work and some people choosing to work fewer hours. The CBO added those two things and produced a hard number, but it actually does not mean 2 million fewer workers,"" it reported. Our conclusion We debated long and hard about this one. Americans for Prosperity Georgia did capture the general theme of what the CBO tried to say about the impact of the health care law on employment. It will result in fewer people working fewer hours. But its terminology was not entirely accurate. The CBO report did not say the health care law would result in a reduction of 2.5 million jobs. It specifically said ""more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree"" and added that ""many of them will not leave the labor force entirely."" We believe that is an important distinction. This claim does contain some element of truth, but some of the details are incorrect. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F0E40>],/factchecks/2014/feb/24/americans-prosperity-georgia-chapter/details-reveal-distinction-obamacare-jobs-claim/

MADD says most drunken-driving deaths caused by first-time offenders
","In assigning Wisconsin one of the lowest grades in the nation in its annual report card, Mothers Against Drunk Driving made an interesting claim about first-time offenders. ""‘First-time’ offenders are rarely first-time drunk drivers,"" said a MADD news release on Feb. 11, 2014. ""Conservative estimates show that a first-time convicted OWI offender has driven drunk at least 80 times prior to being arrested."" MADD continued: ""According to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions."" The group spoke out as part of a push for greater use of in-vehicle breath tests, sobriety checkpoints and other measures. Now, we’ve heard state lawmakers argue that drunken-driving remedies should not hammer first-time offenders, who in Wisconsin alone face no criminal liability upon that first conviction. But the MADD national office counters that, saying first timers are involved in a majority of fatal and injury drunken-driving crashes. Are they right? MADD's evidence MADD told us it relied on statements in the ""Alcohol Traffic Facts"" booklet published in 2003 by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. While dated, it was the latest such research made public by WisDOT at the time of MADD’s news release -- and it was the best source we could find in researching this item. The WisDOT study found that over a 12-year period from 1991 through 2002, three out of four drivers who had been drinking before a fatal or serious-injury crash had no prior convictions for OWI on their Wisconsin driving record. ""Drivers who have previously been convicted of one or more OWI offenses do not comprise the bulk of drivers in fatal and non-fatal serious injury crashes involving drinking and driving,"" the WisDOT study said. (emphasis theirs) So MADD’s ""majority"" claim hits the mark, based on the WisDOT research. Beyond the age of the study, there some are other things to bear in mind. First, DOT noted that drivers’ records are not always complete, and that only post-1989 convictions were counted as ""prior,"" under the law at that time. Second, the statistic focused on drivers who had been drinking, a somewhat broader category than the ""drunken drivers"" in MADD’s claim. Other evidence We found additional evidence generally supporting MADD’s claim, though none of it was directly on point. The best data we saw does not get at who caused these accidents. The Century Council, a distilled spirits trade group, cites 2012 federal government crash data showing that among fatal drunken driving crashes in Wisconsin, 87 percent involved a driver with no prior OWI conviction and 11 percent  involved a driver with a prior OWI conviction in the past 3 years. (Three years is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration standard for repeat offender.) That data does not cover injury crashes, though, just fatal crashes. And we note that the NHTSA, the federal agency that collects the data, does not recommend breaking out its data down to the state level. Nationally, NHTSA says, 93 percent of drivers in fatal crashes with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher had no previous drunken driving conviction in the previous three years. Nina Emerson, a veteran drunken-driving researcher in Wisconsin, studied Wisconsin cases of homicide by intoxicated use, and found that three out of four defendants had no prior drunken-driving conviction. For 20 years, Emerson directed the University of Wisconsin Law Schools Resource Center on Impaired Driving, which closed in 2013 when WisDOT ended its funding. One caution: She defined third offense and beyond as ""repeat offenders"" because second offense is the first criminal violation in Wisconsin. Emerson and other researchers emphasize an important truth about the research. ""By most estimates, although repeat drunk drivers comprise a relatively small proportion of the total population of drivers, they are disproportionately responsible for alcohol-related crashes and other problems associated with drunk driving,"" Emerson and researchers Michael S. Scott, Nina J. Emerson and Joel B. Plant wrote in a drunken driving  guide for the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing. That guide concluded: ""However, even though repeat offenders are disproportionately involved in traffic crashes, most alcohol-related crashes are caused by drivers who have not previously been charged with drunk driving, so police must pay attention to both repeat and first-time offenders."" Our rating MADD claimed that ""a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions."" While repeat offenders are overrepresented in such crashes compared to their share of the population, it’s clear that a strong majority of such crashes involve first-time offenders under several different definitions of the term. The research doesn't match up perfectly with the language in MADD's claim, but the best numbers are tilted heavily in the group's direction.

Obenshain says few Virginians are raising families on the minimum wage
","During a recent floor debate, state Sen. Mark Obenshain disputed contentions that raising the minimum wage would ease plight for many poor families. Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said the recipients of Virginia’s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour are mostly young, single workers.   ""There are 4.7 percent of Virginians who are minimum wage earners who are over 25 years of age working full-time and trying to raise a family,"" he said during the Feb. 11 floor debate on a bill that would have raised the wage over two years to $9.25 an hour. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled Senate but died in the Republican-led House, where opponents said raising the wage would force employers to cut jobs. Even so, we were interested in Obenshain’s statistic on minimum wage earners raising families and looked into it. We contacted Jared Walczak, Obenshain’s legislative assistant, and he said there was an error. Obenshain mischaracterized an estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that has nothing to do with the percentage of Virginians raising families on the minimum wage. What the BLS figure tells us is that 4.7 percent of all U.S. hourly wage earners in 2012 were paid at or below the minimum wage. Of an estimated 75.3 million hourly earners, almost 3.6 million received bottom-line pay or less. The agency does not keep track of how many of these earners are raising families. What can we learn about Virginia minimum wage workers? Not much. BLS figures only tell us that an estimated 6.8 percent of hourly workers in the Old Dominion were paid the minimum wage or less. That’s the sixth highest percentage among states, trailing from the top Idaho, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas. In raw numbers, the BLS estimates 1.8 million Virginians were hourly earners in 2012 and, of them, 123,000 were paid the minimum wage or less. The agency cautions that its estimates may have a large margin of error due to small sampling sizes in some states, particularly small ones.  For that reason, it says the estimates of low earners should not be compared to other BLS tables detailing overall employment numbers in each state. Despite Obenshain’s botched explanation of the data, evidence strongly supports the senator’s overall point that minimum wage earners raising families are a small part of Virginia’s workforce. The BLS spreadsheets estimate that roughly half of the people earning minimum wage or less in the U.S. are 25 or older. If that trend applies to Virginia, it would mean about 3.4 percent of hourly workers are minimum wage earners are older than 25. That percentage would drop if the low earners not raising families could be weeded out. Our rating Obenshain said 4.7 percent of Virginians are minimum wage earners older than 25 raising families. The senator’s office acknowledges he garbled a statistic. In fact, no data is kept on the class of people to which Obenshain referred. Obenshain’s overarching point must be considered, however. He was speaking against raising the minimum wage, arguing that the increase would threaten jobs while improving the lot of only a few working families. Our analysis of data that is available strongly suggests that the percentage of Virginia workers supporting families on the minimum wage might be even lower than what Obenshain mistakenly said. So Obenshain stumbled into a credible conclusion. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097269400>],/factchecks/2014/feb/24/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-few-minimum-wage-earners-virginia-a/

Chained CPI and what it means for the federal budget
","President Barack Obama has yet to formally roll out his 2014-15 budget, but it is already notable for one idea that won’t be in it. Something called chained CPI, or consumer price index, has become a flashpoint in the debate over the deficit and spending on entitlement programs. It is a technical shift that would affect everything from how much the government bumps up government payments to how it calculates the taxes we owe. Put simply, using chained CPI would save the government money (and cost you some money). The president included a version of chained CPI in last year’s budget. Excluding it this year avoids a fight within Democratic ranks over preserving the value of Social Security. The move caught the attention of the Sunday talk shows. David Gregory, host of NBC’s Meet the Press prodded his panel of analysts, saying both parties were in campaign mode. ""Yes. And it's all bad for the country,"" said David Brooks, a columnist for the New York Times. ""Chained CPI would save a trillion dollars in the second decade off the federal budget debt."" We decided to take a closer look at Brooks’ figure. But first, a little bit about this thing called chained CPI. Seeking an accurate way to track inflation Chained CPI matters because so many bits and pieces of the government’s business are indexed to inflation. The list includes tax brackets, pension benefits, the cut-off point for tax credits, who’s eligible for food stamps, and most prominent of all, Social Security benefits. The aim of all this indexing is to keep everything in line with the actual cost of living. If a retiree has $100 to spend on groceries today, 15 years from now he or she should be able to buy the same amount of food even if prices went up. The problem is, economists generally agree that the way the government measures inflation today exaggerates inflation by a tiny bit. The technical problem is that as prices of some goods and services rise, people will change what they buy. Chained CPI adjusts for that. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analysts for Congress, calculated that chained CPI is about one-fourth of 1 percent less than the measure in place today. It hardly sounds like much but over time, the impact builds. Depending on how much you earned, when you retire and how long you live, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a group focused on preserving government programs for less affluent Americans, estimated it would reduce benefits by 1 to 2 percent over the course of the average retirement. Defenders of Social Security don’t like chained CPI because it reduces the amount of those monthly checks. Anti-tax groups don’t like it because shifting tax brackets would, bit by bit, increase people’s income tax bills. But from a deficit reduction perspective, chained CPI has plenty of fans. They often point to the CBO estimate that over 10 years, the change would reduce the accumulated deficit by $340 billion -- $216 billion in lower spending plus $124 billion in higher tax revenues. About half of that lower spending would come from Social Security. The source of the $1 trillion We tried to reach David Brooks to determine the source of his claim and we didn’t hear back. He did not get it from the CBO because that group has provided no estimate beyond 2023. (Brooks clearly spoke about savings taking place in the ""second decade."") We found the $1 trillion figure in publications from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates for aggressive steps to cut deficits. In a fact sheet, the group wrote, ""The chained CPI would reduce the deficit by over $1 trillion in the second decade."" ""I will caution that the estimate is not an official CBO cost estimate,"" Jason Peuquet, a research fellow at the committee, told us. Peuquet said the number was derived from several government sources including the CBO and the Social Security Administration. ""So it is grounded in the best projections available."" he said. But projecting so far out is perilous. CBO sometimes goes beyond a typical 10-year window, but it offers many caveats when it does. In a long-term projection for Social Security, for instance, CBO ran 500 different scenarios. It stood by the general direction of its conclusions but not the specific numbers. That said, the figure Brooks used might be close. Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, compared the $1 trillion to the CBO’s estimate for using the chained CPI across all government activities. ""Under such a proposal, an estimate of $1 trillion for the second 10 years is probably in the ballpark,"" van de Water said. However, Van de Water underscored that there is a substantial difference between the across-the-board policy the CBO evaluated and what Obama had in his budget last year and is dropping this year. In 2013, the president exempted programs for low-income people and offered extra payments for Social Security recipients who had been on the rolls a long time. Van de Water said the total 10-year savings would have been about $100 billion less. When Brooks talked about the impact of the president’s new budget, he was not comparing it to the last one from the White House. ""Brooks is roughly accurate about the theoretical savings but has somewhat overstated the savings from the proposal that the Administration actually put on the table,"" Van de Water said. Peuquet also offered one reminder. He said that Brooks would have done better to have spoken of reducing deficits -- the government’s yearly gap between what it spends and what it takes in -- rather than the nation’s debt, which is the accumulated money it owes to lenders. Our ruling Brooks said that using the chained CPI would reduce U.S. debt by $1 trillion in the period of 11 to 20 years from now. That number did not come from the Congressional Budget Office, the one government body that members of both parties count on for impartial long-term projections. Also, the chained CPI estimate Brooks cited goes beyond what Obama proposed last year. In 2013, the president exempted programs for low-income people and offered extra payments for Social Security recipients who had been on the rolls a long time. Those caveats would bring down the savings, no matter what the real number is. We rate Brooks’ statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7BD80>],/factchecks/2014/feb/23/david-brooks/chained-cpi-and-what-it-means-federal-budget/

Bill Kristol says Ukraine's 2004 revolution was the first 'color revolution'
","The violent uprising taking place in Ukraine and the decision of President Viktor Yanukovych to flee the nation’s capital of Kiev dominated much of the talk on the Sunday shows. On ABC’s This Week, conservative pundit and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol connected the recent events in Ukraine to the country’s November 2004 revolution against alleged electoral fraud. Kristol argued that the United States has a responsibility to help out nations like Ukraine more than they have in the past. ""Ten years ago there was the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, it was the first color revolution in spite of other efforts around the world. … All honor to the people of the Ukraine,"" Kristol said. ""That first revolution unfortunately slipped away. I think that’s partly our fault, the west Europeans’ fault. We didn’t do as much as we could have to help the newly democratic Ukraine."" Whether or not the United States helped Ukraine enough a decade ago is a matter of opinion. But we can check Kristol’s assertion about the Orange Revolution and its place in history. Kristol didn’t return our request for comment. What is a color revolution? Eastern European uprisings have taken on many names. Czechoslovakia nonviolently overthrew its Communist government in 1989 in what was known as the Velvet Revolution. But the ""color revolutions"" speak to a more specific group of revolutions that came well after the original fall of Soviet Union, experts told us. They're associated with colors in a broad sense. ""Color revolutions came to denote pro-western government coming to power in former Soviet republics,"" said Anton Fedyashin, a Soviet history professor at American University. ""None of them have succeeded in the long run."" Experts generally identify three color revolutions: Rose Revolution, Georgia, 2003 Orange Revolution, Ukraine, 2004 Tulip Revolution, Kyrgyzstan, 2005 The first color revolution took place in Georgia in November 2003, when Georgian protesters overthrew the government of Eduard Shevardnadze and elected 35-year-old U.S. educated Mikheil Saakashvili. (The name, Rose Revolution, comes from the flower, but it is considered a ""color"" revolution.) Ukraine’s Orange Revolution came a year later and ended when opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko was elected president. (Yuschenko defeated Yanukovych, Ukraine’s now-deposed leader.) The revolution was originally branded ""orange"" because that was Yuschenko’s signature campaign color. So Kristol was wrong when he said Ukraine’s revolution was first. But Donnacha Beacháin, a Dublin City University government professor who published a book on the color revolutions, did say Ukraine’s revolution attracted much more attention than Georgia’s due to the nation’s larger population. Our ruling Kristol said the Ukraine Orange Revolution ""was the first color revolution."" It was the biggest color revolution, but experts say nobody considers it the first. Georgia’s Rose Revolution took place a year earlier. We rate Kristol’s claim False. This item was updated at 6:51 p.m., Feb. 23, 2014, to note that the ""color"" revolutions speak more to a group of revolutions that have loose ties to colors -- than actual revolutions with colors in their names.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097671280>],/factchecks/2014/feb/23/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-ukraines-2004-revolution-was-fir/

Even adjusting for inflation, most Americans' wages haven't increased in over 10 years?
","After giving his fifth State of the Union address, President Barack Obama hit the road. One of his first stops was a GE gas engines plant in Waukesha, a city about 20 miles west of Milwaukee. In both the House chamber and on the factory floor, the president insisted that over the past four years, corporate profits and stock prices soared while wages fluttered. In the State of the Union, Obama claimed that ""average wages have barely budged."" PolitiFact National rated his statement True, finding the average had risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation from 2008 to 2012. In Waukesha on Jan. 30, 2014, the president alluded to a slightly different statistic and was more bold. He said: ""Because the truth is -- and you know this in your own lives, and you see it in your neighborhoods among your friends and family -- even though the economy has been growing for four years, even though corporate profits have been doing very well, stock prices have soared, most folks' wages haven't gone up in over a decade."" We wondered: Even taking inflation into account, is it true the majority of Americans haven’t seen their wages increase in more than 10 years? Obama’s evidence Income inequality was a big topic in the weeks leading up to the State of the Union. So, one thing to make clear upfront is that in his Wisconsin remarks, the president singled out wages -- the paycheck you get from your job. That’s a narrower category than income, which can include money taken in from other sources such as investments or government benefits. When we asked for evidence to back the president’s wages claim, a White House spokesman cited a database from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows the median weekly earnings for full-time workers in the final quarter of each year from 1999 through 2013. The median wage means half of workers earned more than that amount and half earned less. From the database, we assembled the following table. The wage figures are adjusted for inflation. Year Weekly wages, 4th quarter of each year 1999 $335 2000 334 2001 340 2002 336 2003 337 2004 337 2005 332 2006 337 2007 332 2008 340 2009 344 2010 341 2011 335 2012 334 2013 334 So, the inflation-adjusted median wage during the final quarter of 2013 was $334 --  $1 lower than during the final quarter of 1999, more than a decade earlier. However, the table also shows that the median wage went up in some years and down in others during the period cited by the president. It was as high as $344 and as low as $332. Outside experts We put Obama’s claim and the database to four experts: economist Aparna Mathur of the conservative American Enterprise Institute; economist Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, who served as a deputy assistant Treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan; Michael Tanner, senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute; and Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance research director Dale Knapp. They agreed that it’s not possible to track the wages of actual individuals over a period of more than a decade, and so it can’t be known whether most of them had a higher wage in 2013 than in 2009. But the experts also agreed the median wage figure cited by The White House is the best available. As Steuerle told us: ""Looking at the median tells us what is happening across the economy, but not what is happening to each individual worker over time."" Two other points, neither of which bears directly on the accuracy of Obama’s wage claim: Mathur said the broader measure of income gives a better picture of the standard of living of low- and moderate-income people, since it includes assistance such as the earned income tax credit, food stamps and Medicaid. And Tanner said total compensation, including things such as health and retirement benefits, has risen in recent years even if wages haven’t. Our rating Obama said: ""Most folks’ wages haven’t gone up in over a decade."" It’s not possible to know, considering all Americans, whether most of them saw a wage increase in the period cited by the president. But he cites the best-available figure, which shows the  median weekly wage, adjusted for inflation, was $1 less at the end of 2013 than it was in 1999. We rate the president’s statement Mostly True.

Rhode Island gubernatorial candidate Clay Pell says he oversaw a budget of more than $60 million while at the U.S. Department of Education
","Clay Pell, the grandson of former U.S. Sen. Claiborne Pell is inaugurating his political career by making a run for Rhode Island governor. Part of the challenge of getting hired for the job -- as in any job -- is showing you have the right experience. The issue came up during Pell’s Feb. 2 appearance on the WPRI-TV WPRI-12 program ""Newsmakers."" In response to a question from host Tim White about his lack of political experience, Pell, a Democrat, argued that he has administrative experience, citing a previous post at the U.S. Department of Education. White noted that, as governor, Pell would have to deal with an $8.5 billion-budget. ""What’s the biggest budget you’ve ever managed?"" White asked. ""The budget I managed at the Department of Education was more than $60 million,"" Pell said. ""The International and World Language Education budget, which I oversaw, was more than $60 million."" There's no doubt that Pell served as a deputy assistant secretary in that program. The education department issued a news release announcing his appointment and The Providence Journal published a story when he got the job. But did he really manage a $60-million budget? And for how long? When we contacted Pell's campaign, spokesman Bill Fisher sent us a link to the budget of the Office of Postsecondary Education. He said Pell oversaw the $70.2 million appropriation for international education and foreign language studies, along with the $2.2 million set aside for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. Total: $72.4 million. Pell had said the budget was ""more than $60 million."" We also contacted the Department of Education directly, where spokesman Jim Bradshaw sent us to the same spreadsheet. He directed us to lines 579 to 583 -- the $70.2 million figure. We asked if the $2.2-million line item (line 586) applied as well, as Fisher reported, but Bradshaw didn't get back to us on that. When we went back to the Department of Education again to double-check Pell’s role, we received an email from Martha Kanter, now a senior fellow at the Steinhardt Institute of Higher Education Policy at New York University, who was the under secretary of education during Pell's tenure. While deputy assistant secretary, she said, ""he [Pell] oversaw and managed the U.S. Department of Education’s International and Foreign Language Education budget."" Seventy million dollars is chump change compared with the $8.5 billion or so that Rhode Island is expected to spend in the next fiscal year. But when Pell says the portion of the Department of Education budget he oversaw was over $60 million, he is correct. But there’s another important element to this claim, which Pell didn’t mention in his TV interview: Pell only held the job from April 16, 2013 through Oct. 18, 2013, according to the education department. In other words, he was overseeing the budget for six months, at the most. If he had been there for a full year so he was implementing the bulk of his budget, we would rate his claim True. But he only actually administered a portion of that budget. That makes his claim technically accurate, but lacking an important mitigating factor. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

Rep. Leonidas Raptakis: R.I. murderers’ parole wait shortest in Northeast U.S.
","Rhode Island state Sen. Leonidas Raptakis, D-Coventry, wants to know: What is the meaning of life? At least when it comes to sentencing someone to prison. That’s because in Rhode Island, as in many other states, there are two types of life sentences. There is life without parole, which is levied after a special hearing held by the judge in the case after the initial trial. And there is a life sentence that allows inmates to seek parole after serving a certain number of years, depending on the crime. Raptakis is pressing for a bill in the current General Assembly session that would make inmates who are serving a life sentence for first-degree murder wait 30 years before being eligible for parole, instead of the current 20. At the Feb. 11 news conference where he unveiled his proposed legislation, Raptakis argued that Rhode Island’s 20-year wait is lenient compared with other Northeastern states -- the ""bottom of the barrel,"" he said. Later, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, he said Rhode Island was ""dead last"" among the states in the northeastern United States. So, are Rhode Island’s laws on parole eligibility guilty as charged? At his news conference, Raptakis handed out a map listing the first-degree murder penalties in 12 states, from Virginia to Maine, and the District of Columbia. (Technically, not all of the states he mentioned are considered Northeastern by the Census Bureau, although they are included in other definitions of the region.) Raptakis said he got his information from Wikipedia. To check, we went to the websites of each of the 12 states and the District of Columbia and read their criminal statutes for life sentences for first-degree murder. Only Rhode Island and Virginia allowed first-degree murderers to seek parole after 20 years. In Connecticut, Maine and New York, they become eligible after 25 years. In New Jersey and the District of Columbia, they are eligible after 30 years, in Vermont after 35. In five other states -- Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Hampshire -- first-degree murderers are not eligible for parole. Our ruling State Sen. Leonidas Raptakis said Rhode Island is ""almost dead last"" among Northeastern states in the amount of time first-degree murderers must serve before they are eligible for parole. When we examined the statutes in each of the states he cited, we found that all except Virginia have stricter sentencing requirements than Rhode Island. We rule his claim True.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin strikes out on marijuana research claim
","Though a majority of states have legalized some form of marijuana use, it remains a Schedule 1 drug at the federal level. 
That means under federal law marijuana has ""no currently accepted medical use"" and a high potential for abuse. But U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., asserts the label comes with even more restrictions. Addressing her desire to make marijuana more available for American veterans, Baldwin said she is frustrated that marijuana remains a Schedule 1 drug, ""which is considered a drug with no beneficial characteristics at all, and therefore should not be researched or prescribed."" She said research is a key reason she wants to see marijuana removed from Schedule 1. ""So we lost, since that scheduling occurred, more than a generation of possible research to see safety, efficacy, etc.,"" Baldwin said in a Sept. 14, 2018, interview on ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a Milwaukee-based liberal radio talk show. ""So, (the) No. 1 outrage to me is that we don’t have the body of research in this country — the leading research-funding nation in the world — that would give answers to things we kind of ponder about."" We gave Baldwin a Mostly False rating for another marijuana claim from that interview -- that medical providers with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are ""censored"" from talking with veterans about marijuana. Let’s see how this claim fares. What does Schedule 1 mean? Schedule 1 is the highest, most restrictive rating given to drugs in the federal code. Marijuana is joined on that list by heroin, ecstasy, LSD and opioid painkillers, among many others. The designation complicates matters for federal agencies such as the VA, which is limited by federal guidelines that conflict with state laws. Thirty-three states have now approved medical marijuana, and 10 of those allow recreational use as well, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Baldwin’s staff did not respond to inquiries seeking evidence for her claim that the Schedule 1 designation means marijuana ""should not be researched."" In fact, there are hundreds of current research studies involving marijuana, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. ""One of the biggest misconceptions is that Schedule I status of a drug makes it impossible for research.  This is simply not true,"" said Wade Sparks, a DEA spokesman. ""Schedule I research is absolutely permitted with a proper registration."" Aspiring researchers must get their research protocol approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, then apply for a DEA permit to handle, store and research marijuana or any other Schedule 1 drug. Sparks said security is typically a key hurdle, since the DEA must ensure research protocol is followed and drugs are properly secured. ""Every researcher who has put forth a valid research proposal has received permission to study marijuana,"" Sparks said. Researchers must also work with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which contracts with the University of Mississippi to grow marijuana for research — the only legal research source of marijuana in the country. And there are U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements for research that is related to the development of new drugs. There are currently 449 researchers registered with the DEA to study marijuana, and 249 registered for research of other Schedule 1 drugs, Sparks said. Indeed, much of that research is funded by the federal government. The National Institutes of Health approved about $269 million for hundreds of marijuana-related research projects in 2018. That includes projects focused on therapeutic properties of marijuana, including cannabidiol, which has potential medical benefits but doesn’t cause users to get high. ""In the last few years with the growth of information — both popular information and scientific information — on possible medical marijuana efficacy, there have been more studies approved by the federal government and funded by the federal government"" on the potential therapeutic benefits of the drug, said Igor Grant, director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California-San Diego. ""The climate is changing."" Our rating Making the case to remove marijuana from Schedule 1 status, Baldwin said that standing means marijuana ""should not be researched."" She said a ""generation"" of possible research has been lost as a result. Schedule 1 status does add additional hurdles for researchers, including approval from the DEA. But research is allowed and does happen — to the tune of more than 400 studies nationwide. So the statement has an element of truth but otherwise misses the mark. Our rating for that is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976FA240>],/factchecks/2018/nov/21/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-tammy-baldwin-strikes-out-marijuana-researc/

I highly respect my colleague from Arkansas but everything in his tweet and this thread is 100% Fake News. 1/ https://t.co/fFeHMxLpBf   With three senators mixing it up on Twitter, we decided it was time for PolitiFact to step in. Was Cotton correct that the criminal justice bill has had ""no hearings""? We found some significant shortcomings in Cotton’s argument. The specific bill under consideration in the Senate is the First Step Act. It was introduced on Nov. 15 by Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The bill seeks to reduce mandatory sentencing. The current version includes additional anti-recidivism funding, an expansion of early-release credits, a lowering of mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, and bans on shackling pregnant inmates and solitary confinement for juvenile offenders. The Nov. 15 version is based on a bill passed by the House on May 22. Some aspects of a separate bill were included in the Nov. 15 version -- a bill approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Grassley chairs, on Feb. 15. That bill, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, covers similar topics as the House bill. The current version of the bill was only released a day or two before the dispute erupted on Twitter. But for Cotton to say there have been no hearings is substantially misleading. For starters, the underlying House bill received a markup -- a type of hearing that concludes in a vote to advance or hold back the bill -- on May 9, 2018. The bill, as amended by the committee at the markup, advanced on a 25-5 vote. Then, on May 22, the bill went to the House floor under a ""suspension of the rules."" This means that it would receive a vote following more-limited-than-usual debate, with two-thirds of the vote required for passage. After 40 minutes of floor debate, a vote was held. The measure exceeded the two-thirds margin, winning passage, 360-59. As for the Senate bill that was folded into the House version, it was considered in a markup by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 15, 2018. The committee advanced the measure by a 16-5 vote. Moreover, it’s not as if the substance of these bills emerged from nowhere. ""Both the House and Senate have considered and debated criminal justice reform for more than five years,"" said Conn Carroll, communications director for Lee. ""There’s nothing novel or surprising in this legislation, and the robust debate on the bill shows that everyone understands how it’s supposed to work."" For instance, a House Judiciary Committee task force held a hearing on criminal sentencing in 2014, and the Senate Judiciary Committee held a similar hearing in 2015 on a previous version of the bill. In releasing the bill on Nov. 15, Grassley said that ""many of us on this committee have worked closely together for several years on this issue to reduce crime and improve fairness in sentencing."" James Arnold, a spokesman for Cotton, said a markup is not a substitute for a hearing, particularly for a bill that he called ""the largest change to the federal criminal system in years, perhaps decades."" ""A hearing is a forum in which the committee gathers testimony, information, and opinions from experts on a proposed bill, while a markup is a process where committees debate and rewrite the legislation to correct the errors identified in the hearing,"" Arnold said. ""Even if a markup was a hearing, there has been no markup on the substantially different version of the FIRST STEP Act that was introduced late the Friday before Thanksgiving."" Carroll, the aide to Lee, countered, ""There have been very minor changes to the House bill and only select sentencing-related elements of the (existing Senate bill) have been added."" Something else Cotton sidestepped: The path of the criminal justice bill is standard operating procedure for how bills work in Congress. Experts said it is common for bills to wend their way slowly toward consideration on the floor. There is not generally a final ""hearing"" once the final language in a bill is hammered out -- but there is floor debate, which would still happen if the criminal justice bill is brought up. ""Few important measures proceed to passage on the Senate floor without long debate and consideration of amendments,"" said Steve Smith, a Senate specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. In many cases, he said, a final bill may include pieces of several different bills that individually had hearings at various committees.  ""Moreover, bills are mere receptacles for legislative provisions, so even hearings on a specific bill number is not a very meaningful indicator that relevant hearings were held."" Gregory Koger, a Senate specialist at the University of Miami, agreed. ""It is not common to hold a new hearing every time the text of a bill changes, and it is extremely common for bills to be modified between the committee and House or Senate floor as a broader range of legislators weigh in,"" Koger said. ""Holding hearings in every such case would be a waste of time, as the debate on the floor prior to passage provides the ultimate ‘hearing.’"" Cotton said that ""there have been no hearings"" on a criminal justice bill being considered in the Senate. Cotton’s point is misleading. He ignored years of congressional debate and hearings on the general topics of the bill, as well as the consideration and bipartisan passage of largely similar bills at the House committee level, by the full House, and by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Multiple hearings were held on earlier versions of the current bill in previous congresses. In addition, the bill which would undergo floor debate if it were to be cleared for a vote. We rate the statement Mostly False. UPDATED, Nov. 21, 2018, 10 a.m.: This story has been updated to include a comment from Cotton's office. The rating remains the same.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C15F280>],/factchecks/2018/nov/20/tom-cotton/were-there-no-hearings-bipartisan-criminal-justice/

Blog questions handling of Fulton County ballots in Georgia governor's race
","Stacey Abrams on Nov. 16 ended her bid to become governor of Georgia after a week and a half of counting votes. It was a tight race to the end between Abrams, a Democrat, and Brian Kemp, a Republican who resigned as Georgia’s Secretary of State only after the election. Despite the narrow voting margins, one thing was clear early on: The Democrat easily won Fulton County with more than 72 percent of the votes. But on Nov. 11, a story that appeared in Big League Politics reported that ""a vast amount of provisional ballots submitted in the Democrat stronghold were rejected for being duplicate ballots."" Fulton County includes the city of Atlanta, which serves as the county seat. ""Bombshell"" the headline says. ""Fulton County numbers show massive duplicate ballots, rejected ballots, non-citizens trying to vote."" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Big League Politics, a website founded by Breitbart alum, did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the story.   Out of the ballots cast, were massive numbers of them duplicates, rejects or plain illegal? No. According to the Georgia Secretary of State’s official election results, 425,139 people voted in Fulton County. That’s about 60 percent of all 703,177 registered voters there. That means that less than half of one percent of all ballots were rejected.     Of 3,549 provisional ballots the county received, 1,994 were accepted and 1,555 were rejected. Ballots were rejected because 581 voters weren’t registered, 972 were voting in the wrong county and two weren’t citizens. The number of noncitizens who cast a ballot—two—represents about 0.0005 percent of the vote. Embedded in the story is what appears to be a Nov. 8 ""provisional ballot recap notice"" from the Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections. The notice reports that of the 3,722 provisional ballots it received, 355 were accepted, 1,811 were duplicates, 1,556 were rejected. The reasons for rejecting the ballots, according to the notice, included three cases of ""not a citizen,"" 581 ""not registered,"" and 972 ""out of county."" A spokeswoman for Fulton County sent PolitiFact slightly different numbers on Nov. 15. Of 3,549 provisional ballots the county received, 1,994 were accepted and 1,555 were rejected. Ballots were rejected because 581 voters weren’t registered, 972 were voting in the wrong county and two weren’t citizens. The county did not respond to a request for a final count of the provisional ballots accepted and rejected. Is this a bombshell? No.  First, let’s look at what provisional ballots are. They’re designed to ensure that voters aren’t excluded from the voting process due to an administrative error. If a voter’s eligibility is unclear—if their name isn’t on the voter rolls or they don’t have the required ID, for example—election officials must offer them a provisional ballot instead of a regular one. Officials later determine whether the voter was eligible to vote and whether that ballot should be counted. How the provisional ballots were handled in Georgia alarmed Democrats. Abrams sued to stop counties from tossing out some absentee and provisional ballots, and her campaign asked that officials count provisional ballots of voters who have moved but whose voter registration records still reflect their former addresses, according to the Post. How states deal with provisional ballots—and the number that are issued and rejected—varies greatly, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. On Nov. 13, a federal judge ruled that Georgia must take steps to ensure provisional ballots aren’t improperly rejected, the Associated Press reported. Next, let’s look at the duplicate ballots. Election officials in Georgia can create duplicate ballots if, for example, the ballot is torn, bent or otherwise defective and can’t be processed by the tabulating machine. If a voter selects more than one person for the same office, officials must only omit that invalid vote and can create a duplicate ballot that excludes it.   In the case of Fulton County, ""duplicate ballots"" are provisional ballots that were cast by voters voting in a precinct that is not their assigned registered precinct. ""They are called duplicates because we have to duplicate the assigned registered precinct’s ballot to record their vote correctly,"" spokeswoman April Majors said in an email to PolitiFact. While it’s true that Fulton County did have some rejected and duplicated ballots—and a few cases of non-citizens trying to vote, according to reports—this story suggests something nefarious in the gubernatorial election. Without context, describing ""massive duplicate ballots"" wrongly suggests Fulton County was the site of voter fraud. The headline also misleads readers to believe that a huge number of voters were non-citizens. The county found that was the case in only two instances. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2084C0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/20/blog-posting/blog-questions-handling-fulton-county-ballots-geor/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Public Health', 'Wisconsin', 'Gwen Moore']","
U.S. Rep Gwen Moore correctly says that fewer are insured after Medicaid expansion turned down
","Outgoing Republican Gov. Scott Walker has drawn repeated fire from Democrats for turning down a Medicaid expansion in 2014. With Democrat Tony Evers poised to take over the governor’s mansion, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore said in a Nov. 8, 2018 interview that she expects Wisconsin will now take those federal dollars. And she expanded on a common claim about the cost of Walker’s decision. ""We have lost over $1 billion in not taking the Medicaid expansion money, only to insure fewer people,"" Moore said in an the interview on Milwaukee’s WTMJ-TV (Channel 4). So the Milwaukee Democrat says the decision not only cost Wisconsin $1 billion, but it resulted in fewer people being insured. We’ll dig into both points. Walker declined $1 billion in federal funds We checked a similar $1 billion claim in June, when then-gubernatorial candidate Dana Wachs said Walker ""has turned down $1 billion of Medicaid money."" We rated that Mostly True. That item examined an April 2017 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which detailed the federal funds Wisconsin could have received if the state did a full Medicaid expansion in April 2014. Under that expansion, anyone earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level would have been eligible for Medicaid. Wisconsin would have gained enough additional federal funding to reduce state spending an estimated $1.07 billion on Medicaid from 2014 to 2019, according to the fiscal bureau memo. But since that period has not yet ended, the state has not yet missed out on the full $1 billion. With seven months remaining in the 2018-’19 fiscal year, about $114 million of that has not yet been ""lost,"" said Jon Dyck, supervising analyst at the fiscal bureau. He noted, though, that it’s not really possible  to ""un-lose"" that money at this point since the state would be unlikely to reverse that policy by the end of the fiscal year. Walker, who has criticized the full expansion as essentially a new form of welfare, did institute a partial Medicaid expansion, so for the first time everyone in Wisconsin living below the federal poverty level was eligible for Medicaid. (As an aside, we should note the Medicaid coverage limit in various publications is reported as 133 percent or 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The official limit is 133 percent, but there is a 5 percent ""disregard,"" which means the functional limit is 138 percent, so that is how we’re referring to it.) Medicaid move decreased number of people covered The second part of Moore’s claim is that the decision to pass on the full Medicaid expansion caused the state ""to insure fewer people."" The Wisconsin Department of Health Services found nearly 63,000 adults lost their coverage that year through BadgerCare Plus, which administers Medicaid in Wisconsin. The agency attempted to track the insurance status of those adults and could establish that 58 percent of them obtained other insurance coverage or regained BadgerCare coverage. Most of the rest — about 26,000 — were presumed to be uninsured. The state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau has also analyzed the impact a change would have today. If Wisconsin accepted the Medicaid expansion now — increasing the allowable threshold in the state from 100 percent of the federal poverty level to 138 percent — the number of childless adults and parents enrolled in BadgerCare would grow an estimated 25 percent, or by about 70,000 people, the agency said. Dyck said it’s reasonable to assume a good number of those new enrollees would be moving from uninsured to BadgerCare, given the number of people near poverty who are uninsured. The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2017 American Community Survey estimated 38,000 people are uninsured in Wisconsin and have an income between 100 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Those are the people not currently covered by BadgerCare that would be covered if Wisconsin accepted the Medicaid expansion. Our rating Moore said Wisconsin has ""lost"" over $1 billion from Walker’s decision to turn down the full Medicaid expansion and that Wisconsin is insuring fewer people as a result. That figure is based on an estimate that runs through 2019, so the actual funds missed have not yet topped $1 billion, though they’re not far off. And it’s not quite right to say Wisconsin ""lost"" the money — it just spent that much more due to not receiving federal funds. Meanwhile, a state study confirmed that fewer people were being insured after the 2014 decision. And to add additional support, it’s clear more people would be covered if Governor-elect Evers were to accept a Medicaid expansion in the future. We rate Moore’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097194380>],/factchecks/2018/nov/20/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-correctly-says-fewer-are-insured/

No evidence Broward inmates got absentee ballots after election
","On Nov. 6, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment restoring the right to vote to 1.4 million people with felony convictions.

Rep. Jason Smith not far off on small business job creation
","Many politicians portray themselves as pro-small business, including U.S. Rep. Jason Smith, a Republican, who was recently re-elected to represent Missouri’s 8th District. In a Nov. 9 Twitter post, after receiving an award from the National Federation of Independent Business, Smith said that ""in fact 7 out of 10 new jobs in America are created by small businesses."" PolitiFact Missouri verified a similar statement by Sen. Claire McCaskill in 2017, except she claimed that it was two out of three new jobs. So how did Smith come up with a different statistic? For background, a small business, as defined by the government, is a business that employs fewer than 500 people. As of 2013, according to the Small Business Administration, there were 28.8 million U.S. small businesses. As of how many jobs small businesses created, the past fact-check cited a Small Business Administration article saying ""small businesses provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s."" That’s a bit lower than what Smith cited. To understand where that ""seven out of 10"" statistic came from, we reached out to Smith’s office for evidence. Joey Brown, his communications director, pointed to two files from the Small Business Administration. Those two cited close to a 66 percent net new job creation. After all the searching, we went straight to the source itself for the most recent data – the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes annual gross job gains and losses based on firm size. It measures firm size in two ways: base size (the size of a business at the start of a year) and average size (the average between the sizes at the beginning and end of the year). The reason for this split is that the size of a business or firm isn’t static, said BLS economist Sadeghi Akbar. ""If a business grows from five to 100 employees in a year, what size do you take?"" he said. ""A lot of research has shown that average sizing is the least biased when assigning size to a company."" Therefore, using the average-sizing data, we calculated how many net new jobs small businesses have created from 1994 to 2017 compared to big businesses. The result: around two out of every three. That’s for net new job gains, which takes into account gains as well as job losses. When we calculated using only job gains and ignored any job losses since 1994, the number came to around 70 percent — closer to what Smith said. Even from calculating with data from just 2017, it was also around 70 percent of all new jobs. The percent of new jobs created by small businesses should not be confused with the percent of people employed by small businesses. Smith said that seven out of 10 new jobs are due to small businesses. Based on our calculations, he is correct for job gains. Factoring in job losses, as is standard with most economic measurements, would put the statistic closer to two out of every three new jobs. That’s pretty close, though — the difference between 66 percent and 70 percent. We rate this statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809721CF00>],/factchecks/2018/nov/19/jason-smith/rep-jason-smith-not-far-small-business-job-creatio/

Vallas’ sticky attack on Mendoza’s city sticker record
","Little more than a week after handily winning reelection as the state’s chief financial officer, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza announced her campaign for Chicago mayor. That long-anticipated announcement was met with a flurry of attacks from potential opponents in the mayoral race, including former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas. He criticized Mendoza for touting her opposition to a vehicle sticker price increase in 2011 during her time as Chicago’s city clerk as part of her campaign launch. ""Susana Mendoza’s assertion that she fought Rahm Emanuel’s efforts to drastically raise city sticker prices is absurd,"" Vallas said in a statement sent out by his campaign. ""As news stories earlier this year by WBEZ and ProPublica painfully show, Mendoza pushed a draconian city sticker penalty program that led to the financial ruin of thousands of Chicago’s neediest families."" His press release linked to a July story from ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ in which Mendoza expressed regret for backing an increase in the cost of city sticker violations, a policy that ProPublica and WBEZ revealed had exacted a painful financial toll on thousands of Chicago's poorest residents, in particular African-Americans. But just as clearly documented is Mendoza’s outspoken opposition to the sticker price increase Emanuel proposed in his first budget as mayor. It sounded like Vallas was conflating these two pieces of the sticker policy puzzle. So we asked for clarification. ""I think it’s a pretty clear statement,"" Vallas said in a phone interview. ""I define what I meant and what I meant was, these draconian fines are bankrupting families. … I gave the specific example of what Mendoza did that was so egregious and what the impact was."" A Vallas spokesman followed up several hours later to explain the statement his candidate had characterized as ""pretty clear"" needed some clarification. ""There was inadvertently a word change,"" spokesman John Holden said, explaining the original draft had called absurd Mendoza’s assertion that she fought Emanuel over sticker policy rather than sticker prices specifically. That was not, however, a distinction Vallas attempted to draw when he discussed the matter with PolitiFact. Holden, while acknowledging a lack of clarity in the initial statement put out in Vallas’ name, said the campaign did not plan to issue a correction. Still, it’s worth noting that while Vallas’ public statement attempts to cherry-pick the part of Mendoza’s city sticker record that casts her in the worst light, Mendoza did some cherry-picking of her own when referencing the sticker issue in her campaign launch announcement. Back in 2011, Emanuel prevailed in hiking sticker prices, although he reworked his plan in response to Mendoza’s criticism, opting to spread out a lower increase among all drivers rather than dramatically hiking rates on larger passenger vehicles alone. The city also adopted the kind of increased ticket penalties for sticker scofflaws that Mendoza had pitched as an alternative to an increase in sticker prices. Citations for failing to have a required vehicle sticker jumped from $120 to $200. In the announcement that Vallas ridiculed, Mendoza highlighted only her opposition to higher sticker prices while not mentioning the corresponding increase in violation penalties she backed. ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ found that debt from sticker tickets soared, compounded by late penalties and collection fees, with drivers collectively racking up $275 million in dollars owed to the city for tickets issued since 2012. We reached out to Mendoza’s campaign to hear how she reconciled her actions on city sticker policy. Spokeswoman Rebecca Evans sent us a response that included a statement from the candidate. ""I said long before I announced my candidacy that the city should revisit these penalties and how they are enforced, which overburdens our city’s low-income residents,"" Mendoza said. ""As mayor I plan to do so."" Evans elaborated by calling the comparison between the two issues a ""false equivalency,"" writing that Mendoza’s efforts to halt the sticker price increase and how the city’s Department of Revenue has enforced sticker penalties are separate issues. Vallas said, ""Mendoza’s assertion that she fought Rahm Emanuel’s efforts to drastically raise city sticker prices is absurd … Mendoza pushed a draconian city sticker penalty program."" Vallas is correct that Mendoza backed hiking tickets for violating city sticker requirements during her time as city clerk, a policy that has financially burdened thousands of low-income Chicagoans. But he’s off base in calling into question Mendoza’s well-documented opposition to Emanuel’s sticker price increase.

"['Congress', 'Women', 'New York', 'Kirsten Gillibrand']","
Do women do better in Congress than men?
","Days after she won re-election, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand embarked on a media tour to promote her new children’s book about the fight for women’s suffrage. She has said she will think about running for president. In an interview on Good Morning America, Gillibrand, Democrat from New York, talked about how thrilled she is that more women are getting involved in politics, by voting and running for office. ""Studies even show that when women go to Congress they get more things done - more bipartisan effort, more bills passed,"" she said. Given women’s recent gains in Congress, we’re curious: Is she right? The research is mixed. Same stalemate  The narrative that ""women in Congress are more likely than men to collaborate, solve problems, and get the nation’s business done,"" isn’t true, wrote two political scientists. ""We tested the premise in four ways, and we came up with no evidence for it whatsoever, no matter where we looked,"" Jennifer L. Lawless and Sean M. Theriault wrote in an article summarizing their longer journal article. Three political scientists -- Lawless of  the University of Virginia, Theriault of the University of Texas and Samantha Guthrie of American University -- studied how members of Congress acted in four ways: travel to research foreign policy, co-sponsor bills, cast procedural votes and offer amendments. In each area, the women in Congress did not have more bipartisan tendencies and they did not demonstrate a greater willingness to collaborate. Using the data from Lugar Center’s Bipartisan Index, which rates senators on their support of legislation across party lines, the authors found that Democratic women and men are ""statistically indistinguishable"" from one another, as are their Republican colleagues. ""To be sure, women’s presence in Congress promotes democratic legitimacy, but it does little to reduce gridlock and stalemate on Capitol Hill,"" according to their Journal of Politics article in October. More bills and co-sponsors Another study, however, found that women senators gained more bipartisan co-sponsors for their bills and passed more bills over a seven-year period. The study, published by Quorum, a Washington, D.C.-based technology company, showed that in the House, women secured co-sponsors for their bills from both parties at a higher rate than men, though they did not pass more bills than men. We contacted Gillibrand’s office for evidence of her claim and a spokeswoman pointed us to a Washington Post article from March about a new book on how women politicians face greater hurdles to getting elected, and therefore work harder once they are in office. Authors Jeffrey Lazarus and Amy Steigerwalt, political scientists at Georgia State University, told the Post that their ""book is consistent with a host of other research that emphasizes that female legislators are generally more effective than men. They are better at getting their bills passed, and work in a more consensual manner.""   Women secure more discretionary spending for their constituents and introduce more bills, according to Lazarus and Steigerwalt’s book, Gendered Vulnerability: How Women Work Harder to Stay in Office. It also cites other research that supports the idea that women are more bipartisan than men. Political science professors Craig Volden, Alan E. Wiseman and Dana E. Wittmer wrote in the American Journal of Political Science that women in the minority party in the House of Representatives  ""continue to strive to build coalitions and bring about new policies,"" unlike men in the minority party. The authors, however, also found that ""majority party women have become less effective as Congress has become more polarized.""     The same authors wrote in 2010, that ""our main findings suggest that high effort, consensus building, and issue specialization help female lawmakers achieve increased legislative effectiveness, but only under certain circumstances.""   Gillibrand’s office also cited an analysis in Vox, which highlighted several studies of women’s increased productivity as legislators relative to men. One oft-cited study, ""The Jackie (and Jill) Robinson Effect: Why Do Congresswomen Outperform Congressmen?"" found women secured more discretionary spending for their districts and sponsored and co-sponsored more bills than men. Yet another study, published in 2016, found that in the House between 1990 and 2010, Republican women had more success securing bipartisan sponsors for bills than men, while Democratic women secured fewer bipartisan sponsors for their bills than men.   ""We interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest, rather than gender per se,"" wrote Stefano Gagliarducci and M. Daniele Paserman. Gillibrand said studies show that when women are elected to Congress, they get more things done, are more bipartisan and pass more bills. Studies show women sponsor more bills, secure more discretionary spending for their constituents, and under certain circumstances, reach across the aisle more. In the Senate, women have been more successful than men at passing bills. Studies also show that when women are elected, they work harder than their male colleagues. Other research, however, shows women are not more bipartisan than men and that women’s effectiveness relative to men’s effectiveness varies under different conditions. We rate Gillibrand’s claim Mostly True.   If Gillibrand hadn’t qualified her statement with ""studies show,"" and instead had made an outright claim about women’s performance in Congress, we likely would have reached a different ruling.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C5B400>],/factchecks/2018/nov/16/kirsten-gillibrand/gilibrand-champions-women-legislators/

Bernie Sanders digs up old figure in fresh attack on Walmart’s wages
","Fresh off a successful bid to get Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour, Sen. Bernie Sanders turned his sights on Walmart this week. ""While Walmart claims it cannot afford to pay its workers $15 an hour, it was able to find enough money to pay its CEO more than $22 million last year,"" Sanders tweeted. Sanders unveiled the Stop WALMART Act on Nov. 15 to ""put an end to their outrageous greed."" The bill would bar companies from buying back stock unless they adopt the $15 an hour wage and allow workers to earn seven days of paid sick leave per year. It also would limit executive pay to no more than 150 times median employee pay. ""The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion,"" Sanders said in a series of tweets directed at Walmart. ""Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year."" There was one stat in particular that caught our attention: Are U.S. taxpayers really subsidizing Walmart’s workforce at a cost of $6.2 billion a year? Given the total tax revenue collected by Sanders’ home state of Vermont was $5.9 billion last year, this would be a pretty staggering figure. We decided to dig in. We asked the Sanders camp for leads on where the figure came from and didn’t hear back. But we’re pretty confident we found the source. The $6.2 billion figure first appeared in a report from the advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness that came out on tax day in 2014. ""Walmart receives an estimated $6.2 billion annually in mostly federal taxpayer subsidies,"" the report said. ""The reason: Walmart pays its employees so little that many of them rely on food stamps, health care and other taxpayer-funded programs."" A Google search indicates that the figure made dozens of headlines when the report was released, and continues to be cited in articles on Walmart -- it showed up in a story last year on The Intercept, for example. So how did Americans for Tax Fairness come up with the figure? The group relied on data from a report released by the Democratic staff of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce in May 2013. For that report researchers used Wisconsin Medicaid enrollment data from 2012 ""because it appears to be the most recent and comprehensive."" Walmart was found to have more employees on Medicaid -- 3,216 -- than any other employer in the state. From there, the Democratic staffers assumed that Walmart employees enrolled in Wisconsin's BadgerCare+ Medicaid program were also enrolled in other federal benefits programs, such as subsidized housing, food stamps, home energy assistance and child care subsidies. Taking all these costs together, the researchers estimate that a single Walmart supercenter with 300 employees costs $904,542 per year – about $3,015 per employee. Then they ran the numbers again factoring in some employees who aren’t enrolled in BadgerCare+, but could be, which upped the figure to $1,744,590 per year – about $5,815 per employee. Americans for Tax Fairness then took the midpoint of these figures, $4,415, and multiplied it by Walmart’s estimated 1.4 million person workforce at the time. 1,400,000 x $4,415 = $6,181,000,000 So there it is. About $6.2 billion (not ""at least,"" as Sanders tweeted). But the figure has been controversial since its inception. The House Committee report includes a qualifier about the difficulty of trying to extrapolate the Wisconsin data across the country. Wisconsin has lower poverty levels than many other states, it notes. And, Wisconsin makes it easier than many other states to enroll in Medicaid. ""Because of varying program eligibility requirements across states, extrapolating taxpayer costs for Wal-Mart stores in other states based on the Wisconsin data is difficult,"" the report says. In his tweet, Sanders also referred to ""middle class taxpayers"" footing the bill. The House Committee and Americans for Tax Fairness reports encompass everyone who helps pay for public benefits programs -- not just the middle class.   In 2014, when the numbers were fairly fresh, MSNBC host Ed Schultz got a Mostly False from PolitiFact for citing the $5,800 in assistance per employee figure, which came from the same reports.   Four years later, the figures are even more tenuous. Walmart’s workforce has increased to about 1.5 million employees and the company has raised wages significantly. The Democratic staffers cited an average $8.81 hourly wage for Walmart sales associates in the 2013 report. Walmart announced in January this year that it would raise its base wage to $11 an hour. And then there's cost of living increases.  So maybe these forces cancel out. But who knows? Dennis Bailey, communications director for Americans for Tax Fairness, said the group stands by the accuracy of it’s research, but hasn’t revisited the figures since Walmart increased wages. Bailey added that critics of the group’s research hadn’t come forward with any data to refute their figures. ""You take a small sample and extrapolate -- that's done all the time in a data world. There isn’t any reason to think that doing it in a different state would give different results,"" he said.   Walmart isn’t much help. Company reps have previously rejected the figures in the Americans for Tax Fairness report, but have not provided alternate data. Justin Rushing, head of corporate communications for Walmart, said in an email Friday he had no comment on the veracity of the $6.2 billion figure. He pointed to a 2005 report from Jason Furman, then chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, about Walmart’s low wages and who benefitted from America’s expanded social safety net. ""The bulk of the benefits of these expansions go to the workers that receive them, not to the corporations that employ them,"" says an abstract of Furman's report.   Sanders said, ""Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year."" Sanders is using old numbers that appear to be suspect from the beginning. But there's no updated research that we could find.  There is an element of truth in that some Walmart employees offset their wages with public assistance programs. And given the size of Walmart’s workforce it could very well add up to billions of dollars. Sanders also added a class element that wasn't in the initial research, claiming that the $6.2 billion in taxes came only from the ""middle class,"" which seems to be political flourish not grounded in facts. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3EBA80>],/factchecks/2018/nov/16/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-digs-old-figure-fresh-attack-walmar/

No evidence ‘many’ illegal immigrants voted in midterm elections, as Lou Dobbs said
","In the run-up to the midterm election, President Donald Trump and his allies in conservative media made exaggerated claims about an ""invasion"" of a roughly 3,500-person caravan of mainly-Honduran migrants headed for America’s southern border. With the election in the rearview mirror, the migrant caravan has mostly faded from the headlines. But a new concern over illegal immigrants and the midterms got play on Lou Dobbs’ Tonight, with the host claiming many non-citizen voters cast ballots in the race. ""We are watching, you know, millions of illegal immigrants cross our borders,"" Dobbs said, ""and many of them voting in the past election that's what, just a couple weeks ago."" Dobbs said illegal immigrants were having an ""immense impact."" He then went on to cite the potential consequences on the apportionment of congressional districts. We found no basis for the Fox Business Network host’s claim about undocumented people voting in the midterms. Allegations of undue influence over American elections have become fairly commonplace in the Trump era. Trump himself has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we’ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again. In the case of the 2018 midterms, we’ve found no evidence to back up Dobbs’ claim that many illegal immigrants voted. Fox News’ media contacts did not respond to our request for comment. ""There’s zero evidence of even dozens, let alone millions, of non citizens voting in this or any other election,"" said according to David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a non-profit focused on election integrity. Dobbs’ claim that ""we are watching millions of illegal immigrants cross our borders"" needs context. According to Department of Homeland Security figures, in fiscal year 2018 the U.S. Border Patrol caught 396,579 people crossing the southern border. A broader read of border crossings would also include department data on the number of foreign travelers to the United States who overstayed their visas, which was estimated at around 600,000 in fiscal year 2017. As we’ve noted in a previous fact-check, there’s an oft-cited study among those claiming illegal immigrants have an outsized influence on U.S. elections. The study purports to show ""14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens."" Many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error. The federal government recently brought charges against 19 foreign nationals who voted in the 2016 election in North Carolina, where a total of more than 4.7 million votes were cast. Experts said the Department of Justice under President George W. Bush, and Republican and Democratic election officials have investigated voter fraud extensively and found it is extremely rare. President Trump’s short-lived voter fraud commission couldn’t find any evidence of widespread fraud before being disbanded. As for Dobbs’ claim, we rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C55480>],/factchecks/2018/nov/16/lou-dobbs/no-evidence-many-illegal-immigrants-voted-midterm-/

Do you need an ID to buy a box of cereal, as Donald Trump said? Of course not
","  President Donald Trump set eyebrows aloft with an analogy he used to explain election procedures in a Nov. 14 interview with the Daily Caller. Specifically, he said you needed more detailed identification to buy a box of cereal than to cast a ballot. Here’s what Trump told the conservative news outlet: ""The Republicans don’t win, and that’s because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I’ve been saying for a long time. I have no doubt about it. And I’ve seen it, I’ve had friends talk about it when people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace what’s going on. ""The disgrace is that -- voter ID. If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, you have a voter ID. Well, over here, the only thing you don’t is if you’re a voter of the United States. A voter in the United States of America. I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on. Really a disgrace."" If this claim sounded ridiculous to you, it is. You don’t need an ID to buy a box of cereal, and in many states you do need an ID to vote. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) There’s an easy tip for anyone who doesn’t want to show an ID -- either a ""voter ID,"" as Trump put it, or just plain old driver’s license -- to purchase their Froot Loops. Use cash. Virtually any retailer will take it off your hands, no questions asked. Low on dollar bills? Simply use a credit card or a debit card. One 2017 estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that almost 76 percent of consumers had at least one credit card. And, according to another study by Total System Services, Inc., about 71 percent of consumers had one debit card. Combine these figures and the vast majority of consumers can pay for their sugar bombs with plastic. In many if not most cases, credit cards are verified electronically at the point of sale, with no need for a separate ID check. Neither the National Retail Federation nor the National Grocers Association -- a trade group for independent and privately held retail and wholesale grocers -- said they tracked the percentage of retail outlets who demand a photo ID on top of electronic confirmation for credit and debit purchases. However, there are only ""a couple of instances where identification is required, for example, the purchase of age restricted products,"" such as alcohol or cigarettes, Laura S. Strange, vice president of industry relations, communications and marketing with the National Grocers Association. In other words, you can feel pretty safe holstering that ID card if you’re just buying cereal. In the interview, Trump made it sound as if the election system is a wild west where anybody can vote as many times as they want without showing an ID. He’s wrong. Ten states have a ""strict"" voter identification law, meaning that voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after Election Day for it to be counted, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Of these, seven require a photo identification card; three accept certain forms of ID without photos. An additional 24 states have a ""non-strict"" voter ID law, meaning that at least some voters without acceptable identification have an option to cast a ballot that will be counted without further action on their part. Ten of these states specifically require a photo ID. That leaves only 16 states that do not require documentation at the polling place -- California, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia. Trump specifically mentioned one of those states, California, in his remarks to the Daily Caller. He also mentioned Florida and New Hampshire, which do require IDs at the polls. (We have previously rated Pants on Fire the claim, repeated by Trump to the Daily Caller, that Democrats bused in Massachusetts voters to New Hampshire to cast ballots there.) Trump said, ""If you buy, you know, a box of cereal, if you do anything, you have a voter ID. … The only thing you don’t is if you’re a voter of the United States."" Anyone can buy a box of cereal with cash, ID-free, and in most cases they could pay for it with a credit or debit card without having to flash an ID, either. Meanwhile, many voters across the country do have to show an ID at the polls, contrary to Trump’s suggestion. The statement is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C42BC0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/16/donald-trump/do-you-need-id-buy-box-cereal-no/

Sen. Ron Johnson's claim on migrants at the border is both a hit and a miss
","Editor’s note: This item was updated on Nov. 16, 2018, to note the range of estimates of caravan participants at the time of Sen. Ron Johnson’s claims. In recent weeks, there has been much attention focused on migrant caravans -- thousands of Central Americans traveling toward the United States border, in hopes of seeking political asylum. President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to deploy troops to prevent illegal entry by the migrants. The Pentagon has said more than 7,000 active-duty troops are being sent to the southern border, with more possible. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, supports the president’s action to secure the border. ""Every couple days we have a caravan size group of people apprehended trying to come into the country illegally, or coming to the ports of entry without documentation,"" Johnson said in a Nov. 1, 2018, interview on WTAQ’s ""John Muir Show"" in Green Bay. ""About 1,400 illegally, between the ports of entry, about 500 at ports of entry. That’s close to 2,000 a day. It’s overwhelming our system."" Is Johnson right? 
The background The migrants, mainly from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, say they joined the caravan to escape unemployment, poverty, gangs and violence in their homelands. They began traveling toward the border more than a month ago. Opponents have portrayed the caravans as a major threat; a tweet by Trump referred to it as an ""invasion."" Meanwhile, in a ""Myth vs. Facts"" statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says ""over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership."" When PolitiFact National asked the department how it identified those with criminal histories, an official said only that it was ""law enforcement sensitive."" How many people are in the caravans? According to the Associated Press, the government of the central Mexico city of Queretaro, said 6,531 migrants had moved through the state between Nov. 9, 2018,  and Nov. 10, 2018. It said that 5,771 of those departed the morning of Nov. 11, 2018, after staying in three shelters, the largest of which was a soccer stadium in the state capital. On Nov. 13, 2018, Reuters reported that about 400 migrants who broke away from the main caravan in Mexico City had already arrived in the border city of Tijuana. On Nov. 15, 2018, in Tijuana, the Desert Sun-USA TODAY NETWORK reported that clashes erupted between migrants and about 300 local residents who gathered to demand the migrants leave the upscale Playas de Tijuana neighborhood. Reports have estimated that there are more than 6,000 people in the caravans, perhaps even more than 6,500. At the time Johnson made his statement, estimates were generally lower -- typically in the range of 4,000 to 5,000. However, a United Nations estimate on Oct. 22, 2018, had put the figure at 7,200. The evidence When asked to provide backup for Johnson’s claim, the senator’s staff pointed us to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and its numbers on apprehensions. Statistics for October 2018 show: 50,975 people were apprehended between ports of entry at the southwest border. 9,770 people who presented themselves at ports of entry on the southwest border were deemed inadmissible.   Those statistics were released Nov. 9, 2018 -- more than a week after Johnson made his claim. The numbers that were available at the time Johnson spoke -- for September 2018 -- showed a smaller number apprehended between ports of entry -- 41,486 people. A similar number -- 9,082 -- were deemed inadmissible at ports of entry.

Let’s do the math: With 31 days in October, that means 1,644 people apprehended per day between ports of entry, and 315 people per day deemed inadmissable at the ports of entry. That equals 1,959 -- the 2,000 Johnson noted. With 30 days in September, that means 1,383 apprehended per day between ports of entry, and 303 deemed inadmissable to the ports of entry. That equals 1,686. ""With the size of the ‘caravan’ … 2,000 people per day would, over a couple of days, approximate that caravan figure,"" said Patrick McIlheran, Johnson’s senior communications and policy adviser. So, Johnson has a valid point about the number of people turned away, or apprehended but -- as is clear from the September and October numbers -- the figure can vary widely month to month. At the same time, in making his point, Johnson is doing some mixing of apples and oranges. That is, he is using numbers of illegal entries or inadmissable attempts as a comparison for people who say they want to apply for asylum, a legal process. What is asylum? Seeking asylum has three basic requirements. First, an applicant must establish that he or she fears persecution in their home country. Second, the applicant must prove that he or she would be persecuted on account of one of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or belonging to a particular social group. Third, an applicant must establish that the government is either involved in the persecution, or unable to control the conduct of private actors. Lindsay M. Harris, an assistant professor of law at the University of the District of Columbia and the vice chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association’s National Asylum and Refugee Committee, explained the challenges asylum seekers face in a June 2018 Washington Post essay: The first challenge for asylum seekers is just being able to apply. They must either be at the border or within the United States to claim protection — they cannot seek asylum from outside. Some enter the country with a tourist, study or work visa, but these are difficult to obtain. Others approach the U.S. border and ask for protection, or cross the border without permission and are detained by immigration officials before filing their asylum applications. Applying for asylum does not guarantee acceptance. Indeed, denials of asylum by immigration judges have been rising, according to the latest statistics. The total rate of asylum denials from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2016 was 49.8 percent, according to records kept by Syracuse University. At of the end of September 2016, asylum denial rates for that fiscal year were 57 percent. The study covering fiscal years 2011 to 2016 showed that some of the home countries of the caravan participants have very high denial rates. Mexico had a denial rate of 89.6 percent, while El Salvador had a denial rate of 82.9 percent and Honduras had a denial rate of 80.3 percent. That underscores the idea that most will not be allowed into the country via asylum. Our rating Johnson said, ""Every couple days we have a caravan size group of people apprehended trying to come into the country illegally, or coming to the ports of entry without documentation."" The numbers can vary month to month, and the estimates of those participating in the caravan have risen and fallen. So, Johnson has a point. But the larger issue is that, in making the comparison, Johnson is mixing numbers for illegal entries with caravan participants aiming at a legal process -- asylum. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E48C0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/16/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-just-misses-bulls-eye-migrants-bor/

Did median incomes hit a record level in 2017?
","Politicians often point to the success of America’s middle class as a barometer for the health of the broader American economy. On Sept. 29, the West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, ""Thanks to President Trump and Republican policies, middle-class income rose to a record level in 2017 as the strong economy lifted the fortunes of more Americans, the U.S. Census reported Wednesday! #WVGOP"" Thanks to President Trump and Republican policies middle-class income rose to a record level in 2017 as the strong economy lifted the fortunes of more Americans, the U.S. Census reported Wednesday! #WVGOP https://t.co/bNtp9GQn9i Is this accurate? We will give context for the party’s claim of credit for the Trump administration, but our fact-check is looking solely at the numbers. ""Middle class"" is a vague term that does not have a consistent definition. However, economists generally consider median income to be a reasonable yardstick for the ""middle class."" According to an annual study published by the U.S. Census Bureau in September 2018, the U.S. median income was $61,372 in 2017, a 1.8 percent increase from the previous year after adjusting for inflation. The new level of $61,372 represents a record high since the statistic has been recorded, although the inflation-adjusted figure has come close a few times in the past, census data shows. In 1999, for instance, inflation-adjusted median household income reached $60,062, and in 2007, shortly before the Great Recession, it reached $59,534.   Less certain is the assertion that the record median income level is ""thanks to President Trump."" As we have frequently noted, economists say that presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. ""I suppose President Trump could claim that the upward trend in per capita or median income between 2016 and 2017 was due the policies that his new administration adopted or pursued, in deregulation, taxation, immigration, and trade,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. However, he said, ""that is not terribly compelling, because incomes had been improving for several years before Mr. Trump took office."" Indeed, between the beginning of the post-Great Recession recovery in 2010 and 2016 -- a period when President Barack Obama was exclusively in office -- inflation-adjusted median income rose by about 9 percent. Taking into account the longer period of time, that’s a little slower than 1.8 percent annual increase under Trump, but it’s not dramatically different. So the bump in median income under Trump is largely similar to the trajectory under Obama, rather than representing a major turnaround. That undercuts the argument for crediting Trump exclusively. The West Virginia Republican Party said that ""middle-class income rose to a record level in 2017 as the strong economy lifted the fortunes of more Americans."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, median household income did rise to a record high in 2017 of $61,372. The party is on far less certain ground when it credits Trump, who, like any president, deserves some -- but hardly all -- credit for the economy’s performance on his watch.

Have more died from opioids in two years than in Vietnam War?
","During his unsuccessful run to represent West Virginia’s 3rd Congressional District, Richard Ojeda made curbing opioid abuse one of the centerpieces of his campaign. Speaking about opioids in remarks in a video uploaded to his Facebook page, Ojeda said, ""We have lost more lives in the last two years -- 60,000 two years ago and we're already passing this year -- than all of the lives lost during the Vietnam War,"" he said on Oct. 24. Did Ojeda -- a Democrat who has since announced his interest in running for president -- get his statistics right? We did not hear back from Ojeda’s campaign, but we located the data to answer this question. Politifact has previously placed the number of U.S. service members who were killed in the Vietnam War at 58,220. The most precise statistic we could find is for the number of opioid deaths, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined as deaths from opioid analgesics, heroin or illicit synthetic opioids. The data does not cover 2018, so we took ""the last two years"" to mean the last two years for which data is available, which are 2016 and 2017. In 2016, the CDC found that 42,249 Americans died from opioid overdoses. In 2017, according to preliminary CDC figures released in August 2018, the number of overdose deaths from opioids rose to 49,068. Combined, the number of opioid overdose deaths in 2016 and 2017 was 91,317 -- well beyond the number of U.S. deaths in the Vietnam War. Ojeda’s reference to 60,000 deaths two years ago appears to involve a broader statistic -- the number of overdose deaths for all drugs, not just opioids. The number of deaths in this category for 2016 and 2017 was 63,632 and 72,306, respectively. Using this broader statistic, Ojeda would still be correct: The number of overdoses from all drugs totaled 135,938 over those two years, far higher than the number of service member deaths in Vietnam. Ojeda said, ""We have lost more lives in the last two years"" due to opioids ""than all of the lives lost during the Vietnam War."" More than 90,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016 and 2017 combined, and more than 135,000 died from all drug overdoses in those two years. Both are higher than the 58,220 U.S. service member deaths in Vietnam.

Do Californians want out of sanctuary cities? Mostly not
","President Donald Trump sought to make immigration the centerpiece of the closing days of the 2018 midterm elections. One of his biggest targets was sanctuary cities -- a somewhat fuzzy term that refers to localities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. We previously rated Pants on Fire a statement by Trump at a campaign rally. He said that in California, ""they're rioting now"" over sanctuary cities. Officials said there was zero evidence for that claim. But are Californians unhappy about sanctuary cities, short of actually rioting over them? Trump had made that claim at a rally in Wheeling, W.Va., on Sept. 29. ""If you want to secure our border, if you want to stop sanctuary cities, which even in California now, they don’t want to be sanctuary cities anymore,"" Trump said. ""They want out. You see it. They’re rebelling! In California of all places they’re rebelling."" We found that Californians’ views on sanctuary cities present a more complicated picture. California became a so-called sanctuary state in October 2017 when Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law that limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal authorities on immigration holds. On the one hand, the San Jose Mercury News reported in April that ""at least 14 Southern California cities and two counties have passed ordinances, and in some cases filed lawsuits,"" against the statewide sanctuary law. But these localities are home to a small fraction of Californians, and public opinion data shows that residents are generally supportive of sanctuary laws, as we’ve previously reported. • A November 2017 University of Southern California Dornsife/Los Angeles Times survey found 53 percent favored and 29 percent opposed California’s sanctuary state legislation. • A March 2017 University of California Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found that 56 percent supported and 44 percent opposed ""local communities declaring themselves sanctuary cities and instructing local police and government employees not to automatically turn immigrants over to federal immigration officers when they are found to be in the country illegally."" Support was weaker when the question was asked differently: 53 percent opposed and 47 percent supported allowing cities and counties the right to ignore requests from federal authorities to detain illegal immigrants who have been arrested and are about to be released. • A May 2017 Public Policy Institute of California poll asked specifically about California’s sanctuary state legislation. It found 48 percent of adults were in favor and 42 percent were opposed. • A January 2017 Public Policy Institute of California survey showed that 58 percent of likely voters ""favor California’s state and local governments making their own policies and taking actions—separate from the federal government— to protect the rights of undocumented immigrants living in the state."" Only 39 percent said they were opposed. • The most recent poll, released in April 2018 by the University of California Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, found 56 percent percent support for California’s law and 41 percent in opposition. Opinions are strong both for and against: 38 percent said they strongly support it and 32 percent said they strongly oppose it. Mark DiCamillo, the director of the IGS survey, told PolitiFact California earlier this year that opinions about sanctuary policies ""vary according to how you frame the issue."" Californians, he said, favor allowing cities to declare themselves sanctuaries and letting them choose not to automatically turn over immigrants to federal authorities. But, he added, ""just ignoring a federal request is not as popular. It’s very divisive."" ""There are nuances to the issue, in my opinion, that affect public opinion and how it’s gauged,"" he said. Experts added that the increasing identification of Trump himself with opposition to sanctuary cities has made the issue more polarized on a partisan basis. In California, which is a strongly Democratic state overall, this has helped line public opinion against Trump’s position. Trump said, ""Even in California now, they don’t want to be sanctuary cities anymore. They want out."" A number of California localities have moved to challenge a statewide sanctuary law. However, public opinion more broadly shows a majority of residents expressing support for the law.

How late did Joe Manchin decide on Kavanaugh vote?
","When U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was running for reelection, he broke with fellow Democrats by voting to confirm President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. But that wasn’t enough for some critics. In a tweet, his opponent, Patrick Morrisey, wrote, ""Thanks to @realDonaldTrump & Republicans in the Senate who confirmed Kavanaugh. Remember, Manchin refused to commit to Kavanaugh until AFTER the Senate had the votes. Manchin piled on — he had no courage and empowered the Schumer circus. #wvsen #wvpol."" Thanks to @realDonaldTrump & Republicans in the Senate who confirmed Kavanaugh. Remember, Manchin refused to commit to Kavanaugh until AFTER the Senate had the votes. Manchin piled on — he had no courage and empowered the Schumer circus. #wvsen #wvpol Manchin ended up defeating Morrisey, though by a more narrow margin than polls had indicated. Was Morrisey correct that Manchin refused to confirm Kavanaugh until after the Senate already had votes in Kavanaugh’s favor? Manchin’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we took a closer look. On Sept. 27, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teens.. This allegation put Kavanaugh’s nomination in jeopardy, and the Senate delayed a confirmation vote so the FBI could investigate the allegation. Manchin supported the Senate delaying the vote, and he took his time before committing to a yes or no vote on the nomination. He only made his position public after the FBI investigation was completed. Ultimately, Manchin announced his intentions only after Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced that she would support becoming the 50th vote to confirm Kavanaugh. That would have been sufficient for a confirmation because Vice President Mike Pence could have broken a tie in Kavanaugh’s favor. Manchin made the announcement on Oct. 5, saying in a tweeted press release at 3:54 p.m., ""I met with the nominee for over two hours, attended his hearings, spoke with constitutional experts, and heard from thousands of West Virginians.""  That was ""within moments of"" Collins’ announcement, CNN reported. Politico wrote that ""it’s clear Manchin doesn’t want to be the 50th vote for Kavanaugh, but it seems like he’d be OK with being the 51st or 52nd, barring any new developments."" Morrisey tweeted that Manchin ""refused to commit to Kavanaugh until AFTER the Senate had the votes."" Manchin waited until after Collins said she would become the 50th vote in support of Kavanaugh’s nomination to announce his own decision to back him.
