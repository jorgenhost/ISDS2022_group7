Jeb Bush says that Rubio, Cruz and Paul have a combined 'two bills that became law'
","Three senators running for the Republican presidential nomination have slim records in Congress, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. On NBC’s Meet the Press Nov. 1, Bush said that he, on the other hand, ""got to be governor of a state and accomplish big things."" ""This is about public service, about solving problems. If you look at the three people on the stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. If you look at Hillary Clinton, in 10 years, three bills she sponsored that became law. This is the gridlock that I'm running to try to break up."" We wondered if Bush was right that the three sitting senators he debated against Oct. 28 -- Rand Paul, R-Ky., Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- have only had a combined two bills become law so far. (Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also a sitting senator running for the Republican nomination, but Bush did not include Graham in his count, as he appeared in an earlier debate for candidates with the lowest poll numbers.) (In March, we looked into Cruz’s track record, and we looked at Clinton’s in June.) We evaluated Cruz, Rubio and Paul’s legislative records using Congressional Quarterly’s BillTrack database and GovTrack’s advanced legislation search. We found that Bush’s statement is accurate in that the three senators have sponsored just two bills that eventually became law. But the claim leaves out some important context, such as outside factors working against the senators and the fact that this is an incomplete measure of a senator’s impact in Congress. Put another way, it’s unclear how much you should read into what Bush said. Serving since 2013, Cruz has been the primary sponsor on 57 bills, one of which has become law. Rubio and Paul both joined the Senate in 2011. Rubio has sponsored 106 bills, and President Barack Obama signed one of them into law. Paul has sponsored 141 bills but none has yet to become law. Cruz’s bill, enacted in 2014, denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Iran’s chosen U.N. representative). The bill was uncontroversial and passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. Obama signed Rubio’s bill in 2015. This law, which authorized the State Department to support women’s rights in developing countries, was also uncontroversial and passed both chambers unanimously. All three also have their names on laws as cosponsors: Cruz has three, Rubio has 18 and Paul has four. The caveats to Bush’s claim So it’s true that Cruz, Rubio and Paul haven’t had many of their ideas signed into law. But there are several caveats to Bush’s claims. Seniority matters. Cruz has only been in Congress for 2.5 years; Paul and Rubio have been there for 4.5. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 bills and has been in the Senate since 1977. At the time of National Journal’s report, the median was 78 bills passed and belonged to Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has been a senator since 2005. Who’s in control matters. Until this year, Republicans were the minority party in the Senate, putting Cruz, Rubio and Paul at a disadvantage. It’s expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members’ priorities are at the back of the line. ""First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority,"" Huder told PolitiFact when we wrote about Cruz’s record back in March. That said, the Senate’s design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if they’re not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. They can also use their platform to shape the national conversation, such as Paul’s efforts to raise awareness of privacy issues and National Security Agency surveillance of citizens' phone and other records. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing party’s agenda, like when Cruz spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. ""That's not quite the same as shepherding a bill into law, but it's an example of the ways in which merely counting bills enacted gives short shrift to other ways in which senators can make a difference,"" Binder said. Effectiveness outside of sponsorship. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesn’t account for individual bills’ political salience. Binder noted that Rubio played a major role in crafting the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, and even though that bill did not become law, it was an important piece of legislation that continues to be relevant. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so many factors that go into passing a law is out of the sponsor’s hands, Huder said. A Cruz spokesperson told us that his impact in Congress is demonstrated through more actions than just the number of laws passed. We also reached out to the campaigns for Rubio and Paul, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Looking at Clinton, Sanders Because Bush mentioned her, we wanted to briefly touch on Clinton’s record, too. Serving as the Democratic senator from New York for eight years (not 10, as Bush said), 2001 through January 2009, Clinton sponsored 416 bills, and three became law. She also co-sponsored 74 bills that were eventually enacted into law. There’s one more senator running for president: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Of the 190 bills Sanders has sponsored since joining the Senate in 2007, two have become law. He has cosponsored 33 that were enacted. Our ruling Bush said that the three Republican senators running for president ""have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored."" Bush has his numbers right: Of all the bills Cruz, Rubio and Paul have sponsored combined, only two bills have been signed into law. But experts told us that this isn’t a great measurement of a legislator’s effectiveness, and there are other ways to show impact in Congress. All three senators have their fingerprints on numerous laws as cosponsors or amendment authors.   We rate Bush’s claim Mostly True. Editor's note: This post has been updated to include a response from the Cruz campaign that we received after publishing the article and to clarify the senators identified by Bush in his claim.

Fiorina defends her GOP debate remarks, claims U.S. has 'record numbers of people living in poverty
","Carly Fiorina said on Fox News Sunday that she ""misspoke"" when she used a striking but inaccurate statistic about women and unemployment during the third GOP debate. Nonetheless, Fiorina suggested the real culprit is the ""liberal media."" Numerous fact-checkers, including PolitiFact, debunked Fiorina’s claim that ""92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama’s first term belonged to women."" To FIorina, that’s quibbling with details to bury the larger truths. ""This is what the liberal media tries to do. Let us discredit the messenger so that we ignore the truth of the message,"" she said Nov. 1. ""Here’s the truth of the message: Women are harmed by this administration’s policies. Record numbers of women have lost jobs, are living in poverty, or are living in extreme poverty."" Progressive policies, Fiorina continued, have been bad for everyone, regardless of gender: ""We have record numbers of people who are no longer working or who have quit looking for work. We have record numbers of people on food stamps. We have record numbers of people living in poverty. Those are the facts. That is the truth."" We wanted to check out her claim that there are more people living in poverty now than ever before.  What the numbers say Looking at data from the Census Bureau, Fiorina’s right that the number of people living in poverty (46.7 million in 2014) is the highest since the census began keeping track in 1959. However, the poverty rate — the measure typically used — is nowhere near historical highs. There are 8 more million people living in poverty now than in 1959, but the overall population of the United States also grew by 141 million people (from 177 million in 1959 to 318 million in 2014). So the poverty rate actually decreased from 22.4 percent in 1959 to 14.8 percent in 2014. ""Most economists would agree that standards of living have increased substantially since 1959, and poverty, especially elderly poverty, was more severe in 1959 than today,"" said John Iceland, a professor of sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University and author of  Poverty in America. Here’s a graph from a Census Bureau report published in September of 2015 that illustrates this point:  All the experts we spoke to cautioned against using raw numbers when making comparisons. Instead, analysts typically use rates to correct for the growing population of the nation. ""If we use absolute values and not rates, then the following statements are both true: There are more people who are poor than ever today. But GDP is much higher today than it ever was under a Republican president, so the Obama Administration economic policy is a smashing success,"" said Sheldon Danziger, the president of the nonpartisan Russell Sage Foundation, which funds research on poverty. If we use Fiorina’s preferred measure, we reached a record number of people living in poverty under the watch of every president starting with Richard Nixon, Danziger pointed out. Conversely, said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair, the number of people not living in poverty has also increased. ""No president in the last 40 years has been able to lower the number of people in poverty. Poverty rates fell most under the Bill Clinton Administration than any since Nixon,"" Danziger said. What’s more, given the economic impact of the recession, poverty is actually lower than expected, in part due to spending in the stimulus package, according to Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy think tank. ""So if Obama had any effect on poverty, it was to lower poverty, though presidents tend to have smaller impacts on broad economic trends than they would like to believe,"" he said. ""In fact, when you use a broader definition of poverty that encompasses noncash aid, poverty hardly changed through the recession, which was a surprise to many who work on these issues."" As for Fiorina’s claim that ""record numbers of women ...are living in poverty,"" she’s again accurate that more women live in poverty today than ever (about 162,000 in 2014). But the overall rate has remained relatively unchanged. Here’s a chart using census data that illustrates that point: 
 A Fiorina spokeswoman passed along two articles highlighting the increase in raw numbers and told PolitiFact that the increase should not be trivialized. Our ruling Fiorina said, ""We have record numbers of people living in poverty today."" In terms of raw numbers, Fiorina is correct that more people live in poverty today than ever in the 56 years the census has been keeping track. However, absolute value is an inappropriate measure for poverty analysis, experts said. If we use the right measure, poverty rate, we see that poverty has decreased significantly since 1959. We rate Fiorina’s claim Half True.","[('Fox News, Fox News Sunday, Nov. 1, 2015', 'http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/11/01/newly-sworn-in-house-speaker-paul-ryan-talks-his-plans-for-congress-plus-gop/'), ('Email interview with Anna Epstein, spokesperson for Carly Fiorina, Nov. 1, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with John Iceland, professor of sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University, Nov. 1, 2015', 'https://census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf'), ('Email interview with Sheldon Danziger, president of the nonpartisan Russell Sage Foundation, Nov. 1, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, Nov. 1, 2015', 'https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/historical/hstpov7.xls'), ('Email interview with Tara Sinclair, professor economics at George Washington University, Nov. 1, 2015', 'No link'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Income and Poverty in the United States: 2014,"" September 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/29/carly-fiorina/fiorina-levies-out-date-charge-women-job-losses-un/'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Table 7.

David Cicilline mixes up shooting data in a call for stronger background checks
","On the floor of the U.S. House, Rep. David Cicilline reached for a statistic to bolster his argument for stronger background checks on gun buyers. ""There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world,"" the Rhode Island Democrat said. It’s clear the United States has a problem with rampage shootings carried out in schools and workplaces. But more mass shootings than anywhere else in the world? Had Cicilline considered any of the world’s war zones? Richard Luchette, the Cicilline staffer who had sent us a YouTube video of the congressman’s remarks, provided two sources that Cicilline used in his speech: a website called Mass Shooting Tracker and a recent Wall Street Journal article with the headline ""U.S. Leads World in Mass Shootings."" Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowd-sourced data website that compiles media reports, has documented more than 300 incidents in the U.S. this year in which four or more people were shot. The total number of incidents meeting the site’s definition of a ""mass shooting"" could be greater than what’s reported on the site. The tracker has its issues. For one, its definition of a ""mass shooting"" does not require anyone to be killed. For another, some shootings may not make it into the news media. ""Mass shooting"" is not the term that the Congressional Research Service developed for its widely circulated report on the types of shootings taking place in schools and workplaces.   The congressional report focuses on shootings in a ""relatively public"" location in which either a gunman or gunmen select victims ""somewhat indiscriminately"" and kill, four or more people. The report calls such shootings ""public mass shootings."" Also, on Oct. 8, PolitiFact Florida gave U.S. Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz a ruling of half true for a statement about mass shootings that PolitiFact said relied too heavily on the tracker site data.   But the Mass Shooting Tracker has documented more than 300 shootings with at least four people wounded and Cicilline quoted its findings accurately. The second half of the congressman’s claim is more problematic, in large part, because it has little in common with the first half of the claim. The Wall Street Journal article cited by Luchette refers to research assembled by Adam Lankford, an associate professor of at the University of Alabama Department of Criminal Justice. Lankford examined ""public mass shootings"" in the United States and around the world from 1966 to 2012. He did not consider mass shootings in war zones or mass shootings motivated by gang rivalries.  He identified a total of 292 shooters whose violence met his specific criteria for a public mass shooting, including at least four deaths. He determined that 90 of these shooters, 31 percent of the world’s total, had carried out their attacks in the United States. And that this was more than in any other country. ""Any politician who says that is correct, according to my research of these types of crimes,"" Lankford says.  Our ruling In the YouTube video that Cicilline’s staff sent us, the congressman said: ""There have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year – more than any other country in the world.""  The problem with that sentence is that he mixes disparate facts to draw a single conclusion. The ""mass shootings"" of the first part are not the same as the ""public mass shootings"" of the second part. And so while both parts are basically correct, Cicilline was off base when he put them together. The Mass Shooting Tracker does not tally foreign shootings. And the social scientist from the University of Alabama looked at different events from a different period of time. The first half of his sentence is true and the second half is true. But two trues, in this case, don’t make the whole truth.  For that reason, the judges rate Cicilline’s claim Half True.","[('YouTube.com, ""Cicilline Underscores Importance of NICS background check system,"" Oct. 23, 2015, accessed Oct. 26, 2015', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6FUW_hLxLI'), ('ShootingTracker.com, ""Mass Shootings in 2015,"" accessed Oct. 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('WSJ.com, ""U.S. Leads the World in Mass Shootings,"" Oct. 3, 2015, accessed Oct. 26, 2015.', 'http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Mass_Shootings_in_2015'), ('WashingtonPost.com ""Shooting in Oregon: So far in 2015, we’ve had 274 days and 294 mass shootings,"" Oct. 1, 2015 accessed Oct. 26, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Erin Miller, program manager for the Global Terrorism Database, National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, interview and email Oct. 26, 2015.', 'https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-leads-world-in-mass-shootings-1443905359'), ('Grant Duwe, director of research, Minnesota Department of Corrections, and author of ""Mass Murder in the United States: A History,"" interview Oct. 26.', 'No link'), ('WSJ.com, ""Five things about mass shootings in the U.S.,"" Oct. 2, 2015, accessed Oct. 26, 2015', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/01/2015-274-days-294-mass-shootings-hundreds-dead/'), ('NewRepublic.com, ""Here’s why no one can agree on the number of mass shootings,"" Oct.3, 2015, accessed Oct. 27, 2015.', 'No link'), ('Adam Lankford, associate professor, Department of Criminal Justice, University of Alabama, interviews, Oct. 27-28, 2015.', 'http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/10/02/oreshoot/'), ('Congressional Research Service, ""Mass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013,"" July 30, 2015.', 'No link'), ('FBI, ""A study of Active Shooter Events in the United States, Between 2000 and 2013,"" Sept. 16, 2013, accessed Oct. 28, 2015.', 'https://www.newrepublic.com/article/123027/heres-why-no-one-can-agree-number-mass-shootings'), ('PolitiFact.com, ""Wasserman Schultz claims 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone,"" Oct. 8, 2015, accessed Oct. 28, 2015.', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/september/fbi-releases-study-on-active-shooter-incidents/pdfs/a-study-of-active-shooter-incidents-in-the-u.s.-between-2000-and-2013')]",/factchecks/2015/nov/01/david-cicilline/david-cicilline-mixes-shooting-data-call-stronger-/

Jeb Bush says American dream is in jeopardy more than ever before
","The idea that you can leverage your effort and skill to reach a higher rung of economic standing – regardless of your parents’ wealth – is woven into the fabric of the United States. It's the backbone of the American Dream. But it may no longer be the American reality, according to Jeb Bush. He said for people born into poverty, the dream is facing an unprecedented threat. ""We have intergenerational poverty for the first time in America. If you're born poor, you're more likely to stay poor than any time in American history,"" he said at a town hall event in Concord, N.H., on Oct. 14. The Republican candidate for president and former Florida governor was responding to a question from a black high school student about ""the culture of poverty."" The 17-year-old pointed at income disparities between white families and black and Latino families and wondered how Bush would explain the phenomenon. Bush agreed that there's a culture of poverty – although it has ""nothing to do with race,"" he said – and posited that the way to lift people up is to ""give them power to make choices for themselves, rather than trap them in a situation of interdependency."" People who are born poor tend to stay poor, he said,  ""because we have systems on top of them that put lids on their aspirations."" We decided to explore the second part of Bush’s claim: that people who are born poor are more likely to stay poor than ever before. We’re not examining the first half – that the country is experiencing intergenerational poverty for the first time – since the experts we spoke with rejected that idea out of hand. Mobility versus inequality It’s important to make a distinction about different terms that are used to evaluate wealth and poverty. If you consider mobility and inequality in terms of a ladder, mobility can be seen as moving from one rung to the next, while inequality is more like the distance between rungs. As we’ve previously checked, inequality is as bad as it has been in a long time: The distance between the top rung and second-to-top rung is growing. What we’re talking about here, though, is mobility. Inequality may have an effect on mobility – we’ll come back to that later – but for now, we’re considering a person’s odds at advancing to a higher rung. In a perfectly mobile society, your status at birth would have no correlation with your status at adulthood. Ten children born into the bottom 20 percent would find themselves evenly distributed by maturity: On a five-rung ladder, two would remain on the bottom rung, two would advance to the second, and so on, including two who made it to the top. That’s not how the United States works. A 2012 article in the New York Times examined five recent studies that showed America is less mobile than comparable nations. One project, led by Markus Jantti, an economist at a Swedish university, ""found that 42 percent of American men raised in the bottom fifth of incomes stay there as adults. That shows a level of persistent disadvantage much higher than in Denmark (25 percent) and Britain (30 percent) — a country famous for its class constraints."" Just 8 percent of American men at the bottom rose to the top fifth, it said. Meanwhile, about 62 percent of American men and women raised in the top fifth of incomes remain in the top two-fifths, according to research by the Economic Mobility Project of the Pew Charitable Trusts. So it may be easier to obtain the American Dream, so to speak, in Europe than it is here – that’s another question we’ve previously checked – but what’s the trend within the United States? Studying trends Until recently, there’s hasn’t been much data specific to intergenerational poverty, which is typically studied as the relationship between fathers’ earnings and those of their sons. In the 1980s, work by Gary S. Becker, a Nobel laureate in economics, found only a mild relationship. When better data became available in the ‘90s, Gary Solon, another prominent economist, found the relationship to be about twice as strong as previously thought. These days, the Times wrote, the correlation is supposed to be even stronger: ""Most researchers now estimate the ‘elasticity’ of father-son earnings at 0.5, which means that for every 1 percent increase in a father’s income, his sons’ income can be expected to increase by about 0.5 percent."" That was written before leading contemporary economist Raj Chetty, a professor at Stanford University, completed a study of intergenerational mobility for the National Bureau of Economic Research in January 2014. Using administrative earnings records, Chetty found when he compared groups born in 1971 versus those born in 1993, mobility remained ""extremely stable."" ""We find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s. However, because inequality has risen, the consequences of the ‘birth lottery’ – the parents to whom a child is born – are larger today than in the past,"" he wrote. In other words, mobility doesn’t seem to be getting worse, but Americans hoping to live the rags-to-riches story may have had worse odds in recent decades than they thought. Meanwhile, inequality is getting worse, which means those who start at the bottom have a longer way to go to get to the top – or even to the middle class. Analyzing the claim Bush said: ""If you’re born poor, you’re more likely to stay poor than any time in American history."" Douglas Besharov, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland and director of its Welfare Reform Academy, said that’s an overstatement. The consensus among economists on the left and right, he said, is that mobility is lower than it has been in the recent past, but not the country’s 239-year history. Given the 2008 economic crisis, Besharov said, we’re now on the other side of a 100-year period when ""we had a pretty spectacular experience with economic mobility."" During a time of prosperity, it was easy for everyone to move up – and for the country as a whole to move up in relation to the rest of the world. ""America was growing, the economy was growing, America was the richest country in the world, blah blah blah, you know the story,"" Besharov said, adding that now, we’re in recovery but still have a lot of unemployment. For someone to move from the bottom to the top, he said, someone else from the top has to fall. ""We’ve had such a great run in our economy for the last 50 years, the ones who had it in them to get a better job have gotten a better job. We’ve sort of run out of people who can move up in the world without a lot of help,"" he said. As evidence for Bush’s claim, spokesman Jesse Hunt pointed to a paper written by Katharine Bradbury, a senior economist and policy advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. It didn’t directly study intergenerational mobility, but rather family income mobility between 1969 and 2006. In other words, instead of comparing fathers’ earnings to their sons’, it looked at changes in individual families’ income positions over time. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a number of mobility measures, the study concluded that over nearly 50 years, families’ income mobility got worse, and their later-year incomes depended more on their starting place. In seeking to develop policy advice from the data, the paper comments: ""It appears that increasingly redistributive U.S. tax and transfer policies may have enhanced family income mobility from the 1970s into the 1980s, but then had decreasing impact as tax rates were reduced after 1981 (and intermittently thereafter)."" So there’s some evidence that mobility has waned recently. But Bush cited ""American history,""
which is a big span of time, with many examples of bleak economic mobility, including times of slavery, and after the Civil War, sharecropping. The boy who asked the question of Bush at the town hall, Ebbie Banks, a junior at St. Paul’s School in Concord, said six generations ago, his family members were born into slavery in Georgia. Our ruling Bush said: ""If you're born poor, you're more likely to stay poor than any time in American history.""

Texas police department places ad urging drug dealers to fill out form, snitch on other dealers
","Snopes.com, which evaluates the accuracy of varied claims, declared in an October 2015 tweet that a Texas newspaper ran an ad purchased by the local police department encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers. ""Is your drug dealing competition costing you money?"" the described ad said. ""Would you like to eliminate that problem? We can help! We can take your competition off the streets for FREE. Report your competition to us."" Snopes.com’s Oct. 26, 2015 analysis said a person at the Lumberton Police Department, whom it did not identify,  confirmed that the ad ran, though didn’t recall when. Snopes.com said it spotted the ad in an August 2015 Facebook post. Did police in the Southeast Texas town really place an ad encouraging drug dealers to nark each other out? We were curious enough to check it out on our own. By phone, David Lisenby, editor of the weekly Lumberton Ledger, confirmed that the Lumberton Police Department placed the ad. Lisenby added that the department subsequently purchased another direct appeal about dealers. Lisenby said he suggested the ads in hopes of encouraging community involvement. Lisenby emailed us copies of the first ad, which appeared in the paper’s Aug. 5, 2015, edition, and the follow-up ad, published Sept. 2, 2015. The second ad showed a marijuana leaf over a message directed to ""drug users:"" ""Has your drug dealer ripped you off?"" the second ad says. ""Do you want justice? We can help! We can enact justice for you … for FREE."" Wondering if the ads touched off a wave of snitching, we unsuccessfully tried to connect with Chief Danny Sullins of the Lumberton Police Department. Separately, a clerk for the county attorney in Hardin County, Telisha Green, told us by phone that police reports submitted to the office as backup for misdemeanor drug cases had yet to mention an instance of the ads leading to arrests. Prosecutors otherwise have no way of knowing, Green said, if the ads fueled investigations. But David Sheffield, Hardin County’s district attorney, said he’s heard the ads touched off calls to law enforcement. Sheffield said, though, it’s too early to judge results; investigations take time. Such an ad, he said, ""gets your attention and it generates talk. Maybe it prompts somebody to do something they’d just been thinking about doing."" Our ruling A Facebook post spotted by Snopes.com said Lumberton police placed an ad encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers.

At debate, Rubio calls tally of financial mishaps a pack of 'discredited attacks'
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio waved off a question about his economic smarts during the latest Republican presidential debate, saying stories about his personal financial decisions weren’t worth discussing. At the Oct. 28, 2015, debate in Boulder, Colo., CNBC moderator Becky Quick asked Rubio how qualified he felt to guide national fiscal policy when he’d had so many money problems himself. ""Sen. Rubio, you yourself have said that you've had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills,"" Quick said, quoting Rubio’s 2012 book An American Son before listing several examples. ""You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties. ""In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and the wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say?"" she asked. Rubio’s response was to dismiss all of Quick’s examples as partisan smear tactics. ""Well, you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all,"" he said. He then went on to detail his blue-collar upbringing with immigrant parents. The response made us pause, because we wondered what had been ""discredited"" about Rubio’s widely reported financial mishaps. In this context, ""discredited"" means the things Quick said are not true or accurate. Rubio’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment, but we’ll take them one at a time and explain what happened: ""You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money."" Years before Rubio became speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in 2006, he created two political committees to pay for travel and other expenses. A 2010 Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald investigation found he failed to disclose paying $34,000 in expenses, including $7,000 to himself. He paid his wife Jeanette, who was treasurer of one of the committees, $5,700 for ""gas and meals."" Rubio also gave relatives another $14,000 and charged $51,000 in travel expenses to his own credit cards.   Speaking of credit cards: In 2005, the Republican Party of Florida gave him an American Express for expenses. Rubio charged thousands of dollars’ worth of restaurant meals while his meals in Tallahassee were being covered by taxpayers as part of being in the state House. Rubio routinely used the party’s card to pay personal expenses, which he later repaid. Those included a rental car, repairs to his personal vehicle, flights to Tallahassee, a family reunion trip and paver work to his home. In all, he spent more than $100,000 between November 2006 and November 2008. He didn’t release disclosures prior to that. The Florida Commission on Ethics in 2012 dismissed a citizen complaint that had been filed during Rubio’s 2010 Senate campaign. Rubio wrote in his book that the expenses were the result of simple mix-ups. ""For example, I pulled the wrong card from my wallet to pay for pavers,"" he wrote. Another time, ""my travel agent mistakenly used the card to pay for a family reunion in Georgia.""

""Each time, I identified the charges and paid the costs myself, directly to American Express. The Republican Party of Florida didn't pay a single one of them. Nevertheless, in hindsight, I wish that none of them had ever been charged."" Quick’s description of these events is accurate. ""You faced foreclosure on a second home that you bought."" In 2005, Rubio bought a house in Tallahassee with then-state Rep. David Rivera for $135,000. The pair used the home while in town on state business. Foreclosure proceedings on the Tallahassee house were started in 2010 when Rivera, then Florida House budget chairman and running for Congress in Miami, failed to make mortgage payments for five months. The loan had been structured for interest-only payments on an adjustable rate mortgage until April 2010. Rubio and Rivera stopped paying the loan in February because of a dispute over how much the payments would be after April. In June 2010, Deutsche Bank filed a lawsuit for $136,000, prompting Rivera to make a hasty payment for the missing months. Foreclosure proceedings were stopped. Rivera later became entangled in ethics investigations and Rubio has kept some distance from him. They sold the house in June 2015 for $117,000. It’s worth noting that the foreclosure proceedings didn’t proceed, but Rubio did ""face"" them on a second home. ""And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties."" Rubio disclosed in May 2015 he had cashed out a tax-advantaged retirement account on Sept. 1, 2014, closing an American Bar Association account for the cash infusion. ""It was just one specific account that we wanted to have access to cash in the coming year, both because I'm running for president, but, also, you know, my refrigerator broke down. That was $3,000. I had to replace the air conditioning unit in our home,"" Rubio told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. ""My kids all go to school, and they're getting closer to college and school is getting more expensive. And then when you're running for president, we just wanted to access the sum of that cash."" Because of the way most traditional IRAs are structured, Rubio was able to put money into the account without paying taxes. When he closed the account, by law he would have likely had to pay both income taxes and a 10 percent penalty, a move financial advisers usually do not recommend. Taxes and penalties could have ranged from about $24,000 to as high as $30,000, but it’s unclear how much he paid. Quick’s description here, too, is accurate. Our ruling Rubio said the premise of questions about his financial skills are ""discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents."" He was responding to examples Quick gave when asking if he was prepared to oversee the nation’s economy as president. She listed troubles Rubio had experienced with campaign bookkeeping, foreclosure proceedings and liquidating an IRA at severe tax penalties. All of these events happened and have been well-documented. It’s not accurate for Rubio to refer to the issues as ""discredited,"" whether his opponents have used them to attack him or not. Quick was not making things up nor shading the facts. We rate Rubio’s statement False.","[('Marco Rubio, CNBC’s Republican primary presidential debate, Oct. 28, 2015', 'http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000439507'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Records show Marco Rubio spent thousands with GOP credit card,"" Feb. 24, 2010', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Marco Rubio\'s lavish rise to the top,"" March 12, 2010', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/records-show-marco-rubio-spent-thousands-with-gop-credit-card/1075692'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Senate candidate Marco Rubio in foreclosure tangle over Tallahassee property,"" June 18, 2010', 'No link'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""Marco Rubio\'s personal finances clash with call for fiscal discipline,"" Oct. 21, 2010', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/marco-rubios-lavish-rise-to-the-top/1079473'), ('Tampa Bay Times, ""U.S. Sen.

"['National', 'Regulation', 'Small Business', 'Ben Carson']","
At CNBC debate, Ben Carson cites high cost of regulations for small manufacturers
","Presidential candidate Ben Carson called for fewer government regulations at the Oct. 28 Republican debate. Responding to a question posed about whether the government should regulate pharmaceutical prices, the former neurosurgeon pivoted to talk about federal regulation more generally, saying more government involvement means more problems. ""Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee,"" Carson said. ""Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else. So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on."" We wondered if Carson’s claim that regulations cost $34,000 a year per employee at small manufacturing firms was correct. We found that Carson got the figure from a report, but the figure itself is not bulletproof. The figure comes from a 2014 report commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers -- a group that advocates for regulatory reform -- which concluded that smaller manufacturers bear a bigger regulatory burden than medium and large firms. The study found that manufacturing businesses with fewer than 50 employees face on average $34,671 per employee per year in regulatory costs. The average among manufacturing companies of all sizes, conversely, is $19,564, and the average among all U.S. businesses is $9,991. The researchers were W. Mark Crain and Nicole V. Crain, economists at Lafayette College. In short, the Crains calculated a figure for the total cost of regulations in the United States, estimated what proportion of that cost various economic sectors bear, and then calculated the per-employee cost within each sector using payroll data. Their 2014 manufacturing study largely builds off of one they produced for the Small Business Administration, a government agency, in 2010. Many critics viewed the 2010 study as flawed because of the imprecise way the Crains calculated the primary figure: how much regulations cost in total, which came out to about $1.7 trillion. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service questioned the results in its own report. The gist is that they based it on the extent of regulation within the United States and economic growth, rather than the literal costs associated with particular regulatory policies. (For a detailed overview of the criticisms of the 2010 report, read this New York Times blog.) In an email to PolitiFact, Nicole Crain said they ""took criticisms seriously"" and adjusted the 2014 report as a result. One major change is that the researchers also surveyed manufacturers. They inquired about actual costs incurred by these firms, such as purchasing special equipment to meet regulations and the cost of hiring employees to monitor compliance. Crain said the survey results support the findings from the regulatory index analysis. ""The results obtained from these two distinctly different approaches were quite similar,"" she said. We couldn’t find any other quality studies that calculated a similar figure with which we could compare the Crains’ data, and the experts we asked weren’t aware of any either. The Crains’ methodology is on the right track, but the problem is that they don’t have good data to back it up, said Richard Williams, an economist at the Mercatus Institute at George Mason University, who reviewed the 2010 study. The federal government publishes thousands of rules every year, but there is reliable cost data about very few of them. While it’s uncertain what the actual costs are, the $34,000 figure that Carson cited might not be totally off-base for manufacturers with fewer than 50 employees, Williams said. ""This might be in the ballpark, but it might be a lot higher, but it might be a little lower,"" Williams said. This figure is so vague that it’s meaningless, said Brookings Institution senior fellow and economist Clifford Winston, noting that his work is generally critical of government regulation. There are so many rules and types of costs -- everything from the direct cost of hiring special employees to the indirect cost of lost efficiency -- that it’s difficult to develop a comprehensive number for how many dollars firms lose to federal regulations generally. Most researchers look at regulations much more narrowly, such as examining a specific regulation or business sector, he said. Further, the study doesn’t fully take into account the benefits of regulations, Winston said, adding that in some cases, the absence of regulations could be more expensive than the costs of compliance. Looking through the report, Winston said the figure cited by Carson is in no way a reliable snapshot of how much the average small manufacturer spends on regulatory compliance. Our ruling Carson said that among manufacturers with fewer than 50 employees, ""the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee."" Carson cited a figure from a 2014 report out of the National Association of Manufacturers. However, the methodology behind the report has some significant shortfalls, so it’s not necessarily reliable.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
Ted Cruz says he’s the Republican with the most cash on hand--$3.5 million more than Jeb Bush
","Ted Cruz of Texas recently declared that his campaign’s fundraising is ""astonishing"" and suggested that’s a surprise to the ""Washington chattering class"" and maybe even former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another Republican bidding for president. Sen. Cruz, appearing in Houston Oct. 26, 2015, to accept endorsements from statewide elected Republicans including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, celebrated how much he’s raised in Texas and in general. He made us wonder with mention of the Texas-born Bush, who’s trying to become the third member of his family to win the White House. Cruz said: ""And we finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field… $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign."" Cruz added that if he’d predicted such an outcome relative to Bush six months before, reporters would have laughed aloud. Early in 2015, Bush drew headlines for raising money at a vigorous clip. No giggling here. But was Cruz right about his campaign having the biggest pile of cash on hand and exceeding Bush’s balance by $3.5 million? Campaign vs. campaign, you bet your cacti. But throw in money raised by PACs and Super PACs devoted to individual candidates and it could be there’s far more money stowed away to boost Bush. Then again, PAC fundraising updates won’t be filed until 2016. Campaign vs. campaign To our inquiry, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a list indicating that Cruz’s campaign ended the year’s third quarter, June through September 2015, with more cash on hand than any other Republican aspirant. Separately, we fetched a Federal Election Commission summary, dated Oct. 19, 2015, stating that through September 2015, Cruz’s campaign had nearly $13.8 million cash on hand. And Cruz’s balance, according to the document, exceeded the cash on hand of any of 15 other listed current or former Republican presidential candidates. At No. 2, retired surgeon Ben Carson had nearly $11.3 million cash on hand, according to the summary, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with nearly $11 million and Bush with nearly $10.3 million. To be precise, per Cruz’s claim in Houston, Bush’s cash on hand of $10,271,129 was a little more than $3.5 million less than Cruz’s $13,778,904. We’re not saying here that Cruz outraised everyone. According to another FEC summary, also dated Oct. 19, 2015, Carson raised some $31 million through September 2015, outpacing Cruz’s nearly $27 million and Bush’s nearly $25 million. Businessman Donald Trump, who has led many Republican voter polls, reported a scant $254,773 cash on hand through the third quarter. But Trump, who's wealthy, also has declared plans to self-fund his candidacy. Maybe how much cash he has on hand isn’t significant. Also, Politico noted Oct. 15, 2015, Trump fielded about $3.7 million in donations in the third quarter. Notably too, Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each ended the quarter having raised more money and also having more cash on hand than any Republican. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, had nearly $33 million on hand, according to the FEC, and Sanders, a Vermont senator, had $27.1 million. PACs and Super PACs There’s another wrinkle if you consider how much money PACs and Super PACs devoted to candidates may have in cash on hand. According to a chart built by the New York Times, last updated Oct. 16, 2015, Bush-backing PACs and Super PACs had $98.2 million cash on hand through June 2015. In contrast, Cruz PACs and Super PACs had $37.5 million cash on hand. We don’t see a path to more recent balances; a footnote to the Times chart says most of these groups aren’t required to file an updated report until Jan. 31, 2016. Separately, the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending, posted a chart in October 2015 showing Bush PACs and Super PACs fielding far more money than any other hopeful, again with information limited to what such groups had reported through June 2015:                            SOURCE: Web post, ""Behind the Candidates: Campaign Committees and Outside Groups,"" Center for Responsive Politics, last updated Oct. 27, 2015 (accessed the same day) The chart is preceded by explanatory text: ""The modern presidential campaign isn't a single organization. Yes, there's always an official campaign committee. But for every White House candidate, there is usually at least one super PAC or other outside organization devoted to getting him or her elected. These groups can solicit unlimited donations and later use them to pummel rivals – or, as seems to be the case this cycle, take on some of the duties traditionally handled by a campaign, such as organizing town hall meetings or doing voter outreach."" The explanation continues: ""Outside groups aren't allowed to coordinate with official campaign committees, but they're often run by friends and former staffers – even family members – of the candidate they're helping. Overall, as of the middle of 2015, single-candidate super PACs in the presidential race had raised more money than the candidates themselves. But that wasn't true among Democrats, whose potential nominees raised more than the super PACs supporting them."" Frazier of Cruz’s camp agreed by email it could be that money accumulated to promote Bush’s candidacy still runs ahead of funds raised for Cruz’s cause. Regardless, she reminded, Cruz limited his Houston claim to funds raised by campaigns alone. Our ruling Cruz said his campaign ""finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field… $13.8 million in the bank, three and a half million dollars more than the Jeb Bush campaign."" This is all so, though Bush still might remain ahead (perhaps way ahead) in money accumulated on behalf of a Republican. We won’t know how much total cash has been stashed to help each candidate until PACs report again in 2016. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Jeb Bush says that Florida has cheapest public college tuition
","During a discussion about student debt at the CNBC Republican presidential debate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich talked about bringing down college costs, prompting Jeb Bush to chime in about the low cost of tuition in Florida. ""We don't need the federal government to be involved in this, because when they do, we create a $1.2 trillion debt,"" said the former Florida governor during the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo. ""In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John (Kasich) said. You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't indebt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs."" We wanted to know: Does Florida hold the No. 1 spot for lowest in-state college tuition? Comparison of in-state tuition Bush spokesman Matt Gorman said that when Bush left office in 2007, Florida had the lowest in-state tuition for a public four-year university among the 50 states. The data from the College Board bears that out: It was $3,881 for a four-year public university in 2006-07. But during the debate, Bush didn’t say he was referring to when he ended his tenure as governor — he made it sound like he was talking in the present tense, so we looked at that data, too. The College Board publishes an annual comparison of in-state tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide, comprised of survey data from almost 4,000 postsecondary institutions. The comparison refers to average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment. For 2014-15, the lowest was Wyoming at $4,646, followed by Arkansas at $6,138; Utah at $6,177; New Mexico at $6,190; Montana at $6,279, and then Florida at $6,351. So Florida was the sixth-lowest, although four of the states were only between $72 and $213 cheaper than Florida. ""Florida is one of the most affordable states for public university tuition,"" said Ralph Aiello, who supervises college counselors for Broward County public schools in Florida. The College Board produces a similar report comparing tuition for two-year degrees which showed that Florida was again on the low end but not at the cheapest spot in 2014-15. ""There are a number of reasons for the wide variation in published tuition and fees by state — state tuition philosophy, aid policy, economic conditions, and funding for higher education,"" said Jennifer Ma, the College Board’s policy research scientist. ""For example, New Hampshire, which has the highest published tuition and fees for the public four-year sector in 2014-15, does not have a state grant aid program and has the lowest state appropriations on a per-student basis."" Bush specifically mentioned ""tuition,"" but we’ll note that there are a lot of factors than influence the ultimate price tag for students, including fees, scholarships, financial aid and room and board. Our ruling Bush said, ""In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state."" That’s not accurate if we look at 2014-15 tuition for four-year public universities compiled by the College Board. That data shows Wyoming had the lowest tuition followed by Arkansas, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Florida. Florida was the sixth-lowest. Bush’s campaign said he was referring to Florida’s ranking as the lowest in 2006-07 when he left office, but he didn’t specify that timeframe during the debate.

Ted Cruz says median wage for women has dropped $733 under Obama
","Facing the possibility of a historic female presidential candidacy by Hillary Clinton, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz sought to puncture the notion that Democratic policies have been good for women. ""Under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733,"" Cruz said during the CNBC Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo. Have female workers really fared so poorly under Obama? We took a closer look at the earnings numbers for working women and found that Cruz’s claim is off. The statistic closest to the one Cruz mentioned is calculated by the Census Bureau -- the median wage or salary for workers who are paid through wages or salaries. The bureau breaks those figures down by gender and adjusts the figures for inflation in order to enable comparisons across time. In 2008, the last year before Obama took office, the median for women was $28,574. By 2014, that had risen to $29,098 in inflation-adjusted dollars. That’s an increase of $524 over six years -- not a decline of $733, as Cruz said. So Cruz is wrong using the most obvious benchmark. But he would have been on safer ground if he had said ""income"" rather than ""wages,"" as he intended to do, Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, confirmed to PolitiFact. The Census Bureau separately calculates inflation-adjusted median income by gender. By this measure, the figure for women in 2008 was $22,945. By 2014, that had fallen to $22,240 -- a decline of $705, which is close to what Cruz said. The wages-and-salaries statistic only includes gross employer compensation of employees. By contrast, the income statistic takes in a much larger mix of income flows, including commissions, bonuses, tips, self-employment income, interest, dividends, rental and royalty income, income from estates and trusts, Social Security and public assistance, child support and alimony, and unemployment and retirement benefits. Cruz specifically mentioned wages, which makes his statement less accurate. Another wrinkle undercuts the relevance of the income statistic. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said the wages-and-salaries statistic only applies to the 72 million-plus women undertaking paid work. The income figure applies to every woman over the age of 15 -- more than 112 million in all. Since Cruz referenced wages -- which are earned from work -- he seems to be talking about bad economic trends for working women. Given this, Burtless said, ""I’m not sure why the median income number is relevant."" A lot of the 112 million with income of any kind are homemakers or retired, he said, and with the aging of the baby boom generation, lots of women (and men) are retiring from jobs and beginning to draw Social Security or pensions that don’t pay as much as their old jobs did. This could be the source of the decline in income, even as wages are rising for the smaller group of working women. Our ruling Cruz said that ""under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733."" That's wrong. Wages actually have risen for women since Obama took office. Cruz's spokesperson said Cruz intended to use a different phrase. But at PolitiFact, we say words matter. The statement is not accurate and we rate it False.  ","[('CNBC Republican debate in Boulder, Colo., transcript, Oct. 28, 2015', 'http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/09/17/full_replay_and_transcript_of_second_republican_debate.html'), ('Census Bureau, Table P-53: Wage or Salary Workers by Median Wage or Salary Income and Sex, accessed Oct. 29, 2015', 'No link'), ('Census Bureau, Table P-8.

Fiorina levies out-of-date charge on women job losses under Obama
","As the only female candidate on the debate stage, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said women voters shouldn’t assume that just because Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is a woman that she has their interests at heart. ""It is the height of hypocrisy for Mrs. Clinton to talk about being the first woman president, when every single policy she espouses and every single policy of President Obama has been demonstratively bad for women,"" Fiorina said. ""Ninety-two percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women."" Her 92-percent claim dates back to the 2012 presidential race when it was used by the Republican National Committee and GOP nominee Mitt Romney. At the time, March 2012, the claim had some numerical validity but was also cherry-picked and flawed. We rated it Mostly False. We reached out to the Fiorina campaign and did not hear back, so we’re not sure if she based her statement on the same data as Romney’s campaign used. But here’s what we found back in April 2012: Between January 2009 and March 2012, the total drop in employment was, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 740,000. In the same period, employment for women fell by 683,000. Do the division and you get 92.3 percent. A big problem with the claim in 2012 was that it cherry-picked the starting date for assessing Obama’s jobs track record. The recession began in December 2007, and he didn’t take office until January 2009, when it was nearly over. It’s difficult to blame any president for the economic situation he inherited. The bigger problem with Fiorina making the same statement today is that Obama’s first term continued for another 10 months.  During that time, the women job numbers did a U-turn and became a net gain. The government data show an increase of 416,000 working women between January 2009 and January 2013. Total employment also rose by 1.3 million. So more women actually were working at the end of Obama’s first term compared with the day he first took office. We used the January 2009 to January 2013 timeframe to be consistent with the original Republican framing of the critique of Obama’s economic policies. Our ruling Fiorina said 92 percent of the jobs lost during Obama’s first term belonged to women. By January 2013, the jobs numbers don’t back it up at all. The number of women with jobs increased by 416,000 during Obama’s first term. We rate this claim False.

Most people get their news from Facebook, GOP Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch says
","Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was asked at a Marquette University Law School forum why polls indicate that most Wisconsin residents think the state is headed in the wrong direction. Kleefisch told the audience Oct. 21, 2015 that she thought the polls reflected Wisconsinites’ concerns about where the nation is headed. Then she suggested that some of the good economic news in the state isn’t getting enough attention -- and made an interesting claim about Facebook, saying: ""One of the things that we don’t hear a lot about is the fact that wages are actually up four and a half percent year over year here in Wisconsin. I haven’t read that article. I read it in my briefing binder; we hear our cabinet secretaries talk about it. But it’s not one of those things that’s on Facebook every day. Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook. We need to be talking about the things that matter to our neighbors."" When we asked Kleefisch about the Facebook claim, she said ""should have qualified and sourced"" what she stated. She said she was actually relying on a poll about where millennials get their news about politics and government, not where all Americans get their news generally. But let’s investigate this a little, looking at some scientific polls. The polls The poll Kleefisch said she relied on was reported in June 2015 by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. That survey, done in March and April of 2014, found that most millennials -- 61 percent -- reported getting news about politics and government from Facebook in the previous week. Millennials were born from 1981 to 1996, and were between the ages of 18 and 33 at the time. We found some other polling, however, that surveyed for all Americans and for news generally, not just news about politics and government. Those polls do not show that most Americans get news from Facebook. 1. A March 2015 Pew poll found that 41 percent of American adults get news from Facebook. Pew emphasized to us that that does not suggest that Facebook is the main source of news for that group. 2. A poll done for the American Press Institute in January and February 2014 asked respondents if they had found news in the previous week from a list of various sources that were read to them. When asked if they got news directly from news organizations, such as a newspaper or TV newscast, websites or news wires, 88 percent said yes. Only 44 percent said they had gotten news in the past week from social media, through platforms such as Twitter or Facebook. 3. Gallup in June 2013 used an open-ended question to ask respondents to identify their main source of news. Some 55 percent of the respondents said TV; that was the most popular answer. Only 21 percent said the Internet as their main news source, including 2 percent who identified Facebook, Twitter or other social media. Nine percent said the print version of newspapers. Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, told us there are two points to keep in mind: Overall, most Americans get their news from many sources, even if TV still is the most common, and people use different sources for different types of news. ""We seek it out and we bump into it and, actually, no one place dominates,"" he said. Facebook is not a source of news -- since it distributes rather than produces news -- but it is likely the top pathway to news for people under age 35. Our rating Kleefisch said at a public forum: ""Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook."" The lieutenant governor told us she misspoke and should have qualified her statement to make it about millennials -- Americans roughly between the ages of 18 and 33. One poll found that 61 percent of them reported getting political news on Facebook in the previous week. But in terms of Americans overall getting news of all types, not just political news, we found no polls indicating that a majority get news from Facebook. We rate Kleefisch’s statement False. More on polling U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., said ""60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded."" True. GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson said the number of people who ""believe in socialism ... is increasing."" Half True. Conservative commentator Karl Rove said that at this point in 2012, ""Rick Perry was ahead at 29.9 percent, and we had seven more leads before it finally settled on Mitt Romney.""

At debate, Ben Carson says he has no connection to Mannatech
","Ben Carson said it’s ""total propaganda"" to suggest he had any connection to Mannatech, a maligned nutritional supplement company. At the Oct. 28 Republican presidential debate, hosted by CNBC in Boulder, Colo., moderator Carl Quintanilla asked Carson about his involvement with the company. ""This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship,"" Quintanilla said. ""They offered claims they could cure autism, cancer. They paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet your involvement continues. Why?"" ""Well, that’s easy to answer: I didn’t have an involvement with them,"" replied Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon. ""That is total propaganda. And this is what happens in our society -- total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people. They were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of relationship with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it’s a good product."" Mannatech sells nutritional supplement pills made from larch tree bark and aloe, ingredients with disputed health benefits. The company in 2009 settled the lawsuit, which stemmed from claims that the company was deceptively pitching cures and treatments for illnesses such as cancer and even Down Syndrome. For Carson to say he ""didn’t have an involvement with"" Mannatech is a stretch. While he was not any sort of employee for the company as far as we can tell, it’s hard to see the speeches he’s delivered, as well as other promotional work, as anything but a full-throated endorsement of the product. Further, Mannatech appears to view Carson as a product promoter. First, the speeches. Carson has delivered four to Mannatech, according to the Wall Street Journal. Carson has written these paid remarks off as just several of many diverse speeches the Washington Speakers Bureau have booked for him. But in the speeches, he talks about his personal fondness for the product, which he started taking in conjunction with cancer treatment years ago. For example, Carson delivered remarks to Mannatech sales associates in 2004. In the speech, he talked about his introduction to Mannatech’s supplements and a personal conversation he had with the company’s lead doctor. ""I started taking the product, and within about three weeks, my symptoms went away,"" adding that he toyed with the idea of using only the supplements, rather than undergoing cancer surgery. He said in the remarks that it would be inappropriate for him to be an official spokesman or sales associate, but he does refer people to Mannatech. Since then, he has appeared in Mannatech-produced videos that appear to be promotional materials. In 2011, he answered questions in an interview with Mannatech’s co-CEO and chief science officer. In a 2013 Mannatech video, Carson described his experience with nutritional supplements. ""The wonderful thing about a company like Mannatech is that they recognize that when God made us, he gave us the right fuel. And that fuel was the right kind of healthy food,"" Carson said in the 2013 video. ""Basically what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural diet as a medicine or as a mechanism for maintaining health."" Carson also talked about his use of nutritional supplements on PBS in 2014, and Mannatech promoted the interview on its homepage. While it’s no longer accessible, the Mannatech website had a specific tag for all articles about Carson. Carson’s campaign requested that Mannatech remove some videos and articles featuring Carson from its website. And since media outlets have started poking around this question, Mannatech has taken down even more, according to reporters at the Wall Street Journal. Our ruling Carson said, ""I didn’t have an involvement with"" the nutritional supplement company Mannatech. As far as we can tell, Carson was not a paid employee or official endorser of the product. However, his claim suggests he has no ties to Mannatech whatsoever. In reality, he got paid to deliver speeches to Mannatech and appeared in promotional videos, and he consistently delivered glowing reviews of the nutritional supplements. As a world-renowned surgeon, Carson’s opinion on health issues carries weight, and Mannatech has used Carson’s endorsement to its advantage. We rate Carson’s claim False.

Another claim questioning Pete Buttigieg’s military service is wrong
","Before he was a Democratic presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg was the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and before that, he was an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy.  But a recent Facebook post casts doubt on his military credentials as he seeks the nation’s highest office.  The post shows three images. One is of Buttigieg standing in front of a barbed wire fence in a camouflage uniform holding a gun with a helmet on his arm. The second and third images are cropped closer around his face.  ""Some INTERESTING investigation of ‘Mayor Pete’ and his ‘military service’ photo being circulated here,"" the account writes.

This photograph was STAGED!!! This being known, I hereby label ‘Mayor Pete’ A FRAUD!!!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  We’ve already debunked claims that Buttigieg never served in the military. He was a Navy intelligence officer in Afghanistan for six months, according to military records his campaign provided to PolitiFact. News outlets have spoken to his commanding officers and fellow soldiers. He was sent to Afghanistan to join a task force called the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, according to ABC News. ""We dealt with things like bank fraud, money laundering, extortion, kidnapping, human trafficking and the opium-heroin trade,"" said Army Reserve Col. Guy Hollingsworth, who was the task force’s military commander when Buttigieg arrived. Journal entries Hollingsworth shared with the network describe Buttigieg accompanying the colonel on trips to meetings around Afghanistan. Paul Karweik, Buttigieg’s commanding officer after Hollingsworth, told ABC Buttigieg ""knew the mission inside and out and he could articulate it well. … He was very organized, very disciplined.""  Buttigieg joined the Navy Reserve in 2009. He was a lead analyst tracking the flow of money to terrorist cells. He wasn’t in combat but he took more than 90 trips outside secured military installations in Afghanistan. He was honorably discharged in 2017.  We asked Buttigieg’s campaign about the Facebook post.

China air quality projections used to promote coronavirus cremation hoax
","A popular Facebook post is taking an image out of context to promote a hoax about the cremation of coronavirus victims. The post, which was published Feb. 15, includes an image that claims to show a ""spike in sulfur dioxide emissions just outside Wuhan."" The image cites Instagram user @conspiracyplots, who published it the same day. ""Sulfur dioxide is a gas that is released when organic matter, such as human bodies, are burned,"" reads text underneath the image.

The vast majority of the 2,761 deaths have occurred in China. The Chinese government has ordered for the swift cremation of patients who die after contracting the coronavirus. But the Facebook post does not show sulfur dioxide resulting from cremation. Twitter user @inteldotwav first connected cremations in China with heightened levels of sulfur dioxide near Wuhan. In a Feb. 8 thread, the user posted a screenshot of a map from Windy.com, a website that tracks global wind and weather patterns. It has more than 12,200 retweets. One of the possible reasons for the influx of sulfur dioxide, @inteldotwav said, is that ""dead bodies are being burned on the outskirts of the city.""

The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that environmental officials had recorded sulfur dioxide levels several times lower than what Windy.com showed.

Chinese billionaire floats conspiracy about coronavirus victim cremation
","As American officials brace for new potential coronavirus outbreaks, a conspiracy theory about the cremation of victims in China is gaining traction online. The source is a website connected to Steve Bannon and an exiled Chinese billionaire. A Facebook video published Feb. 25 by a page called China Declassified asserts that coronavirus patients in Wuhan are being ""cremated alive."" The Chinese city was where the virus, officially known as COVID-19, first broke out in December. The 15-minute clip starts by showing two people wearing face masks in a car. Speaking in Chinese, a woman who is purportedly a Wuhan resident claims she witnessed Chinese officials put a coronavirus patient in plastic bags while still alive.  The video then cuts to unrelated footage of the coronavirus outbreak and a newscast from NTD News. (Screenshot from Facebook) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared thousands of times on several different social media platforms. According to the World Health Organization, the 2019 coronavirus has infected more than 81,000 people in 37 countries. The vast majority of the 2,761 deaths have occurred in China. The Chinese government has ordered the swift cremation of patients who die after contracting the coronavirus. But there is no evidence they are being cremated alive. About two months after the first 2019 coronavirus cases emerged in Wuhan, China’s National Health Commission issued an order requiring hospitals to notify funeral parlors and family members as soon as a patient dies. ""The funeral parlour is responsible for receiving and transporting the remains in time, setting up a special funeral service channel and a special cremation furnace, doing cremation work in accordance with the operating procedures, and issuing a cremation certificate,"" reads the order, which we translated using Google Translate. ""Remains must not be stored or visited, and it is strictly forbidden to open the sealed remains bag during the whole process."" The order states that cremation can take place without their permission, and it prohibits funeral ceremonies. The claim that officials are burning coronavirus patients alive stems from a YouTube video uploaded Feb. 24. RELATED: PolitiFact’s coronavirus coverage in one place The vertical video, which has more than 46,000 views, shows the full clip that was posted by China Declassified. According to subtitles, the woman was purportedly hospitalized for the coronavirus and claims she saw officials put a male patient who was still breathing in several plastic bags and take him away. The video was uploaded by Guo Wengui, a Chinese billionaire and political activist. Wengui fled China in 2014 in anticipation of corruption charges from the Communist Party. Since then, Wengui, who is a member of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, has become known for his criticism of Chinese leaders.  A watermark for G News, the media arm of Wengui’s company Guo Media, appears on the YouTube video. The site, which also employs Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, has previously published misinformation about the coronavirus. Other conspiratorial websites, such as pro-Trump outlet the Epoch Times, have amplified the video on social media. We could find no other evidence that Chinese officials are cremating coronavirus victims alive. And to be clear, at no point does the video offer any firsthand evidence.

Fact-checking Trump’s farm bailout vs. Obama’s GM rescue
","An attack on President Donald Trump’s emergency aid to farmers to offset the impact of trade wars tries to put it in a bad light in contrast with President Barack Obama’s bailout of General Motors. It raises a fair question about repayment, but fudges the figures and the facts. The attack, made in a post on Facebook, claims: ""Fact: Trump's farmer bailout is now twice the size of Obama’s GM bailout. The big difference is GM paid their bailout back — with interest."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Amid a trade war with China, the Trump administration in 2018 authorized $12 billion in payments to American farmers who were hit by retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on U.S. agriculture. In 2019, the administration added $16 billion. That’s a total of $28 billion in direct aid, which won’t need to be repaid. The GM bailout was different in both size and structure. Figuring out the cost of GM’s rescue is complex. The auto industry bailout effort began before Obama took office with a pair of emergency loans from President George W. Bush’s administration for GM and Chrysler through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. With hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, the new Obama administration in 2009 stepped forward with more TARP assistance, including critical debtor-in-possession financing to usher GM through bankruptcy.  With much of its debt converted to stock during those proceedings, the U.S. Treasury emerged with a 60% ownership stake in the reorganized company, which went public again in November 2010. By the time GM sold all of its shares in 2013, the taxpayers had lost $11.2 billion on the bailout. In all, the Bush and Obama administrations invested about $50 billion of TARP money into GM. But ultimately, only $6.7 billion was in loans, which GM repaid, with interest and five years ahead of schedule.  The goal of the government investment ""was never to make a profit, but to help save the American auto industry, and by any measure that effort was successful,"" a U.S. Treasury Department spokesman said at the time. A Facebook post claimed: ""Trump’s farmer bailout is now twice the size of Obama’s GM bailout. The big difference is GM paid their bailout back — with interest."" The Trump administration’s assistance to farmers who have been hurt in the trade war with China is $28 billion — about half the size of the Treasury’s $50 billion bailout of General Motors, not twice the size. Only $6.7 billion of the bailout ended up as loans, which GM did pay back. But in the end, the government lost $11.2 billion in the bailout. Farmers are not expected to repay their aid.

The book ‘End of Days’ described an illness in 2020, but not 'Wuhan-400'
","The book ""End of Days"" by Sylvia Browne explores, well, end of days — ""predictions and prophecies about the end of the world,"" according to the book’s subtitle.

Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.""  The reference to ""Wuhan-400"" comes from the 1981 book ""The Eyes of Darkness"" by Dean Koontz. But Snopes, which fact-checked another claim that Koontz predicted the new coronavirus outbreak, pointed out several ways the current outbreak differs from what’s described in the novel. In the book, for example, Wuhan-400 has a 100% fatality rate. But in China, where more than 77,600 cases have been confirmed, the death toll is 2,663.

Bloomberg adviser slams Bernie Sanders’ decades-old writings about sex, cancer
","Editors’ note: This fact-check contains graphic content and content related to sexual assault. Bloomberg campaign adviser Tim O’Brien ripped Democratic frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders in a CNN interview ahead of the South Carolina primary, accusing the Vermont senator of saying ""loopy stuff"" about orgasms and cervical cancer, children’s nudity and women’s rape fantasies. Yes, you read that right. Not your typical morning on CNN. ""Bernie has all of this loopy stuff in his background, saying things like women get cancer from having too many orgasms, or toddlers should run around naked and touch each others' genitals to insulate themselves from porn,"" O’Brien told CNN ""New Day"" anchor Alisyn Camerota.  ""Why has this stuff not been more surfaced?"" O’Brien said. ""He's written about women's rape fantasies. That hasn’t been surfaced. That’s the loony side of Bernie.""  JUST NOW: @MikeBloomberg Senior Adviser @TimOBrien goes there on @BernieSanders.Orgasms. Rape fantasies. Children running naked. All there.@NewDaypic.twitter.com/EUckLVYNR0 O’Brien’s claim caught our attention and generated a number of headlines, so we decided to check it out. Galia Slayen, a spokesperson for former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s campaign, said O’Brien ""misspoke"" with regard to the claim about cancer and orgasms. ""He meant that Sanders believes it was a lack of orgasms that leads to cancer,"" she said. Now that that’s cleared up, here’s what we found: The Bloomberg adviser was drawing from essays Sanders contributed to a left-leaning alternative newspaper about 50 years ago. Not everything O’Brien said needs a correction. Bloomberg’s campaign cited 2015 articles in the New York Times and Mother Jones that examined Sanders’ writings for the Vermont Freeman in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  According to the New York Times, Sanders wrote roughly a dozen pieces when he was in his late 20s and early 30s, before his political career took off. The writings became a source of controversy for Sanders during his presidential campaign in 2016. We fact-checked a claim related to his essay on women’s fantasies of rape. At the time, Sanders campaign spokesman told CNN the 1972 essay was a ""dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication"" that ""in no way reflects his views or record on women."" Sanders downplayed the writings as ""bad fiction"" and told late-night host Seth Meyers that he ""learned my lesson.""  He said the ""poorly written"" article mentioning rape was meant to confront ""gender stereotypes of the period,"" according to the New York Times. (The Sanders campaign pointed us to his remarks during the 2016 campaign when we asked about his writings.) Below, we’ll compare what Sanders wrote with O’Brien’s descriptions on CNN. O’Brien’s description: ""Women get cancer from having too many orgasms."" Sanders’ 1969 article: Sanders’ point in an essay titled ""Cancer, Disease and Society"" was that lack of sex — rather than too much sex — could lead to poor health or, specifically, cancer.  ""In another article in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine ... it is stated that ‘sexual adjustment seemed to be very poor in those with cancer of the cervix (who) were found to have a lower incidence of orgasm during sexual intercourse,’"" Sanders wrote, quoting a 1954 study. ""The manner in which you bring up your daughter with regard to sexual attitudes may very well determine whether or not she will develop breast cancer, among other things,"" he wrote. Throughout the essay, Sanders quoted freely from various studies and from a book by Austrian psychologist Wilhelm Reich, who believed in connections not only between sexual energy and good health but also between sexual repression and fascism.  For the record, the American Cancer Society has said ""there’s no reason to believe that emotions can cause cancer or help it grow."" O’Brien’s description: ""Toddlers should run around naked and touch each others' genitals to insulate themselves from porn."" Sanders’ 1969 article: ""In Vermont, at a state beach, a mother is reprimanded by Authority for allowing her 6-month-old daughter to go about without her diapers on. Now, if children go around naked, they are liable to see each others sexual organs, and maybe even touch them. Terrible thing! If we (raise) children up like this it will probably ruin the whole pornography business, not to mention the large segment of the general economy which makes its money by playing on peoples sexual frustrations."" Sanders writings often criticized cultural oppression, according to Mother Jones. In one piece, Sanders wrote that a function of schools was to ""set up in children patterns of docility and conformity.""  In the essay in question, which was titled ""The Revolution is Life Versus Death,"" Sanders wrote about the monotony of life, his frustrations with the status quo, and a nonviolent revolution that he believed was on the horizon in the United States.  ""The revolution comes when two strangers smile at each other, when a father refuses to send his child to school because schools destroy children, when a commune is started and people begin to trust each other, when a young man refuses to go to war, and when a girl pushes aside all that her mother has ‘taught’ her and accepts her boyfriend’s love,"" he said. O’Brien’s description: ""He's written about women's rape fantasies."" Sanders’ 1972 article: ""A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees. A woman tied up. A woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously … Do you know why the newspapers with the articles like ‘Girl, 12, raped by 14 men’ sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?’’ The column, ""Man and Woman,"" was about changing gender stereotypes and roles. Later in the essay, Sanders suggested men and women should reconsider how they relate to each other. O’Brien said Sanders has said ""things like women get cancer from having too many orgasms, or toddlers should run around naked and touch each others' genitals to insulate themselves from porn … He's written about women's rape fantasies."" O’Brien got the first detail backwards. Nearly five decades ago, Sanders wrote about the possibility that women could get cancer from having too few orgasms, not too many. Sanders also wrote about a revolutionary order in which toddlers would not be chastised for public nudity, noting that such a world could have negative consequences for the porn industry. Finally, Sanders wrote about women’s rape fantasies in an essay on gender stereotypes. We rate O'Brien's statement Half True.","[('John Berman on Twitter, Feb. 25, 2020', 'https://twitter.com/JohnBerman/status/1232299147455234048'), ('The Vermont Freeman via Mother Jones on DocumentClud, ""Cancer, Disease and Society,"" accessed Feb. 25, 2020', 'No link'), ('The Vermont Freeman via Mother Jones on DocumentClud, ""The Revolution is Life Versus Death,"" accessed Feb. 25, 2020', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2157403-sanders-cancer.html'), ('Snopes, ""Bernie Sanders’ 1972 Essay on Rape,"" Sept. 22, 2015', 'No link'), ('Mother Jones, ""‘You Might Very Well Be the Cause of Cancer’: Read Bernie Sanders’ 1970s-Era Essays,"" July 6, 2015', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2157415-sanders-revolution.html'), ('The New York Times, ""Bernie Sanders’s Revolutionary Roots Were Nurtured in ’60s Vermont,"" July 3, 2015', 'No link'), ('People, ""Bernie Sanders Talks 1972 \'Rape Fantasy\' Essay: \'I Learned My Lesson,’"" June 2, 2015', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bernie-sanders-essay/'), ('Late Night with Seth Meyers on YouTube, ""Senator Bernie Sanders Plans to Vote Against the USA Freedom Act - Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" June 1, 2015', 'No link'), ('NBC News, ""Meet the Candidates: Bernie Sanders,"" May 31, 2015', 'https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/bernie-sanders-vermont-freeman-sexual-freedom-fluoride/'), ('The New York Times, ""Bernie Sanders Recants 1972 Article on Women’s Fantasies of Rape,"" May 29, 2015', 'No link'), ('CNN, ""Bernie Sanders distances himself from \'dumb\' 1972 essay on rape,"" May 28, 2015', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/us/politics/bernie-sanderss-revolutionary-roots-were-nurtured-in-60s-vermont.html?referringSource=articleShare'), ('Mother Jones, ""How Bernie Sanders Learned to Be a Real Politician,"" May 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('American Cancer Society, ""Attitudes and Cancer,"" Feb. 28, 2014', 'https://people.com/tv/bernie-sanders-talks-rape-fantasy-essay-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/'), ('National Cancer Institute, ""Psychological Stress and Cancer,"" Dec. 10, 2012', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Did Bernie Sanders make a rape comment similar to one by Wisconsin Justice Rebecca Bradley?""

Story exaggerates 2014 drug bust on cargo ship owned by McConnell’s family
","Cocaine Mitch? A story from 2016 about a drug bust in Colombia insinuates that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., profits from drug smuggling.   The story was published by a website called ""WarAgainstAllPuertoRicans.com,"" which appears to reference a quote by former Puerto Rico police chief, E. Francis Riggs. The headline reads: ""90 Pounds of Cocaine discovered on a boat owned by the family of Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate."" A cargo ship owned by McConnell’s family was found with cocaine aboard, but the story overstates the incident and suggests without evidence that the family smuggles drugs. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In August 2014, Colombian authorities discovered around 90 pounds of cocaine on a cargo ship scheduled to head to the Netherlands. U.S. Coast Guard and maritime records show that the Ping May is a Liberian-registered bulk carrier owned by the Foremost Group, a New York-based shipping company that controls at least five other vessels. The company was founded by James Chao, McConnell’s father-in-law.  But McConnell’s connection to the seizure is a thin one: No one in the family was named in the incident, and there is no sign that charges were ever filed.  McConnell’s office did not respond to a request for comment.  The story falsely states McConnell was ""linked to the distribution and sale of the cocaine"" and speculates, without evidence, that his wife’s family are smugglers and his political career benefits from drug money.  But the story goes further by stating that McConnell’s family has been ""financing his Senate campaigns with their cocaine drug profits.""  McConnell’s wife, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, received an inheritance valued between $5 million and $25 million after her mother died in 2007. This was years before the 2014 seizure, and there’s no proven connection to a drug business. In 2014, cocaine was discovered on one of the cargo ships owned by McConnell’s family.  But the story exaggerates the seizure and McConnel’s connection. It speculates that, because officials found cocaine on the carrier, the company owned by McConnell’s father-in-law smuggles drugs internationally and uses the money to fund McConnell’s political pursuits. There’s no evidence to support this.  No one was charged in the seizure — not the crew, Foremost Group, the Chaos or McConnell.

Wisconsin lawmaker's jobs claim falls short by one word
","President Donald Trump fulfilled one of his campaign promises in January 2020 when he signed a revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law. The revised deal, known as the USMCA -- United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement -- is a replacement for NAFTA, which Trump described as ""one of the worst trade deals"" in history. In the weeks leading up to the signing of the new agreement, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle weighed in, including Wisconsin’s U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Glenbeulah, who expressed his support on Twitter. ""In #WI, over 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada,"" Grothman said in a Jan. 16, 2020 tweet.  The tweet also featured a graphic, attributed to the National Association of Manufacturers, which read: ""In Wisconsin 44,361 jobs depend on manufacturing exports to Canada and Mexico.""  Is Grothman’s jobs claim correct?  Well, yes and no. It depends if you think it’s accurate to say the Milwaukee Bucks have won more than 10 games this year … when at the All-Star Break they had won 46. Let’s take a look.  The export picture According to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Wisconsin’s top two export markets for 2019 were Canada ($6.7 billion) and Mexico ($3.3 billion). Those far outpace China, which held down the No. 3 spot at $1.4 billion. The top Wisconsin export products in 2019 were industrial machinery ($5.6 billion), electric machinery ($2.4 billion) and medical and scientific instruments ($2.0 billion). When asked for backup for the claim, Grothman staff member Timothy Svoboda pointed to the National Association of Manufacturers graphic as well as the group’s website, which includes the 44,361 number.  The wrinkle: Grothman’s claim spoke of jobs in general that depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, not just manufacturing jobs which -- obviously -- is a smaller segment. As such, he vastly undershoots his target. Grothman’s omission of the word ""manufacturing"" is an example of how a word omission can significantly change the veracity of a statement.  In a phone call with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman acknowledged the mixup. In a Jan. 29, 2020 news release after Trump signed the trade deal, he offered a more accurate total, saying under the deal ""the 231,000 Wisconsin jobs and nearly $11 billion worth of Wisconsin exports supported by trade with Canada and Mexico will be provided a better playing field."" In a tweet, Grothman said that in Wisconsin ""over 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada.""  He actually undershoots the mark, since the 44,000 applies only to manufacturing jobs. The real total of jobs tied to Canada and Mexico trade is 231,000. To be sure, 231,000 jobs is more than the 44,000 jobs claimed in the tweet. But it could also give the impression that only 44,000 jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico -- a figure that is off the mark by an estimated 187,000 jobs, or 80.9% PolitiFact’s definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate or leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Bernie Sanders embraces new study that lowers ‘Medicare For All’ price tag, but skepticism abounds
","UPDATE: This story was updated to include more information about recent studies the Sanders' campaign referenced regarding the costs of single-payer. This update does not change the rating. Defending his signature health plan — a single-payer system known ""Medicare for All"" that would move all Americans to government-funded coverage — Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that the massive health care expansion would actually save the system hundreds of billions of dollars. Sanders’ figures come from a study published Feb. 15 in The Lancet, a British medical journal. ""It said ‘Medicare for All’ will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save the lives of 68,000 people who would otherwise have died,"" Sanders said at the Feb. 25 Democratic presidential debate. The price tag of Medicare for All has been fiercely debated, and some previous analyses have suggested that the proposal would increase health spending, not decrease it. But Sanders is relying on the Lancet paper — which has a cost estimate that is the lowest, in the neighborhood of $17 trillion over 10 years — to argue that the suite of financing mechanisms he has proposed would more than cover the cost of his health bill. (Funding would include taxes on high earners, a new payroll tax, and 4% income premiums for the majority of families.) Most other estimates place the cost between $30 trillion and $40 trillion over a decade, which would make paying for it far more difficult.  So we decided to take a closer look. We reached out to one of the study’s authors, but never heard back.  A spokesperson for the Sanders campaign said the paper is ""similar to 22 other recent studies that have also shown that moving to a single-payer healthcare system will cost less than our current dysfunctional healthcare system."" (We asked for those 22 other studies but, as of publication, hadn’t received them from the campaign. However, an independent researcher provided us with this related analysis.) But other independent experts were skeptical of the Lancet study's estimate — arguing it exaggerates potential savings, cherry-picks evidence and downplays some of the potential tradeoffs. ""I don’t think this study, albeit in a prestigious, peer-reviewed journal, should be given any deference in the Medicare for All debate,"" said Robert Berenson, a fellow at the Urban Institute who studies hospital pricing. Largely, the Lancet paper is more generous in its assumptions than other Medicare for All analysis, noted Jodi Liu, an economist at the RAND Corp., who studies single-payer plans. To the researchers’ credit, she said, they acknowledge that their findings are based on uncertain assumptions. For instance, the researchers calculate $78.2 billion in savings from providing primary care to uninsured people — $70.4 billion from avoided hospitalizations and $7.8 from avoided emergency room visits. But previous evidence suggests that logic is suspect at best.  When states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing new insurance to people who had previously lacked coverage, avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits didn’t disappear because people could suddenly use preventive care, noted Ellen Meara, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. That evidence doesn’t appear anywhere in the Lancet paper. ""The notion that we’re going to get rid of all these avoidable visits — that’s not been borne out,"" she said.  The researchers also assume that a Medicare for All system would pay hospitals at a maximum of Medicare rates. That’s tricky. In 2017, the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimated that, on average, a hospital has a -9.9% margin on a patient who is insured through Medicare. (Private pay helps make up that difference.) Some hospitals certainly would be able to swallow this cost. But others would struggle to stay afloat, said Adrianna McIntyre, a health policy researcher at Harvard University  Given the political influence hospitals in particular carry in Congress — where most members are sensitive to their concerns — passing a plan offering such a low payment rate would be politically challenging. Sanders’ bill doesn’t actually  specify the rates at which hospitals would be paid. Beyond the lower payments, the researchers also suggest hospitals would spend less money on overhead, only having to navigate a single insurance plan. That change accounts for $219 billion in their estimated savings. But again, that ignores some of the reality of how hospitals work. While a single-payer system would undoubtedly cost less to administer — requiring a smaller back-end staff, for instance — it would not eliminate the need for expensive items like electronic health records, which coordinate care between hospitals. ""The assumptions are unrealistic,"" said Gerard Anderson, a health economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ""You are never going to save that much money from the various providers.""  Medicare for All would enroll all Americans in coverage far more generous than what most experience now — eliminating virtually all cost-sharing associated with using health care.  That’s a major change, researchers told us. Previous evidence suggests that such a shift would encourage consumers to use health care more than they currently do.  The Lancet paper acknowledges that — but only partially. It allows that people who are uninsured or ""underinsured"" — that is, who have particularly high levels of cost-sharing now — would use more medical care under Sanders’ system than they currently do. It factors that into the price tag.  But its estimate does not account for people who already have decent or adequate insurance and who would still be moving to a richer benefit, and therefore more likely to use their insurance.  ""It drastically underestimates the utilization increases we would expect to see under Medicare for All,"" McIntyre said. ""People have different views on whether the increased utilization is good or bad,"" she added — it makes the program more expensive, but also means more people are getting treatment. Context is helpful, too. Other estimates — namely, a projection by the Urban Institute — of Medicare for All have suggested it would increase federal health spending by about $34 trillion over 10 years. But elimination of other health spending would make the overall change smaller.  To implement the Sanders proposal, national health spending — public and private dollars, both — would increase by $7 trillion over a decade, Urban said. And Medicare for All would be bringing new services: more insurance for more people, and more generous coverage for those already covered. Urban’s estimate of $7 trillion more in spending over 10 years is far removed from the study’s estimate of $450 billion less annually. And, experts said, relying on the latter figure isn’t a good idea. ""I think they need more work to prove"" the savings, Meara said. ""They’re not being complete, and by not being complete, they’re not being honest."" It’s also worth noting that the study’s lead author was also an informal unpaid adviser to the Sanders staff in drafting its 2019 version of the Medicare for All bill, according to the paper’s disclosures section. Experts agree that expanding access to health insurance would probably reduce early mortality. But the 68,000 figure is another example of cherry-picking, Meara said.  The figure is based on a 2009 paper. It doesn’t acknowledge a body of research that came after, including multiple studies that examined how expanding Medicaid  affected mortality — and maybe offered less dramatic numbers. ""When they so clearly are cherry-picking, when they clearly have all the  information on studies in front of them, it’s concerning,"" Meara said. ""It’s a situation where you’re going to overpromise and underdeliver."" Sanders said a recent study suggested Medicare for All would save $450 billion annually and saves 68,000 lives. That study does exist. And it cites some evidence. But many of its assumptions are flawed, and experts uniformly told us it overestimates the potential savings. It cherry-picks data in calculating mortality effects. This statement has some truth, but ignores context that would create a dramatically different impression. We rate it Mostly False.","[('Bernie 2020, ""How Does Bernie Pay For His Major Plans,"" Feb. 24, 2020.\xa0', 'https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/'), ('The Lancet, ""Improving the Prognosis of Health Care in the USA,"" Feb. 15, 2020.', 'No link'), ('JAMA, ""Association of Medicaid Expansion With 1-Year Mortality Among Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease,"" Dec. 4, 2018.', 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=2d1a7809-2d05-4592-9985-239cb8ab0884'), ('Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, ""2019 Report to the Congress,"" March 15, 2019.', 'No link'), ('University of Michigan, ""Medicaid and Mortality: New Evidence from Linked Survey and Administrative Data,"" Aug. 17, 2019.', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2710505'), ('Email interview with Gerard Anderson, professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Feb. 19, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Robert Berenson, fellow at Urban Institute, Feb. 19, 2020.', 'http://www.medpac.gov/docs/default-source/reports/mar19_medpac_entirereport_sec_rev.pdf?sfvrsn=0'), ('Email interview with Jodi Liu, associate policy researcher at the Rand Corp., Feb. 19, 2020.', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with Ellen Meara, professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard T.H.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared hundreds of times in several different groups. (Screenshot from Facebook) But the post isn’t original — it’s adapted from an old warning issued by South African officials. In October 2017, the South Africa Department of Home Affairs published a warning about groups posing as election officials that were going door to door pretending to check IDs. Once the groups entered people’s homes, they would rob them. In April 2019, the department tweeted a similar statement. The phrasing is almost identical to the Facebook post. #SecurityAlert!!!! pic.twitter.com/JoTamy7K1E In South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs is responsible for immigration and civic services, such as travel documents and citizenship records. There is no such department in the United States. Additionally, the Triangle Park Neighborhood Association is in the Greenville neighborhood of Jersey City, N.J., not Connecticut.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are three ways the agency conducts its decennial count: online, by phone and by mail. By April 1, all Americans should receive an invitation to participate in the survey. If the agency doesn’t hear back by May, it will start following up with households in person. The Census Bureau has debunked the ""Home Affairs"" hoax. While the agency does have employees in neighborhoods across the country, the census takers do not ask residents for identification. They are focused on whether the address is correct. They also carry badges and briefcases that indicate they work for the Census Bureau. Different versions of the Facebook hoax have been circulating online for several years. It’s an example of a ""zombie claim"" — a falsehood that never dies. We found similar posts in community groups in New York, Tennessee, Illinois and South Carolina, as well as India, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the United Kingdom. News outlets spanning from Texas to Malaysia have debunked it. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.","[('Facebook post, Feb. 21, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/groups/231915190180310/permalink/2855141334524336/'), ('Facebook post, Jan. 8, 2020', 'No link'), ('Facebook post, Nov. 4, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/2009180876056522/posts/2188135638161044'), ('Facebook post, Oct. 9, 2019', 'No link'), ('Facebook post, Sept. 12, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/1735968666616552/posts/2555252741354803'), ('Facebook post, Sept. 19, 2019', 'No link'), ('Facebook post, Sept. 21, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/374644839253703/posts/2666250486759782'), ('Facebook post, Sept. 28, 2019', 'No link'), ('Greenville Neighborhood Alliance, accessed Feb. 25, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/363622387310300/posts/992315421107657'), ('KVII-TV, ""Warning of Census Posers Gone Viral,"" Oct. 17, 2019', 'No link'), ('Snopes, ""Did Fake ‘Home Affairs’ Officials Commit a Census-Linked Robbery Scam?""

Fact-checking ties between Bernie Sanders, Socialist Workers Party during Iran hostage crisis
","Bernie Sanders is facing stepped-up attacks over his record of friendly words for authoritarian regimes as he gains support in the early Democratic primaries and caucuses. A viral social media post criticizes Sanders as ""standing alone"" in support of Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis, when militants took over the U.S. Embassy in Iran and held over 50 Americans hostage for 444 days. The post (which wrongly says 70 hostages were held) features images of Sanders, Iran’s former leader Ayatollah Khomeini and President Jimmy Carter and says: ""Socialist Workers Party leader Bernie Sanders supported Ayatollah Khomeini against the US, condemned president Carter for imperialism, and accused the hostages of being CIA spies. ""Is this what Democrats stand for? Bernie Sanders for president? Maybe in Iran. Not in the US."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This claim exaggerates Sanders’ involvement in the Socialist Workers Party and wrongly says Sanders, like the party, labeled some of the hostages spies.  Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, supported the Socialist Workers Party and spoke at some of the organization’s events in the 1980s, but he was neither the leader nor a member. The organization did criticize the Carter administration’s approach to the crisis and suggested some of the embassy hostages were spies. But Sanders did not. The post’s claims appear to come from a January 2020 Daily Beast opinion column by Ronald Radosh headlined, ""When Iran Took Americans Hostage, Bernie Backed Iran’s Defenders."" The Socialist Workers Party is a far-left revolutionary group that originally supported Leon Trotsky, a Soviet communist and Marxist theorist whose beliefs are commonly known as ""Trotskyism."" In the piece, Radosh wrote that in 1980, Sanders ""aligned himself with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), the self-proclaimed Trotskyist revolutionary party. (The column goes too far in saying Sanders joined the party.) The social media post inaccurately jumbles this information. Here’s the historical context. In 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 — the day Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency from Carter, who had faced wide public disapproval over the protracted crisis. The Socialist Workers Party criticized the U.S. government’s approach during the crisis, writing in its newsletter The Militant that Carter’s administration was ""defying the wishes of the vast majority of the American people"" and called on the government to meet Khomeini’s demands, as well as suggesting that some of the hostages were spies. At the time of the hostage crisis, Sanders was in Vermont, running for mayor of Burlington as an independent, though he identified himself at the time as a socialist. Still, we could find no record of any public statements by Sanders on the crisis. Sanders, who was mayor from 1981 to 1989, was not a member of the Socialist Workers Party during or after the Iran hostage crisis, according to multiple contemporaneous news reports.  But Sanders was affiliated with the party, even though Vermont in 1980 did not have a branch, according to The Militant. Sanders served as one of the Vermont Electoral College electors for SWP leader and presidential candidate Andrew Pulley. But Pulley’s candidacy was futile, because he was only 29 years old at the time, too young to be president under the U.S. Constitution (the minimum age is 35). Sanders also spoke at some of the party’s campaign events in 1982 and 1984. In 1980, Sanders said he didn’t support all of the party’s positions, telling the Rutland Daily Herald newspaper (hat-tip Snopes): ""Although I am not in agreement with the SWP on all issues, I strongly support that party’s attempt to become a nucleus for a national labor party, which will fight for the interests of low-income and working people."" Sanders' relationship with the party seems to have largely diminished since then, and he hasn’t publicly addressed his affiliation with the organization during his current campaign for president.  A Sanders campaign spokesperson referred us to their comment for the Snopes story: ""Sen. Sanders did not think the hostages were spies nor did he support their captivity. Any suggestion otherwise is nonsense."" We rate this False.","[('Facebook post, Feb. 18, 2020', 'https://www.facebook.com/TheSilentMajority12/photos/a.155630881228055/1669312289859899/?type=3&theater'), ('The Daily Beast, When Iran Took Americans Hostage, Bernie Backed Iran’s Defenders, Jan. 17, 2020', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Fact-checking the Jan. 17 news shows, Jan. 18, 2016', 'https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-iran-took-americans-hostage-bernie-backed-irans-defenders'), ('The Washington Examiner, Bernie Sanders campaigned for Marxist party in Reagan era, May 30, 2019', 'No link'), ('Snopes, Did Bernie Sanders Express Support for Iran During ’79 Hostage Crisis?, Feb. 5, 2020\xa0', 'https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/jan/18/fact-checking-jan-17-news-shows/'), ('New York Times archives, Socialist Vows to Be Capitol Outsider, Nov. 12, 1990', 'No link'), ('The Militant, Oct. 24, 1980 issue, accessed Feb. 24, 2020', 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/bernie-sanders-campaigned-for-marxist-party-in-reagan-era'), ('The Militant, Nov. 30, 1979 issue, accessed Feb. 24, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Mike Casca, spokesperson for Bernie Sanders campaign, Feb. 24, 2020', 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bernie-sanders-iran-hostage-crisis/')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/25/facebook-posts/fact-checking-ties-between-bernie-sanders-socialis/

Made-up Will Smith quote resurfaces on pro-Trump blog site
","A headline generating interest on social media quotes actor Will Smith as saying, ""I’m not afraid to say that Trump and his supporters are ba…""  The quote isn’t just incomplete. It’s also entirely made-up.  The headline appears in a Feb. 9 story on Trump Train Pro News, a website we’ve fact-checked for recycling bogus quotes about President Donald Trump before. Posts sharing the headline were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the headline broadcasts a fake Smith quote, the text of the Trump Train Pro News story is a slightly altered representation of criticisms Smith lobbed at then-candidate Trump in 2016. The Trump Train Pro News story lifts almost verbatim from an authentic news report published Aug. 3, 2016, by news.com.au, an Australian news outlet. The report features comments Smith made about Trump while promoting ""Suicide Squad,"" a movie about supervillains. The quotes Smith gave to news.com.au made headlines in mainstream British and U.S. news outlets as well, including the Guardian, Time, the Hill and the Washington Post. According to the report, Smith said he hoped Trump wouldn’t win the 2016 election and condemned what he called a ""separatist non-inclusive xenophobic, racist wave that is sweeping the globe."" He said he had no tolerance for Trump’s comments about women and wondered why they didn’t seem to diminish Trump’s support. ""For a man to be able to publicly refer to a woman as a fat pig, that makes me teary. And for people to applaud, that is absolutely f------ insanity to me,"" Smith told news.com.au. In the Trump Train Pro News story, that same quote — and others from Smith’s news.com.au interview — appears as though it was filtered through a thesaurus machine. The Trump Train Pro News version of Smith’s quote about Trump’s comments on women reads: ""Fоr a man tо hаvе the аbіlіtу tо ѕtrаіghtfоrwаrdlу intimate a wоmаn as a fаt ріg, thаt mаkеѕ me mіѕеrаblе. Lіkеwіѕе, fоr реорlе tо endorsement, thаt is аbѕоlutеlу f------frаntісnеѕѕ tо me."" We found no record that Smith made the statement spotlighted in the Trump Train Pro News headline, which isn’t referenced in the body of its story. Other fact-checkers debunked the same false headline when it appeared on another site. Smith was critical of Trump throughout the promotional tour for the August 2016 film.  ""As painful as it is to hear Donald Trump talk, and as embarrassing it is as an American to hear him talk, I think it’s good,"" he said during another press event. ""We get to hear it, we get to know who people are, and now we get to cleanse it out of our country."" The actor made similar remarks about ""cleansing"" racism from the United States during a ""Tonight Show"" interview that same month. But there’s no proof that he said, ""I’m not afraid to say that Trump and his supporters are ba…""  We rate this statement False.","[('Trump Train Pro News, ""ACTOR WILL SMITH: ‘I’M NOT AFRAID TO SAY THAT TRUMP AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE Ba…"" Feb. 9, 2020', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20200219221323/https://www.trumptrain.pro/actor-will-smith-im-not-afraid-to-say-that-trump-and-his-supporters-are-ba-2/?fbclid=IwAR2l1zZ5KMKtV9pM217mSbyBgEwdX66WAi88GwQSdDF1cOxEGv0IudvpZ2k'), ('News.com.au, ""Will Smith really can’t stand Donald Trump,"" Aug. 3, 2016', 'No link'), ('Lead Stories, ""Fake News: Actor Will Smith Did NOT Say: ""I\'m Not Afraid to Say That Trump And His Supporters are Ba...""
