Is Kingston claim more rhetoric than reality?
","In a provocative ad now airing on television and radio, U.S. Senate candidate Jack Kingston tries to tie his Republican runoff opponent, businessman David Perdue, to President Barack Obama. An Obama impersonator leaves a faux voicemail for Kingston, asking him to ""ease up"" on Perdue because ""he’s my kind of guy."" Perdue and Kingston, a veteran U.S. congressman from Savannah, are locked in a heated Republican runoff to be the party’s nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. In November, the winner of the July 22 runoff faces Democrat Michelle Nunn. In his ad, Kingston claims Perdue's company took $3 million from the federal stimulus program that Obama created to jump-start the economy. Kingston opposed the stimulus, and some critics say it was a waste of taxpayer money. But is the claim about a Perdue company taking stimulus money true? Or is it more rhetoric than reality? PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know. Kingston is hardly the first candidate to try to discredit an opponent with claims of connections to the president or to one of Obama’s polarizing initiatives – mainly, the health care overhaul, commonly known as Obamacare, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the ""stimulus plan."" In 2012, Mark Neumann, the leading tea party candidate in Wisconsin’s GOP Senate primary, was on the defensive after acknowledging that his company took $80,000 in stimulus money. He lost the primary to former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. In his ad, Kingston is referring to $3.4 million in stimulus that went to Alliant Energy Co., a Midwest energy holding company that reported $3.2 billion in operating revenue in 2013. Perdue, best known for his leadership of Dollar General, has been on Alliant’s board of directors since 2001, earning about $1.3 million in directors fees, according to records of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, Perdue reported making between $2.1 million and $8.1 million from investment income and corporate board memberships. At the time, in addition to Alliant’s board, he was serving on the board of Sandy Springs-based Graphic Packaging International Inc., California-based Easton-Bell Sports Inc. and Washington-based Liquidity Services Inc. Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said this week that Perdue has acknowledged in the past that he knew of the stimulus grants to Alliant. ""If he was aware, why didn’t he take action to stop them?"" Crawford said. ""If he didn’t take an ownership role in leading the company, why did he take $1 million from the company?"" Perdue campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey said the ad is representative of ""the kind of false and misleading accusations we have come to expect"" from Kingston. Perdue didn’t receive any stimulus money personally and neither did any company he managed, Dickey said. He said Perdue doesn’t recall any board of directors vote at Alliant on the stimulus money and isn’t a fan of that initiative. ""David believes that overall, like most spending by Washington politicians, the stimulus was a waste of taxpayer money that missed its mark while piling on even more debt,"" Dickey said. (Perdue’s campaign has stressed the need to reduce the federal debt and has a running debt clock on its website.) We attempted to contact Alliant to see whether we could review the minutes of the board of directors’ meetings, specifically to see whether there were discussions and/or votes on the stimulus money. We didn’t receive an immediate response. We also reached out to Robert S. Chirinko, a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in corporate governance issues. We asked him about the fairness of an ad suggesting that the stimulus money went to ""one of Perdue’s companies"" when his role at Alliant is as a member of the board of directors. Members of a board of directors ""are merely the trustees of the company and they represent the shareholders’ interests,"" he said. ""In principle, the board makes sure the shareholders/owners get treated fairly and applicable laws and regulations are followed. It could well be the case that the board was not involved in the decision to accept stimulus money."" With a major company the size of Alliant, ""$3.4 million may fly below the board’s radar screen,"" Chirinko said. The Kingston ad mentions the $3 million in stimulus funds. But the Kingston camp says much more stimulus money went to Alliant or its affiliates. The company’s 2012 annual report shows that it has three wind farms that took at least $64 million in stimulus-provided production tax credits and another that took a $62.4 million stimulus cash grant, Crawford said. The Hill also has reported that Graphic Packaging, another company that has Perdue on its board, received a $500,000 stimulus grant. Perdue’s camp suggests Kingston has questions of his own to answer about the stimulus. Dickey said Kingston voted against the stimulus but lobbied for and put out press releases about the federal money being received in Georgia. In summary, the ad makes the claim that one of Perdue’s companies took stimulus money. Perdue sat on four company boards, including at Alliant. That’s a lot different than owning, running or working day to day for a company. We think it’s misleading to say Alliant is his company in an attempt to link him to the president’s stimulus program. It is a company with which he has an affiliation, so there is a bit of truth here, but just a bit. We rate the attack ad statement as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/30/jack-kingston/kingston-claim-more-rhetoric-reality/
"['National', 'Supreme Court', 'Bob Goodlatte']","
GOP leader: Supreme Court has ruled 13 times that Obama exceeded his constitutional authority
","President Barack Obama received a strong rebuke from the Supreme Court last week for his attempt to make appointments when Congress was still technically in session. The 9-0 decision in National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning came just as Speaker John Boehner announced plans to sue Obama for executive overreach. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who defended Boehner’s lawsuit, said the Supreme Court’s ruling was emblematic of Obama’s term. Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the ""9-0 decision last week was the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority."" Has Obama really had such a tough time with the high court? We decided to review the record. Goodlatte isn’t the only person to make this argument. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made a similar claim in a press release last week and it was also the subject of a column in the National Review, a conservative news website. A spokeswoman for Goodlatte gave us a list of the 13 cases he referenced. We reviewed the evidence his office offered enlisted the help of a few experts to help us parse through the legalese. Goodlatte’s assertion doesn’t seem to hold water. Susan Bloch, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University, said the NLRB case is very different than the rest of the cases on the list, in that the court actually was ruling on a separations of power issue and a presidential overreach. ""That’s a fair case of the president’s use of executive authority getting rejected,"" she said. But the rest of the claim? ""It’s a total overstatement,"" Bloch said. Why? For starters, in eight of the cases, the alleged overreach occurred under President George W. Bush, as did the court cases that challenged the administration (United States vs. Jones, Sackett vs. EPA, Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School vs. EEOC, Gabelli vs. SEC, Arkansas Fish & Game Commission v. United States, PPL Corp. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Horne vs. USDA, and Bond vs. United States). Bush’s Justice Department handled the initial court proceedings in most instances. Obama’s Justice Department in many of the cases handled the appellate process and ultimately defended the actions to the Supreme Court. But that’s commonplace, experts we spoke with said. Goodlatte spokeswoman Jessica Collins contended that doesn't make the chairman's statement untrue. ""Regardless of who started the policies that were overturned by the courts unanimously during the Obama administration, President Obama decided to continue those policies which were struck down,"" she said. But that isn't really what Goodlatte claimed. He said Obama ""exceeded his presidential authority,"" not that Obama defended executive overreach. Additionally, in many of the cases, executive overreach wasn’t really even at issue. For example, in United States vs. Jones, the court was ruling on whether the FBI had the power to use a GPS to track a suspect and gather evidence. Technically, the FBI is a federal department under the Justice Department, a department in the executive branch. But the court was not reeling in an administration that was abusing power. Rather, ""it gave us some guidance about how new technology and the Fourth Amendment should interact,"" Bloch said. ""It has nothing to do with presidential authority."" Another case on the list, Arizona vs. United States, surprised our experts. Why? Because many saw it as a partial victory for Obama. This is the case surrounding Arizona’s tough immigration laws that many civil rights groups said amounted to racial profiling. In 2012, the Supreme Court released a complicated 5-3 ruling, in which the court actually sided with the Obama administration on three of four counts. On the fourth provision, which allowed Arizona authorities to check the immigration status of anyone suspected of being an undocumented immigrant, the court basically said it’s too soon to tell, and unanimously decided to send the issue down to the lower courts to monitor for further challenges. ""The Supreme Court struck down three of the four because they interfered with federal immigration enforcement, which was defended by the Obama administration to advocate for the laws passed by Congress,"" Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University. Another case on the list was last week’s ruling in United States vs. Wurie, which was decided along with Riley vs. California. The court ruled that police could not search your cell phone without a warrant if you were arrested. Wermiel said it was ""absurd"" to include the Wurie case on the list. It also originated prior to Obama taking office and was the result of a Boston police effort. Like the Jones case, it dealt with technology issues, not executive overreach. Another case on the Goodlatte’s list and decided last week, McCullen vs. Coakley, dealt with state laws, particular whether a Massachusetts law that put no-protest zones around abortion clinics was constitutional. While the Obama administration filed a brief supporting the Massachusetts law, the issue decided had little to do with executive authority. The last case included, Sekhar vs. United States, did originate under the Obama administration. It’s complicated, but basically the FBI sought extortion charges against a Massachusetts venture capitalist, who was accused of trying to force a legal adviser to the New York state comptroller to persuade the comptroller to invest in his company. The Supreme Court said the FBI couldn’t arrest him under federal extortion laws. In all, how does Goodlatte’s assertion hold up? Not well, our experts said. ""This is a concocted statistic,"" said Tom Goldstein, publisher of the Supreme Court blog SCOTUSblog.com. ""It's just saying that the government lost cases unanimously. The government participates in roughly 60 cases a term. Every administration loses cases unanimously."" ""It's true that the Obama Administration's views have been rejected repeatedly in the Supreme Court. But this way of putting it overreaches considerably."" Our ruling Goodlatte said, the ""9-0 decision last week was the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority."" A thorough review of the 13 cases found many instances where presidential authority was not at issue. Further, most of the cases originated under and were first litigated by the Bush administration. We rate Goodlatte’s statement False.",/factchecks/2014/jun/29/bob-goodlatte/gop-leader-supreme-court-has-ruled-13-times-obama-/

Bill Clinton: 'I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century'
","Former President Bill Clinton defended his wife and potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for saying they left the White House ""not only dead broke, but in debt."" He doubled down on it, in a way, while insisting just because they found success does not mean they are out of touch. ""I think I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office,"" he told host David Gregory in an interview airing June 29, 2014, on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""But I still could have been tone deaf. And, you know, now I don't, and we've got a good life, and I'm grateful for it."" Intrigued by his comment, we wanted to know if it was accurate. Nowadays, the Clintons are not known for living on modest means. A Washington Post report says Bill Clinton earned more than $100 million from speeches given in the U.S. and abroad between January 2001, when he left office, and January 2013, when Hillary Clinton left her role as Secretary of State. She reportedly draws $200,000 for each public appearance, a new talking point among pundits who oppose her potential 2016 presidential candidacy. Clinton is considered the wealthiest living president and among the top-10 all-time wealthiest, with the Clintons’ combined net worth at about $55 million, according to the website 24/7 Wall Street, which started evaluating the net worth of presidents in 2010. But to Clinton’s point, it was not always this way. Clinton’s pre-presidential wealth The Clintons did not move into the White House with old money akin to the political dynasties of the Roosevelts, Kennedys and Bushes. And unlike nearly every other president, Clinton’s wife was the breadwinner ahead of his run for the Oval Office. Clinton sought a political career not long after graduating from Yale Law School in 1973 and marrying Hillary Rodham two years later, first winning a term as Arkansas’ attorney general in 1976 and following it up with five terms as governor. He earned $35,000 a year as governor, consistent with the lower pay of other Southern governors, as well as some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor’s residence. Hillary Clinton, then a lawyer and senior partner in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm’s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a New York Times examination of the couple’s finances in 1992. The Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a statement released a few months later, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the Washington Post. Assets included big gains in their investment portfolio (reaching $387,077) and retirement plans of $180,200, and liabilities included $65,000 mortgage for a half-interest in a condo co-owned with Hillary Clinton’s parents and a $100,000 bank loan from his last governor’s race. Was Clinton counting himself separately from his wife? We don’t know for sure, because our email wasn’t returned. But that would not be consistent with how married couples are usually treated under the tax code, an expert told us. ""Most net worths of individuals, presidents or otherwise, are viewed as joint net worths,"" said Barbara Perry, senior fellow and associate professor in the University of Virginia Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program. ""Most of these (presidents) did not have spouses with their own high income."" Comparing against other presidents While we have a good picture of Clinton’s net worth, it is more difficult to gauge the net worths of many other presidents who served in the 20th century. The 24/7 Wall St. research is helpful but does not detail presidents’ net worth before taking office -- the crux of what we’re checking. We heard from several experts on presidents who said the data we need is just not available. Problems include a lack of uniform candidate financial disclosure requirements, inflation and changing national circumstances. ""It’s one of those Clintonesque statements that can be true but who knows?"" said Lewis Gould, a visiting distinguished professor at Monmouth College and scholar of William McKinley. We know some presidents are not really in the conversation. Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy all came from wealthy families, while Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush all either were successful in real estate or investments, or both. Others came from a career in public service and did not have significant family wealth, including Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Woodrow Wilson. Often, people discussing the least monied presidents -- especially in the 20th century -- turn to Harry S. Truman. Truman’s money problems and bankruptcy-dodging as a result of his failed haberdashery business in the 1920s are no secret. With debts over his head, he continued to climb political ladders, first as a county judge and ultimately as U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death in 1945. Truman continued to live modestly as a senator and vice president, residing in a two-bedroom apartment in Washington, D.C., shared with his wife Bess, daughter Margaret and ailing mother-in-law. Truman’s mother-in-law, not Truman, owned the well-known Truman Home in Independence, Mo., said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and distinguished professor of history emeritus at Ohio University. Even as a U.S. senator in 1935 earning $10,000, Truman was not in a solid enough financial position to save the family farm owned by his mother, Hamby said. So even though it’s not clear what his net worth was before he became president, Hamby said, ""I find it very hard to believe that Bill Clinton was in a tighter financial situation."" Another contender, though his term straddles the 19th and 20th centuries, is William McKinley, who was assassinated six months into his second term on September 1901. Based in Canton, Ohio, McKinley practiced law before becoming Ohio governor. The economic collapse of 1893 dealt him a personal financial setback during his time as governor, as he had co-signed loans from a friend who ended up going bankrupt (his friends helped him raise the money). He took office in 1897 and left an estate of $250,000 when he died, Gould said. We also found a document through the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggesting that the 38th president took office with a relatively small net worth. The document, with a date of Oct. 29, 1973 (which would have been a year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378. That would have the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992, when adjusted for inflation. Russell Riley, co-chair of the Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program and director of the Clinton Presidential History Project, said Clinton’s claim did not strike him as much of an exaggeration, ""if an exaggeration at all."" ""He may have taken it one step too far by asserting he was No. 1 on the list, but if he’s not No. 1 he’s somewhere near the top,"" Riley said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office."" Without a doubt, Clinton’s net worth was one of the lowest of 20th century presidents, experts told us. Whether it was the lowest is hard to say, and we could not find information to support it. There’s a good case to be made that Truman entered the White House with a (albeit unknown) smaller net worth. There’s not enough evidence to prove Clinton correct, but he is at least right in his larger point: He did not enter the White House with the wealth of many of his contemporaries. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/29/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-i-had-lowest-net-worth-any-american-p/

Ted Cruz says most people caught at the border are coming because of 'amnesty'
","People have increasingly crossed into Texas over the Rio Grande because they think Uncle Sam has open arms, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said the other day. Cruz, at a San Antonio press conference with fellow Republicans Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, said a May 2014 government survey of over 200 people apprehended trying to enter the country illegally proves his point. Asked ""why are you coming here?,"" Cruz said, ""95 percent said we are coming  because we’ve been promised amnesty. We are coming because if we get here, we were told that we are allowed to stay, that we will have a permiso."" We wondered if most recent arrivals are citing expectations of amnesty. Record crossings Tens of thousands of people, including children mostly from Central American countries, have been crossing the border, resulting in a record number of non-Mexicans getting apprehended. Accounts have varied on why more are coming than before. For instance, a June 16, 2014, National Journal news story quoted Leslie Velez, a senior protection officer at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, as saying its 2014 interviews of 404 children revealed many were fleeing violence and crime in their home countries. Survey says... And what was Cruz citing? By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out June 2014 news stories in The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner summarizing a Border Patrol survey reportedly brought to light in an undated document Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, placed into the records of the Senate Judiciary Committee at a June 2014 hearing. A copy of Grassley’s document, emailed to us by Texas Sen. John Cornyn’s office, describes May 2014 interviews of adults and children by Border Patrol officers in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector. By telephone, Grassley spokeswoman Beth Pellett Levine said the senator knows a whistleblower summarized the interviews, though she said that as of June 24, 2014, Homeland Security hadn’t confirmed or denied the document’s authenticity. By email, a Del Rio-based Border Patrol spokesman, Dennis Smith, declined to comment on the four-page document. According to the document, the agents interviewed 230 adults and unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala on May 28, 2014. The focus, the document says, was to ""obtain a general consensus as to why"" the border crossers ""are migrating en masse"" into the country through the Rio Grande Valley. The word ""amnesty"" doesn’t appear in the summary of results. Also, the document says in many cases, ""the subjects mentioned more than one reason,"" including gang-related violence, extreme poverty, high unemployment, poor living conditions and subpar educational circumstances -- with many women mentioning domestic abuse. Still, the document says, the main reason interviewed individuals ""chose this particular time to migrate"" was to ""take advantage of the ‘new’ U.S. ‘law’ that grants a ‘free pass’ or permit (referred to as ‘permisos’) being issued by the U.S. government to female adult"" non-Mexicans ""traveling with minors and to"" unaccompanied children."" The document says the issue of ""permisos"" was the ""main reason provided by 95% (+/-) of the interviewed subjects."" The document doesn’t confirm any new law and we’re unaware of any. Confusingly, too, the document says the permisos are ""Notice to Appear"" documents, but it also says those documents aren’t free passes to stay in the country. Rather, the document says, the notices are routinely issued to undocumented entrants ""when they are released on their own recognizance pending a hearing before an immigration judge."" The document goes on to say the granting of permisos ""is apparently common knowledge in Central America and is spread by word of mouth, and international and local media. A high percentage of the subjects interviewed stated their family members in the U.S. urged them to travel immediately, because the United States government was only issuing ‘permisos’ until the end of June 2014,"" while several people said they’d heard they’d be issued only through May 2014, the document says. Most unaccompanied children, the document says, stated they were going to join a parent or parents or other family members already in the country. The children ""stated they wanted to take advantage of the ‘permiso’ being issued by the U.S. government to minors traveling alone."" Many children cited high crime in their countries and forced recruitment into gangs, the document says, with others mentioning educational opportunities in the U.S. Outside lawyers: ‘It’s not amnesty’ To our telephone inquiries, immigration lawyers who looked over the Grassley-publicized document offered different interpretations of the references to permisos. Each one also said it would be inaccurate to interpret the permisos as amnesty, as in passes to remain in the country without risk of being deported or other penalties. Elizabeth Lee Young of the University of Arkansas School of Law, who emailed us a ""Notice to Appear"" document, characterized it as an immigration court summons. ""Most of the people know it’s a notice to go to court,"" Young said. Anyone who doesn’t show up for their court date, she said, is subject to immediate deportation. Significantly, Young said, no one caught after crossing is given a work permit, which is how she said she usually interprets ""permiso."" Detainees given a notice near the border, the lawyers told us, can then be held in a government facility or released deeper into the country on personal recognizance -- as children and women with children often are, the lawyers said. Toni Maschler, a Washington, D.C., attorney, said generally, she considers a permiso a permit, like a driver’s license, and not the notice to appear for an immigration hearing. Maschler speculated the document’s references to permisos were really to the document that releases someone on their own recognizance. Lisa Brodyaga, a lawyer in San Benito, close to the Texas-Mexico border, similarly said the document’s references to permisos probably mean paperwork related to releases on personal recognizance, which she said clear the way for women and unaccompanied children to leave the border region; men, for the most part, she said, are kept in detention. Each release ""allows you to get out of detention, allows you to travel, it allows you to go be with your family,"" Brodyaga said, ""and, as long as you go to your hearings when you have them, it allows you to stay in the United States. It’s a ‘permit,’ until you get deported."" ""It’s nowhere near amnesty,"" Brodyaga said, which would mean ""you are forgiven for something. You’re not forgiven. You’re subject to the laws of the United States… This does not entitle them to remain indefinitely."" Similarly, Maschler said the release on personal recognizance is ""not amnesty. It doesn’t give anybody a permanent right to stay in the United States."" Young said: ""Amnesty would indicate some form of legal waiver of your undocumented presence or entry. That is not the situation."" Apprised of the lawyers’ assessments, Cruz’s spokeswoman said by email Cruz didn’t say that any legal papers deliver amnesty to border crossers. The point is people are coming because they think they’ll be allowed to stay, as they have been, Frazier said. Our ruling Cruz said a survey indicates 95 percent of people caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border said ""we are coming because we’ve been promised amnesty."" This statement accurately recaps a statistic in a document made public by another senator: 95 percent of 230 adults and unaccompanied children interviewed recently by the Border Patrol gave as the main reason for their journeys the U.S. government issuing permisos, which the document defines as notices to appear in immigration court enabling recipients to stay in the country at least until then. But that’s not ""amnesty,"" as in an absolution enabling people to stay indefinitely without risk of penalty, and indeed ""amnesty"" goes unmentioned in the survey summary. Also, as unsaid by Cruz, the immigrants listed other reasons for coming, including crime and violence in home countries. The document, with its anonymous origins, doesn’t specify how many individuals singled out these other factors. Another study, in which the United Nations earlier surveyed twice as many immigrants, pointed to gang violence as the vital factor.

Allan Fung: GOP challenger Ken Block was fined for illegally funneling money to his Moderate Party
","During the June 17 Providence Journal - WPRI-TV debate between the Republican candidates for governor, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said his GOP rival, businessman Ken Block, was caught illegally funneling money to the Moderate Party that Block founded. That was before Block changed his affiliation to become a Republican. The comment came after Block criticized Fung for accepting campaign money from the city's police union. (The department was ultimately caught up in a parking ticket scandal, a controversy Fung has been accused of mismanaging.) Fung, in response, said he was not going to be lectured on ethics by someone who ""has been fined by the state Board of Elections for funneling money into his Moderate Party."" Fung repeated the allegation two minutes later, telling Block, ""The fact that you were fined and had to admit that you funneled money illegally to the Moderate Party speaks for itself."" To evaluate Fung’s claim, we first turned to The Journal’s December 2009 story. We also examined emails and the original consent decree signed by Block. Block founded the Moderate Party in 2007 and was its chairman in 2009. He successfully sued the Board of Elections in federal court over its rules that hampered establishment of new political parties. He would subsequently be the Moderate Party's candidate for governor in the 2010 election. On Monday, Sept. 21, 2009, he made a $10,000 party-building donation to the state Moderate Party. Most political donations are capped at $1,000 each year per person but that cap increases to $10,000 if the money is designed for ""party building"" to cover expenses related to staffing, rent and utilities, but not to winning a specific election. That same day, Block sent an email to Richard E. Thornton, director of campaign finance at the Rhode Island Board of Elections, asking if, ""Using the most extreme example, an individual donor can make a $10,000 'party building' donation to every State Committee and every Town Committee of every political party in the State every year."" The goal was to establish Moderate Party town committees in all 39 cities and towns. Thornton initially wrote back to say that would be allowed. But 74 minutes later, Thornton sent a followup message saying, ""I need to do some additional research . . . before I can confirm that your assessment is accurate."" ""OK, Rick. Please let me know when you have more clarification on this issue,"" Block responded. Thornton then said the board would need to issue a full advisory opinion on the matter. Block, already at odds with the board over the federal lawsuit, didn't want to wait. He subsequently informed Thornton that he had made a second $10,000 donation, this time to the Barrington Moderate Party Town Committee. But two days later, the Barrington group transferred the money to the state Moderate Party. Ultimately, the board concluded that Block had violated campaign finance law in two ways: first, by making the second donation and second, because the Barrington committee had shuttled the money to the state committee. The two sides eventually settled for a $2,000 fine, to be paid personally by Block, who also  signed an admission of wrongdoing. ""I do believe that given the time and energy, we could have proven that we were right. But the election would have come and gone by then,"" Block said at the time. ""It just made much more sense to put it behind us."" Today, Block argues that when he sought advice, ""They never actually said, 'No. Don't do this. You can't do it.'"" ""We were completely in the open about doing this,"" Block said. ""Their overreaction to what we had done is a classic Rhode Island political payback story."" Fung, during the debate, didn't go into details. He simply said that Block was ""fined and had to admit that [he] funneled money illegally to the Moderate Party."" We rate the claim as True.

Ken Block knocks Republican Allan Fung's donations to controversial Democrats
","One of the issues in the Republican primary for governor is which candidate is more of a Republican. During the June 17 Providence Journal - WPRI debate businessman Ken Block attacked Cranston Mayor Allan Fung's past financial support of Democrats. ""Did you know that Mayor Fung was a registered Democrat and he donated to Democrats like Congressman David Cicilline, disgraced [House] speaker Gordon Fox and even Mr. Obamacare, Harry Reid,"" Block said. The thought of a Republican giving money to Cicilline (who left Providence deeply in debt when he served as mayor), Fox (who left his post after federal investigators raided his office and home), and Reid (the U.S. Senate Majority Leader who championed the Affordable Care Act), would make most loyal members of the Grand Ol' Party cringe. So we decided to see whether Block was fairly characterizing the facts. To put everything in context, it's worth noting Fung's voting history. Cranston records show that Fung originally registered to vote in 1990, as a Democrat. He voted in the 1992 Democratic primary. He switched to unaffiliated in 1994 and back to Democrat in 1998, but then voted in the 1998 Republican primary. Since then he has voted in seven primaries, always as a Republican. Block's office sent us campaign finance data on Fung's contributions to the three Democrats, showing he donated to each candidate once. We confirmed the information on state and federal websites. But Block’s characterizations of Cicilline, Fox and Reid suggest the donations to them were recent. In fact, they weren’t. For example, the most recent of the three donations Block cited was Fung's $150 contribution to Fox. It was made in February 2008. Fox was House Majority Leader at the time, two years away from being elected speaker. The raid on his office was six years in the future. And even today, Fox has not been charged with any wrongdoing by state or federal authorities. The donation to Harry Reid, for $250, came in June 2004. Reid was the Senate Minority Whip. Obamacare wasn't even a gleam in Reid's eye when he got the money. The Cicilline donation for $250 is the oldest, made in March 2002. At the time, Cicilline was a state representative poised to run for mayor of Providence. When we asked Fung's campaign about the donations, spokesman Patrick Sweeney said the three donations of $650 should be compared to 113 donations Fung has made to Republicans totaling more than $25,000. Our ruling Ken Block said Allan Fung ""donated to Democrats like Congressman David Cicilline, disgraced [House] speaker Gordon Fox and even Mr. Obamacare, Harry Reid."" His statement is true to the extent that Fung donated once to each of those politicians. But his characterizations of the recipients were misleading. He referred to Cicilline as a congressman, but Cicilline was a state representative when Fung gave him money. He labeled Fox as the ""disgraced"" House speaker, but Fox was majority leader at the time of the Fung donation, and not under investigation. And the word ""Obamacare"" hadn’t even been coined when Fung donated to Reid. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at [email protected] And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.) (On July 1, 2014, we removed an incorrect reference to when Fox and Cicilline served in the Rhode Island General Assembly. The change does not affect our ruling.)",/factchecks/2014/jun/29/kenneth-block/ken-block-knocks-republican-allan-fungs-donations-/

In Democratic Party video ad, Scott Walker nods yes when asked if he’s part of ‘criminal scheme’
","Five days after an unsealed legal brief spelled out John Doe prosecutors’ suspicions that Gov. Scott Walker helped run a ""criminal scheme"" to violate campaign laws, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin posted a web video. The video, ""Wisconsin Deserves Better,"" ends with a question-and-answer segment in which Walker appears to acknowledge guilt. That sequence starts with audio of part of a question asked of Walker by reporter Charles Benson of WTMJ-TV, the NBC affiliate in Milwaukee. He was among a group of reporters seeking Walker’s reaction on June 19, 2014, after the legal brief came out as part of a lawsuit by a conservative group under investigation in the Doe probe. Benson, not shown at first, is heard saying to Walker: ""...that you are the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?"" Abruptly, the audio goes out, the video goes to slow motion, and Walker nods his head up and down with eyes closed and sort of a grim look on his face. ""Our State Deserves Better"" appears on the screen as the video ends without any verbal evidence of Walker’s response to Benson. The video is on the party’s YouTube channel, and was promoted on its Facebook page and state party’s website. Tale of the tape At the bottom of the screen during the sequence with Benson and Walker, the video credit appears to be WEAU-TV, the NBC affiliate in Eau Claire. The station picked up the feed from WTMJ and aired it June 20. But the report originally aired on WTMJ, so we looked at the station’s segment regarding the release of the prosecution’s brief and Walker’s reaction. We examined the relevant parts of the TMJ interview, and the Dem video, and created our own video with those clips back to back. In the WTMJ segment, anchors introduce the story and then go to Benson, who says, ""Well, the new documents are public after conservative groups sued in Federal Court to stop the investigation. Prosecutors allege a criminal scheme. Walker says the allegations from a partisan Milwaukee D.A. are false."" After showing some highlights of the prosecution’s theory of the case, the segment cuts to Benson questioning Walker. It’s the complete version of the sequence truncated by the Dems in their video. The first tipoff to the fact that the Dem video is manipulated: In the WTMJ segment, unlike in the Dem video, Benson is on screen when he asks Walker: ""Prosecutors in the John Doe investigation allege that you are at the center of a criminal scheme. Are you?"" ""No,"" Walker says immediately, shaking his head side to side. The WTMJ segments cuts away at that point, back to Benson, who says: ""Walker says no laws were broken, and the case was rejected by two judges who have reviewed the allegations."" Finally, WTMJ cuts back to the reporters interviewing Walker, who is shown saying, ""And I asked people to look at the facts, and the facts are pretty clear. A judge at the state and the federal level made it clear that they didn’t buy into this argument. They said to move on."" It doesn’t take a degree in YouTube to see that Walker actually bobbed his head ""yes"" during Benson’s question, not in response to Benson. (As those who follow Walker know, he uses the head bob frequently when listening to people as he campaigns or when taking in reporters’ questions.) We asked Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Mike Tate about the discrepancy between the two videos. Tate referred us to party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff, who acknowledged that it appears Walker shakes his head yes in the party’s video. It wasn’t intentional or an attempt to mislead, Baldauff said. The party was trying to ""layer together clips"" of news coverage of the Doe issue and about the jobs reports that came out the same week, she said. Walker campaign spokesman Tom Evenson wasn’t buying that explanation Friday. ""This Democrat Party propaganda is another attempt to mislead the voters from the facts and distract from Mary Burke's failed record as Jim Doyle's commerce secretary,"" Evenson said, referring to Walker’s leading Democratic Party challenger in the fall governor’s race. WTMJ news director Janet Hundley and WEAU general manager Terry McHugh assisted PolitiFact in locating video of the Walker segment. Neither wanted to comment on the Dem video. Our rating A Democratic Party web video making the rounds on social media shows a grim-faced Gov. Scott Walker appearing to bob his head yes to a reporter’s question about whether he was at the center of a ""criminal scheme"" to evade campaign finance laws. In real life, the governor answered an emphatic ""no"" --  not surprising given he’s been denying any wrongdoing since new documents were released in the John Doe investigation. The Dem video, in its editing of the WTMJ clip, leaves the viewer with the misleading and ridiculous impression that Walker is somehow admitting guilt in the case. That’s the definition of Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/jun/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-video-ad-scott-walker-nods-yes-wh/

Do an average of nine children a day die in the United States of gunshot wounds?
","Editor’s Note: We rarely find it necessary to re-examine a PolitiFact Oregon fact-check, but this was an exception. Our original fact-check, based  largely on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that a claim by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was Mostly True. However, readers brought significant new information to light that we thought warranted a new analysis -- and ultimately a new ruling. We are committed to finding the facts even if they emerge after we’ve published. In the wake of the Reynolds High School shooting in Troutdale that left two students dead June 10, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation’s leading gun control advocacy groups, has once again been urging parents to lock up guns and ammunition in separate gun lockers. The claim: At a June 17, 2014, rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: ""9 kids every day will never have another birthday."" Were Emilio Hoffman, the victim at Reynolds, and Jared Padgett, the shooter, just two of nine children who die from gun violence on any given day? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to find out. The analysis: In an email, Brady Campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Fuson said the number is based on a five-year average of government data recording children who died from gunshot wounds. The ages range from infants to 19. Using the same age range, we obtained the same numbers from an online database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2007 to 2011, the most recent data available, 14,258 children died as a result of gunshot wounds. The circumstances range widely: accidental shootings by adults, kids who gained access to unsecured guns, gang violence, suicide and planned shootings like the incident at Reynolds High School on June 10, 2014. The numbers work out to 7.81 deaths a day, about one fewer than the Brady Campaign claimed. We presented this information to Heidi Yewman, a member of the national Brady Campaign board, who organized the rally. She acknowledged that the number presented at the rally was incorrect. A volunteer accidentally wrote the wrong number on the chalkboard display, she said. Nine children are unintentionally shot and survive every day, she said, but those children are in addition to the eight who are shot — intentionally and unintentionally — and die. ""It’s really important we don’t exaggerate the number, because it undermines what we’re saying,"" Yewman said in a phone interview. ""That was unfortunate and somewhat misleading."" She added: ""Certainly there was no conspiracy to mislead the public."" The national Brady Campaign spokeswoman confirmed the figure. ""It is correct to say that 8 children and teens die from gun violence every day,"" Fuson said in an email. ""It is also correct to say that 9 children and teens are shot unintentionally."" We checked the nonfatal number as well and found that 8.86 children are unintentionally shot each day and survive, according to the CDC’s nonfatal injuries database. But those two numbers — eight gun-related deaths and nine injuries per day — do not show the whole picture. PolitiFact Oregon obtained a breakdown by age from the CDC’s online database and found that about half of all youth gun deaths — 7,223 of 14,258 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. The same goes for unintentional injuries, roughly 46 percent of which — 7,479 of 16,172 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. Remove those two years from the calculation, and there are an average of 4.76 unintentional injuries each day and 3.85 deaths. That is significant given the use of the word ""children"" in the Brady Campaign’s display, along with a chalkboard and shoes suited to children younger than 12. In addition, people 18 and older are legally considered adults. They are allowed to buy guns and ammunition without parental consent, and are solely responsible for crimes they commit using those weapons. We asked Fuson, the Brady Campaign spokeswoman, to find out why the campaign includes 18- and 19-year-olds in its calculation. In an email, she said the campaign used the CDC’s own metrics for measuring unintentional injuries. She pointed us to a report published by the center examining childhood injuries from 2000-06. The CDC did use data for ages 0-19, including injuries. The center uses the same age range in The National Action Plan for Child Injury Prevention.   The CDC is the nation’s leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. The federal database includes information on thousands of death and emergency room records, and is regularly cited by lawmakers and activist groups. Data is categorized by four-year age ranges — 15-19 year olds, for example — in addition to many other metrics such as year, race and sex of victims. Users can also search the CDC website for statistics by any age or range. It is important to note, however, that the CDC says its data for unintentional gun injuries among children 16 and younger is shaky because the samples sizes are small. Another wrinkle: The agency has been caught in political cross-fire, with right-wing critics saying it collects and presents data in a way that supports gun-control efforts. Liberal supporters, meanwhile, say that criticism has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun injuries and deaths. In short, not everyone agrees CDC data are unassailable. Last year, President Barack Obama ordered the CDC, in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings, to begin studying the causes of gun violence. That information is not yet available. The ruling: At a rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: ""9 kids every day will never have another birthday."" PolitiFact Oregon checked that claim against government data using the Brady Campaign’s age range of 0-19, and found that about 7.81 children and teens die each day from gun violence, based on the most recent five-year average available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heidi Yewman, who organized the rally in Vancouver, said the incorrect number was a volunteer’s mistake. We found the difference between eight and nine not hugely significant. It’s horrible that children are dying of gunshot wounds, of course, but the difference in the two numbers is unlikely to materially change the debate about gun control. But including 18- and 19-year-olds, who are not ""children"" under legal and other definitions, significantly skews the numbers, making the problem seem much worse than it is. Because the group’s claim contained an element of truth but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Charlie Crist signed 'the nation’s harshest marijuana laws,' ad says
","A radio ad attacking former Gov. Charlie Crist accuses him of signing the nation’s ""harshest marijuana laws."" And it’s aimed at a voting bloc that overwhelmingly sides with Democrats: African-Americans. ""While Crist was coddling the gun lobby, he was cracking down on us,"" says the ad from Progressive Choice Florida, a 501(c)4 group that’s been attacking Crist from the left. "" Passing maximum sentencing laws. Signing the nation’s harshest marijuana laws. And enacting the country’s strictest penalties against non-violent offenders – many of whom just happen to be black."" We wanted to know if Crist had signed ""the nation’s harshest marijuana laws."" That claim caught our attention because one of Crist’s chief backers is attorney John Morgan, who’s been bankrolling a campaign urging a constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana. Our research showed that Florida is tough on those busted for pot, but that reputation began long before Crist was governor. Marijuana law during Crist’s tenure Progressive Choice Floridapointed to two bills signed by Crist: House Bill 173, the Marijuana Grow House Eradication Act in 2008, and the so-called ""Bong Bill"" outlawing drug paraphernalia in 2010. The grow house law made it a second-degree felony to grow 25 or more plants; the previous law set the threshold at 300 plants. The bill also allowed law enforcement to destroy bulky grow house equipment and simply take photos or video. While law enforcement widely supported the bill, advocates for marijuana and the ACLU of Florida opposed it. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and only one representative, Broward Democrat Evan Jenne, voted against it. Jenne told PolitiFact Florida that he opposed the provision that allowed law enforcement to destroy evidence. Though Crist signed the bill, the champion of it was then-Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum, who two years later lost a primary in the governor’s race against Scott. William Shepherd, who worked for McCollum at the time, said he doesn’t know what ""harshest"" would mean or how Florida’s law compared to other states. (The federal standard was 100 plants.) However, he said the grow house bill was a major change for Florida. ""We definitely ramped up the marijuana production laws,"" he said. In March 2008, Crist told a Miami Herald reporter that he favored Florida's tough drug laws and didn't support reviewing whether to lessen penalties for some crimes such as nonviolent drug possession. Two years later, the bong bill made it a crime to sell smoking devices such as pipes and bongs at most head shops. We found no evidence that Crist pushed hard for the bill, which he signed after the Legislature unanimously passed it in 2010. Were Florida laws 'harshest'?  We reached out to experts on marijuana laws to ask if Florida held some sort of record for having ""the nation’s harshest marijuana laws."" Comparing state drug policies is difficult at best, because each state codifies offenses and sentences in different ways, according to Tamar Todd, an attorney with the pro-decriminalization Drug Policy Alliance. ""One of the challenges of cross-state comparison is that some states might be harsher, in that cultivation of any amount is a felony with a harsh sentence, but at the same time cultivation in the presence of a minor is not a separate more serious offense,"" Todd said. ""Other states classify crimes differently than degrees of felonies."" He added that how much time offenders actually get may differ, because states often employ diversion programs or habitual offender statutes, muddying the waters concerning sentencing records. Other advocates for legalizing at least some uses of marijuana or reforming marijuana laws told PolitiFact Florida that the state had long had a reputation for tough marijuana laws -- and that didn’t suddenly occur when Crist was governor. Allen St. Pierre, executive director of NORML which advocates for reform of marijuana laws, pointed to a handful of states that he said have laws that are equally or more harsh than Florida’s including Georgia, Texas, Idaho, Missouri and Wyoming. ""Florida, ever since the early 1980s, has historically (and) traditionally always had pretty harsh laws,"" St. Pierre said. The bills Crist signed as governor didn’t change Florida’s reputation in terms of marijuana laws, he said. ""In general, no drug policy reform group, including NORML, viewed the passage of the 2008 anti-cultivation laws as being particularly harsh as much as we did out-of-touch with where most rest of the country is moving politically on cannabis policy,"" St. Pierre told PolitiFact Florida. Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, wrote an article in 2011 about ""The Five Worst states to get busted with pot."" The ""top 5,"" in order of severity, were Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Louisiana and Arizona. ""No other state routinely punishes minor marijuana more severely than does the Sunshine State,"" he wrote. ""Under Florida law, marijuana possession of 20 grams or less (about two-thirds of an ounce) is a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one-year imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Marijuana possession over 20 grams, as well as the cultivation of even a single pot plant, are defined by law as felony offenses – punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine."" A Progressive Choice Florida spokeswoman cited an analysis of state laws and sentencing guidelines written by Jon Gettman, a former NORML director. He wrote that, ""The states with the most severe overall penalties for marijuana possession are (in order of severity) Florida, Montana, Arkansas, Georgia and Oregon (tied) and Missouri."" But Gettman’s article was based on 2007 arrests and laws in place before Crist was governor. NORML board member Florida attorney Norm Kent told PolitiFact Florida that he considers our state’s laws ""draconian and amongst the toughest"" but doesn’t consider Florida the worst in the nation. (Kent endorsed Crist earlier this year.) ""What happens on the third strike in Texas is you can get life in prison if it’s a marijuana charge,"" he said. Our ruling A radio ad says that Charlie Crist signed ""the nation’s harshest marijuana laws."" As governor, Crist signed laws that cracked down on grow houses and bong sales. But both bills sailed through the Legislature without any particular advocacy from Crist. In both cases, the laws didn’t change Florida’s pre-existing reputation as having tough marijuana laws.

Barack Obama says, 'In 31 states, decent child care costs more than college tuition'
","President Barack Obama recently headlined a White House Summit on Working Families. During his address, he made a striking -- and for families with young kids, rather terrifying -- claim about how much child care costs. ""In most parts of the country, it costs thousands of dollars a year,"" Obama said in the June 23, 2014, speech. ""In fact, in 31 states, decent childcare costs more than in-state college tuition. In 31 states -- in more than half the states."" Really? It costs more than college? We decided to take a look. We tracked down the source of the claim -- a 2013 report by Child Care Aware of America, which describes itself as the ""nation’s leading voice for child care."" After surveying child care providers in all 50 states, the report concludes that ""in 2012, in 31 states and the District of Columbia, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college."" Among the 50 states, the costs for infant care in center-based care ranged from $5,467 in Alabama to $16,430 in Massachusetts. Tuition and fees ranged from $4,278 in Wyoming to $14,576 in New Hampshire. That seems pretty close to what Obama said. (We’re not going to quibble over the definition of ""decent"" -- while it’s a subjective term, ""decent"" seems roughly equivalent to ""average,"" which is how the study reported its figures.) Still, Obama’s claim oversimplifies the issue a bit. It’s worth noting some clarifying language in the report --""for an infant in center-based care"" -- that is absent from Obama’s statement. This is actually the highest-cost example of the four cases the report looked at. If you look at the cost for a 4-year-old in center-based care -- rather than an infant -- it costs more than in-state college tuition and fees in 19 states. That’s 39 percent fewer states compared with statistics for infant care. (Generally, care for infants is more intensive, so costs tend to go down as children get older.) The report also looked at costs for home-based care, which is often a less expensive option for parents. For infants, the cost of home-based care is higher than college costs in 14 states. That’s a 55 percent reduction in states compared to Obama’s 31. And for 4-year-olds, the cost of home-based care is higher than college in 10 states. That’s a 68 percent reduction in states compared to Obama’s 31. So Obama chose the most dramatic number of the four presented by the report -- a bit of cherry-picking. Using infant care in centers ""as a comparison for the costs of college could be considered cherry-picking,"" said Stephen Wood, a research analyst for Child Care Aware of America. But he added that her group's study put emphasis on that comparison because it involved ""the most in-demand form of early childhood education (infants in centers) and the most in-demand form of post-secondary education (four-year public colleges)."" It’s also worth noting that Obama’s claim doesn’t factor in tax credits and federal assistance for child care. For instance, according to the child care group’s study, ""about 2.6 million children received federal subsidies through one of several funding sources including the Child Care and Development Block Grant, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block Grant. Additional public funding that supports early care/education is allocated for programs such as child welfare initiatives and special education."" In addition, the report says, ""parents and businesses can take advantage of tax credits for supporting child care, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and Dependent Care Assistance Programs."" All of these would reduce the cost of child care for many families. Of course, there are also tax credits and federal grants on the college side of the equation, and it’s possible the benefits for college are bigger than those for child care. Still, since we don’t know the impact of discounts either for child care or college costs, it adds another layer of uncertainty into Obama’s seemingly crisp summary. Our ruling Obama said, ""In 31 states, decent child care costs more than college tuition."" He’s chosen a statistic that originated in a wide-ranging survey of child care costs (albeit one published by an advocacy group). However, Obama has cherry-picked the most dramatic statistic of four presented in the report, allowing him to say 31 states, rather than as few as 10. He also ignores uncertainty about how federal aid and tax credits would affect the comparison. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jun/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-31-states-decent-child-care-cost/

Is the government 'stockpiling' hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use?
","Do Americans need to worry about the government stockpiling ammunition and assault rifles to quell coming uprisings? A number of political bloggers think so. A slew of chain emails and articles on conservative-leaning websites going back a year or more claim that the government’s stockpile of ammunition reaches into the billions of rounds. The claim: James Buchal, an Oregon Republican challenging Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., clearly has concerns. His campaign website includes a photograph of an ominous-looking armored vehicle below copy in which Buchal says part of his campaign will ""focus on raising awareness of the threat to America’s future posed by an out-of-control total surveillance state."" He adds, ""The government -- and not the armed forces -- is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use."" Is the government stockpiling that much ammunition? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed Buchal, who pointed to a Government Accountability Office report released Feb. 12, 2014. The report, ""Ammunition Purchases Have Declined Since 2009,"" was produced in response to questions from U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. In a letter dated Nov. 13, 2012, Coburn wrote to Janet Napolitano, then the head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security: ""It has been reported that DHS has recently purchased large amounts of ammunition, as much or more than 1 billion rounds according to some estimates."" Some claims put the figure at 1.6 billion rounds. Another set had it at 2.7 billion. Still others fretted about the alleged retrofitting of more than 2,700 heavily armored military vehicles that were going to be turned over to domestic police forces. The GAO report found that as of October 2013, DHS had about 159 million rounds -- enough to meet the training and operational needs of its firearm-carrying personnel for about 22 months, it said. The agency has more than 70,000 armed personnel, the most of any federal agency, according to the report. The Department of Justice is second with 69,000 armed personnel. The DOJ reported its ammunition inventory as enough to last from 13 to 20 months. The report did not translate that to specific figures but provided other information that enabled it to calculate a range of about 90 million to about 138 million rounds. Together, those two agencies represent 80 percent of federal armed personnel, and together they have roughly 250 million to 300 million rounds of ammunition on hand. That may be on the low end of the figure that pops to mind when someone says ""hundreds of millions,"" but Buchal’s claim is accurate on the amount of ammunition the government has on hand. Then we looked at the thrust of Buchal’s claim, that the government is ""stockpiling"" the ammunition for some later use. DHS’s 159 million inventory in October was down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012, the GAO report found. We emailed DHS’s press office, which provided a statement saying DHS purchases dropped to 93 million rounds in fiscal 2012 and are projected at 75 million for fiscal 2014. Further, the GAO reported that DHS’ use of ammunition over the past six years has roughly equaled the amount it bought. In 2009, the agency bought 133 million rounds and dipped into reserves to use a total of 141 rounds. In 2013, the agency used 89 million rounds compared with new purchases of 84 million rounds. The report noted that DOJ purchasing trends and usage rates are similar. It also said DOJ’s inventories are below DHS’s. How is the ammunition used? The report noted that new federal officers go through 2,000 to 5,000 rounds a year, most of that in training and certification programs. Experienced officers use about 600 rounds a year. The email from DHS concluded, ""Although a small reserve in terms of the overall ammunition is usually kept by the component law enforcement agencies, most do not have the capability to store large amounts of ammunition. There is not an ammunition stockpile."" Buchal acknowledged the report’s assertion that purchases have declined but added, ""The available information is not sufficient, at least to me, to demonstrate that the levels of ammunition purchases are appropriate."" When asked, he did not make a distinction between an ""inventory"" and a ""stockpile."" In a final email, Buchal said the distinction may be beside the point. ""Bottom line, in all likelihood, the ammunition will only be used for training purposes, but engaging in such broad-scale training is itself a problem,"" he wrote. ""We don’t need SWAT teams to deal with student loan fraud, and training up vast quantities of SWAT teams to deal with such issues is itself a sign of a growing divide between the government and the people."" The ruling: On his campaign website, U.S. House candidate James Buchal claims that the government ""is stockpiling hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition for domestic use."" A government report indicated that the federal Department of Homeland Security, as of October 2013, had an estimated 159 million rounds in inventory, down from 178 million rounds in April 2013 and 193 million in November 2012. The report also found that DHS and Department of Justice -- which employ 80 percent of the federal government’s armed personnel -- have steadily decreased ammunition purchases since 2009. Projected purchases by DHS for this year will be the lowest in more than five years. Estimated ammunition inventories for both agencies also continue to fall. With inventories and purchases going down, and usage roughly equaling purchases, the government is clearly not ""stockpiling"" ammunition. And while Buchal is correct in his assertion that the government has ""hundreds of millions"" of rounds on hand, even he later acknowledged that ""in all likelihood,"" those rounds are being used for training purposes.

Greg Abbott lacks proof Wendy Davis is under FBI scrutiny
","Democrats gathering in Dallas for their state convention were welcomed by a billboard featuring a photo of their gubernatorial nominee, Wendy Davis, and this message: ""Wanted: Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation."" It’s one of several billboards rented by the campaign of her Republican opponent, Greg Abbott, according to a June 26, 2014, Abbott press release. A photo of the billboard also appeared in an Abbott campaign tweet. Davis is ""wanted"" by the FBI? Michelle Lee, spokeswoman in the FBI’s San Antonio office, told us by phone: ""Our policy is that we don’t either confirm or deny the existence of an investigation."" Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed to several April 2014 news stories as the campaign’s evidence. The reports said the FBI was investigating an agency with which Davis’ law firm has done business. FBI officials had no comment in those news stories, and a Travis County prosecutor cautioned against concluding that Davis was in federal sights. April 2014 news stories Let’s look at those reports in detail. A news story posted online by the Dallas Morning News on April 17, 2014, quoted Travis County officials as saying documents related to Davis’ work as an outside lawyer for the North Texas Tollway Authority, ""are part of an FBI inquiry of the agency."" That work, the story said, had related to land condemnations and delinquent toll collections. The story also touched off an Abbott campaign tweet:    But, the News’ story said, it wasn’t clear whether Davis’ work for the authority ""is a focus of the FBI or only part of the material collected in connection with its look into tollway agency operations."" The story said the authority disclosed in 2011 that the FBI was investigating potential conflicts of interest among current and former board members. Davis, it noted, had not served on the board. Also, the story said, no one had been charged. In 2013, the story said, the Public Integrity Unit of the Travis County district attorney’s office built a file while reviewing a complaint filed by the Republican who lost to Davis for her Senate seat in 2012. Elizabeth Winn, a Travis County assistant district attorney, told the newspaper her office had confirmed with the FBI that the material from the county’s review of the complaint by Mark Shelton was now part of a federal investigation. ""We did confirm by telephone … they still have a pending investigation,"" Winn said. The newspaper quoted Gregg Cox, who heads the county’s investigatory unit, as saying that in looking into Shelton’s complaint about Davis, his office fielded information from the FBI. ""They shared information with us, and that information was in our files,"" Cox said. ""We ultimately closed our investigation."" The News said it learned of the FBI link after its request for the investigative file under the Texas Public Information Act was rebuffed by the Public Integrity Unit. The paper quoted Cox as saying: ""When the open records request came in, we felt a need to protect the information in our files that we had learned from the FBI."" In a September 2013, letter to Shelton, the News reported, the district attorney’s office said it had conducted legal research into his complaint against Davis but had been ""unable to accumulate sufficient evidence to support a prosecution"" for any offense that might have occurred in Travis County. Much of what the allegations deal with occurred elsewhere, in Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth. ""Thus we do not have proper venue to prosecute any criminal conduct that occurred,"" the letter said. A day later, on April 18, 2014, the Austin American-Statesman followed up with a news story stating: ""There is no evidence that Davis is an object of interest for the FBI, which is mum on even the question of whether there is an investigation."" A Statesman news story posted online earlier that day quoted Cox as saying Shelton’s October 2012 complaint concerned the North Texas Tollway Authority hiring Davis’ law firm in exchange, Shelton asserted, for her vote on legislation that mattered to the authority. Davis, the newspaper said, had said she voted in the interests of her constituents and it had nothing to do with being given work by the authority. Cox said that, when the county embarked on looking into the matter, ""we came across a bunch of news articles about the FBI investigating the NTTA so we reached out to them and they shared information with us about their investigation."" The Statesman said the disclosure about the sharing of information between the Public Integrity Unit and the FBI was prompted by the Dallas newspaper’s March 11, 2014, open-records request for a copy of the case file. Travis County asked the open records division of Attorney General Abbott’s office on March 24, 2014, for a ruling, and on April 1, 2014, received an affirmative reply, confirming that it did not have to make the documents available, the Statesman said. According to the Statesman, Winn’s letter seeking the AG’s ruling said ""the requested information is the subject of an open investigation"" by the FBI and ""the information’s release would interfere with the FBI’s prosecution of the crime underlying the information."" Cox told the Statesman it would be wrong to read into the letter that Davis is a subject of the FBI investigation. Cox said the Public Integrity Unit did not provide the FBI any information; it was the FBI that provided the Public Integrity Unit with information about its investigation of the authority. We called Cox and didn’t hear back. We also asked Hirsch of Abbott’s camp how Abbott knows Davis’ work is ""currently"" under investigation. He didn’t say, replying by email with a question: ""Has the FBI said the investigation is closed?"" Our ruling Abbott’s billboard said: ""Wendy Davis’ legal work is currently under FBI investigation."" That's largely unsupported. According to news reports, the FBI has looked into an agency that’s also relied on Davis for legal work--and her work may or may not be an element of the inquiry. But the FBI has been silent about the inquiry and any Davis element and we see no official confirmation otherwise of a focus on the senator. Notably, a Travis County prosecutor said two months ago it’d be wrong to conclude his office’s mention of the FBI inquiry in a letter indicates Davis is under federal scrutiny. Also, Abbott’s camp offered no evidence the declared investigation is ""currently"" happening. We rate this claim as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Does Joni Ernst want to abolish the Education Department and the EPA?
","A new ad from a coalition of environmental groups tries to paint Iowa’s Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst as too extreme. The groups, which include the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, kicked off a nearly $1 million campaign with a 30 second TV spot on June 23, 2014. The ad raises concern over Ernst’s promises ""to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA.""  It claims that these promises are ""why extremist Sarah Palin and the billionaire Koch brother want Ernst in Washington."" All in all, the ad concluded that Ernst is ""Too extreme for Iowa."" It’s not unusual for political ads to distort candidate’s positions. Does Ernst really call for the abolition of the U.S. Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency? Our research showed that the ad was right on track. Ernst called for the closure of both agencies in April. Will she do away with the Education Department? Ernst is a state senator who won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. She’s running against the Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley. Ernst brought up both the Education Department and the EPA in the Republican primary debate on April 24, 2014. One of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nation’s ""crumbling road and transportation systems."" Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds. ""I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government,"" Ernst said. She called for ""closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level. And not just because it would save taxpayer dollars, but because I do believe our children are better educated when it’s coming from the state."" We ran those comments by Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel, who said that Ernst wants to see power taken from Washington and put back in the hands of Iowans. She is ""about state-driven policy,"" Hamel said. According to the Education Department’s website the ""federal role in education is limited."" States handle almost all education policy and issues. But, at the federal level, the Education Department takes on many tasks such as conducting research and overseeing state policy to prevent discrimination. It also awards and distributes federal financial aid in the form of loans and grants. The ad says that if Ernst is elected, 213,000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants. According to federal numbers, that is the number of Iowans who received Pell Grants in 2011-12. We asked the Ernst campaign what her plan for Pell Grants is, but we didn’t get a response. What about the EPA? While answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response, Ernst also mentioned the EPA. ""Let’s shut down the EPA,"" she said. Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government, saying, ""The state knows best how to protect resources."" So, the ad is on solid ground. Ernst did say that she would shut down the EPA. Agriculture and manufacturing are two of Iowa’s key industries, and they are both heavily affected by EPA regulation. Hamel, Ernst’s spokeswoman, said that ""Joni wants to have Iowa make its own decisions."" The ad also refers to the Clean Air Act. This raises the question of how states would deal with national issues, like air pollution. Unlike the Education Department, where the states already play a huge role, this could be more complicated for the EPA. Two experts on environmental law told us that abolishing the EPA would dramatically reduce regulations on industry. ""Nearly all states have seen significant cuts in the budgets of their state environmental agencies in recent years,""  said one of them, Joel A. Mintz, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University who specializes in environmental law. ""Although some states may have the expertise, resources and political will to subsume EPA’s responsibilities, many — probably most — do not."" Our ruling An attack ad aired by the League of Conservation Voters said that Ernst wants to ""shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA."" In an April debate, Ernst called for the closure of both federal agencies, and her campaign didn’t dispute that.

Senators ring alarm about ""$4 billion"" daily debt
","
Four billion dollars.

Imagine what could be done with that amount of money. MARTA, metro Atlanta’s mass transit system, has said it could use $4 billion for various expansion projects. The Obama administration has set aside that much money for its Race to the Top education program. Or, perhaps, you can buy the New York Yankees andthe Beatles music catalog and still have about $1 billion to spare.

Here’s a disturbing figure concerning $4 billion.

""An average of $4 billion is added to the national debt"" every day, U.S. Sens. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a March 29 op-ed.

Is it really that much money? We wanted to find out.

The estimate is aimed at raising awareness among Americans into facing and dealing with what the two senators believe is one of the nation’s biggest problems -- its rapidly rising debt. Chambliss and Warner will come to Atlanta on Monday to talk about the debt to more than 500 business and community leaders at an event hosted by the Rotary Club of Atlanta.

The two senators are part of what’s been called the ""Gang of Six"" -- a group of six senators working on ways to lower the debt. The budget deficit and national debt are big issues in Washington as Democrats and Republicans debate how to best cut spending.

""Every dollar that we spend simply paying the interest on our nation’s staggering debt is disappearing into a fiscal sinkhole,"" they wrote. ""These are resources that cannot be targeted toward creating jobs, expanding the U.S. economy or addressing any of our other shared priorities.""

We wondered if Chambliss and Warner had their math right -- or are they trying to scare the public with false and gaudy numbers?

PolitiFact Virginia checked out a prior claimin December by Warner that the debt grew by an estimated $15 billion in one weekend. They ruled his claim was on the money.

There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion. Those numbers are as of April 6, 2011, the most recent figures available. The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show.

So, to see how fast the public debt is growing, we looked at the total on two other dates.
On Dec. 31, 2010, it was $9.4 trillion. A year earlier, the debt held by the public was $7.8 trillion.

Between the end of 2009 and April 6, 2011, the public debt has risen by an average of just above $4 billion a day. In 2010, it grew by an average of $4.3 billion a day. The pace of debt increase does seem to have slowed this year. The debt has risen by $250 billion between the end of 2010 and April 6, an average of $2.6 billion a day.

If you look at the total debt, the average daily increase is about $4.3 billion. In 2010, it grew by about $4.7 billion a day. In 2011, the total debt has risen by about $2.45 billion a day.

Our math shows the debt has grown by an average of more than $4 billion per day since 2009. It grew by that rate during 2010 as well. The average daily rate has slowed to slightly less than $3 billion so far this year. Either number shows the debt is indeed a big problem.

The senators’ op-ed did not detail what time frame they were discussing to spell out their claim. They said they were basing it off Warner’s claim that had been checked of what amounted to $5 billion a day and decided to be conservative and chose the $4 billion daily estimate. This year, their claim is off by about $1 billion. Over the last two years, it’s correct. Since the average daily debt through the first quarter of 2011 is more than $1 billion less than their statement, we rate the Chambliss claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/11/saxby-chambliss/senators-ring-alarm-about-4-billion-debt-problem/

David Pepper says budget woes in states without public employee collective bargaining top Ohio's
","
Gov. John Kasich has said collective bargaining should be restricted for Ohio’s public workers  to help governments balance their budgets and, in turn, help the state bring its spending into balance in the face of a massive deficit.

""One of the reasons I did this is I wanted local governments to have the tools to be able to control their costs,"" Republican Kasich said in March right before he released his budget proposal that sharply cuts state funding to local governments.

But opponents of controversial Senate Bill 5 — a measure that Kasich enthusiastically signed March 31 that would sharply restrict bargaining, end binding arbitration and ban public employees from striking — say the governor’s argument comes up false when comparing Ohio to other states.

""There is no evidence to suggest that collective bargaining is the cause of overall budget challenges,"" former Hamilton County Commissioner David Pepper told an Ohio House committee in March. ""Many states without collective bargaining, such as Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina, have far larger budget deficits than many that do, including Ohio.""

Clearly, Pepper and the governor have very different ways of framing the debate over collective bargaining. The last part of his comment got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention, though, and we decided to take a look.

Pepper, a Democrat who lost to Republican Dave Yost last November in the state auditor election, said his point was that most states are suffering budget difficulties regardless of whether they have collective bargaining options for public workers.

""There is clearly from looking across the country no correlation between states that have collective bargaining for public workers and having budget problems or being competitive,"" Pepper said in an interview. ""There simply is no case for getting rid of collective bargaining to solve budget problems.""

Pepper said his comments were based on information from Policy Matters Ohio, a left-leaning research organization. Its executive director, Amy Hanauer, testified in February to a Senate committee that Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada all faced more significant budget gaps than Ohio for fiscal 2010.

In terms of percentages of their overall budgets, the gaps were higher in Arizona (65 percent), North Carolina (26 percent) and Nevada (47 percent) than in Ohio (14 percent) for fiscal 2010, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, also a left-leaning group. CBPP’s data is widely used by government think tank groups, including by the Pew Center on the States.

Data from the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures showed the same was true in fiscal 2011 when those same three states had deficits that were a larger percentage of the overall budget than was the case in Ohio.

In terms of dollars, Arizona’s deficit of $5.1 billion and North Carolina’s -- $5 billion -- were both higher than Ohio’s gap of $3.6 billion for 2010. But Nevada’s -- $1.5 billion -- was lower.

Republicans who control the General Assembly argue that many local governments have complained about public employee wages and benefits, sometimes gained through binding arbitration when negotiations have failed. But likening restrictions on collective bargaining to a budget solving pill appears to be a stretch.

States with no collective bargaining for public employees had an average budget gap of 24.8 percent in 2010, according to Policy Matters Ohio. Meanwhile, states with collective bargaining for all public employees had an average deficit gap of 24.1 percent.

Pepper was right on the money in terms of percentage gaps. He was correct in terms of actual dollars and cents for two of the three states he cited.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Pepper’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/11/david-pepper/david-pepper-says-budget-woes-states-without-publi/

Texas Rep. Stefani Carter says Beaumont schools chief is highest-paid in state
","
Discussing the state budget with three fellow freshman Texas House members and Texas Tribune editor Evan Smith, Republican Stefani Carter of Dallas said she sees room for cuts in the ""administrative side"" of the state’s public schools. As an example, she highlighted the Beaumont school district, where, she said, ""the superintendent is making $356,000 a year."" 
That prompted Smith, who interviewed the freshmen Feb. 16, to interject: ""In fact, among the highest-paid if not the highest-paid school superintendent in the state."" Carter agreed: ""The highest-paid. And it’s a very tiny school district. So, things are out of whack. ... Superintendents should not be paid a salary increase unless the voters say so."" 
We wondered if the Beaumont school chief’s pay is tops in the state. 
Carter’s chief of staff, Taurie Randermann, pointed us to the Tribune’s superintendent salary database, which indicates that Beaumont ISD leader Carrol Thomas’ base pay has been the highest in the state for the past three school years. This school year, Thomas’ salary is $347,834, according to the database, which was built with information from the Texas Education Agency. 
The Tribune’s database also calculates each superintendent’s pay per student. This school year, the Beaumont district has about 20,000 students, which means Thomas’ base pay is about $17 per student. Terry Grier — head of the state’s largest school district, Houston ISD, which has about 200,000 students — earns about $1.50 in salary per pupil. Overall, Grier’s $300,000 salary is the sixth-highest in the state, according to the Tribune database. 
The $283,412 annual salary of Austin district chief Meria Carstarphen ranks No. 10 on the list. That makes her per-pupil pay about $3 a year. 
We confirmed the Tribune’s salary information with TEA’s own rankings, current as of October 2010. Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that the average annual salary for Texas superintendents is $119,080. 
But that’s the average in a state with more than 1,000 districts, about 80 percent of which have less than 3,000 students. Mary Barrett, assistant director of compensation services at the Texas Association of School Boards, told us that the group’s annual survey of superintendent salaries and benefits found that half of reported salaries are less than $105,000 and 75 percent are less than $138,000. (The association’s report is based on surveys sent to Texas school districts. This year, 79 percent responded. Beaumont was not among them.) 
How does Thomas’ salary compare with superintendents in similar-sized school districts? 
According to the association, the average superintendent salary in districts with between 10,000 and 24,999 students this year is $191,316. 
So, why is the Beaumont superintendent’s salary higher? In a Dec. 17, 2009, news article, the Tribune wrote that Thomas’ ""high salary may reflect his uncommon longevity: He’s been leading Beaumont since 1996 — a tenure tantamount to eternity in the hyper-politicized, high-turnover world of urban education."" 
As of this year, Texas superintendents had held their posts an average of five years, Barrett said. 
A Nov. 17 article in the Beaumont Enterprise said that when Thomas was hired in December 1995, ""the district was embroiled in a bitter battle among (school) board members who were split along racial lines, with student performance that was well below the state average."" TEA monitors had taken control of the board, according to the article. 
The article says that Thomas’ initial annual salary was $152,800. That compared with a 1996 average superintendent salary of $103,407 in school districts with 10,000 to 25,000 students, according to Barrett. 
Ratcliffe told us that the Beaumont district was willing to pay Thomas a high salary because the district was grappling with serious problems when he was hired. ""And he’s turned a lot of those schools around, so they’ve given him good raises along the way,"" she said. 
His contract, which the district sent to us, provides for a 3.9 percent annual raise dependent on a positive review from the school board. The average superintendent pay raise for this year was 3.3 percent, Barrett said. 
In a March 25 article, the Tribune reported that ""student achievement in Beaumont has climbed steadily for the past 15 years even as the state has moved to the more rigorous Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests and required more students to be included in the testing."" 
However, according to the article, Thomas’ salary and the school district’s spending have become issues in Beaumont, where residents in May will vote on an initiative to change election procedures for the school board. 
But there’s more to superintendent compensation than salary: The district leaders also receive perks — which vary considerably among districts — such as bonuses and car allowances. We wondered how those compare among Texas superintendents with the highest base salaries. 
That information proved tougher to get. Ratcliffe told us that the education agency doesn’t keep data on superintendents’ total compensation packages. 
The school board association tracks the most common extras, including allowances for cell phone or home Internet service, bonus payments, professional organization membership dues and car allowances, Barrett told us — but the data is only for use by association members. However, she did say that the top 10 compensation packages ranged from $338,000 to $443,000. Thomas’ salary alone puts him in that group. 
We attempted to conduct our own total compensation analysis, starting with Thomas. Beyond his $347,834 salary, Thomas’ contract shows that he receives a monthly ""supplemental allowance"" of $1,000. And Jessie Haynes, a spokeswoman for the district, told us that Thomas’ annual health and dental insurance benefits are about $6,800. The district also pays about $10,500 a year in premiums for his life and professional legal liability insurance and about $1,500 a year in membership dues to professional and civic organizations. 
That brings Thomas’ total package to about $379,000. How does that compare to his counterparts? 
Of the superintendents with the highest salaries in Texas, we were able to track down enough information to calculate nearly complete totals for Melody Johnson of the Fort Worth school district (No. 4 in TEA's salary rankings) and Grier of the Houston district (No. 6 in salary). 
Johnson, whose district has about 80,000 students, earns an annual salary of $328,950 and receives an automobile allowance of $600 per month. According to district spokesman Clint Bond, the district also pays $1,426 per year in membership dues to a professional organization, $4,475 for an annual disability insurance premium and $2,940 for health insurance. Johnson’s total: about $345,000. 
In addition to his $300,000 salary, Grier receives $1,200 per month for an automobile allowance and $400 per month for a cell phone, according to his contract. The district also pays $2,485 annually for dues and fees to professional and civic organizations, and this year, Grier will get $21,150 in supplemental salary payments. In January, the district paid $30,000 into a special retirement account for Grier, in addition to awarding him a performance-based bonus of $18,001 for the 2009-10 school year. 
Grier’s total, without health insurance: about $391,000. 
Our research also indicates that the total compensation package of Dallas school district Superintendent Michael Hinojosa is likely bigger than that of Thomas. Hinojosa’s salary of $332,832 — in a district that serves more than 150,000 students — ranks third on the education agency’s list of superintendent salaries. Add to that $450 per month for his cell phone, $23,464 in extra payments to the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and a $15,000 annuity, and you get more than $376,000. 
That doesn’t count professional dues, annual premiums for disability and professional liability insurance, performance-based bonuses,and health insurance — all benefits noted in Hinojosa’s contract. We requested that information from the district but had not received any answers as of press time. 
In the Austin school district, which has about 86,000 students, Carstarphen’s benefits include $12,000 a year for automobile allowance, a $15,000 annuity and $5,377 in health insurance. The district also pays $9,953 per year for a long-term disability insurance policy and $1,046 for a life insurance policy. And in August, Carstarphen was awarded a bonus of $41,500 for meeting performance goals for the 2009-10 school year. (She has waived any bonus tied to this school year.) 
Her total: about $368,000. 
Readers may note that none of these compensation packages approaches the $443,000 high-end figure mentioned by Barrett; we’re still awaiting information that would confirm which district is spending that amount. 
We checked in with lawyer Neal Adams, who, according to the Tribune’s March 25 story, has negotiated most superintendent contracts in the state since 1987 as general counsel for the Texas Association of School Administrators. When we asked him whether he knew of any superintendents with higher compensation packages than Thomas', he said he didn’t have specific numbers but that there were probably some. 
So, where does that leave us? 
On the Tribune panel, Carter said the Beaumont schools chief was the highest-paid in Texas. He does have the highest salary, although Carter misquoted the exact figure. 
But additional perks are a significant portion of superintendents’ compensation and cannot be ignored. In terms of total compensation, Thomas is among the highest-paid, but our research indicates that at least a couple of superintendents get more. 
We rate Carter’s statement Half True. 
UPDATE, noon, April, 14, 2011: After our item was published, we received information from the Fort Bend school district, in the southwestern suburbs of Houston, about the 2010 compensation package of Superintendent Timothy Jenney. It exceeded that of the Beaumont schools chief. According to the TEA data, Jenney’s salary of $260,339 ranked No. 24 in the state. In addition to that, according to his contract, he received $9,600 a year for a car allowance and $4,200 for a cell phone and other technology. The district paid about $35,000 that year for Jenney’s life insurance and disability income protection insurance. For the year, Jenney received a performance-based contribution of $36,000 to a retirement plan and a $26,000 supplemental salary payment, plus a $20,000 annuity payment. Sum total: about $390,000.",/factchecks/2011/apr/11/stefani-carter/texas-rep-stefani-carter-says-beaumont-schools-chi/

Austin's school superintendent says Pease Elementary's origin is in Texas Constitution
","
Speaking about a proposed Austin school facilities master plan, the district’s superintendent told Austin’s KUT-FM April 1 that she doesn’t expect school closures until 2012-13, if then, and only after consideration of community concerns.

Meria Carstarphen also all but ruled out a task force’s erstwhile suggestion that Pease Elementary in downtown Austin be closed to help ensure that facilities districtwide are sufficiently filled with students. In its final recommendations, the task force did not specify which schools might best be shuttered.

Carstarphen told KUT reporter Nathan Bernier that Pease ""is a school that was created as part of the Texas Constitution."" According to audio of the 30-minute interview posted online, Carstarphen also recapped her reaction to the possibility of Pease being closed: ""I’m one of the people who was like, really, Pease? It’s in the constitution. How do we do that?""

""I can’t understand how that option got on the table,"" she said.

Pease Elementary, on Rio Grande Street near West 12th Street, dates to the 19th century. Its website says it was founded in 1876 and later named after Elisha M. Pease, who last served as governor until late September 1869. Pease is the district’s only all-transfer school, accoding to the website, meaning students may attend regardless of where they live in the district.

Does the school really owe its existence to the state constitution?

We searched for references in the constitution and spotted no mention of any single grade school in the document’s education article, which states it’s the Legislature’s duty to ""establish and make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of an efficient system of public free schools."" Another provision permits lawmakers to create school districts but doesn’t single out particular schools. We also found no Pease clauses in earlier versions of the constitution.

Next, we asked for back-up information from the district and called the Pease school, which put us in touch with Brenda Gunn, who has children attending the school. Gunn said in an e-mail that she brought a facsimile of the Texas Declaration of Independence to a March meeting involving Carstarphen and Pease parents, and she pointed out to Carstarphen that ""education is listed as one of the grievances against the Mexican government.

""I remarked to her that 175 years ago education was worth a revolution … that in 1838, (the) president of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau B. Lamar, gave his first speech as president and education featured prominently in the speech. Several months later, after Austin was selected as the new capital... Lamar ordered that the new capital be surveyed and prepared for the government's arrival. In this 1839 survey of Austin, two city blocks were set aside for education. Pease is on one of those city blocks.""

Carstarphen, Gunn’s e-mail says, ""was very energized by this information, and though she switched her documents in her recent interview, her comment about Pease being in the constitution really gets to this central point: Pease is a direct manifestation of what the Texas founders wanted for Texas schoolchildren.""

Gunn also passed along a Feb 23 letter from Light Cummins, an Austin College professor who’s also the Texas state historian. ""It would be impossible to find a more historic school than Pease, which traces its origins back to the year 1839,"" Cummins writes, describing the 1839 survey designating the plot ""as the site for a public school for the children of the new town."" The Austin Graded School opened in 1876, the letter says.

""Pease Elementary School thus traces its beginnings back to the very establishment of public education in Texas,"" the letter continues. ""It has survived almost a century and a half as a touchstone of public education in Texas.""

Andy Welch, the district’s spokesman, said in an April 5 interview that Carstarphen’s comments to KUT stemmed from her meeting with the Pease parents and their reminder of the school’s roots.

Welch pointed out too that a 1971 law dedicates the land where the school sits to the Austin district ""so long as said property is used"" by the district for educational purposes. If not, the law states, the property reverts to the state.

""Of course, (Pease) is not in the constitution,"" Welch said. Texans ""put important things like hide inspectors in the constitution,"" a reference to the document’s sprawl of arcane detail.

He agreed that the implication of Carstarphen’s claim -- that the district can’t close Pease without a change to the constitution -- is not correct.

The district followed up that day with statements on Pease’s history, also attaching a timeline stating the original school on the site burned down and was rebuilt in 1896; it was named after Pease in 1902.

Also, Carstarphen placed her own statement online, in a post headlined: ""Pease Elementary's Origins Tied to the Origins of the State of Texas."" ""The Pease community and I are in agreement that, while Pease is not literally and specifically mentioned in the 1876 Constitution, its origins are tied directly"" to the state’s origins, her post says. She says the larger point is preservation of the ""historic jewel.""

The 1876 Constitution, Carstarphen’s post says, was ""very clear about the use of public lands to establish a system of free public schools. The original Pease school, several blocks from the Capitol, embodied the intention of those constitutional framers.""

Our analysis: The superintendent clearly hopes to preserve an historically unique school. Still, her statement to KUT was False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/10/meria-carstarphen/austins-school-superintendent-says-pease-elementar/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Wisconsin', 'Charlie Sykes']","
Charlie Sykes says JoAnne Kloppenburg had a 3-to-1 advantage in spending over Justice David Prosser for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court
","
Conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes was in a pretty good mood the day after his preferred candidate for state Supreme Court battled to a virtual dead heat against the more liberal JoAnne Kloppenburg.

Justice David Prosser avoided defeat, Sykes told his WTMJ (620-AM) listeners on April 6, 2011, despite the efforts of labor and the left to use public anger over Gov. Scott Walker’s anti-union legislation against Prosser, a former Republican legislator.

It was especially remarkable, Sykes said, because liberals had such a huge fundraising edge.

""They put in as much money as they will ever be able to,"" Sykes said. ""They will never again, in Wisconsin, be able to mobilize a 3-to-1 money advantage.""

He repeated the ""3-to-1"" claim at least twice more, at one point attributing it to an unidentified ""political observer"" who wrote up some pro-Prosser thoughts late on election night.

The claim surprised us.

The two candidates both agreed to public financing, so they were limited to public grants. And spending by outside groups was heavy on both sides.

Sykes wasn’t the only one to sound this theme.

A National Review story two days before the election said outside groups on the conservative side were being ""heavily outspent"" by liberal counterparts.

And Bob Dohnal, publisher of the Wisconsin-based Conservative Digest, circulated an email on April 7 saying conservatives were outspent 10 to 1. He told us the figure was based on information ""bandied around the Internet and the talk shows for weeks.""

What’s more, it’s much broader than Sykes’ claim. Dohnal said his number included all efforts by the unions and liberal groups dating back more than a month to the protests over Gov. Scott Walker’s budget bill -- not just the Supreme Court race.

We asked Sykes for backup for his statement, but he did not respond.

So, we turned to the numbers, which fall into three categories.

-- Candidate fundraising. As noted, both candidates opted for public financing, limiting their intake almost exclusively to $400,000 in public financing each ($100,000 for the primary, $300,00 for the general). So that’s a draw.

-- Independent expenditures by political action committees. This is a small category, but Kloppenburg had a decided edge, according to state Government Accountability Board reports of spending through April 6, 2011. Groups supporting her or attacking Prosser spent $135,152. On the Prosser’s side, the tally was $12,386.

-- Media spending by special interest ""issues advocacy"" groups trying to influence voters. This is the big outside money that came in record amounts for a state judicial race. By law, these ads can’t explicitly endorse the defeat or election of a candidate, but they are essentially indistinguishable from ads that do.

The two tallies we found both showed a big advantage for Prosser’s side -- not Kloppenburg’s.

The first was a report -- released on election day -- by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School that looked at broadcast TV spending by outside groups. It is the only organization we could find that attempts to put a hard number on such spending by outside groups.

The left-leaning think tank/advocacy group relies on TV satellite data collected by TNS Media Intelligence/CMAG, an ad-tracking firm. It says its numbers are estimates that may underestimate the precise amount of actual expenditures.

The Brennan study was reported widely by Wisconsin and national media, including the Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, and the Journal Sentinel.

It found there had been  $2.2 million spent by four conservative groups through election day vs. $1.36 million by one liberal group, the Greater Wisconsin Committee.

(The conservative groups are the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce’s issues mobilization council, Citizens for a Strong America, Wisconsin Club for Growth and the State Tea Party Express).

That’s an $840,000 advantage for the conservative side.

The Brennan study also was picked up on WisPolitics.com, a widely cited online digest. The website added some of its own reporting and wrote on election day that pro-Prosser groups outspent the Kloppenburg side, $2.5 million to $1.9 million. That’s a somewhat smaller $600,000 advantage.

WisPolitics had broader information -- including cable TV and radio -- though it cited the Kloppenburg campaign as its source for the additional information. Kloppenburg, the WisPolitics story said, had tracked ad spending by both sides, and provided some numbers to WisPolitics.

Prosser’s campaign manager Brian Nemoir said he had not tracked the spending totals by outside groups and couldn’t comment on which side spent more.

We also asked the biggest spending groups on both sides to release spending figures -- or to confirm or dispute the Brennan Center tally.

The liberal GWC group said they do not release their spending figures -- nor are they required to do so. Officials with Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, Citizens for a Strong America and Wisconsin Club for Growth could not be reached. Kloppenburg’s side did not respond to a question about spending.

To be sure, the information that is available is not perfect.

State and federal laws allow undisclosed spending by a variety of groups, on a variety of election and issues-related advocacy. Robo-calls and mailings by outside groups are not tracked. There are limitations to the TV data, though it likely covers a very large chunk of the TV spending by outside groups, said Ken Goldstein, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who tracks ad spending.

Still, it is the best and most complete information. And it all was available when Sykes made his comments the day after the election.

Indeed, the Brennan numbers and WisPolitics story both came out the day before.

So what were the grand totals, when paired with the other categories? 
That’s a $728,000 spending advantage on Prosser side, or a 38 percent edge.

The gap is smaller, but still substantial, if you use the figures reported by WisPolitics.

Let’s wrap this one up.

Sykes repeatedly claimed that the pro-Prosser forces were outgunned financially by a 3 to 1 ratio by the Kloppenburg side. He did not specify a source of his own, cite any information from the Prosser side or debunk the widespread media reports of the spending advantage on the Prosser side. His assertion may have become an article of faith in some circles on the right, but we could find no basis for any spending advantage by Kloppenburg, much less a 3 to 1 edge.

His statement warrants a Pants on Fire. 
(Editor’s note, April 11, 2011: Sykes did not respond to our April 7, 2011 request for information that would support the claim he made about spending in the Supreme Court race. He went on the air April 11, 2011-- the day after the item was posted – and led off his segment by saying: ""I don’t have a problem admitting if I made a mistake.""

Amid criticism of PolitiFact Wisconsin, Sykes said it was his ""good faith"" impression from about two weeks prior to the election that the Kloppenburg side was outspending the Prosser side. He acknowledged the balance might have tipped by election day and said no one can know the true amount that was spent because, by law, it is not officially reported.

He did not provide any information to support his claim that the Prosser side was outspent 3-to-1.)",/factchecks/2011/apr/10/charlie-sykes/charlie-sykes-says-joanne-kloppenburg-had-3-1-adva/

Licht says proposed fees for R.I. state beaches are still less than fees at some municipal beaches
","
After an unusually cruel winter and chilly spring, we couldn’t stop dreaming of hot summer days at the seashore. Then Governor Chafee proposed nearly doubling fees at state beaches. It hit us like a bucket of ice water. 

Under the plan, the price for a season pass would increase to $60 for Rhode Islanders from $30. Daily rates for state residents would jump to $10 from $6 during the week and to $14 from $7 on weekends and holidays. Fees for out-of-staters would also increase.

While discussing the proposed fees on WJAR-TV’s ""10 News Conference"" on April 3, Richard Licht, director of the Department of Administration, asserted they weren’t out of line.

""For $30 more, you are getting a season pass to one of the greatest sets of beaches in the country. …You still, at $60, are less than some of the town beaches charge … I don’t think that’s an inordinate burden on the people of Rhode Island,"" Licht said.

Could the fees at state beaches still be lower than town beaches — even if doubled?

When we inquired where Licht got his information, the governor’s spokesman, Michael Trainor, told us we’d hear back by the next day. 

While we waited, we made some phone calls and found 14 coastal communities that charge admission to their beaches. Most of the beach fees have been set for the season.

Like a beach ball on a breezy day, the fees are all over the place. And there are many different categories, covering residents, non-residents and seniors.

(The Chafee administration ultimately referred us to the state Department of Environmental Management, which cited many of the same figures we found in our survey.)

We decided to focus on the fee that the majority of state residents -- who don’t live in beach communities -- would pay for a season pass or a single day at the shore. If they visit a state beach, they’d all pay the new fees. If they visit a town beach, they’d pay that community’s non-resident fee.

The most expensive non-resident season pass costs $175 for Little Compton’s South Shore Beach. Middletown’s Sachuest Beach, also known as Second Beach, charges $140. Next comes Charlestown, at $90. Passes go for $80 at Newport’s Easton’s Beach and South Kingstown Town Beach and $70 at Wuskenau Town Beach in Westerly.

So how does the state’s proposed $60 season pass compare? Of the eight towns that offer passes to non-residents, the state fee would be less than all but Portsmouth, which collects $50 for a pass to Sandy Point Beach, on the Sakonnet River.

So far, so good for Licht.

But what about daily fees? (Remember, we’re comparing state fees to local non-resident fees, setting aside favorable pricing for residents.)

Let’s begin with weekdays. 

The Chafee administration wants to increase the $6 daily state fee to $10.

Three towns -- Warren, Bristol and Tiverton -- charge just $5 per day. Westerly charges $6 and Portsmouth charges $7. 

Prices are higher at the ocean beaches: $10 in Charlestown, Narragansett, Middletown and Newport; $12 in Little Compton; and $15 a day in South Kingstown and Jamestown. (Narragansett also charges a separate fee to walk onto the beach.) Two towns -- Barrington and North Kingstown -- don’t allow non-residents to park at their beaches.

So the $10 state fee would be less than 5 of the 12 towns that welcome out-of-towners. 

On weekends and holidays, the state’s new fee would be $14 -- less than fees in 8 of the 12 beach towns.

So when Licht says the new state fees are less than ""some"" of the town beaches, we can’t  disagree. In fact, the state fees are lower in many instances.

We won’t kick any sand at Licht on this one.  We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/10/richard-licht/licht-says-proposed-fees-ri-state-beaches-are-stil/
"['Economy', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Bob McDonnell says he cut $6 billion from Virginia's budget
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell is urging the federal government to follow Virginia’s lead in slashing spending.

""When I took office last year we faced historic budget deficits of $6 billion here in Virginia,"" McDonnell said on March 26 in delivering the Republican weekly radio address to the nation. ""And we closed those deficits by cutting spending, not raising taxes.""

We agree that general state taxes have not increased since McDonnell took office on Jan. 16, 2010. But we wondered if he really did cut spending by $6 billion -- which amounts to 37.5 percent of the money Virginia spends each year on education, health and public safety.

McDonnell, who is mentioned as a vice presidential prospect for the 2012 GOP ticket, has made the claim repeatedly. ""We cut $6 billion out of our last two budgets,"" McDonnell wrote in a Jan. 31 column that ran in The Hill, a newspaper specializing in Congress that is well read by Washington insiders.

An April 8 news letter issued by the governor’s political action committee, Opportunity Virginia, lauds McDonnell for ""cutting $6 billion.""

Let’s start with some background: Unlike the federal government, Virginia and most states are constitutionally required to balance their budgets. Virginia’s General Assembly approves spending plans each year based on estimated revenues the state will receive from taxes and other sources of income.

As the nation sank into recession in late 2008, Virginia and just about every other state saw  revenues plummet. The lack of revenues to cover expenses creates a budget shortfall.

McDonnell’s comments suggest there are two ways to repair a shortfall: cut spending or raise taxes. But there is a third option that the General Assembly usually prefers. It involves transferring money in state accounts and other bookkeeping gimmicks to alter paper balances.

These steps are perfectly legal, done in the open, and are an integral part of managing Virginia’s annual budget of almost $38 billion. They provide short-term solutions during economic lulls that  shield citizens from cuts in services or tax increases. The danger is that they can cause long-term structural problems in the budget if the actions are not rescinded when the economy improves.

Congress gave Virginia a fourth option in early 2009 when it approved the $787 billion stimulus bill with hopes that a shot of federal money would jolt the economy out of recession. Virginia received $1.9 billion in one-time stimulus payments to help its budget problems.

Two of McDonnell’s key advisers, Finance Secretary Ric Brown and Director of Communications Tucker Martin, told us in February that the governor’s $6 billion figure refers to the cumulative shortfalls Virginia faced from July 1, 2008 through last year. They acknowledged that many of the actions by McDonnell and the General Assembly took to balance the budget involved maneuvering accounts and using stimulus dollars -- not cutting spending.

Our math shows that actual budget cuts accounted for about 39 percent of the dollar value of actions taken to balance the budget. Robert Vaughn, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, helped us compile the numbers and did not dispute our conclusions.

We found total cuts of about $2.34 billion. Most of it, $2 billion, came from reductions in funding to state agencies; the remainder came from trimming benefits for state employees.

We came up with about $2.91 billion in transfers and bookkeeping maneuvers. Lawmakers helped support general services by diverting $850 million in scheduled contributions to the state pension. They withdrew $783 million from Virginia’s rainy day fund. They also found savings by using debt to finance some construction projects they had planned to pay for in cash, raising a variety of fees, moving up the monthly deadline for businesses to submit sales tax receipts to create an extra collection in 2010, and moving money from self-supporting programs into the state’s general fund to help pay for education, health programs and public safety.

Finally, as we noted, Virginia received $1.9 billion in one-time federal stimulus payments. Of the money, $1.1 billion defrayed rising Medicaid costs and $800 million bolstered public schools.

All told -- counting cuts, bookkeeping moves and stimulus -- we came up with $7.15 billion in cost-saving moves. That’s higher than the $6 billion figure McDonnell and others bandy about. But we have one more piece of math left.

As we mentioned, Medicaid costs rose by $1.1 billion between 2008 and 2010 and were covered by the stimulus. So when we subtract that amount from the $7.15 billion, we get a $6.05 billion total in cost-saving actions -- roughly the same figure McDonnell uses.

You won’t see a $6 billion reduction in the bottom line of Virginia budgets since mid-2008. To the contrary, overall spending increased by $800 million to a total $37.9 billion in the 2011 budget. But that’s not really a fair figure because the overall budget includes designated revenues that the state doesn’t fully control, such as college tuition payments and federal aid for highways.

You can see $2.2 billion spending cuts if you look at the general fund budget, which pays for schools, health and public safety from general taxes. The fund dropped from $17 billion in 2008 to $14.8 billion in 2010.

In the 2011 budget year, which ends June 30, the general fund rose to $15.4 billion. It’s set at $16 billion for the 2012 budget, which starts July 1.

One more note: McDonnell said that when he took office in January 2010 ""we faced historic budget deficits of $6 billion."" That implies that the entire problem was solved under his watch.

But the financial problems began at least 18 months before McDonnell took office. And McDonnell’s predecessor -- Democrat Tim Kaine --  announced budget actions to close a $2.5 billion shortfall in October 2008.

Kaine, McDonnell and the General Assembly all share credit for closing a $6 billion gap. It’s impossible to precisely establish how much the shortfall was solved under McDonnell or Kaine. Numbers used by Kaine and McDonnell do not add up neatly. Some of the programs begun by Kaine were implemented by McDonnell, so who should get the credit?

Kaine, by the way, is making a similar claim to McDonnell’s. The Democrat announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on April 5. The next day, at a news conference, he said: ""We cut over $6 billion from the state budget by the time I finished being governor.""

We’ll look at that in the future. For now, let’s review McDonnell’s claim.

The governor says he faced a $6 billion budget shortfall when he took office in January 2010 and ""we closed those deficits by cutting spending.""

It’s true that Virginia that Virginia faced $6 billion in shortfalls between from 2008 through 2010. But the problems began long before McDonnell took office and so did some of the solutions. Kaine announced a plan to close $2.5 billion of thee budget gap in October 2008. It’s impossible to determine exactly how much of the shortfall was solved under McDonnell and how much under Kaine.

McDonnell wrongly implies all off the $6 billion revenue shortfall was balanced with spending cuts. In fact, spending reductions accounted for about $2.34 billion of the sum. The rest came through bookkeeping maneuvers and federal stimulus dollars.

McDonnell and the General Assembly deserve credit for balancing the budget without raising taxes during a brutal recession. McDonnell is accurate in saying spending was cut, but he greatly exaggerates how much.

Tuition equity supporters say undocumented students in Oregon are working toward U.S. citizenship
","
Among the hot topics of the Oregon Legislature this session is Senate Bill 742, which would grant cheaper in-state tuition to undocumented students brought to the country as children. Supporters say it’s only fair that these high school graduates, who are for all intents and purposes ""Oregonians,"" get a shot at a more affordable state university education.

Qualified students would have to meet specific credentials to get in-state tuition. They must have attended a U.S. school for at least five years, attended an Oregon school for three years, and graduated from an Oregon high school.

But there is a puzzling final criterion. According to a fact sheet by Oregon Rep. Michael Dembrow, D-Portland, the students ""are actively working toward U.S. citizenship."" Senate Majority Leader Diane Rosenbaum, D-Portland, also says this in a press release:

""The students who will benefit from SB 742 have attended a U.S. school for at least five years, graduated from an Oregon high school, and are on the path to citizenship. By allowing a student to stay in Oregon and attend college, we’re keeping some of our best and our brightest in the state.""

Now we at PolitiFact Oregon understand just enough about federal immigration law to know that applying for citizenship or legal residency as an undocumented person still living in the United States is really tough under current law. So we wanted to find out what it meant to be ""actively working toward U.S. citizenship.""  

Let’s turn first to the language of Senate Bill 742, section 2(1)c, which states that the student ""shows intention to become a citizen or a lawful permanent resident of the United States by filing an affidavit with the institution of higher education... stating that the student has filed an application to legalize the student’s immigration status, or will file an application as soon as the student is eligible to do so.""  

Well, filing an affidavit with the Oregon University System does not mean that that person is actively working toward citizenship. Sorry,that’s not a step in the onerous process to achieve legal status.

Now let’s look at the process if you are undocumented and in the country illegally, but you want to apply for U.S. citizenship. For that, we turned to Sharon Rummery, a longtime spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Rummery says there are a few ways an ""out of status"" person could seek to become a permanent resident and then apply for citizenship. The person could apply for political asylum. The person could be petitioned by an immediate family member who is here legally.

Or the person could be petitioned by a potential employer who swears that he or she can’t find a legal resident or citizen to do the job that’s open. (That’s called an H-1B visa -- and frankly, it’s used by high-tech companies to get more skilled engineers and programmers to the United States; those, and fashion models.)

Also, here’s the kicker from Rummery, which shows why it’s so daunting for undocumented students: Even if these petitions are made, ""you still can't get permanent resident status without leaving the U.S.  If you've been here out of status for more than a year, you'll be subject to a 10-year bar on returning."" There's a waiver to the 10-year bar, but in most cases, you have to leave the country to apply for that waiver.

David Leopold, national president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, attests to the difficult position these students are in. ""Other than some minor, minor, some very narrow exceptions, it’s not legally possible to put somebody on a pathway to citizenship who is undocumented,"" he said.

Dembrow, in defense, argues a broader definition of the phrase. ""‘On the path to citizenship’ simply means that they have begun the process of seeking citizenship,"" he wrote in an email. ""By signing an affidavit and swearing their intention to put themselves through the complicated, lengthy process, they have started that journey.""

Tell that to USCIS. Look, we realize that immigration law is full of unique situations and exemptions, and we know that the law can change. In other words, just because it’s difficult for undocumented students to get legal status now -- which is why some in Oregon want tuition equity -- doesn’t mean they can’t get legal status in the future.

The federal Dream Act, which failed in Congress last year, would have granted a way for those students here illegally to become U.S. citizens. But the federal Dream Act is not Oregon’s Tuition Equity Bill and for supporters to claim that these students are all ""actively working toward"" or ""on the path"" toward citizenship is misleading.

To sign an affidavit that the student will file an application as soon as the student is eligible to do so is essentially meaningless for most students. Unless students are already in the process of applying for citizenship, which might be the case for some, the moment where they are eligible likely will never come for most undocumented students under current law.  

There’s an element of truth -- signing an affidavit indicates some intention on the part of the student who hasn’t yet applied -- but it’s nowhere near the same as applying for legal status with USCIS. We rate this Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/09/michael-denbrow/tuition-equity-supporters-say-undocumented-student/

State Rep. Donna Howard says 50 percent of students who enter higher ed aren't prepared for college-level work and require remedial courses
","
As floor debate on the Texas House’s version of the 2012-13 state budget wound down Sunday, state Rep. Donna Howard decried balancing the budget with spending cuts alone.

The Austin Democrat, who voted against the bill, said lawmakers have falsely painted the state’s government as ""bloated,"" with enough revenue to run Texas.

""I have a hard time believing that when when 50 percent of our students who enter higher education need to take remedial courses because they are not prepared for college-level work,"" Howard said.

We wondered whether half of the state’s 1.3 million students enrolled in higher ed really start off needing to catch up.

To back up Howard’s statement, Eleanor D’Ambrosio, her chief of staff, passed on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the agency that oversees higher education in the state.

But first, some background: As of fall 2003, state law requires students entering public higher education institutions in Texas to pass a Texas Success Initiative exam assessing their readiness in reading, mathematics and writing — unless they meet one of six exemption standards, including a combined verbal and math SAT score of 1,070, with a minimum of 500 on either portion of the test.

Students must take and pass the exam before they’re eligible to enroll in college-level classes. Those who don’t pass one or all parts of the exam are placed in a ""developmental education program designed to help the student achieve college readiness,"" according to a June 2010 overview of the initiative by the coordinating board.

According to an e-mail to Howard’s office from Lizette Montiel, a spokeswoman with the coordinating board, in fall 2008, 48.6 percent of students entering community colleges directly after graduating from high school failed to meet Texas Success Initiative standards in at least one area. The coordinating board collects the data from public institutions of higher education, the e-mail says.

According to the e-mail, that rate has dropped from 54.3 percent in 2003.

D’Ambrosio also sent us a link to a October 2008 column on the coordinating board’s website by Higher Education Commissioner Raymund Paredes. Paredes, arguing that some pre-Advanced Placement classes in Texas high schools aren’t rigorous enough, wrote that coordinating board data ""show that 50 percent of entering Texas college students require remedial education.""

She also passed on the agency’s strategic June 18 plan for fiscal years 2011-15. Addressing challenges Texas colleges may face in bringing under-prepared students up to college standards, the report says: ""Nearly half of all first-time college students are not college ready in at least one of the core academic areas of math, reading or writing.""

Case closed? Not quite.

Board spokesman Dominic Chavez told us that in academic parlance, ""college"" refers solely to the state’s community colleges. Texas has more than 50 community college districts, some with multiple campuses. The board refers to four-year institutions as universities, Chavez said.

Calling the June 2010 report ""a poorly-worded document,"" Chavez said those involved with higher education would catch that distinction, but there’s ""no way that someone from the general public would look at that and know that there’s a nuance there.""

Howard ""read exactly and said exactly what’s in the report,"" Chavez said. The report does not specify that ""college students"" only refers to people enrolled in community colleges.

So, nearly half of all students who enroll in community college immediately after high school aren’t college-ready in at least one academic area, Chavez said, but that statistic changes when you include four-year universities. In fall 2008, 31 percent of students who enrolled in public higher education institutions — both community colleges and four-year universities— immediately after high school weren’t ready in at one academic area.

The rate is even lower for students who enrolled in four-year universities right out of high school. Only about 14 percent of those students aren’t college-ready in one or more academic area.

Include freshman university students who have been out of high school for longer, and the not-ready rate rises to about 28 percent. Add community college students who have been out of high school for a few years, and that figure jumps to 38 percent.

""Community colleges traditionally serve students who are less prepared,"" Chavez said. But ""most students who are enrolled in our universities are college-ready.""

Do all students who fail to meet the Texas Success Initiative standards in at least on area require remedial coursework? In most cases, yes, Chavez said.

When we followed up with Howard’s office, D’Ambrosio told us that Howard was ""trying to convey (in her own words) a data point that had been presented to her"" by the coordinating board.

""Rep. Howard relies on state agencies to provide her with information and statistics on various topics,"" D’Ambrosio said. ""Rep. Howard did not ask for clarification when she was presented with information that said nearly half of all first-time college students are not college ready in at least one of the core academic areas of math, reading or writing.""

Upshot: Howard based her statement on a state report that says nearly 50 percent of all incoming college students fresh out of high school are underprepared for college and require remedial attention. However, the report doesn’t explain — and Howard didn’t realize — that the statistic excludes students at four-year universities.

Taking into account all students who enroll in a Texas institution of higher education, nearly 40 percent aren’t prepared for some aspect of college-level work. And if you only look at students who enter higher education directly from high school, that rate drops to 31 percent. We rate Howard’s statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/09/donna-howard/state-rep-donna-howard-says-50-percent-students-wh/

Jon Kyl says abortion services are “well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does”
","
As the government inched toward a shutdown on April 8, 2011, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., gave a speech on the Senate floor to respond to Democratic charges that the major sticking point in the negotiations was a disagreement over Planned Parenthood.

Many Republicans want to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the organization does abortions. The federal government currently provides Planned Parenthood with $363 million annually, but by law, that money cannot be spent on abortion. It is spent on other types of health care services, such as cancer screenings, breast exams, and tests and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.

Some opponents of abortion say that by sending any money to Planned Parenthood, taxpayers are still supporting abortions indirectly, since money is fungible. That’s why they’re pushing to eliminate all funding for the organization.

Here’s a portion of what Kyl said on the floor:

""Everybody goes to clinics, to hospitals, to doctors, and so on. Some people go to Planned Parenthood. But you don’t have to go to Planned Parenthood to get your cholesterol or your blood pressure checked. If you want an abortion, you go to Planned Parenthood, and that’s well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.""

We got many requests to fact-check his statement.

Planned Parenthood says the statistics are dramatically different -- that 90 percent of its services are preventive in nature, compared with 3 percent that are abortion-related.

Planned Parenthood calculates the numbers by services provided, rather than dollars spent. In a fact sheet last updated in March 2011, the group lists the following breakdown of its services:

Contraception (including reversible contraception, emergency contraception, vasectomies and tubal sterilizations): 4,009,549 services

Sexually transmitted infections testing and treatment: 3,955,916 services

Cancer screening and prevention: 1,830,811 services

Other women’s health services (including pregnancy tests and prenatal care): 1,178,369 services

Abortions: 332,278 procedures

Miscellaneous (including primary care and adoption referrals): 76,977

Total services: 11,383,900

By this tally, abortions accounted for just under 3 percent of the procedures Planned Parenthood provided in 2009, which is the most recent year for which the group is reporting statistics. And that would make Kyl’s statement way off.

We should note a few caveats.

First, we think many people would acknowledge a difference between providing an abortion and, say, handing out a pack of condoms or conducting a blood test. The former is a significant surgical procedure, whereas the latter are quick and inexpensive services. So Planned Parenthood’s use of ""services"" as its yardstick likely decreases abortion’s prominence compared to what other measurements would show. Using dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care would likely put abortion above 3 percent in the calculations.

Second, it’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood self-reported these numbers, although the group says each affiliate’s numbers are independently audited. (There is no single, national audit.) So we have no choice but to accept their accuracy more or less on faith.

Still, even with those caveats, we do think that Kyl has vastly overstated the share of abortions.

We checked with Kyl’s office but did not hear back. However, a few hours after the speech, CNN anchor T.J. Holmes told viewers that the network had received a statement from Kyl’s office saying that the senator’s remark ""was not intended to be a factual statement but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives millions in taxpayer dollars, does subsidize abortions.""

The statistics from Planned Parenthood and the statement from Kyl's office make it clear that he erred by saying abortion counts for well over 90 percent of the group's services. We find his claim False.",/factchecks/2011/apr/08/jon-kyl/jon-kyl-says-abortion-services-are-well-over-90-pe/

Donald Trump says his show is No. 1 on NBC -- is he right?
","
No one ever accused Donald Trump of being modest. So when he was asked in a combative Today show interview when he would formally announce a campaign for president, the tycoon said he was being respectful of NBC.

After all, Trump said, his show The Celebrity Apprentice is the network's top-rated show.

Here's the exchange with Today host Meredith Vieira:

Vieira: ""What are you waiting for?""

Trump: ""I hate to say it, I have the No. 1 show on NBC. Is that a correct statement? I mean, The Apprentice is doing great -- The Celebrity Apprentice.""

Vieira: ""What does that have to do....""

Trump: ""It has a lot to do. It sounds so trivial, and I hate to even bring it up, but I'm not allowed to run during the show. You're not allowed to have the show on and be a declared candidate. It’s a great show and it’s got phenomenal ratings, and until that show is over, I can’t declare, because otherwise, NBC would have to take the show off the air, and I think that would be very unfair to NBC.""

This season's Celebrity Apprentice is the latest in a long-running NBC reality show that features celebrities ranging from a country singer to a Playmate of the Year competing in a series of challenges that include creating a children's book and selling pizzas. At the end of each show, one of them gets fired by Trump.

So how do the ratings look? It depends whether you're referring to recent weeks or to the entire season.

If you look at the most recent week’s Nielsen ratings, Trump is right. For the week ending April 3, 2011, The Celebrity Apprentice ranked higher than any NBC prime time broadcast show among adults age 18-49 -- the coveted demographic for television executives.

We should note that the bar is pretty low to be the highest-rated NBC show these days. When you consider shows on all broadcast networks that week, The Celebrity Apprentice ranked 15th. And The Celebrity Apprentice was the only NBC show to rank in the top 22 -- behind 10 from CBS, eight from ABC and three from Fox.

We’ll also note that for the previous week -- the one ending March 27 -- The Celebrity Apprentice finished third on NBC and 19th overall.

Still, Trump's right for the most recent ratings.

For the entire season, however, The Celebrity Apprentice is not the top-rated NBC show.

Marc Berman, a senior television editor at AdWeek, provided us with the average Nielsen ratings for all 160 broadcast network shows between Sept. 20, 2010, and April 3, 2011 -- basically, the entire season to date.

Here’s how the top NBC shows stack up for the 18-to-49 demographic:

1. Sunday Night Football (3rd overall)
2. Football Night in America pregame show (tied for 17th overall)
3. The Office (tied for 17th overall)
4. The Biggest Loser (tied for 34th overall)
5. The Celebrity Apprentice (tied for 36th overall)

And here are the numbers for all ages:

1. Sunday Night Football (4th overall)
2. Harry’s Law (29th overall)
3. Football Night in America pregame show (33rd overall)
4. Law & Order L.A. (42nd overall)
5. The Celebrity Apprentice (44th overall)

So in both categories, The Celebrity Apprentice ranks fifth behind a mix of scripted dramas, sitcoms, reality shows and Sunday football. By this standard, Trump is wrong to say he has ""the No. 1 on NBC.""

""It’s misleading,"" Berman said. ""His show is doing well for NBC, but it’s not the No. 1.""

So Trump's boast needs some context. He's right for the most recent ratings, but not for the season overall. We find his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-his-show-no-1-nbc-he-right/
"['Ethics', 'Health Care', 'Legal Issues', 'Florida', 'Broward County Medical Association']","
Group claims it is not illegal in Florida for spouse to benefit from state legislation supported by partner
","
From appointing state health agency heads to proposing how much funding state-run health care programs should receive, Gov. Rick Scott has some major influence over the state's medical industry.

It's that influence coupled with Scott's former business dealings in health care that has at least one group of Florida physicians concerned that Scott could potentially peddle legislation that would benefit a fast-growing urgent-care clinic company he co-founded.

On March 31, 2011, the board of directors of the Broward County Medical Association convened for its monthly meeting, where one of the items up for discussion was how Scott's position might benefit Solantic Corp. -- a chain of 32 walk-in clinics Scott helped found in 2001.

Before taking office in January 2011, Scott transferred his $62 million worth of shares in the company into a trust under his wife's name. Scott said that by doing so, he was free of any future conflicts of interest.

""As I've told you, I'm not involved in that company,"" Scott was quoted as saying in the St. Petersburg Times in an April 2, 2011, article about why he didn't sell his shares instead.

Still, for the 20-member board of the Broward Medical Association, Scott handing over his shares to his wife did not address concerns that his actions as governor could potentially benefit Solantic. So the board unanimously agreed to issue a resolution.

""It is a conflict of interest for the governor (or any government official) to have his immediate family own urgent-care centers or clinics and for them to benefit financially from government health care reform,"" read the resolution, according to an e-mail provided by the group's president, Dr. Aaron Elkin. The association represents 1,500 allopathic and osteopathic physicians of all specialties, according to its website.

The association then sent out notice of the resolution with the following statement: ""Gov. Scott transferred his ownership interest in Solantic to a trust owned and managed by his wife. Solantic has contracts with Medicaid HMOs. Their volume of patients will likely increase if/when Medicaid Reform is expanded statewide. Gov. Scott's wife sits on the Solantic board. Florida is one of the few states where that arrangement (an immediate family member may prosper from legislation supported by their spouse) is not illegal.""

We wondered if the last part of the statement was true. Does Florida have no laws banning a state officer from supporting legislation that would benefit an immediate family member?

What Florida law says

First, we turned to Florida statutes and the Florida Commission on Ethics to see what the law spells out in cases where an immediate family member’s finances could potentially cause a conflict of interest.

Kerrie Stillman, spokeswoman for the Florida Commission on Ethics, said she couldn't comment on Scott's potential conflict of interest but directed us to the provisions of the law that might be relevant. The issue of ""misuse of public position"" is addressed in Florida Statute 112.313.

The law reads: ""No public officer...shall corruptly use or attempt to use his or her official position or any property or resource which may be within his or her trust, or perform his or her official duties, to secure a special privilege, benefit, or exemption for himself, herself, or others.""

When it comes to business dealings, the same statute says that a public officer shall not ""either directly or indirectly purchase, rent, or lease any realty, goods, or services for his or her own agency from any business entity"" in which the officer, his or her spouse or child is an officer, partner, director or proprietor or has a ""material interest.""

As long as Solantic is not doing business directly with the governor's office, then Scott is technically not violating those provisions, said Mark Herron, a Tallahassee attorney specializing in ethics and government affairs. Herron also previously served on the Florida Commission on Ethics.

""His agency is the Executive Office of the Governor, it’s not the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Department of Health, the Department of Elder Affairs, etc.,"" Herron said. ""From a strict reading of those provisions, he doesn’t have any conflicting interests as long as Solantic is not doing business with the Executive Office of the Governor.""

While Scott does not have a vote in legislative matters -- only the ability to propose or veto legislation -- it's worth noting that even other state lawmakers can still vote on an issue, even if there is a potential conflict of interest.

Florida Statute 112.3143 provides that ""no state public officer is prohibited from voting in an official capacity on any matter.""

The statute goes on to clarify that should there be a potential conflict of interest, such as a ""special private gain or loss of a relative or business associate,"" the elected official has 15 days after the vote occurs to ""disclose the nature of his or her interest as a public record in a memorandum file filed with the person responsible for recording the minutes of the meeting.""

In contrast, on the municipal and county level, the same statute gives a different set of instructions. Should a conflict of interest arise, officials have to abstain from voting on the measure, and publicly announce at the meeting why they aren't voting. They also have 15 days to file a memorandum with the clerk or whoever is recording meeting minutes.

Herron said that when the state’s initial ethics laws were passed in 1975, both local and state governments were held to the same standard. But the provisions for municipal and county officials were changed in 1984 because lawmakers felt local elected officials have more day-to-day dealings with approving and entering into contracts.

A measure working its way through the Legislature this year seeks to hold all state officers to the same standard as local and county officials when it comes to voting on items where there may be conflicts of interest.

Blind trusts

The issue of where to place a governor's financial holdings to avoid a potential conflict of interest has been around long before Scott -- whose reported net worth is $218 million -- took office.

During two terms as governor, Jeb Bush, whose net worth coming into office was close to $2 million, held his assets in a blind trust, according to the St. Petersburg Times. A blind trust is one in which the owner hands over power of attorney to someone else, and has no right to intervene in the holdings of the trust. Gov. Charlie Crist likewise placed his assets in a revocable trust, according to the Times. That's similar to a blind trust in that you’re handing over the daily decisions about assets to someone else, but there is still an opportunity to chime in on the management of the assets.

For the 2011 legislative session, Republican Sen. Mike Fasano has revived a bill he first sponsored in 2007 that would require the governor and other elected officials to place their financial assets in a blind trust.

We called Scott's office to get his take on the concerns that, by transferring his Solantic shares to his wife’s trust, he had not eliminated the potential for a conflict of interest, but we did not hear back.

Still, when Scott was pressed again on the subject of potential conflicts of interest with Solantic at an economic forum in West Palm Beach on April 4, 2011, he told the Palm Beach Post: ""That company will not be doing business with the state, and I've told everybody all along, hold me accountable for that.""

However, even if Solantic does not do business with the state in an official capacity, the company can still accept payments through state workers compensation programs and Medicaid HMO plans. For example, people covered by state-run programs may visit a Solantic clinic as a personal decision.

According to figures provided by Solantic CEO Karen Bowling to the Palm Beach Post and St. Petersburg Times, the company received $110,657 from the state in 2010, and $20,061 so far in 2011 -- mainly for providing employment-related physicals and workers' compensation cases.

""Even when we cast the governor's actions in the best light possible and presume his compliance with the relevant Florida voting conflict and disclosure of financial interests statutes, his indirect but real financial interests in the current trust creates an appearance of impropriety from a reasonably objective public perspective,"" said Tony Alfieri, director of the Center for Ethics and Public Service at the University of Miami School of Law.

Our ruling

The medical association's resolution criticizes Scott for a conflict of interest, but its e-mail announcing the resolution concedes it is not illegal in Florida for an immediate family member of a state officer to prosper from legislation supported by their spouse. So back to our question: Is it legal?

Provisions in Chapter 112 of the Florida Statutes allow state lawmakers to vote on issues that might benefit family members so long as they disclose the relationship after the vote. Scott may propose health-care legislation and budgets and appoint health-care officials, but he's not a lawmaker. Solantic clinics benefit from doing routine medical work paid for through state programs, such as Medicaid or workers' comp exams, but Scott has said repeatedly that Solantic will not officially do business with the state.

""From the point of view of complying with the strict definition of the law, he appears not to have violated any of the provisions,""  Herron said. ""But, as everyone has noted, there may be a higher standard than a legal standard to be held to.""

The legal standard is the one we're fact-checking. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/08/broward-county-medical-association/group-claims-it-not-illegal-florida-spouse-benefit/
"['Redistricting', 'Virginia', 'Thomas Norment, Jr.']","
Sen. Thomas Norment now says he opposes bipartisan redistricting
","
Redistricting is an ugly process, one that almost always leaves bruised feelings among the minority party.

And that’s playing out in both chambers of the General Assembly this week. Republicans control the House of Delegates and have eliminated the district of Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry. Democrats control the Senate and are drawing four Republican incumbents into two districts.

Senate Minority Leader Thomas K. Norment, Jr., R-James City, was especially upset with the Democratic proposal.

""Senate Democrats have crafted an outrageously partisan redistricting plan that will go down as one of the most notorious examples of gerrymandering in history,"" Norment said in a press release.

The Senate plan, drawn primarily by Sen. Janet D. Howell, D-Fairfax, would squeeze GOP Sens. Frank W. Wagner and Jeff McWaters, both of Virginia Beach, into the same district. It also would lump Sen. Stephen D. Newman, R-Lynchburg, into the same district as Sen. Ralph K. Smith, R-Botetourt County.

Ten years ago, when Norment was Senate majority leader, he did the same thing.

With Republicans holding 22 seats to the Democrats’ 18, the Senate drew election maps, Norment’s party cramped Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple, D-Arlington, into the same district as Sen. Leslie L. Byrne, D-Fairfax.

Sen. Madison E. Marye, D-Montgomery, was grouped with Sen. Malfourd ""Bo"" Trumbo, R-Botetourt, with the Marye’s seat moving to Northern Virginia.  The moves created a pair of GOP-leaning open seats, designed for and won by Republicans who were then serving in the House of Delegates.

The gerrymandering left Byrne furious and complaining that Republicans were unfairly singling out Democratic women. Norment was unsympathetic, sarcastically replying that ""subtlety is lost"" on the Democrat.

The next day, Norment said the 2001 map was far less extreme than those drawn in 1991, when Democrats held the Senate. Norment said redistricting is ""a political process.""

Norment isn’t the only senator to change his redistricting tune. Ten years ago Howell called the GOP’s Senate  plan ""absurd."" On April 5, she said the  2011 map she drew for the Democratic majority followed the same principles as the 2001 GOP plan, including the use of a 2 percent population deviation for districts. Howell also noted that her plan splits 43 localities into different districts, quite similar to the 41 cleaved in the 2001 map.

Norment now complains that Senate Democrats are pushing ""one of the most notorious examples of gerrymandering in history.""

But to our eyes, Howell’s plan uses many of the same criteria Norment endorsed 10 years ago.  Just as two Democrats stood to lose their seats in 2001, two Republicans are out of luck in 2011.

Rep. Tim Ryan off target in claim about service personnel contemplating suicide
","
A March 16 House Armed Services Committee hearing on the war in Afghanistan put the spotlight on a  widely documented increase in military suicides. 

During questioning of General David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and Michele Flournoy, undersecretary of defense for policy, Rep. Tim Ryan cited figures for military personnel who have contemplated taking their own lives

""From '05 to '09, we've had 1,100 soldiers commit suicide, one every 36 hours. A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide,"" Ryan said at the hearing.

 PolitiFact Ohio checked the first part of his quote in a separate item and rated it True. This item will just check his assertion that 7.3 percent of personnel in the Army, Navy and Marines have contemplated suicide.

We started by trying to verify the existence of the Navy Times report that Ryan mentioned, which was supposed to indicate that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have contemplated suicide. When we couldn’t find it among Navy Times articles archived in the Lexis-Nexis database, we contacted editors at Navy Times. They confirmed that the publication never reported such a statistic.

The closest thing we found was a December 2009 article on attempted suicides in the military during 2008. It cites a Defense Department survey that found the Navy had a 2.8 percent attempted suicide rate that year, the Army had a 2 percent rate, the Marine Corps had a 2.3 percent rate and the Air Force had a rate of 1.6 percent.

It’s important to note, though, that these numbers represent service members who actually tried to kill themselves, not those who thought about suicide, as Ryan said.

But Ryan’s statistic, it turns out, evolved from this December 2009 article via a circuitous series of bloopers.

First, instead of consulting the original article or the military report from which it drew its information, Ryan got his information from a student-researched blog entry on a website operated by ""Project Censored."" That blog item said: ""According to the Navy Times, 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marine soldiers reported in a survey that they had attempted suicide at one point.""

The ""Project Censored"" author used an article from ""The World Socialist Web Site"" as his main source, and committed a math gaffe in attempting to summarize the article.

Instead of finding a combined average for suicide attempts in those three service branches, the student added the percentages together to produce an erroneously high 7.3 percent figure. The total is slightly off from the sum of the Navy Times numbers because the Socialist website incorrectly listed the Navy’s suicide attempt rate as 3 percent instead of 2.8 percent.

Finally, Ryan added in his own mistake to the mix by claiming the figure applied to suicidal thoughts instead of suicide attempts.

""Congressman Ryan unfortunately misstated the statistics,"" Ryan spokesman Erick Sanchez acknowledged in an email.  Sanchez sent us the original government report that contains the statistics reported by Navy Times. It also contains data on suicidal thoughts by members of the U.S. military.

That report said that in 2008, almost 5 percent of Defense Department personnel said they’d seriously considered suicide. The Air Force (3.1 percent) and Coast Guard (2.8 percent) had lower rates of suicidal thoughts than the other service branches, which were all around the 5 percent mark.

Although the rate of suicidal thoughts had not increased since 2005, the report found that ""all DoD services reported at least a doubling in rates of attempting suicide from 2005 to 2008."" It cited an overall military rate of 2.2 percent for attempted suicides.

So where does that leave us on the Truth-O-Meter?

Through a series of goofs and misrepresentations, data about actual attempted suicides among military personnel became a number cited as the percentage of those who had contemplated suicide. The numbers Ryan cited didn’t come directly from the military. Instead, he relied on material from a blog article that used faulty mathematics to come up with an erroneous percentage.

The series of errors took data from a military report on a ridiculous course to create an inaccurate statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, that kind of a claim rates as Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/apr/08/tim-ryan/series-errors-thwarts-rep-tim-ryans-accuracy-milit/
"['Abortion', 'Georgia', 'Herman Cain']","
Cain claims Planned Parenthood founded for ""planned genocide""
","
This presidential election season, Georgia’s homegrown prospect Herman Cain is talking about race.

Cain, a black, conservative Republican, recently said the media is ""scared that a real black man may run against Barack Obama.""

And there’s this one about pro-abortion rights group Planned Parenthood:

""When Margaret Sanger - check my history - started Planned Parenthood, the objective was to put these centers in primarily black communities so they could help kill black babies before they came into the world,"" Cain said during a talk in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group.

""It's planned genocide,"" Cain added. He wants the U.S. Congress to yank funding for Planned Parenthood, which receives about $75 million a year to provide non-abortion health services.

Was Planned Parenthood founded to help kill unborn black babies?

Cain asked his audience to check his history. So, we did.

First, a disclaimer. Cain, who has launched a presidential exploratory committee, was a talk show host on AM 750 and now 95.5 FM WSB, which, like The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is part of Cox Media Group.

Cain has more political heft than your average talking head. The former CEO of Godfather Pizza beat a six-term U.S. congressman to finish second in Georgia’s 2004 U.S. Senate Republican primary. The Morehouse grad has eight honorary doctorate degrees and has authored four books, and he serves on several corporate boards.

Now some history. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger is credited with making birth control legal and widely available.

Born 1879, Sanger, who was white, blamed her mother’s death on her frequent pregnancies. At the time, speaking about birth control could lead to arrest. She thought that if women could legally control the number of children they bore, their health and economic conditions would improve.

We consulted with scholarship, Cain’s camp, anti-abortion groups, Sanger’s biographer, and multiple experts on Cain’s claim.

The supposed evidence that Sanger supported black genocide is a loose collection of her most objectionable statements, her ties to the disgraced eugenics movement, and her work on what was called the Negro Project. That effort, started in 1939, brought birth control services (but not abortion) to black communities in the South.

These facts don’t come close to supporting Cain’s claim.

Eugenics was once a wildly popular theory that the human race can be improved through better breeding and genetics. It drew together backers as diverse as President Theodore Roosevelt and black intellectual W.E.B. DuBois.

At its best, the U.S. movement pushed for better prenatal care. At its worst, it enabled forced sterilization laws and let claims that blacks and immigrants were inferior to masquerade as science.

Sanger welcomed some of the movement’s more notorious leaders onto the board of a predecessor to Planned Parenthood. She also endorsed paying pensions to women of low intelligence who agreed to be sterilized.

But we found no evidence that Sanger advocated - privately or publicly - for anything even resembling the ""genocide"" of blacks, or that she thought blacks are genetically inferior.

Every academic PolitiFact Georgia consulted said that Cain’s claim is wrong.

""I have never run into any serious academic reference of Sanger or others wanting to ‘kill black babies,’"" Indiana University professor Ruth Engs, a eugenics movement expert, told PolitiFact Georgia in an e-mail.

What’s worse, Cain got his facts mixed up.

Sanger’s first birth control clinic opened in 1916 in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., which was mostly Irish and Jewish.

When she did open a Harlem clinic in the early 1930s, about half of its patients were white. Members of the black establishment, including DuBois and black newspaper the Amsterdam News, supported it. This was hardly the pro-genocide camp.

None of these centers performed abortions.

Those who think Sanger wanted black genocide cite the Negro Project. But even their strongest evidence, a passage from a letter she wrote advocating that organizers recruit black ministers for the project, does not come close to proving a genocidal plot.

Sanger wrote that ""We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs.""

But her correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears.

The facts of the Negro Project suggest nothing more genocidal than a public health project. Black leaders DuBois and Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and the pastor of the influential black Abyssinian Baptist Church were members of its advisory council. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was supportive.

For Sanger to launch a genocidal plot behind their backs and leave no true evidence in her numerous writings would require powers just shy of witchcraft.

Really, calling the Negro Project a genocidal plot defies common sense. Why would Sanger try to destroy a race of people by giving them access to the very thing she thought could make life better?

Planned Parenthood’s early objective was not to ""help kill black babies before they came into the world.""

Sanger failed to rise above the ethnic and racial paternalism of her time, but that’s a far cry from being genocidal.

Cain’s claim is a ridiculous, cynical play of the race card. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/apr/08/herman-cain/cain-claims-planned-parenthood-founded-planned-gen/
"['Ohio', 'Military', 'Tim Ryan']","
Rep. Tim Ryan cites rising numbers of service personnel committing suicide
","
Persistent U.S. deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have coincided with a widely documented increase in military suicides.

At a March 16 House Armed Services Committee hearing on the war in Afghanistan, Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, raised the issue with General David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, as well as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy.

""From '05 to '09, we've had 1,100 soldiers commit suicide, one every 36 hours. A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide,"" Ryan said at the hearing.

Ryan, whose district includes an Air Force Reserve base, brought up an important issue. PolitiFact Ohio reviewed the second part of his quote in a separate item, rating it Pants On Fire. This item will focus on his claim about the number of suicides and their frequency.

Ryan’s staff referred us to a 2010 Pentagon report titled ""The Challenge and the Promise: Strengthening the Force, Preventing Suicide and Saving Lives,"" which shows the military’s suicide rate rose from 10.3 per 100,000 service personnel in 2001 to 18.4 per 100,000 in 2009.

The report counts 189 suicides by active duty and reserve component service members in 2005. In 2006, the number rose to 213. It was 224 in 2007, 267 in 2008, and 309 in 2009. That’s a grand total of total of 1,202 suicides over five years, which exceeds the number Ryan cited.

Dividing the 43,824 hours in that period by 1,202 suicides reveals that there was one military suicide every 36.46 hours, a number nearly identical to Ryan’s statistic.

The groups with the highest suicide rates were service members who were male, Caucasian, divorced, under age 25 and those with a GED. The largest U.S. military branch the Army, had the highest number of suicides during those years. It released its own report on the topic last year.

So where does this claim rank on the Truth-O-Meter?

Ryan’s number for actual suicides over a five year period was understated, but not off by enough to distort his underlying point - that suicides among military personnel are a problem that is on the rise. His statistic of one military suicide every 36 hours was also on the mark.

On this point we rate his statement as True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/08/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-cites-rising-numbers-service-personne/
"['Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Families', 'State Budget', 'Roberto DaSilva']","
Rep. DaSilva says R.I. pays hundreds of thousands of dollars for out-of-state care for children in state custody
","
State Rep. Roberto DaSilva recently introduced legislation intended to make it much more difficult for the state Department of Children, Youth and Families to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities.

He said he was moved by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who was the subject of a column by The Providence Journal’s Bob Kerr.

Alahverdian says he endured years of abuse and neglect in two out-of-state residential facilities where he was sent by DCYF. He has formed his own nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care. He has also filed state and federal lawsuits stemming from his alleged mistreatment.

DaSilva said in a General Assembly news release that Rhode Island has the resources to provide children with the treatment they need within the state. DaSilva said he is concerned about the well-being of children in state care and also about keeping taxpayer dollars in the state.

""We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, to house our own state residents,"" DaSilva said. ""It just doesn’t make sense, especially in these dire economic times.""

Among the children the DCYF takes into its custody are those who are victims of abuse or neglect caused by their primary caretakers, those who are in the juvenile justice system and ordered by courts to have access to rehabilitative care, and those with emotional, behavioral or developmental challenges who need out-of-home care and treatment and whose parents give DCYF temporary custody, according to DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin.

The DCYF has said it is working to reduce its dependence on residential treatment programs, both in Rhode Island and in other states. So we wondered whether the agency is still spending as much as DaSilva says on such placements.

We asked DaSilva where he got his information and he referred us to a website called the Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal. It shows the agency’s expenditures in various categories such as personnel and foster care. The top expenditure is residential services.

For fiscal year 2010, for instance, the portal shows the state spent $117 million for residential care for youth in DCYF custody, which also includes costs for foster home placements and varous community services
 
Much of that money was spent on local services such as Child and Family Services of Newport County or Ocean Tides, a residential treatment program in Narragansett for male juvenile offenders. The DCYF also budgets an additional $22.4 million this year for youths sent to the Rhode Island Training School.

But the website shows that millions of dollars go to out-of-state programs. For example, Mass Mentor Inc., which provides services at several Massachusetts locations to children with developmental disabilities was paid $376,829 in the first quarter.

During the same quarter, the Bennington School in Vermont was paid $77,769 and the Glen Mills School in Pennsylvania got $59,246.

We asked Kevin J. Aucoin, interim director of DCYF, for more data. He said that this fiscal year, the DCYF expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities, most of them in nearby states.

Aucoin says the spending on residential programs has been declining. In fiscal year 2007, for example, the state spent $85.4 million for 1,102 children. In that year, it spent $18.4 million to send 154 children out of state.

All residential placements are expected to be reduced as the agency adopts a new model of care that focuses on keeping families together.

Aucoin said the DCYF sends children out of state for specialized treatments not offered by in-state providers. Those include multiple psychiatric diagnoses and severe and profound developmental disabilities. The majority, he said, have severe aggressive behaviors. Some may be youth with significant ""sexual offending behaviors.""

Aucoin said children are placed out of state only with approval of the Family Court and only after the agency demonstrates there is no adequate program in-state.

So it appears the only fault with DaSilva’s claim is it is too conservative. Instead of spending the ""hundreds of thousands,"" DaSilva claims, the state actually expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs.

We find his claim to be Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/apr/08/roberto-dasilva/rep-dasilva-says-ri-pays-hundreds-thousands-dollar/
