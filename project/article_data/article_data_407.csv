No mandate makes universal claim tough
","Barack Obama responded to an attack on his health care plan from Hillary Clinton by saying, ""I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Senator Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated -- forced -- them to get health care.""
 
The distinction between the two plan's is that Clinton's has a mandate requiring people to get health insurance; Obama's does not. Is it fair to say a plan is universal without a mandate?
 
There's little doubt that Obama's plan would significantly expand health care coverage. In its structure, it's not that different from Clinton's: Both leave in place employer-based private insurance; they increase access to Medicaid and SCHIP programsl they subsidize premiums for some employers; and they create pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance.
 
But universal? Obama's plan ""would get close to universal coverage,"" said Sara Collins, a health care expert with The Commonwealth Fund. ""It's clear his goal is universal coverage,"" she said, noting that Obama's plan includes a mandate for children.
 
""But I think to get all people covered, he would have to mandate that adults get it, too.""
 
We think Obama is pushing the envelope calling a plan without a mandate ""universal."" For that reason, we rate his claim Barely True.

"['National', 'Crime', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Murders went up, but all violence declined
","We evaluated Rudy Giuliani's attack on Mitt Romney by looking at the FBI's uniform crime statistics.
Romney became governor in January 2003 and left office in January 2007. Comparing the numbers between 2002 and 2006, we can calculate how crime rates changed in Massachusetts during the Romney administration.
 
To count violent crime, the FBI includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2002, that number was 31,137 in Massachusetts. In 2006, it was 28,775. That means violent crime declined 7.6 percent, just like Romney claims. Giuliani is wrong on this point.
 
But let's take a closer look at murders and robberies.
 
Murders went up from 173 in 2002 to 186 in 2006, for an increase of 7.5 percent. The murder rate — the number of people murdered per 100,000 people — moved up from 2.7 to 2.9.
 
Robberies increased more than murders. Robberies in Massachusetts increased from 7,169 to 8,047, a jump of 12.2 percent. The robbery rate increased from 111.5 to 125.
 
So what made the violent crime rate go down if murders and robberies went up? The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault, which declined from 22,018 to 18,800, a drop of 14.6 percent.
 
Given these numbers, Giuliani is right when he says murders and robberies went up, but wrong when he says violent crime went up. We rate his claim Half True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Not if you count all the years
","Rudy Giuliani often boasts of turning a ""$2.3-billion budget deficit into [a] $2.9-billion surplus by FY 2001"" while he was mayor of New York City. He sometimes refers to the surplus as a ""multibillion-dollar"" one.
 
Although his figures are correct, he doesn't include his full eight years in office.
 
When Giuliani took office on Jan. 1, 1994, city spending was in the hole by $700-million, according to figures provided by a former Giuliani budget director, Bob Harding, at the request of the Giuliani campaign. The budget forecast for the next fiscal year, which would begin July 1, 1994, projected a gap between revenues and spending of $2.3-billion.
 
Jump ahead seven years, to June 30, 2001, the end of Giuliani's last full fiscal year in office. The city wound up with the $2.9-billion surplus Giuliani is boasting about. So far, so good.
 
But the last budget Giuliani wrote, for the 2001-02 fiscal year beginning the next day, had higher spending with a much smaller surplus – a $350-million surplus, to be precise, as of the day he left office. And Giuliani's budget forecast for the next fiscal year, 2003, says Harding, included a deficit of $3.1-billion that Giuliani's successor, Michael Bloomberg, would have to close.
After the 9/11 attacks, that projection ballooned to $4.77-billion, according to figures from the New York City Office of Management and Budget. (The figures are not adjusted for inflation.)
 
What Giuliani has done is include the budget that outgoing Mayor Dinkins wrote as he left office, but doesn't include the budget Giuliani himself wrote as he left office. Including both is closer to a fair comparison of the two changes of administration. It looks at (1) the moment he took office and left, and (2) the out-year projection for the first full fiscal year of the new administration as of the same date.
 
So Giuliani inherited a deficit of about $700-million and left a surplus of $350-million as of the first and last days of his tenure. He also inherited a projected budget gap of $2.3-billion for his next fiscal year, and left his successor, Bloomberg, a projected deficit of $4.7-billion.
 
It is probably worth noting that both out-year ""deficit"" figures – the one Giuliani says he inherited from Dinkins and the one he bequeathed to Bloomberg – are just projections. The city (unlike the federal government) is not allowed to end the year with an operating deficit. Harding notes that gaps in out-year budgets have often happened in New York City and have, through a combination of above-budget revenues or below-budget spending, gotten into balance or turned to surplus by the time the year ends.
 
Add it all up and we only get halfway to true.

"['National', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
The frown was already turning upside down
","New Yorkers weren't happy just before Rudy Giuliani took office, but it wasn't as dire as he says. That 60 or 70 percent figure he mentions was two-year-old news by the time he took office.
 
In November 1991, the

New York Times

/ WCBS-TV News conducted a poll among New Yorkers in which 60 percent said things had gotten so bad in the city they would leave tomorrow, if they could.
 
But that startling figure, which Giuliani uses, had changed by the time he prepared to take office. Just before Giuliani defeated incumbent Mayor David Dinkins, the

Times

and WCBS did the poll again. Between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, 1993, they asked 1,223 adults some questions about New York City. The responses were generally pessimistic; the

Times

referred to them as ""grim."" Nearly two-thirds viewed the economy as bad or very bad, almost as many thought crime had gotten worse, and so on.
 
Here was the

New York Times

description of the ""want to leave"" issue: ""In its most provocative finding, the survey determined that 45 percent of respondents said things had got so bad in New York that they would move out tomorrow if they could. Some pollsters played down the significance of the finding, noting that similar surveys in Chicago and London also showed many residents said they wanted to leave immediately.""
That 45 percent may be disturbing, but it's not 60 or 70 percent, as Giuliani said.
 
In fact, despite the ""grim"" findings about New Yorker attitudes, the percentage who wanted to leave had been dropping sharply in the two years before Giuliani took office. From 60 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1993. It fell to about 33 percent in eight years under Giuliani.
 
As for 70 percent wanting to stay, the Giuliani campaign cites a

New York Times

/CBS News poll in August 2001, just before the 9/11 attacks and in the midst of a campaign to elect a successor to Giuliani. The

New York Times

reported that ""barely a third"" of the respondents said they would move out of the city if they could and added that ""about 60 percent"" of New Yorkers wanted to stay in New York.
It should be noted that the question had a couple of important predicates, including a longer-term time horizon: ""Looking ahead about four years, if it was entirely up to you, would you want to be living where you are now, or would you want to be living somewhere else in New York City, or outside the city."" A variation on earlier surveys limited the choice to NYC or ""somewhere else,"" but the negative results varied only a little when both versions of the question were used.
 
So the ""city that I was handed"" at the end of 1993 did not have 60 or 70 percent who wanted to leave, but only 45 percent, according to the polls, and the city Giuliani managed for nearly eight years had 60 percent who wanted to stay, according to the poll he cites, not 70 percent.
 
There's no disagreement among sources here. Giuliani just misquotes the numbers, and does so in a way that reflects better on him. We find his statement to be Barely True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Update: Giuliani pushed city income tax cut
","
Updated: Rudy Giuliani is deft at cherry-picking statistics to make his case and he's not one to share credit, either.
 
But he does have a record of performance that can be examined. The claim made in Dearborn is an oft-analyzed, widely debated example.
 
In our original posting on this issue, which we declared ""Barely True,"" we focused on his use of ""I,"" which is indeed technically untrue. It takes the mayor, the city council and the state legislature to cut that income tax. But after hearing an appeal from the Giuliani people, we think he deserves the benefit of the doubt on this.
 
The tax cut he refers to clearly was a Giuliani initiative, and in the same way that we refer to ""Reagan tax cuts"" that were studied, modified and approved by Congress, we have concluded that Giuliani's initiative on this is clear enough to be lenient in judging the ""I"" claim. We also erroneously stated that this is a state income tax, and while it must be approved by the state, it is a separate city income tax.
 
And 24 percent? Giuliani likes to use percentages of percentages. It doesn't sound like much to say the top-bracket tax rate fell from 4.46 percent to 3.54 percent during his tenure. But okay, the math works. Since personal incomes were also rising, it's not necessarily the case that New Yorkers saw a reduction in their total tax bills. But the rate went down 24 percent.
 
We want to note that the same report reflecting the 24 percent reduction shows that the rate was even lower, 3.4 percent, in 1989, the end of the Ed Koch administration. (It was raised again during the David Dinkins administration.) Okay, so we're getting addicted to our calculator.
 
Which brings us to that ""42 percent more revenues.""
 
The 42 percent figure for revenue growth, just to complete the documentation, is a comparison of revenues from the city income tax from Giuliani's first full fiscal year, 1995, to his last, 2001. That's a very reasonable way of counting.
 
But to link the revenue growth to the tax cut brings us into the world of supply-side economics. With tax-cut advocate Steve Forbes, of the magazine family, as an economic adviser, Giuliani keeps claiming that ""his"" tax cuts created the growth.
 
""When you reduce the burden of government,"" Giuliani said in Des Moines on June 20, 2007, ""what happened is the unemployment rate was cut in half, the number of jobs grew ... the number of people that were working went up dramatically, and new businesses came back to the city.""
 
So let's just pause on supply-side economics, the popular version of which is that reducing the tax rate actually increases the tax revenue by giving people more incentive to produce income. But how much is tax-cut incentive, how much is sheer greed, and how much is the rising tide of a booming economy? Who knows? One sign that something else is involved is that during the years in question the revenue increase ranged from 41.4 percent in Queens to 60 percent in Brooklyn.
 
We have changed our ruling since this item first published in November 2007. We understated Giuliani's role in the city income tax cut, and we simply misstated the origin of the tax that was in question. Upon further review, in light of clarifying information provided by the Giuliani campaign, we are giving Giuliani a Mostly True ruling.

Citizenship 110, Financial aid 102
","As part of his education platform speech, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson lays into how tough it can be to get financial aid for college.
 
""The forms that families have to fill out to get college aid, the (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), is 127 questions. That's longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship,"" he said. ""Something's wrong when it's more complicated to get money for school than it is to become an American citizen. I will tear up those forms and replace them with a postcard-sized form.""
 
His idea — and his numbers — come from a Brookings Institution position paper called ""College Grants on a Postcard,"" his campaign says. But it's not quite clear that the paper, and hence the candidate, gets it right.
 
The FAFSA includes 102 numbered questions, some complicated, some as basic as last name and first name. Yes, those count as separate questions.
 
You don't have to answer them all, depending on where you live. (It's a universal form, so some items apply only to Californians, and others only to Tennesseans, while others are general.)
 
Six questions rely on worksheets that have questions. But that's backup documentation, not the form.
 
Confused, we asked the paper's author, Harvard associate professor Susan Dynarski, how she came up with her number and what we missed.
 
""We counted the questions,"" Dynarski responded in an e-mail. ""There are 127.""
 
Dissatisfied, we turned to the Center for College Planning in New Hampshire, where a spokeswoman came in closer to the government's number. ""There are 100 questions involved on the form,"" she wrote. (We don't know which ones she didn't count.)
 
Is that longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship?
 
Nope.
 
By our count, Form N-400 from the Department of Homeland Security has 110 questions (first and last name count as one, not two). And though it doesn't include worksheets like FAFSA, it has its share of complicated questions. It's no easy task to document every trip of 24 hours or more outside the United States in the past five years.
 
At a score of 110-102, we rule Richardson's statement False.

"['National', 'Education', 'Hillary Clinton']","
A lot of time, but the math is off
","While discussing college costs, Sen. Hillary Clinton joined a growing chorus of political leaders calling for reform of the financial aid application process.
 
Quoting from a Brookings Institution proposal called ""College Grants on a Postcard,"" the former first lady said something must be done given how long Americans spend filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid each year.
 
It's 100-million hours, Clinton said, the equivalent of 55,500 full-time jobs.
 
Her math is slightly off, and it relies on a disputed number.
 
The Brookings Institution paper says 100-million hours is ""the equivalent of about 50,000 full-time jobs."" And our calculator figures it's 48,077 jobs of 40 hours a week.
 
Also, that figure of 100-million hours is at odds with the government's best estimate.
 
The Department of Education estimates on its Web site that first-time users will need less than an hour to complete FAFSA on the Web. That time frame ""largely assumes that the applicants and their parents come to the Web prepared,"" spokeswoman Stephanie Babyak told PolitiFact.com.
 
Approximately 10-million forms are filed each year. By the department's estimate, it would be 10-million hours of form filling.
 
""Implausible,"" counters Harvard University associate professor Susan Dynarski, who wrote the Brookings Institution paper.
 
""The IRS estimates 8 to 10 hours to complete the 1040EZ or 1040A, which are both far shorter than the FAFSA,"" Dynarski wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact.com. ""The estimate for the 1040 is 16 hours, and 1040 is about the length of the FAFSA. Other researchers have estimated an average of 27 hours for IRS compliance. Ten hours is therefore an informed estimate based on this range of values and our detailed examination of the FAFSA questions.""
 
Given such disparities, we turned to other experts, who largely sided with the Department of Education's version.
 
""That form is fairly simple,"" said Vivian Fiallo, a guidance counselor at Freedom High in Tampa.
 
Several of the questions are biographical — nothing tough there — and many require only a yes or no. The interactive Web site even tells you where to look for each answer, Fiallo added.
 
Indeed, a spokeswoman for the New Hampshire-based Center for College Planning said in an e-mail that the denseness of the form has become less of an issue since it went online, though some families still describe the process of applying as overwhelming.
 
""With assistance, it can take an average of 30 to 45 minutes to fill out the FAFSA,"" the center's Erin Hathaway wrote to PolitiFact.com. ""If there are complicated asset situations or private business owners, joint families etc., then it can take longer, usually one to two hours.""
 
No research has been done on the topic, said Meihua Zhai, director of research at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, making all information on how long it takes anecdotal.
 
Given the disputed number and the lack of research, we find Clinton's statement to be Half True.

Edwards tagged 'populist' early on
","After John Edwards charged that Barack Obama would be too willing to compromise with special interests, Obama jabbed back during an interview with the

Washington Post

on Nov. 8, 2007.
 
""John wasn't this raging populist four years ago when he ran"" for the previous Democratic nomination, Obama said. ""He certainly wasn't when he ran for the U.S. Senate.""
 
Edwards has run for major office three times: He ran for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina in 1998, and he's run for president in 2004 and 2008. News reports from his 1998 race show Edwards was described as a populist early on, running as ""the people's senator"" and saying he would help fight powerful interests like the insurance lobby, just as he did in his career as a successful trial lawyer.
 
Ferrel Guillory, a longtime Edwards watcher and director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed Edwards as a ""suburban populist"" back in 1998. In a 2007 interview with PolitiFact.com, Guillory recalled that first race. ""The way Edwards framed himself was very much in tune with the modern suburban Southern middle class, who have anxieties about their medical care, about the quality of their children's education, and about their future,"" he said.
 
If Obama didn't think of Edwards as a populist in 2004, a lot of other people seemed to. The

Los Angeles Times

wrote of Edwards, ""The North Carolina senator lays his populist cards on the table in New Hampshire,"" while David Brooks wrote a column about Edwards titled, ""The Happy Populist.""
Brooks, a conservative columnist, criticized Edwards' ideas as ""false"" and ""too facile,"" but he painted a striking picture of classic populist rhetoric: ""The emotional climax of his speech comes when he describes how he used to represent 'people like you' against teams of highly paid, distinguished corporate lawyers. 'And you know what happened? I beat them, and I beat them, and I beat them again!' The crowds go crazy...""
 
Guillory said Edwards has struck populist themes his entire political life, but that's not to say Edwards hasn't sharpened his rhetoric and branched out to other populist issues over the years. During the course of the two presidential campaigns, Edwards has increased his support of unions, a crucial Democratic constituency, and spoken out more about international trade policy.
 
""Edwards is in a different place than he was in 1998,"" Guillory said. ""But it's not like he couldn't go back and give his speeches from 1998. He's just running for a different office in a different context.""
 
We give Obama a False ruling on his remark that Edwards came to populism recently. His Senate record may not be the most substantial, but Edwards has consistently raised issues of economic inequality his entire political career.

"['National', 'Terrorism', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
He's on point, but still off base
","Rudy Giuliani is basing his presidential campaign on the argument that, as the mayor who guided New York City through the Sept. 11 attacks, he's best suited to keep the country safe from terrorism. He has said repeatedly that he would continue President Bush's policy of attacking terrorists aggressively overseas, and has criticized the Clinton administration for failing to foresee the 9/11 attacks.
 
""I think America — America never made up for the Clinton peace dividend; America never made up for the gutting of the intelligence services that Bill Clinton did,"" Giuliani said Nov. 2, 2007, on Bloomberg TV's

Political Capital With Al Hunt.

""I think those are Tenet's words, by the way, that Bill Clinton gutted American intelligence — 20, 30 percent cuts,"" Giuliani said, referring to former CIA director George Tenet, who has taken much of the heat for not foreseeing the 9/11 attacks.
 
Given that his fellow front-runner, Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, was first lady during that time, Giuliani is eager to paint the most unflattering portrait he can of the Clinton administration's antiterrorism record.
 
It is true that Clinton oversaw decreases in the intelligence budget and that Tenet has described the budget situation when he became CIA director in 1997, four years into Clinton's presidency, as a disaster. But Tenet has never placed blame on Clinton in the way Giuliani describes (which makes sense since Clinton made him director).
 
Likewise, Giuliani neglects to provide some important context: The CIA budget cuts began under the first President Bush and were reversed, under Tenet's leadership, late in the Clinton presidency and before the 9/11 attacks.
 
Here's what Tenet told the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States — better known as the 9/11 Commission — in April 2004 testimony:
 
""By the mid 1990s the intelligence community was operating with a significant erosion in resources and people, and was unable to keep pace with technological change. When I became director of central intelligence, I found a community and a CIA whose dollars were declining and whose expertise was ebbing. We lost close to 25 percent of our people and billions of dollars in capital investment.""
 
As a result, Tenet said, the CIA no longer could ""recruit, train and sustain officers for our clandestine services,"" and ""the nation's human intelligence capability was in disarray.""
 
Tenet's clear implication is that Clinton — who took office in 1993 — bore considerable responsibility. But Tenet doesn't say whether Clinton accelerated the rate of decline or followed the trend begun by Bush, and proving it is impossible. That's because, with the exception of the current fiscal year and fiscal years 1997 and 1998 — when Tenet agreed to release the overall budget figure after the Federation of American Scientists filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit — the government has classified the intelligence budget on national security grounds.
 
The budgets during the first two years of Clinton's presidency were lower than at any point during Bush's presidency, according to a chart released by Congress that shows spending growth and declines across years but not precise funding levels. The chart ends in fiscal 1994.
 
The secrecy surrounding the budget during those years may have contributed to the precipitous cuts, as many advocates of increased military and intelligence spending were kept in the dark about them, argues Steven Aftergood, director of the project on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists.
 
In his view, the era was marked not by the ""Clinton peace dividend"" but the ""post-Cold War peace dividend when defense spending and intelligence spending dropped significantly.""
 
Aftergood contends that the bottom hit in 1997, when Tenet became CIA director and made gaining new resources a top priority. The budgets for fiscal 1997 and 1998 were flat, according to the official figures Tenet released under pressure from the Federation of American Scientists: $26.6-billion in fiscal 1997, $26.7-billion in March 1998.
 
In 1999, Tenet reversed course and refused to release the intelligence budgets for the remainder of his tenure, which ended in 2004. Aftergood suspects that the 1999 decision was made to mask the first big increase in intelligence spending since the Cold War ended.
 
But it's impossible to be sure when the first budget increases came. Courts refused requests from the Federation of American Scientists to force Tenet to release the budgets. In his testimony to the 9/11 Commission, Tenet said that he'd made considerable headway in boosting the agency's resources prior to the 9/11 attacks. ""Between 1999 and 2001, our human agent base against the terrorist target grew by over 50 percent,"" he said.
 
So, we conclude that Giuliani's statement is Half True. Clinton did reduce the intelligence budget early in his tenure. But Tenet never placed the blame squarely on Clinton's shoulders, as Giuliani said he did. And while Tenet said budget cuts had made it difficult for the CIA to pursue its mission by 1997, the cuts came during both the Bush and Clinton presidencies.

Lightning strikes, but not like the feds
","Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois tried to make the point that enforcement against people who hire undocumented workers has to improve.
 
But statistics show the feds at least outpace lightning strikes.
 
Given current data, indictments out of employer investigations happen 4.6 times more often than people get hit by lightning, figured Deborah Rumsey, author of

Probability for Dummies

and

Statistics for Dummies

, among other books. Rumsey, a statistics education specialist at Ohio State University, helped PolitiFact.com review the stats.
 
""Neither one of these is a common occurrence, but compared to each other, there's a big difference,"" Rumsey said.
 
Asked to support his statement, the Obama campaign cited a

Washington Post

report that showed only three businesses were fined — a more narrow look than prosecutions — for employing illegal immigrants in 2004.
 
Being fined is indeed rarer than lightning hitting someone.
 
But based on figures from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the National Weather Service, we find that the change Obama demanded in Thursday's debate already has happened, at least in meteorological terms.
 
For starters, lightning hits an average of 1,000 to 1,100 people a year, according to the National Weather Service. That would make strikes on people a 1.1-in-303,000 probability, using current U.S. Census population estimates.
 
Now consider indictments in investigations of employers, which numbered 441 in 2006, according to an annual report of the Office of Immigration Statistics at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
 
Based only on indictments, there was a 5.1-in-303,000 chance an employer would be prosecuted to the point of indictment. That's based on a U.S. Census count of nearly 26.3-million businesses from 2004, the most recent year full data is available.
 
It should be noted that the number of employers is tough to determine; officials with the IRS and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said they had no data. The Census count is its largest available, with other surveys showing smaller numbers — and even higher chances of indictments against employers.
 
Given these findings, we rule Obama's statement False.

Congress and Cheney beat HMOs
","Gov. Bill Richardson took a humorous jab at his fellow candidates who serve in Congress during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Nov. 15, 2007, saying their approval ratings are lower than Dick Cheney's and HMOs'.
 
First of all, Congress' approval rating is not as low as 11 percent. Polls in October 2007 have hovered between 19 and 28 percent.
 
Vice President Cheney's approval rating is not polled as often as Congress, but his most recent approval rating, in October 2007, was 23 percent.
 
Polls on health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are even less frequent. But the Gallup Poll annually queries the public on opinions about the honesty and integrity of specific professions. The most recent poll in December 2006 rated HMO managers with approval ratings of about 12 percent, just above advertising practitioners and car salesmen.
 
In fact, in that poll, both senators and congressman rated higher than HMO managers. Senators were at 15 percent and congressman were at 14 percent.
 
So Richardson is wrong on all counts. Congress and Cheney are arguably neck-and-neck for approval ratings, while HMO managers lag behind. We rate his claim False.

Edwards was worried about cost

","In fending off attacks on her as someone who equivocates, Hillary Clinton singled out John Edwards for changing his mind on health care.
 
""When Sen. Edwards ran in 2004, he wasn't for universal health care. I'm glad he is now,"" she said.
 
Clinton is correct. In 2004, when he was running for president, Edwards favored universal coverage for children but stopped short of proposing universal coverage for adults. At the time, he was concerned that true universal coverage would be too costly. ""What we ought to be doing is something that No. 1 is achievable and No. 2 is responsible,"" he said at a debate in Manchester, N.H., on July 28, 2003.
 
Edwards released a health care plan in February 2007 that mandates universal coverage. At a debate a few months later, moderator Tim Russert charged Edwards with changing his position.
 
""That's true and so has America,"" Edwards responded. ""I proposed universal health care for children at that point, and what is clear from this presidential campaign is I was the first presidential candidate — others have followed me now, and that's a good thing, good thing for America — but I was the first presidential candidate to lay out a specific, truly universal health care plan. And the one thing I can
tell you ... anybody who knows me knows I will never give up.""
 
Edwards did release his plan before Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but Dennis Kucinich released a proposal for universal health care before Edwards.

Bill Nelson: Connie Mack is 'protecting' Chevron from big oil pollution lawsuit
","
Allegations of political paybacks as filthy as an oil-polluted rainforest are at play in Florida’s U.S. Senate race.

""Out-of-state billionaires and special interests have spent over $20 million to buy Connie Mack IV a Senate seat. Is it any wonder?"" says a TV ad from Mack’s incumbent rival, Sen. Bill Nelson. ""In Congress, Mack is protecting Chevron oil from a multibillion dollar lawsuit over pollution of rivers and rain forests.""

Nelson repeated the charge during the first and only debate between the candidates on Oct. 17, 2012. Mack, he said, ""has filed a resolution to void a court judgment for $18 million for the Chevron Corp., which by the way is one of his largest contributors.""

The Chevron claim gave us pause. It’s been two years since BP’s well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. Is Mack really protecting an oil company accused of polluting a rain forest?

There’s a lot more to this story than Nelson lets on -- about five decades’ worth.

Oil in the Jungle

The origins of the ordeal are rooted in the 1960s, when Texaco launched oil drilling operations in undeveloped land in northeast Ecuador. Texaco worked in partnership with Ecuador’s national petroleum company, Petroecuador, with Texaco drilling the wells and digging pits for sludge-like oil runoff.

Texaco wrapped up its operations in the early 1990s. It paid the government $40 million to clean up about 40 percent of the oil pits, and the government granted Texaco a release from future litigation.

Meanwhile, a group of indigenous Ecuadorians -- calling themselves afectados, or ""the affected ones"" -- sued Texaco for rampant environmental neglect, blaming incidents of cancer, miscarriages and other health problems on oil pollution from the company's operations. A team of New York trial lawyers led a class-action suit originally filed in 1993 in U.S. court, but the case moved to Ecuador at Chevron’s urging.

We have studied the complicated case and included links to detailed reports about it. Ultimately, Ecuadorian judges have ordered Chevron -- which bought Texaco in 2001 and inherited the suit -- to pay a whopping $19 billion award.

Chevron has not paid the tab and says it doesn’t intend to, arguing the company did not get a fair trial in Ecuador and should not be held responsible anyway, because of the mid ’90s agreement Texaco reached with Ecuador about future litigation.

Neither side is willing to bend, spawning international arbitration and dozens of court filings in Ecuador, the United States and even Canada and Brazil. Chevron is pursuing an extortion and racketeering case against the plaintiff’s lead attorney.

Mack’s involvement

So where does Connie Mack, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, fit in with this mammoth environmental case?

In September 2012, Mack earned an eyebrow-raising headline from the Tampa Tribune: ""Mack pushes legislation that aids political backers.""

The Tribune story connected a resolution Mack introduced about revoking Ecuador’s trade privileges with Chevron’s hefty political donations to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has made attacking Nelson over the airwaves one of its biggest priorities this year. (Corporations cannot donate directly to candidates, and we did not find that any employees of Chevron donated money to Mack this campaign cycle.)

Mack’s resolution lists the Chevron case as one of many reasons the U.S. should not renew a trade agreement with Ecuador next year. Other reasons include press censorship and intimidation, a politicized judicial system, a growing relationship with Iran, an uptick in Ecuadorians seeking asylum in the U.S., and a problem as a transit hub for illegal narcotics.

Mack had harsh words for President Rafael Correa.

""Preferences from the United States, including trade benefits, should not be utilized to bolster anti-democratic leaders,"" Mack said in a news release. ""I hope that Congress recognizes the truth about Rafael Correa and declines the renewal of the U.S. trade preference program until democratic standards of freedom and security are restored in Ecuador.""

The exact wording of the Chevron segment: Whereas Ecuador has not complied with the interim award issued by an international arbitration tribunal convened under Article 6 of the United States-Ecuador BIT, which enjoins Ecuador `whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to take all measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and recognition within or without Ecuador' of the $18,200,000,000 judgment by Ecuadoran courts against the Chevron Corporation.

Mack’s resolution, co-sponsored by 31 House members, has not been heard in committee. Even if it were to pass, it would merely state the ""disinclination"" of Mack and the co-sponsors to renew the U.S.’s trade agreement with Ecuador; it would not by itself strip away Ecuador’s trade privileges.

Nelson’s campaign threw us a slew of press clips about the Chevron case, including the Tribune story and a 2009 POLITICO story about Chevron’s lobbying efforts of Congress and the office of U.S. Trade Representative to strip Ecuador’s trade preferences.

""The plaintiffs contend that Chevron botched the cleanup, but if the court were to recognize the agreement, it could essentially end the suit,"" POLITICO reported.

Four Senate Democrats, not including Nelson, wrote the trade representative in 2009 and urged him not to intervene in the case. Then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2006 asked the previous trade representative not to use trade agreements as leverage.

Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said the company did not ask Mack to include the language and does not see how it would protect Chevron. He said the case ""boils down to the issue of contracts"" between two private parties.

""I don’t think it’s accurate to make the connection that’s being made right now,"" he said.

We asked the Mack campaign why he listed Chevron as a reason for no longer supporting the trade agreement, and if he was trying to shield Chevron. A spokesman did not address those questions, writing instead that Mack ""feels strongly about protecting the freedom, security and prosperity of the U.S. at home and abroad.""

""Ecuador currently benefits from one-way trade preferences from the U.S. as part of a program that incentivizes Ecuador to work productively with the United States,"" Mack spokesman David James wrote in an email. ""Under Ecuador’s current President, Rafael Correa, that cooperation has dropped off. This is a timely matter given that these trade preferences expire next year and are currently under review.""

Is Mack protecting Chevron?

It’s clear Mack’s resolution is meant to protect Chevron’s interests, said Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin.

""His new bill would inject Congress to try to strip Ecuador of its trade rights with the U.S. if the country doesn't void the judgment,"" McLaughlin said.

We found a couple of experts who agree, including Judith Kimerling, a City University of New York-Queens College environmental policy professor who authored the 1991 book Amazon Crude, which is widely credited with inspiring the lawsuit. She represents a group of Huaorani people from Ecuador in a lawsuit against the Amazon Defense Front and plaintiff’s lawyers over how the award would be distributed.

Asking lawmakers to withhold trade practices is part of a multipronged approach to avoid the judgment, she said, adding she can’t know for sure why Mack would include the Chevron in his resolution.

""Mack’s resolution in and of itself will not achieve that purpose, but it's part of a strategy to pressure Ecuador to intervene on the case on its side,"" she said. ""They probably would have preferred for Mack to have sponsored a law that would do more.""

Other experts empathized with Chevron’s argument that it did not get a fair trial in Ecuador, and that it overlooks that Petroecuador has been in control of drilling operations for the past 20 years.

""A lot of us familiar with Latin America don’t lend any credence to this award,"" said Ed Glab, director of the Global Energy Security Forum at Florida International University and a former longtime employee of Exxon. ""Ecuador is not a place where you can put your faith in the law.""

It would not be unusual for Chevron to request a business-friendly lawmaker to support its cause, he said, but that doesn’t mean Mack’s effort will do anything.

""I don’t know that the U.S. government can or would be willing to step in,"" Glab said. ""I don’t know if (Mack) has the power to ‘protect’ Chevron.""

As Mack’s spokesman pointed out, the resolution contains a timeliness factor.

The trade preferences program that Ecuador currently enjoys is an updated version of a Reagan-era policy the U.S. established with four Andean nations to ""adopt business-friendly intellectual property, investor, tax and other policies that U.S. companies favored and draw countries away from left-wing influences,"" said Lori Wallach, director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group.

Every few years, Congress must reauthorize the law that designates the trade preferences, the qualification conditions and which countries are eligible for special duty-free access to the U.S. market. The next deadline for Congress is July 31, 2013.

Mack could have chosen a couple dozen other investor claims against Ecuador to include in his resolution, she said, but it’s telling that he singled out the Chevron case.

""He’s shilling for Chevron but has not yet delivered on actually cutting off Ecuador’s trade preferences,"" she said.

Our ruling

Nelson’s TV ad hits Mack for ""protecting Chevron oil from a multibillion dollar lawsuit over pollution of rivers and rain forests.""

Mack’s act of protection is a yet-to-be-heard congressional resolution listing the Chevron case as one of many reasons to withhold trade preferences with Ecuador. Resolutions are symbolic gestures, so it would take a law for Congress to take real action on Ecuadorian trade practices.

The Chevron case is also particularly complicated. Chevron says it did not get a fair trial in Ecuador and should not be held responsible anyway.

Still, the resolution seems designed to exert political pressure on the country in Chevron’s favor.

"['National', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Regulation', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says federal regulations quadrupled under Obama
","
During the town hall presidential debate, Mitt Romney accused Barack Obama of strangling small businesses with too much regulation.

That's been a popular theme with Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who have complained about a ""tsunami"" of new regulations under Obama since 2010.

Asked by one of the town hall participants about outsourcing, Romney gave his prescription for keeping jobs in the United States. First he spoke about the corporate tax rate, which he believes is too high and prevents job creation. Then he turned to regulations.

""Regulations have quadrupled,"" Romney said. ""The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.""

We decided to check Romney’s numbers and see if he was right.

Romney’s quadruple regulation claim

The Romney campaign told us the basis for the statement was research by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. An ongoing study by Heritage documents regulation activity by the federal government. Its latest update said President George W. Bush’s administration adopted 28 ""major regulations"" that increased burdens on the private sector in its first three years, compared with 106 by the Obama administration.

But viewers of the debate didn’t hear the caveats that should have been attached to Romney’s statement. First, he was referring only to ""economically significant"" regulations, which are those with a cost estimate of $100 million or higher. Second, the Heritage report doesn’t account for all regulations. It only looks at regulations that Heritage researchers said would ""limit activity or mandate activity by the private sector.""

James Gattuso, an author of the Heritage report, said Romney’s use of the phrase ""rate of regulations"" seemed to be an effort to distinguish between all regulations and new regulations approved under a president. ""Rate"" implies a time frame. Heritage made comparisons about regulations over a three-year period.

But we find Romney was not clear about which time frame he was using during the debate.

Other data contradict Romney

Since Heritage looked narrowly at high-cost regulations that it judged to be harmful to businesses, we sought other research about regulations and found little to support Romney's claim.

The annual number of regulations approved under the Obama administration is about the same as other administrations in the past 18 years, according to OMB Watch, a left-leaning group that advocates for transparency in the Office of Management and Budget, better known as the OMB.

In a September report titled ""The regulatory tsunami that wasn’t,"" the group used records from the OMB to evaluate charges that the Obama administration was imposing more regulations than other recent presidents.

In fact, the most up-to-date figures show about 8.5 percent fewer regulations in Obama’s first 46 months than in the same time frame for Bush. That tally comes from the Office of Management and Budget.

The chart below comes from the OMB Watch report, comparing regulations and economically significant regulations under presidents Bill Clinton, Bush and Obama.


""The story is much more of continuity than radical change,"" said Michael Livermore, executive director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law.

Since 1994 the number of regulations approved per year has ranged from 228 to 371, the group found.

Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration approved an average of 297 regulations per year, comparable to yearly figures for the past 18 years. (In 1992 and 1993, the numbers were much higher, exceeding 1,000 regulations both years.)

Even among the economically significant regulations, Obama is nowhere near quadrupling them: For the first three years of the Obama and Bush administrations, Obama is about 24 percent higher.

(The numbers on the OMB Watch chart differ from Heritage because the conservative group only looked at economically significant regulations that it deemed to be harmful to the private sector, a subset of the total number. Also, Heritage relied on records from the Government Accountability Office, which includes regulations from independent agencies in addition to those in the executive branch.)

Although Republicans have criticized Obama for over regulation of business, his former ""regulatory czar"" Cass Sunstein received widespread criticism for not enforcing several high-profile rules, such as a tighter ozone pollution standard and rules on coal ash disposal. In a May editorial, The New York Times called the attacks about too much regulation ""absurd"" because ""the administration has a mediocre record when it comes to curbing dangerous practices by industry.""

Our ruling

Romney said that regulations and the rate of regulations quadrupled under Obama. He was basing that on the Heritage study, but he did not include important caveats about how the study was conducted.

And more importantly, the actual data on regulations show Obama's rate of regulations is no different from the past 18 years.

This is a broad claim describing its own evidence inaccurately. False.

Democrats point to votes om Ryan budget as evidence Rep. Frank Guinta wants to tax middle class
","
Despite his claims, U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta is no friend of the working man or woman, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And his vote on this year’s House budget proves it, the Democratic group charged in an ad released on New Hampshire airwaves.

""Say you're a regular person with a regular job,"" a narrator says in the ad, ""Regular,"" which launched Monday on WMUR-TV in New Hampshire. ""Frank Guinta voted to make you pay over a $1,000 more a year in taxes.

""Frank Guinta is looking out for them, not you,"" the ad concludes.

The Guinta campaign quickly disputed the ad, calling it ""false"" and ""misleading,"" and asking WMUR to remove it from the air.

The DCCC stood by its ad, pointing to an ABC News report from August to support the claim. And WMUR said it has no plans to pull the ad.

The ABC News story, aired August 14, referenced a report from the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee that suggested the House Republicans’ 2013 budget proposal would raise taxes on middle class families.

The Joint Committee report, prepared by the staff of the committee chairman, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), concludes the House budget proposal, headed by Republican Vice-Presidential nominee Paul Ryan, would raise taxes by $1,358 on households with an income between $50,000-$100,000.

Guinta voted March 29 in favor of Ryan’s budget proposal, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate. So the Joint Committee’s numbers match the DCCC claim. But, according to some analysts, the committee used some funny math to reach its conclusions.

As noted in past PolitiFact reports, the Casey report assumes, without knowing, House Republicans would eliminate deductions on state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions, among others.

In the budget, Ryan, like his presidential running mate, included few specifics regarding tax deductions and other expenditures. But, keeping the budget revenue neutral, as Ryan has stressed, would require the elimination of these and other deductions, according to Joint Committee economists.

""The remaining large tax expenditures … all deliver significant benefits to the middle class, and removing these tax expenditures would hit middle-income taxpayers hard,"" they wrote in the report.

Still, to make those assumptions was too big a leap for other tax analysts.

The business-backed Tax Foundation, which did not conduct its own review of the Ryan budget, had no competing figures to offer. But, foundation economists still offered a critical review of the Joint Committee report.

""(The analysis) is quite speculative in that it assumes certain things about the plan that were not specified publicly,"" William McBride, the foundation’s chief economist, wrote in an email to PolitiFact New Hampshire. ""It also assumes no economic growth.""

In its analysis, the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, did not assume the elimination of any deductions or expenditures.

The review, published in March, concluded that middle class families, earning between $50,000-$75,000 a year, would see a $975 tax cut under Ryan’s plan, while families earning $75,000-100,000 would average a decrease of$1,692.

But, unlike the Joint Committee report, the center review wasn’t intended to project the tax impacts of the budget proposal, according to Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate for the center. Rather, it looked to provide a snapshot of the spending plan as it was presented, he said.

""The details matter tremendously,"" Rosenberg said. ""Which tax expenditures you target, or which preferences you target makes all the difference. ... It’s hard to know (what the impacts will be) without that level of detail.""

Our ruling:

Frank Guinta, who is running against Democrat Carol Shea-Porter in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, voted in favor of the House Republicans’ 2013 budget. That much is clear. But, whether the spending proposal would have increased taxes on middle class families remains in question.

The study by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, which is chaired by a Democrat, suggests the budget plan would have increased taxes by $1,358 -- more than the $1,000 referenced in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ad. But, it assumes the budget would eliminate a host of deductions and expenditures -- assumptions that are too big a stretch for other tax analysts.

Had it passed, the House budget may have increased middle class taxes as the ad suggests. But, given the lack of specifics, there isn’t enough evidence to know for sure, as the DCCC claims to do.

We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097241180>],/factchecks/2012/oct/18/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-point-votes-om-ryan-budget-evidence-rep-/

Shelley Adler claims Jon Runyan voted to redefine rape
","
Democratic congressional hopeful Shelley Adler says the voting record of her Republican opponent, Rep. Jon Runyan, stands as ""proof that we can't trust him to be on our side.""

But one piece of Adler’s evidence against Runyan doesn’t hold up against the facts.  

At an Oct. 10 campaign event, Adler -- who is challenging Runyan on Nov. 6 for the seat representing the state’s third congressional district -- listed the reasons women should be wary of her opponent.

""We can’t trust him to stand up for women, after he sponsored legislation that would allow insurance companies to deny women access to birth control and basic preventive health care services. He voted to cut off critical, life-saving health care for women that included cancer screenings, like mammograms, and even voted to redefine rape,"" Adler said. ""That’s not being on our side.""

Adler levies a hefty allegation against Runyan in claiming he voted to redefine rape, but it’s just not true.

Adler’s charge -- which her campaign has repeated before -- stems from legislation sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.) called the ""No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.""

The bill, as introduced, would have permanently restricted federal funding for abortions except in cases of ""forcible rape,"" incest, if the victim was a minor, or to save the life of the mother.

In September, PolitiFact Wisconsin checked a claim from Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat from Wisconsin, that House Republicans ""tried to change the definition of rape"" and rated it Mostly False.

As one piece of evidence to support the statement, Moore’s spokeswoman cited Smith’s legislation. But PolitiFact Wisconsin found that House Republicans were not trying to change the definition of rape, per se. Rather, they were trying to limit federal funding for abortions.

So Adler starts off on a flawed premise. But the charge against Runyan  -- which Chris Russell, Runyan’s campaign spokesman, called ""just plain despicable"" --  is even more misleading because when he cast a vote in favor of Smith’s bill, the word ""forcible"" had been removed.

Adler’s spokesman, Michael Muller, acknowledged the error, saying ""you're right about the vote.""

Smith first introduced the bill in 2010 when Democrats controlled the House. The legislation went nowhere.

But the next year Republicans gained control of the House. Smith reintroduced his bill on Jan. 20, 2011.

As we noted in a previous fact-check, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican nominee for vice president, and Rep. Todd Akin -- a Republican Senate candidate from Missouri who made the controversial remark that pregnancies are rare in cases of ""legitimate rape"" -- both signed on as co-sponsors of Smith’s bill.

Runyan never co-sponsored the legislation.    

Critics condemned the term ""forcible rape,"" saying it would exclude rapes involving drugs and victims of statutory rape. By February, Smith had agreed to strip the controversial language from the bill.

So when the House passed the bill on May 4, 2011, the legislation exempted all cases of rape from the ban on federal funding for abortions.

The legislation passed by 251 to 175, with Runyan voting in favor of the legislation. The Democrat-controlled Senate never voted on the proposal.

So  Adler is wrong to claim Runyan voted to redefine rape.

The vote he cast was in favor of prohibiting federal funding for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother was at risk.

Our ruling

Adler said Runyan ""voted to redefine rape"" while listing the reasons ""we can’t trust him to stand up for women.""

The Democratic congressional hopeful distorts the voting record of her Republican rival with this claim.

House Republicans introduced a bill that restricted federal funding for abortions, except in cases of ""forcible rape.""

Runyan never signed on as a co-sponsor of that legislation. Further, when the bill reached the House floor for a full vote and Runyan voted in favor of it, the word ""forcible"" had been removed.

We rate Adler’s claim False.

Crossroads GPS says that Sherrod Brown backed ""Obama's $453 billion tax increase""
","
Ohioans need only brief exposure to commercial television to get a sense of the oversized  amounts of outside spending on campaign advertising in the state.

Outside spending -- money spent by third-party groups not directly tied to a candidate or party -- has been a force in the U.S. Senate race between Sherrod Brown, the incumbent Democrat, and Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer. Going into October, more outside money was spent against Brown than on anyone else in Congress, more than $19 million for TV and radio ads.

One of the big spenders targeting Brown is the group Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, better known as Crossroads GPS. Co-founded by Karl Rove as a spin-off of the super PAC American Crossroads, it is a political advocacy organization that is not required to disclose its donors.

After spending more than $6.7 million against Brown through late September, Crossroads reserved another $4.5 million worth of air time against him, spokesmen for the Brown and Mandel campaigns say.

That includes the 30-second TV ad ""Vision,"" which says, ""Sherrod Brown supported President Obama's $453 billion tax increase"" (and) ""higher taxes on manufacturers that could cost Ohio jobs.""

PolitiFact Ohio looked at the second claim when it was included in an earlier Crossroads ad. The earlier ad said that the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, ""adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers."" We rated the statement as Half True because it left out important details about the tax, which is an excise tax only on the sale of medical devices, with arguable jobs impact.

We asked Crossroads how it backed up the claim about the $453 billion tax increase. It cited the sources shown in the ad.

One is Brown's ""yes"" vote, on Oct. 11, 2011, to open debate in the Senate advancing S. 1660, Obama's American Jobs Act of 2011.

The second source is a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on the budgetary effects of the jobs bill. The report says one provision, a 5.6 percent surtax on incomes above $1 million, would increase revenues by $453 billion over the 10 years ending in 2021. That's the ""$453 billion tax increase"" in the ad.

But context and additional information are needed to fully understand the claim.

The $447 billion jobs bill aimed to jump-start employment and included spending on highways and other infrastructure, aid for states to prevent layoffs of teachers and emergency workers and an extension of jobless benefits.

The bill also provided $272 billion in tax relief for individuals and businesses, the CBO said, with tax cuts for businesses that hire new employees.

Bloomberg Business News described a cut in payroll taxes, intended to increase take-home pay for 160 million, as its ""centerpiece.""  Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Moody’s Analytics Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predicted it would give the economy a boost of up to 2 percent.

It is additionally worth noting that the measure was not enacted. It did not, in fact, ever reach consideration. Yet the Crossroads GPS ad is silent on those points.

Brown's ""yes"" vote came on a procedural measure to open Senate debate, which did not reach the 60-vote, filibuster-proof threshold required. (Brown indicated support for the jobs bill, but at least one senator who voted with him, Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia, said he was voting to take up the bill but opposed the measure itself.)

The claim from Crossroads GPS has an element of truth in its statement. The American Jobs Act of 2011, which Brown did indicate support for, did include a surtax that was expected to yield $453 billion over 10 years.

But the claim in the ad leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Rhode Island', 'Bipartisanship', 'Congress', 'Voting Record', 'Brendan Doherty']","
Rhode Island Republican Brendan Doherty says he can be bipartisan in Congress, citing GOP Sen. Scott Brown’s bipartisan votes
","
During the Oct. 16, 2012, debatebetween U.S. Rep. David Cicilline and challenger Brendan Doherty, Democrat Cicilline said his Republican opponent shouldn't be elected because it would let the GOP keep control of the House and push policies that Rhode Islanders don't want.

But Doherty argued, as he repeatedly has, that he would be his own man and not tied to the party the way Cicilline almost always votes with his fellow Democrats.

To illustrate that bipartisanship is possible, he pointed to the record of Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown, who now holds the U.S. Senate seat once held by the late Ted Kennedy.

""I understand there will be difficult situations in Washington where I might not be in step with my own party. My friend Scott Brown in Massachusetts, he has made that decision. He votes about 66 percent with his own party,"" said Doherty. ""Republicans come up with good ideas and so do Democrats, and they need to work together and fight this gridlock.""

We wanted to see if Brown really has been willing to vote against his own party 34 percent of the time.

To do that, we turned to the database of party-line votes compiled by The Washington Post.

The Scott Brown pageconfirms that of the 433 votes he has cast, Brown has voted with his party 66 percent of the time. Among Republicans, only one senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, has voted against the party more often during the current session of Congress.

(Cicilline, in contrast, voted with his fellow Democrats 96 percent of the time out of 1,550 votes, making him one of the most partisan members of the House.)

The numbers don't tell the whole story because some of the votes are procedural. When you look at Brown’s votes on 20 issues the Post identified as ""key"" -- such as repealing the Don't Ask-Don't Tell policy for the military, extending unemployment insurance benefits, and ratifying the SALT treaty with Russia -- the percentage shifts.

In 6 of those 20 issues, Republicans and Democrats agreed. On the remaining 14 issues where there was a split, Brown sided with his party in 10 instances (71 percent) and jumped ship to side with the Democrats in 4 cases (29 percent).

(Cicilline is listed by the Post as having taken 23 ""key"" votes. On the 17 issues in which there was a party split, Cicilline voted with Democrats 13 times and sided with his party by declining to vote twice. That's 88 percent. He voted with the GOP in two instances [12 percent].)

Our ruling

Republican Brendan Doherty, attempting to illustrate how he would not be a lock-step Republican if elected to Congress, cited the example of Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown, saying that Brown ""votes about 66 percent with his own party.""

Voting records show that Doherty is correct. Even when you look just at key votes where the political stakes were higher and members of the two parties came down on different sides of the issue, Brown's party-line score was 71 percent, still pretty close to the 66 percent mark.

Connie Mack says Bill Nelson votes 98 percent of the time with Obama
","
From the first day of his campaign, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack has repeatedly hammered U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson for voting with President Barack Obama.

Mack raised ire from Nelson as he hit that note several times during Wednesday night’s Senate debate, when he cast Nelson as more extreme than ever before.

""Senator, the people of the state of Florida are tired of you saying one thing to them and then going back to Washington, D.C., and voting with Barack Obama 98 percent of the time. They’re tired of that. They want you to look them in the eye and tell them what you’re going to do to them instead of what you’re going to do for Barack Obama.""

""Is that the only line that you have memorized?"" Nelson shot back about the 98 percent figure.

""Are you going to own up to it, Senator?"" Mack replied. 
PolitiFact checked on Nelson’s voting record last year, when Mack, in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, accused Nelson of voting with Democrats 95 percent of the time. PolitiFact found that claim Half True.

Now, Mack is criticizing Nelson not just for voting with his party, but for voting with the president. We decided to go in for a fresh fact-check.

Mack’s campaign says the claim is based on 2010 and 2011 figures from Congressional Quarterly, a leading provider of congressional news and legislative tracking.

The publication found that Nelson voted with Obama 97 percent of the time in 2009, 98 percent in 2010 and 97 percent in 2011, on issues in which the president took a clear position. (Obama doesn't vote, so CQ relied on his public statements to determine his position in favor or against a bill in Congress.)

""Nelson has gone left, and his lockstep support of Obama reflects that,"" Mack spokesman Gary Maloney said. ""It’s possible the party has gone even further left than Nelson has.""

The numbers pan out, but we also checked a few other sources to see if Nelson is, indeed, a lockstep liberal, as Mack suggests.

The vote-tracking website OpenCongress, which counts every congressional vote since the beginning of the current 112th session of Congress, suggests Nelson is one of the Senate’s more moderate Democrats.

Nelson is the 36th most likely Democratic senator to vote with his or her party, doing so on 371 out of 404 of his votes.

He also voted with his party 91.8 percent of the time, the website found.

But the OpenCongress website, created by the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation, says voting percentages can be misleading because ""the vast majority of the hundreds of votes factored in are routine in nature. The result is that even highly independent senators have a seemingly high score on voting with their party.""

The average Democratic senator votes with his or her party 93.2 percent of the time, according to the website.

Other vote-tracking websites referenced in our first fact-check found that Nelson voted with the Democrats 90 to 94 percent of the time.

Our ruling

Mack claims Nelson votes with Obama 98 percent of the time. The campaign backs that figure up with Congressional Quarterly data from 2010 and 2011.

The figure by itself, however, doesn’t tell the entire story. The fact is, most Democrats and Republicans largely vote with their respective party. And the groups that keep score say using the figure in isolation can be misleading.

With that context in mind, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E22600>],/factchecks/2012/oct/18/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-votes-98-percent-time/

Bill Nelson said Connie Mack takes two homestead exemptions, ""directly contrary to Florida’s Constitution""
","
Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV sparred over personal tax breaks during their only U.S. Senate debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie.

Mack cried moo early on during the Oct. 17, 2012, match, hitting Nelson for taking a greenbelt assessment on a family pasture because he allows a half-dozen cows to graze there.

Nelson’s retort came a bit later, when a reporter-panelist asked if he supported amnesty for illegal immigrants.

""I’m going to answer that in detail,"" Nelson said, ""but I’m first going to say not only has it been a cow pasture for 60 years, (but) why don’t we ask him why he takes two homestead exemptions, which is directly contrary to Florida’s Constitution that says that a husband and wife can only take one homestead exemption?""

Mack has faced heat over his homestead exemption since the primary, when former U.S. Sen. George LeMieux claimed he was a California resident who lives with his wife, U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack. We rated that Mostly False.

Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin elaborated on Nelson’s comments after the debate, saying what Nelson meant is that ""Mack is part of a family unit that has two homestead exemptions."" He pointed to Florida’s Constitution, which says, ""Not more than one exemption shall be allowed any individual or family unit or with respect to any residential unit.""

Some quick background: Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004; he filed for divorce from his wife Ann in 2005; and two years later, he married U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif., the widow of singer and U.S. Rep. Sonny Bono.

When Mack announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in 2011, the Tampa Bay Times wrote that he had been criticized for not spending time in Florida. According to the story, ""Mack said he and his wife spend time together in Washington and then usually go separate ways on the weekend — the opposite situation from other lawmakers. Another incentive to be in Florida, he said: an 11-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son from his first marriage are in the state.""

The U.S. Constitution requires Senate candidates to be a citizen of the U.S. for at least nine years and a resident of the state when elected. Florida’s election code doesn’t define residency, but the courts have defined legal residence to mean a permanent residence, according to a 1993 advisory opinion by the state Division of Elections.

Mack gets a homestead exemption for a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom condo in Fort Myers,  Lee County property records show. His time at the home has been questioned by political opponents and also by his ex-wife, who said in a 2005 divorce court filing that Mack bought it to ""solely to assist his political career"" when he was running in the congressional district for the area. The Mack campaign has disputed her account.

The Tampa Tribune raised more questions in February 2012, reporting that Mack’s current wife gets an exemption on her California home on top of Mack’s homestead break for his condo. The Tribune quoted William D. Shepherd, general counsel for the Hillsborough County property appraiser’s office, as saying the Macks should not collect two homestead exemptions because they are operating as a ""family unit,"" and Florida law says one homestead exemption per unit.

Under Florida law, Mack is entitled to the exemption if he can prove his finances aren’t co-mingled with those of his wife.

Mack campaign spokesman David James told the Miami Herald in February that Mack meets that criteria: ""They file separate returns, do not have joint accounts, and Connie’s name is not on Mary’s home in California, and Mary’s is not on Connie’s home in Fort Myers,"" James said.

Lee County Property Appraiser Ken Wilkinson looked into the legality of Mack’s homestead after the media attention about it. His verdict: ""Connie is entitled to the homestead here.""

""He provided the documentation, and our attorneys looked at it, and it is proper,"" Wilkinson told PolitiFact Florida in an interview.

Wilkinson said he could not get into specifics about Mack’s case, but he emphasized that Mack had to clear ""very stringent hoops"" to get the homestead after the review ""or I would not have agreed.""

Further, he said he does not think the intent of homestead laws is to prevent members of Congress from getting married. If Connie Mack or Mary Bono Mack had to give up their homesteads, they may be at risk of losing the residency requirement for Congress.

James said Nelson can’t back up his debate claim.

""The Lee County assessor has approved Connie Mack's one and only homestead in Fort Myers, the only home he owns,"" James wrote in a statement after the debate.

Shepherd said he still disagrees with Mack receiving the exemption. Shepherd told PolitiFact Florida that case law has changed on this even within the past year. ""In Hillsborough, they would have to give up one of those homesteads,"" he said.

 Our ruling

Nelson tried to whack accusations about his lower tax bill for a family pasture with a claim that Mack takes tax breaks of his own in the form of ""two homestead exemptions.""

Mack and his wife both serve in Congress, representing two different states on opposite coasts, and that’s clearly an unusual situation. They each own their own homes in their respective states.

While it’s true Mack and his wife have two homestead exemptions between them, it is not accurate for Nelson to say Mack himself has two homestead exemptions. That would not be lawful, and Mack’s county property appraiser has vetted his case and determined it proper.

Bill Nelson says Connie Mack missed a lot of votes this year
","
Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said that his Republican rival U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV has missed 178 votes this year, giving him one of the worst attendance records in Congress.

""Speaking of votes, why don’t you explain how you don’t show up to work. Why don’t you explain how this year you have one of the worst voting records. I have missed one vote this year, you have missed 178,"" Nelson said.

Nelson made the claim during a debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie on Oct. 17. Mack countered back that they had similar records of missed votes if looking at their entire careers, rather than just this year.

Missed votes in 2012

Here we will examine recent figures for missed votes by both Mack and Nelson through September 2012.

GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate.

It shows that for the first three quarters of this year, Mack has missed 178 votes (65 in the first quarter, 75 in the second quarter and 38 in the third quarter.)

Nelson’s one missed vote this year was to confirm the nomination of a federal judge in Illinois, which passed 86-1 on May 14.

But looking at sheer votes isn’t an apples to apples comparison because the House takes more votes than the Senate.

Career missed votes

That’s why we also looked at the percentage of missed votes on GovTrack for Mack’s tenure and Nelson’s Senate tenure (Nelson previously served in the House 1979-1990) -- and the percentage missed this year.

From the start of Mack’s tenure in January 2005, he missed 6 percent of roll call votes. During Nelson’s Senate tenure starting in January 2001, he missed 1 percent. The median missed votes for all members was 2.5 percent.

We noticed that Mack’s percentage of missed votes started to spike in the last quarter of 2011 around the time he announced he was running for the U.S. Senate. While Nelson faced token primary opposition, Mack faced more serious challengers, forcing him to campaign more in Florida.

The New York Times’ Inside Congress tabulates missed votes and shows the top three vote missers in the House for the 112th Congress, which covers the past two years. For that time period, Mack is in 13th place, according to New York Times reporter Derek Willis. That was worst among Florida representatives. If we removed Reps. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.; and Jane Harman, D-Calif., who resigned; and Donald Payne, D-N.J., who died, Mack would be in 10th place, Willis said.  

In July,  Mack campaign spokesman David James said that Mack missed some votes ""to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington.""

Our ruling

Nelson said Mack missed 178 votes this year, making that ""one of the worst voting records."" Mack did miss 178 votes this year compared to 1 for Nelson.

But unlike Nelson, Mack faced serious primary challengers, which meant he had to campaign in Florida more. Also, the House takes more votes than the Senate, so it’s more useful to look at percentages of missed votes. But the numbers are correct.

According to the New York Times, Mack’s record places him in 13th for this Congress which started in January 2011 (or 10th if we omit members who resigned or died). That fits the definition of ""one of the worst.""

We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097716180>],/factchecks/2012/oct/18/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-mack-missed-lot-votes-year/
"['Debates', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'Connie Mack']","
Connie Mack says -- repeatedly -- that Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times
","
Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson is a big fan of tax increases, says his Republican rival U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV of Fort Myers.

""Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times, 150 times,"" Mack said during a debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie Oct. 17. ""I voted to cut taxes … if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it's time for you to go.""

Later in the debate Nelson said that Mack’s claim was ""simply not true.""

""Outside fact-check organizations have said it's not true,"" Nelson said. ""You haven’t talked about all the tax cuts I voted for.""

Mack repeated the claim again: ""Senator, your propensity to vote for higher taxes is shocking, absolutely shocking. Like I said, if you voted for higher taxes 150 times, it’s time for you to go.""

We fact-checked this claim by Mack in August and rated it False. We will summarize what we learned from our earlier research.

Double-counting votes and other tallying tricks

Mack’s campaign sent us a list of what they characterized as at least 157 votes in favor of higher taxes during Nelson’s Senate career, which started in 2001. (They sent us a similar list again the night of the debate.)

About half of the votes on the list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution raised, lowered or even kept taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law.

Mack’s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan.

Mack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments.

For example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson’s votes against H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. That counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- not 15 examples.

Which brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as ""voting to raise our taxes?"" Mack’s list counts several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson’s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010.

We sent Mack’s list to a three federal budget experts, who  generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut doesn’t equal a tax increase.

Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction, said Mack’s long list was ""ludicrous.""

""Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase,"" he said. ""So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue.""

 Nelson supported some tax cuts

Mack’s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Here, we will focus on the Bush tax cuts.

Nelson opposed a $1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 because he said it didn’t do enough to reduce debt or help low- and middle-income taxpayers. He also said that as a congressman he had voted for President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts and that led to huge deficits.

""I don't want to see Congress make that mistake again,"" Nelson said in 2001.

In 2003 on the second round of Bush tax cuts, Nelson voted against the $350 billion package on the conference report. But in 2006 and in 2010 Nelson, supported extending the tax cuts.

This year, he went along with Obama’s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million.

""His favored position, and one he still holds, is to let the Bush cuts expire on those making more than $1 million,"" said his Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin.

Nelson called for other tax cuts at times. During his first Senate term he bucked his party in favor of repealing the estate tax and in 2007 he sponsored an amendment to reduce the tax on large cigars.

Some of Nelson’s votes cited by Mack would only affect certain businesses -- for example he voted in favor of repealing exemptions for oil and gas companies in 2010. He took many votes in favor of eliminating corporate tax breaks to pay for projects such as port security.

Mack’s spokesman told us that the largest tax increase Nelson voted for was ""Obamacare."" The health care law did raise taxes on the wealthy and health insurance companies. (Read about those provisions in a fact-check we did on a claim by Rush Limbaugh.)

In an interview on debate night, Mack campaign consultant Gary Maloney defended including the budget resolutions and said they are important because they bind congressional committees on their spending and build in assumptions of revenue, taxes and spending. ""A vote for a budget that assumes higher taxes is a vote that is designed to produce a revenue bill that will raise taxes,"" he said.

 Our ruling

Mack said, ""Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 150 times.""

Mack arrives at that figure through some tricks: He counts non-binding resolutions and duplicative votes on the same bill. He counts a vote against a tax cut as a vote for a tax increase, even though it’s not the same thing. And Mack failed to tell debate viewers that Nelson has also voted in favor of tax cuts or extending tax cuts.

In the list of votes that Mack supplied to PolitiFact after the debate, he included a note that explained it included non-binding votes and other caveats. But during the debate, Mack didn’t explain any of that -- he just repeated the claim without further explanation.

"['Medicare', 'Florida', 'Connie Mack']","
Connie Mack says Bill Nelson voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare
","
It is a favored line among Republican candidates to charge their Democratic opponents with cutting Medicare. U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, leveled the attack at least four times in the first half hour of Wednesday’s Florida U.S. Senate debate.

Mack said incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson ""voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare.""

PolitiFact has addressed this claim many times, in many ways, in many states.

Obamacare refers to the Affordable Care Act. It does not literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. We should note that the Republican plan championed by GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan also trims Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount.
   
The spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.
   
Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.
     
The overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget.
     
 $716 billion
         
The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $716 billion.
         
Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. One impact of the law is it extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by eight years to 2024.   

There is a connection between the Medicare cost savings and the health care law. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending.
   
Some of the new spending goes toward Medicare recipients. It increases coverage for prescription drugs and offers preventive care at no cost to the patient.
     
More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending.
     
The health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That, too, offsets the new spending.

 Our ruling

Mack said Nelson voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare, to pay for Obamacare.

Medicare spending increases under Obamacare, but over 10 years, it rises more slowly that it would without the law. The money comes from reducing payments to insurance companies and hospitals.

Part of the savings go to reduce prescription drug payments for Medicare recipients, as well as to provide free preventive care.

Overall, the lower spending extends the solvency of Medicare by eight years.

"['China', 'Debates', 'Pensions', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says Obama also has investments in Chinese companies and through a Cayman Islands trust
","
One of the many tense moments in the second presidential debate turned on a new topic in the race: President Barack Obama’s pension account.

Here’s how it came up: Early in the face-off, Obama scoffed at Mitt Romney’s pledge to crack down on unfair trading practices by China, saying Romney is currently invested in companies ""that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.""

Romney later explained that, yes, he understands that his blind trust has invested in foreign firms, including companies in China. Then he confronted Obama.

 Romney: ""Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?""

 Obama: ""You know, I don’t look at my pension. It’s not as big as yours so it doesn’t take as long. I don’t check it that often.""

 Romney: ""Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust.""

The exchange was a role reversal: An Obama campaign ad in July 2012 claimed Romney had millions in the Cayman Islands, among other ""tax havens."" We rated that True, noting that nothing was illegal or improper about the investments through his blind trust.

We also reviewed an Obama claim from an ad in September 2012 that said, ""Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China.""

We rated that Mostly True, noting that Romney had money invested in funds that owned shares in two Chinese firms, but that Obama’s claim suggested Romney had more to do with the investment decision than is the case. (We further noted that the New York Times reported that one of the funds had invested in a Chinese video surveillance company that supplies cameras to police for watching public spaces.)

Okay, so what about Romney’s debate description of Obama’s pension investments?

The Romney campaign told us it was referring to investments made by the Illinois State Board of Investment on behalf of the state employees’ retirement system there.

Obama, you may recall, was an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 before winning election to the U.S. Senate. He is a participant in the General Assembly Retirement System in Illinois, said William Atwood, executive director of the Board of Investment, who confirmed that for us.

The Romney campaign pointed us to that pension fund’s holding in an entity that is part of Advent International. Advent has described itself as ""one of the world’s most global private equity firms"" and has buyout offices in 16 countries.

Atwood confirmed that the pension fund has invested $30 million in one of Advent’s limited partnerships, Advent International GPE VI-A. That partnership was organized in the Cayman Islands, Atwood said. Public filings back that up.

What about Romney’s broader claims, about Obama’s foreign investments?

The Illinois pension fund also has numerous foreign investments, including in Chinese companies, as part of its diversified portfolio, Atwood said.

The Obama campaign has connected Romney’s overseas investments in the Caymans to methods for avoiding U.S. taxes. But there’s no evidence Obama receives any tax advantage from his overseas pension investments.

David S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in New York, reviewed public filings by Advent and said it was highly unlikely Obama got any tax advantage from the pension fund’s investment in the Advent partnership.

Atwood went further, saying: ""There is no tax advantage to any (pension) plan participant"" from that investment.

Miller offered this analysis: ""There is no evidence that the fund helped the Illinois pension fund avoid any taxes – in this respect, the Illinois pension fund would have been treated identically had the fund been organized as a domestic (U.S.) partnership. However, the fact that it was organized as a Cayman partnership might have allowed some taxable investors to defer some tax on foreign (non-U.S.) portfolio companies purchased by the Fund.""

Atwood emphasized that neither Obama nor any other participant in the retirement system has anything to do with selecting investments for the fund.

Miller concurred with that, and added that Romney legitimately can claim that he has similar distance from foreign investments made through his individual retirement accounts.

It’s ""entirely accurate"" for Romney to say that Obama’s pension plan has investments in foreign companies and through a Caymans trust, Miller said. Technically, it’s a Cayman-based partnership, but that’s a trivial difference, he added.

 Our rating

Romney told Obama: ""You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust.""

It’s an accurate set of statements when you consider investments made by managers of the Illinois pension fund in which Obama has an account.

As we noted in reviewing previous claims about Romney’s investments in China, the investments involved are indirect and -- as far as anybody has said -- made without the knowledge of the account holder.

With that clarification, we rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E08E80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-also-has-investments-chinese-com/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama touts record high border agents, lowest immigration from Mexico in 40 years
","
President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney sparred over border-control policy during the second presidential debate at Hofstra University. Here’s one of Obama’s claims:

""We put more border patrol on the (U.S.-Mexico border than at) any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.""

We’ll look at the two parts of this claim in order.

A record number of border patrol officers?

As of 2011, the most recent year available, the Border Patrol has 21,444 agents, about 86 percent of them stationed along the southern border.

That’s a higher total number of agents than in any year going back to at least 1924, according to data from the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics compiled and provided to PolitiFact by Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues.

It’s worth noting -- as the Romney camp and others pointed out to us -- that the biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents rose by about 14 percent a year on average. Between 2009 and 2001, under Obama, it has increased by about 3 percent per year.

Still, Obama framed his claim carefully. Are there more Border Patrol agents today than in any prior year? The answer is yes.

Is the flow of undocumented immigrants the lowest in 40 years?

When demographers try to measure the number of people crossing the border illegally, they usually refer to the net flow -- arrivals to the United States minus departures. Lately, that number has been essentially a wash, according to statistics from the Pew Hispanic Center.

The center estimated that between 2010 and 2011, the number of immigrants from Mexico declined so much that the flow into Mexico was bigger than the flow out of Mexico since ""probably in the 1930s,"" said Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for Pew.

This is consistent with the kind of decline Obama was referring  to, but both Passel and Massey said Obama was likely referring to a somewhat different statistic -- namely, apprehensions of individuals crossing from Mexico to the United States. Those numbers also support Obama’s claim.

Apprehension statistics are an imperfect gauge of population flow, since they can be affected by the magnitude of the border patrol effort. Still, while this statistic is not a ""direct measure of flow across the border,"" Passel said, it is ""widely accepted as an indicator of the magnitude of the flow.""

So what does that data look like? In 2011, according to federal statistics compiled by Massey, the United States apprehended 327,577 individuals, a smaller number than in any year going back to 1970 -- or just outside Obama’s 40-year window. And if you look at apprehensions per agent, it’s the lowest in an even longer period -- since 1943, Massey said.

Assigning reasons for the decline

Where Obama’s claim runs into problems is when he credits his policies.

Passel said Obama has a point that law enforcement -- something the president has influence over -- has a major impact.

""We know from various surveys that the cost of hiring a smuggler to get into the U.S. has increased significantly as enforcement has been ramped up,"" he said. ""We also know that Mexicans have been pushed into more remote areas to try to cross where it is physically more difficult and dangerous.""

But Massey considers the economy the primary factor. The recession, he said, had an immense impact in slowing border crossing. In particular, dwindling prospects of finding a job in sectors such as construction, which traditionally attract a disproportionate number of Latinos, dampened the urge for potential Mexican migrants to undertake a difficult journey.

Two other significant factors were also out of Obama’s control -- the state of the economy in Mexico (which has been relatively healthy) and the activity of the drug cartels (which has increased violence on the Mexican side of the border).

Our ruling

Obama said, ""We put more border patrol on the (U.S.-Mexico border than at) any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than it's been in 40 years.""

Obama is right about the numbers of Border Patrol agents and on the immigrant flows across the border.

Barack Obama says his administration has created 5 million jobs
","
Early in the second presidential debate at Hofstra University, President Barack Obama answered a question from a young voter seeking reassurance that he will be able to find a job after he graduates.

Obama responded in part, ""And what I want to do is build on the 5 million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.""

Job-creation statistics have been bitterly contested terrain between the campaigns this election cycle, with each trying to frame the question in a way that paints their side most favorably.

For example, Mitt Romney’s campaign ran an ad recently that said, ""Since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women."" We rated that statement Half True, because the number was correct by one method, but way off by others.

Obama’s claim from the debate suffers from the same problem.

If you start at the low point in the private-sector job market -- February 2010, which is 31 months ago -- then Obama has presided over the net creation of 4.7 million jobs.

But that means starting the count more than a year after Obama took office, which -- a little too conveniently for the president -- removes all of the job losses from his first year off his ledger.

Another way of doing it would be to start with January 2009, when Obama was sworn in. By this count, the nation has gained a net 514,000 private-sector jobs -- an amount only one-tenth the size of what Obama claimed. However, this method has its drawbacks, because no president can have much impact in the first few months on the job.

A middle-ground position is to start the count at the official beginning of the recovery, which came in June 2009. From June 2009 until today, the nation has gained roughly 3.6 million private-sector jobs. That’s less than Obama claims, but more than the inauguration-day calculation the Romney camp often prefers. 
It's also worth noting that economists say that presidents have a relatively modest impact on the ups and downs of jobs, so it can be a stretch to give Obama either credit for good job numbers or blame for weak job numbers. 
A final note: Private-sector job numbers are a credible yardstick, but they do paint a more favorable picture for the president than total job numbers do, since government jobs have been shrinking in recent years. Since June 2009, the nation has gained a little under 3 million total jobs, compared to 3.6 million using private-sector jobs alone.

Our ruling

Obama said that his administration has created ""5 million jobs … over the last 30 months in the private sector alone."" That’s true only using the most cherry-picked time frame. A more reasonable method -- starting the count at the beginning of the recovery -- shows a gain of 3.6 million jobs.
That’s still a substantial number, but well short of the 5 million Obama claimed.

Obama says Romney suggested employers should be able to decide if insurance covers contraceptives
","President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney clashed over contraceptives coverage in their second debate, with Romney ultimately declaring, ""the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.""

That sounded like a request for some fact-checking.

So, was Obama totally wrong?

The issue emerged in the Oct. 16, 2012, debate at Hofstra University after a question from the audience about how the candidates intended to fix income inequality for women.

Obama touted signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, then said: Romney later responded: It's worth noting that they were talking past each other. Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees’ insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept — whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care.

For this fact-check, we’re asking whether Romney has suggested that ""employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.""

The Blunt amendment

Obama’s support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment.

Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obama’s health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions.

In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their ""beliefs or moral convictions."" At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like.

A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer ""Of course I support the Blunt amendment.""

CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign.

""Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a ‘moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization’ will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?""

Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: ""Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety.""

In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, ""As president, I will abolish it.""

So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employer’s ability to decline to provide a service that goes against ""beliefs or moral convictions,"" that means he supports employers making ""the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.""

Romney’s response

We asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obama’s claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul: The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control.

(Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though we’re not sure how many had religious exceptions.)

Our ruling

Obama said Romney ""suggested"" that ""employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage.""

Romney says he doesn’t believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees’ insurance.

Paul Ryan's House opponent, Democrat Rob Zerban, says Ryan budget ""ends Medicare""
","
Understandably, Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan is more focused on running for vice-president than he is on seeking re-election to his southern Wisconsin House seat.

But his House opponent, Democrat Rob Zerban, continues to run hard against him.

The former Kenosha County supervisor used his first TV ad, released Oct. 4, 2012, to attack Ryan. He repeats one of the most common -- and debunked -- claims of the past year.

""Paul Ryan -- his controversial budget for America has been called dangerous, cruel and deeply wrong,"" a narrator says of the House Budget Committee chairman as the ad begins.

""The Ryan plan ends Medicare.""

No maybes. No qualifiers. Just a straight declaration.

Zerban’s evidence

As the claim is uttered by the narrator, the words ""End Medicare"" (in quotation marks) appear on the screen, along with a citation to a June 2011 opinion article in The New York Times.

Paul Krugman, who writes The Conscience of a Liberal column, had written that ""Republicans are trying to end Medicare. The program we now call Medicare is one in which the government acts as your insurer, paying your major medical bills; coverage is guaranteed to all seniors. The program Republicans want gives you vouchers and tells you to go buy your own insurance, if you can. That’s not at all the same thing.""

It’s important to underline the fact that Zerban’s ad cites an opinion column. We asked Zerban if he had other evidence.

Campaign spokesman Karthik Ganapathy sent us a statement citing news articles that say Ryan’s plan would effectively end Medicare; end Medicare as we know it; or reform Medicare into a voucher system relying on private insurers.

The statement also quoted the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Washington, D.C. think tank, as saying Ryan’s plan would raise Medicare recipients’ premiums and ""lead more of Medicare’s healthier enrollees to abandon it for private plans, very possibly setting off a spiral of rising premium costs and falling enrollment for traditional Medicare. Over time, traditional Medicare would become less financially viable and could unravel.""

So, Zerban cites news accounts and a think tank report on how Ryan would change Medicare -- substantially, to be sure -- but not end it.

And then Zerban wavered on his claim. 
The statement his campaign sent us quotes Zerban as saying: ""We don’t say anything we don’t mean -- Paul Ryan’s budget ends Medicare."" 
But then Ganapathy e-mailed us to say he wanted to emphasize the ad’s reference to the Times opinion article: ""We are citing other folks who claim the Ryan plan will end Medicare, not coming up with a new accusation ourselves."" 
Zerban is hardly the first to claim Ryan’s plan ends Medicare. But, no bones about it, he clearly made that allegation. 
So what would Ryan’s plan do?

Other evidence

In December 2011, more than nine months before Zerban’s TV ad, PolitiFact National rated as its Lie of the Year for 2011 the oft-repeated Democratic line that Republicans voted ""to end Medicare"" by voting for Ryan’s plan. 
(FactCheck.org has also knocked down the ends-Medicare claims.) 
PolitiFact National noted that the allegation ignores the fact that people 55 and older would remain on traditional Medicare and that, even with the privatized system under Ryan's bill, younger people would still receive a guarantee of care. Moreover, around the time the top lie was chosen, Ryan announced he was altering his plan and would retain an option for people to stay in traditional Medicare if they want.

In other words, Medicare doesn’t end.

Which isn’t to say there wouldn’t be major changes.

PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a charge by President Barack Obama that Mitt Romney and Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher program.

In that item, our colleagues noted that under Ryan’s original plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only. But Ryan later proposed allowing beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.

So, Medicare would remain the same for people 55 and over and it would remain an option for those who are younger.

Our rating

Long after the claim had been debunked, Zerban flatly stated that Ryan’s budget plan ""ends Medicare.""

People 55 and older would remain on traditional Medicare, while those who today are under 55 could use a voucher they would receive to buy either a private insurance plan or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.

We rate Zerban’s statement Pants on Fire.

Josh Mandel ad claims Sherrod Brown failed to pay his taxes three times
","
Claims and charges keep flying in the U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown and Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.

Mandel opened the final month of the campaign with a TV ad focused on Brown's  tax lapses.

""Sherrod Brown caught not paying his taxes"" are the announcer's first words, and the same words are displayed onscreen.

In a news release accompanying the ad, Mandel calls Brown ""a serial delinquent when it comes to not paying his property taxes"" because he ""failed to pay his own taxes three separate times.""

Mandel's campaign cited articles by The Plain Dealer and Associated Press as support for the claim.

PolitiFact Ohio looked at those stories and others. We also reviewed records from the District of Columbia's Office of Tax and Revenue.

The stories, in February 2012, reported that Brown had paid a penalty fee and interest a week earlier, after being four months late paying property tax on his Washington, D.C., apartment.

Brown owed $922.04 in property taxes for the last half of 2011. The taxes were due by Sept. 26, according to the District property tax office. His delinquency added another $76.96 as a late penalty and $46.18 for interest.

Brown also was delinquent in 2006 and 2007 and paid penalties and interest, according to tax records from the District. Before he paid the bill in 2007, his apartment was placed on a District of Columbia auction list for properties with taxes in arrears.

The delinquencies in 2006 and 2007 resulted in Brown paying a total of $735.07 in late charges and interest. Each of those original tax bills, excluding interest and fines, was for less than $900.

Brown was asked about the delinquency during a conference call with reporters last February. He said, ""I was late. I misplaced the bill and I paid it as soon as I found out. I paid a penalty for being late, and it won't happen again.""

He said he also had misplaced the earlier missed bills.

""This is a small apartment,"" he said. ""I'm not in D.C. nearly every week, I'm here when the Senate's in session, I'm here three or four nights a week. I paid the penalty. And in no way, obviously, was I avoiding taxes.""

Brown, who won his Senate seat in 2006 after serving seven terms in the House of Representatives, bought the one-bedroom apartment in 1993. He appeared to have paid the property taxes on time for a dozen years after that.

His primary residence is in Avon.

Mandel was accurate in saying that Brown failed to pay his taxes three separate times. Brown was late to pay. He did pay the taxes and penalty.

There is no indication he was trying to evade the tax, but that wasn’t part of Mandel’s claim, either.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the Mandel campaign ad rates True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C20B40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/17/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-ad-claims-sherrod-brown-failed-pay-his/
