Deal allows Iran to produce nuclear weapon, U.S. Senate candidate Carlos Beruff says
","Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff lobbed a bombshell against his Democratic opponents and the White House: President Barack Obama’s deal with Iran actually allows that country to build a nuclear weapon.   The Manatee County Republican criticized the president’s negotiation skills and berated U.S. Reps. Alan Grayson and Patrick Murphy for backing the deal. Grayson and Murphy are squaring off in the Democratic primary, while Beruff faces a packed GOP field. ""Both Congressman Grayson and Congressman Murphy supported President Obama’s disastrous deal, which allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon,"" Beruff said in a May 5, 2016, news release. Beruff’s argument gave us pause, since the idea of the Iran nuclear agreement was ostensibly made to prevent the country from building a nuke. When we rechecked the terms of the deal for this fact-check, we found that was still the case. The deal’s terms The deal, which was struck in July 2015, essentially lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb.   To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production areas is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact over the last few months that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, they cannot build a nuclear weapon. Opponents (like Beruff) say that all this does is delay a bomb, not prevent it. ""The deal legitimatizes Iran’s nuclear program,"" Beruff campaign spokesman Chris Hartline said in an email. ""It allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium and to ramp up enrichment down the road, while also giving the country access to tens of billions of dollars."" Hartline further said that reported missile tests in March 2016 (which Iran has denied happening) prove that Iran will undoubtedly cheat on the deal. Some experts have said it’s reasonable to suspect Iran could disregard the agreement and again pursue a weapon. But even if the United States had won tougher terms, any agreement only works if the country follows the guidelines. Not coming to an agreement at all would have let Iran’s militarized nuclear progress continue unabated. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s ""breakout time"" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. ""It does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. ""It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days."" Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University, told PolitiFact last year that the deal definitely impedes Iran’s nuclear program. ""Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon,"" he said. Our ruling Beruff said Obama’s deal ""allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon."" He makes it sound as if the agreement formally blesses Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. But it doesn’t. The terms of the deal expressly forbid pursuing a militarized nuclear program. There are limits on uranium enrichment and facility uses, and Iran must agree to inspections. It also must abide by terms of international treaties to not seek weapons even after the deal’s guidelines end. To develop nuclear weapons, Iran would have to either break the terms of the agreement or else wait it out and start building one anew once the deal’s provisions have expired (which would be counter to the provisions of treaties that predated this deal). Either way, that doesn’t sound like an agreement that ""allows Iran to produce a nuclear weapon."" We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2016/may/11/carlos-beruff/deal-allows-iran-produce-nuclear-weapon-us-senate-/

PAC claims former Arizona senator wanted to ban intelligence agencies
","Several attack ads have surfaced in the three-way race for U.S. Sen. John McCain’s seat ahead of the Aug. 30 primary. McCain is skipping out on July’s Republican National Convention in Cleveland to campaign against his main opposition, Democratic U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff and former Republican State Sen. Kelli Ward of Lake Havasu City, who stepped down in December 2015 to focus on running against McCain. The Arizona Grassroots Action Political Action Committee, which supports McCain, challenged Ward’s weakness on national security in an April 20 attack ad. ""She wanted to ban our intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona, leaving Arizonans vulnerable to attack from terrorists,"" claims the PAC. The PAC has spent $211,547 against Ward and $45,050 supporting McCain as of May 10, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Last month, we fact-checked the same PAC’s online attack ad against Kirkpatrick, claiming she votes with fellow Democrats ""nearly 90 percent of the time."" We rated it Mostly True. The latest attack ad about Ward’s record on national security is more misleading. Ward and the NSA Matt Kenney, Arizona Grassroots Action PAC Executive Director, referred us to several news articles on SB 1156, which Ward sponsored in the state Legislature in 2014. The bill eventually died in the Senate. According to the bill’s text, the law would have prohibited state and local law enforcement from assisting federal agencies that collect data without warrants, such as the National Security Agency. It also would have barred local governments from providing ""material support,"" such as water and electricity, to these agencies, assuming they had an in-state facility. Finally, the bill would have also blocked public universities, such as Arizona State University, from serving as ""NSA research facilities."" A December 2013 U.S. News and World Report article quotes Ward as saying that ""the NSA isn’t welcome in Arizona unless it follows the Constitution."" Ward believed the NSA violated the Fourth Amendment with ""unconstitutional snooping."" We did not hear back from her campaign. Arizona State University law professor Paul Bender said the ad’s claim exaggerates what the bill sought to do. ""I don't think that it is accurate to say that, if the bill passed, that would ban U.S. intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona,"" Bender said. ""It would just require them to get warrants in order to get electronic information from Arizona state or local governments."" Technically, Ward’s bill could have applied to any federal agency that engaged in warrantless surveillance, not just the NSA. The legislation, drafted by the Tenth Amendment Center, popped up in 12 states, but the bill only became a law in California. ""It wasn’t intended to stop intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona,"" said Mike Maharrey, a spokesman for the Tenth Amendment Center. Our ruling The ad claimed Ward ""wanted to ban our intelligence agencies from operating in Arizona."" Ward did seek to limit the power of the NSA by preventing assistance from state and local law enforcement without a warrant. However, experts said calling it an outright ""ban"" on operations is beyond what the bill proposed. The legislation was meant to discourage federal agencies from collecting information without a warrant. We rate the ad’s claim as Mostly False.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e0152c92-7c02-4b73-8396-0d6a40f4c330",/factchecks/2016/may/11/arizona-grassroots-action-pac/pac-claims-former-arizona-senator-wanted-ban-intel/

Rating the Philly Daily News’ claim that ‘It’s not a grocery tax’
","According to the monied interests fighting Mayor Jim Kenney’s proposed tax on sugary beverages, it’s not really a ""soda tax."" It’s a ""grocery tax."" This coalition of unions, businesses and others has released ads with the slogan ""No Philly Grocery Tax,"" and last week held a rally outside of City Hall with beverages on a replica of grocery store shelves. Last month, the Daily News criticized the linking of the soda tax to a grocery tax in an editorial titled ""Soda tax would benefit kids, which is why we support it."" After discussing the anti soda tax group’s ads’ insistence on referring to the tax as a grocery tax, the editorial read, ""If you don’t buy cigarettes at your local supermarket, your grocery bill won’t go up a dime. The same is true of the sugary drink tax. If passed, you can avoid paying the tax by not buying sugary drinks."" Their criticism of the phrase ""grocery tax"" has been one of many. But will the prices of groceries be untouched by the proposed soda tax? Or is there a possibility grocery bills could increase even if consumers stop buying soda? Sandy Shea, the Daily News’ editorial page editor, stressed that the newspaper’s editorial board is convinced that calling the sugary drinks tax a grocery tax is disingenuous.   ""If you don’t buy sugary drinks in a supermarket,"" Shea said, ""it’s not a grocery tax."" As city officials have stressed, the three-cent-per-ounce soda tax is levied on distributors. From there, at least some of it will likely be passed through to the retail level. The owners of supermarkets, drugstores, corner stores or whatever businesses sell sugary beverages can choose to absorb the cost, or pass it onto the consumer. While most talk has centered on the possibility of rising soda prices, experts and research suggest it’s possible these businesses could raise the prices of other items similar to sugary drinks. Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, said the prices of diet soda and pure juices might increase because demand for them could increase as people searched for alternatives to sugary beverages. But he doubted the increase would extend to items unrelated to the sugary drinks tax. ""The question you always have to ask yourself is why would these stores be able to raise the price of these other goods,"" Marron said. ""And if they’re able to why wouldn’t they already? If that were the profitable thing to do, they ought to raise the price of cereal anyway."" In Berkeley, the only American city to enact a soda tax, researchers noted the price of Diet Coke increased by an average of .32 cents per ounce (regular sodas saw increases in the range .5 to .7 cents per ounce). They saw no significant increase in other diet sodas. Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said it was possible the prices of other products would rise but not probable in most circumstances. He said smaller convenience stores would be more likely to raise prices on other products than larger grocery stores because they likely take in a greater share of revenue from soda sales. Still, they’d face limitations on how much they could increase prices of other goods given the lack of variety of items they sell and the need to keep profit margins high on soda if soda is a major revenue generator for them. ""All that said, this soda tax proposal is novel enough that any answer to this question is going to involve some amount of speculation,"" he said. Last month in a 6ABC story, it seemed Mayor Kenney was suggesting other items could rise in price because of the soda tax. The station paraphrased the mayor like this: ""The mayor said he believes the increased costs will be spread over thousands of retail items."" Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s communications director, said the station’s paraphrase was incorrect: ""He was referring to the supermarket’s ability to absorb the tax. I believe he was asked to respond to supermarket’s claim that they can’t absorb the increase in cost (if distributors pass it on) because they say they don’t make that much of a profit on soda. He responded by pointing out that because supermarkets sell so much more than just soda that they can absorb the price as part of their overall profits from all the different products they sell."" Asked why the phrase grocery tax is being used, Philadelphians Against the Grocery Tax Coalition spokesperson Larry Miller pointed to a list of taxed products on their website. These products range from sodas to energy drinks to fruit juices that are not 100 percent natural. ""Would you consider, let’s say, Minute Maid premium tropical punch a grocery item?"" Miller said. ""Would you consider Cranberry Ocean Spray cherry juice? Ocean Spray pomegranate? These are grocery items. Snapple Grape. These are all grocery items that people buy every day at the grocery store or the supermarket."" Our Ruling In an editorial supporting the soda tax and condemning the use of the phrase grocery tax, the Daily News wrote Philadelphians would avoid the tax by not purchasing sugary beverages. Evidence, experts and studies say it’s possible a sugary drinks tax on distributors could lead to some rising prices elsewhere. But there’s not enough data and there’s also a chance those who don’t buy sugary drinks will bear some of the cost of the tax.   We rule the claim half true.",/factchecks/2016/may/11/philadelphia-daily-news/rating-philly-daily-news-claim-its-not-grocery-tax/

Georgia's top cop correct about city's pot plan
","Once the smoke clears, the tiny city of Clarkston could become the pot-friendliest place in the Peach State. Or so says 33-year-old Democratic Mayor Ted Terry. Known locally as ""Mayor Ted,"" he is the only mayor in Georgia to publicly endorse Bernie Sanders for president. Terry and his City Council could  vote next week on a plan to make possession of less than an ounce of pot an offense punishable by a small fine only --  possibly $5 to $15. Offenders could also be required to attend a Marijuana Awareness Program, a diversion course for people with risky behavior. Terry touts the proposal as a rational move to make low-level pot possession a public health issue instead of criminalizing users. Clarkston, which is about 1.4 square miles and has 13,000 residents, would become the first city in Georgia to do this -- Athens flirted with a similar idea but backed off. Some people contend it would be a de facto decriminalization of pot possession by the progressive DeKalb County municipality near Atlanta.   The pot plan has made some in law enforcement bristle. ""They can’t decriminalize marijuana,"" Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan recently told a newspaper reporter. ""Only state legislators and Congress can do that."" Keenan is a veteran top cop and a guy with more than a working knowledge of the law. But could he have overstated his case on this one? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. We contacted Keenan, who stood by his statement but declined to comment further. The Clarkston plan has also caught the attention of Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who gave it an immediate thumbs down. ""We should not have any municipality or jurisdiction of state government saying that they’re willing to flaunt the law to downgrade or excuse what is otherwise criminal conduct,"" Deal recently told public radio station WABE. PolitiFact also contacted Terry, who surprisingly, agreed with Keenan -- but with a few, key  caveats. ""We are not decriminalizing it,"" Terry said. ""We are just changing the way we punish it. The more appropriate term is deprioritization, moving to a ticket-only offense."" Chuck Spahos, the director of the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia, said a move by Clarkston would only affect cases heard in Municipal Court. ""Nothing is going to prevent the solicitor general or the district attorney from prosecuting those cases in State Court,"" he said. ""All it does, it gives the citizens of that city a false sense of security."" Terry said there were 77 arrests for low-level pot possession in Clarkston in the past year or so. About 50 of those defendants had their cases judged by Municipal Court. The other defendants had committed additional state crimes and their cases were heard in State Courts. Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said the city could certainly change its local ordinance and order police to make pot possession a low-level offense. But, he said, that’s only part of the equation. ""If they got to an actual prosecution it’s less clear that the mayor would have control over the charges the prosecutors brought,"" Roosevelt wrote in an email to PolitiFact Georgia. Jessica Cino, a law professor at Georgia State University, said any real change in pot laws would have to come from the state level. ""They (Clarkston) certainly can deprioritize it,"" Cino said. ""But they are not going to be able to get around state law."" A municipality can have that policy policewise,"" she added, ""but anyone could still be arrested under state law."" Our ruling. Vernon Keenan, Georgia top state cop, said the city of Clarkson ""can’t decriminalize marijuana. Only state legislators and Congress can do that."" Keenan  is correct on that point -- even the mayor of Clarkston agrees with him. Clarkston can change its pot ordinance, and it can instruct its police officers to make pot enforcement a low-level priority. This, however, would not preclude the district attorney from bringing charges in State Court, which is beyond Clarkston’s control. We rate Keenan’s statement True.

Koch-funded Super PAC attack says Russ Feingold got 2009 memo about harm to veterans and did nothing
","In unveiling an attack ad against Democrat Russ Feingold, who is challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in a rematch of their 2010 contest, a group backing Johnson said it was spending $2 million to air the TV spot. The central claim in the ad from the Freedom Partners Action Fund -- a Super PAC whose funders include billionaire industrialists Charles Koch and Wisconsin’s Diane Hendricks -- is that then-senator Feingold received a memo in 2009 detailing serious problems at the VA Medical Center in Tomah, Wis. Deaths of veterans were later linked to the over-prescription of painkillers at the facility. But there are several issues with the ad: The person who wrote the memo -- and added a notation saying it was hand delivered to Feingold -- reversed herself several months before the ad was released, saying the memo never had been delivered to Feingold after all. After the ad began running, three Wisconsin television stations pulled it when Feingold’s campaign demanded it be taken down for being inaccurate. Then Freedom Partners produced a new version of its ad. This time, the ad didn't say Feingold received the memo; instead it said the memo was marked as having been delivered. Whether Feingold ever received the memo seven years ago may never be known. Freedom Partners points out it is relying on the memo writer’s original contention that Feingold did receive it. But -- as Freedom Partners itself seems to confirm by revising its ad -- there isn’t evidence that Feingold did receive the memo. The ad The original ad, titled ""The Real Story,"" was posted online May 2, 2016. It features whistleblower Ryan Honl, a former employee at the Veterans Administration clinic in Tomah, which is about 100 miles northwest of Madison. Honl describes falsified records and other problems at the clinic, then makes the accusation about Feingold. ""I found out that Russ Feingold got a memo in 2009 that outlined veteran harm and nothing was done,"" Honl says. As he speaks, a copy of the memo appears on the screen. The focus is the hand-written notation that says the memo was hand-delivered to Feingold and two other Wisconsin Democrats -- U.S. Rep. Ron Kind and then-Rep. Dave Obey. Animation is used to draw a red circle around Feingold’s name. Honl continues, saying: ""Russ Feingold ignored veterans' concerns while veterans were dying at the facility. All those veterans who’ve come back wounded, and they die at the hands of politicians who look the other way. I just want the voters to know the real story."" The memo The memo was revealed by USA Today in October 2015, after it had been reported that a 35-year-old Marine died at the facility in 2014 after doctors prescribed him a fatal mixture of drugs. The memo was written by Lin Ellinghuysen, president of a local union at Tomah, to another union official. ""(M)any of the veterans served at this facility are prescribed large quantities of narcotics,"" she wrote, adding that it had become a ""significant"" and ""serious"" concern.    But Obey and representatives of Kind and Feingold told USA Today they had no recollection -- or record of -- receiving the 2009 memo. Obey told the newspaper that such correspondence would have been destroyed when members of Congress leave office. In addition, Ellinghuysen told USA Today ""we can't confirm"" the memos were delivered to the three offices and that she had ""mistakenly operated on that assumption."" Ellinghuysen has since gone further, stating to PolitiFact Wisconsin that the memo was not delivered to Feingold or Kind. She said the union official she sent the memo to told her he did not make the deliveries. The aftermath The memo has continued to be used in the run-up to the November 2016 election. But no evidence of whether Feingold received it has emerged. In January 2016, the Wisconsin Republican Party released audio of an interview Ellinghuysen did with a local sheriff’s deputy in 2009. She says on the recording that she had spoken to members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation in 2008 and they were aware of ""unreported, unexpected deaths"" at the VA hospital. But the recording doesn’t say who exactly Ellinghuysen talked to in Washington. And in any case, it doesn’t bear on whether Feingold received the memo cited in the Freedom Partners ad. In May 2016, after the three TV stations stopped running the Freedom Partners ad, the group released its revised version of the ad. In the new version, Honl says multiple memos outlining veteran harm, including the one from 2009, were marked delivered to Feingold and nothing was done. That’s a key change. The original ad states Feingold received the 2009 memo. The revised ad refers to multiple memos, but claims only they were marked as being received by Feingold (and the marking was done by the memo writer). Our rating Freedom Partners says in a TV ad that Feingold ""got a memo in 2009 that outlined veteran harm"" at a Wisconsin VA facility ""and nothing was done."" Whether the memo was ever delivered to Feingold, who was then a U.S. senator, may never be known. But Freedom Partners cites no evidence that it was delivered. And it made a revised version of the ad that essentially walks back its claim, now saying the memo was marked as delivered, not that Feingold actually received it. Because there isn’t evidence that Feingold received the memo, we rate the claim False.  ",/factchecks/2016/may/11/freedom-partners-action-fund/attack-ad-says-ex-us-sen-russ-feingold-got-2009-me/

Loretta Sanchez dodges question about gun liability vote, cites Brady campaign support
","U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., was asked to explain her 2005 vote to offer gun manufacturers liability protections during a debate in the U.S.Senate race. Sanchez never really directly answered the question but said that the law didn’t give gun manufacturers ""blanket immunity."" She then pivoted to talk about her support from the nation’s leading gun control group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""The Brady Campaign has given me a 100 percent, not 99, 100 percent rating,"" Sanchez said May 10, 2016. ""They say I’m not a lap dog to the gun lobby, and they say I don’t take their money."" The Brady Campaign did say that. But they said a lot of other things -- including some not-so-positive comments on Sanchez’s 2005 vote. We’ll walk you through it. Sanchez on gun issues While Sanchez supports several gun-control measures, such as a mandatory waiting period, a ban on high-capacity magazines and universal background checks, she did vote for the 2005 bill that granted gun makers immunity from lawsuits based on the misuse of their products. To many in the gun control community, this is a blemish on her record, and in April, Sanchez wrote an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee defending that vote. She noted that the full package included some gun control measures, but it was her concern for ""unintended consequences"" that played as large a role. ""I voted for it to prevent frivolous lawsuits against manufacturers,"" Sanchez said. ""If someone uses a baseball bat or hammer to assault you, should the manufacturers be held criminally liable? If you said ‘no,’ then you agree with the principle behind the 2005 law."" The Brady Campaign wasn’t buying it. Four days after Sanchez’s op-ed, the organization issued a press release. ""Loretta Sanchez is dead wrong,"" said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign. ""I find it excruciatingly frustrating that she claimed to have 'fully analyzed unintended consequences' of the law and saw fit to support it nonetheless."" Gross said unlike an auto maker who can be sued, the victims of gun violence have no legal recourse. ""The choice between a victim's right to justice and the possibility of inconveniencing the multibillion dollar gun industry is not a 'tough decision', nor is it 'complicated',"" Gross said. ""Loretta Sanchez is standing on the wrong side of this issue."" Ratings from the Brady Campaign, NRA Sanchez is correct that she received a 100 percent rating from the Brady Campaign in its most recent rankings, which cover the 2013-14 Congress. This was called the ""Lap Dog"" scorecard. But, according to votesmart.org, she has been nicked by the group in the past. Her ""lifetime score"" with the group, which covers only 1991-2009, was 81 percent. On the flip side of the coin, the National Rifle Association has given Sanchez a grade of F in her past two terms, and before that, Ds going back to 2002. ""She cannot defend her vote by parroting the gun lobby's misleading talking points and she cannot sweep this problem under the rug by laying claim to decade-old ratings,"" Gross said in his press release. We did not hear back from Sanchez’s campaign. Our ruling Sanchez said the Brady Campaign has given her a 100 percent rating. They have. But she’s cherry-picking the evidence that puts her in the best light. In reality, the gun-control group just recently wrote a scathing rebuke for Sanchez’s defence of her position on gun maker liability. And she hasn’t always received a 100 percent rating with the group. Sanchez’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

""The PPIC (Public Policy Institute of California) recently reported that Kamala is failing to keep us safe,"" Sundheim said May 10, 2016. ""There is a 34 percent increase in violent crime in the state of California. … And that’s just within the last year."" The PPIC, a nonpartisan think tank, reported no such thing.

Hillary Clinton says market forces made coal companies go bankrupt
","Some coal country voters see Hillary Clinton as a threat, someone who would install regulations that would hurt rather than help the struggling coal industry. But Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that she thinks it's necessary to move away from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, and she wants to do what she can to help current coal mine workers make that transition. ""But the market is making this decision,"" she said May 4. ""The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt. So what I'm offering is a $30 billion plan to really revitalize coal country, to provide support for coal miners and their families, and I think that is the least the country owes these brave people."" Coal has historically been the country’s primary electricity generator. But several major coal companies have gone bankrupt in recent years, including Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy. We decided to dig into the question of how much of that change is due solely to market forces, rather than environmental regulation. We talked to coal industry experts who told us that the primary forces working against coal are market-based, notably the growth of natural gas as a cleaner, cheaper alternative. But now that coal is vulnerable, environmental regulations may seal coal’s demise. ""Coal has always been able to absorb new regulations,"" said Robert Godby, a professor and expert in energy economics at the University of Wyoming. ""But the impact natural gas has had since the fracking boom has been amazing to watch."" He added: ""This would all still be happening regardless of regulations."" Natural gas is eating coal’s lunch, and the coal companies made a bad bet on Chinese demand. Coal used to generate about 50 percent of electricity in the United States, but now it’s down to about 30 percent. Just in the past couple years, natural gas has begun to displace coal. (In this Energy Information Administration chart, the grey line represents coal, and the orange line represents natural gas.)  A recent boom in hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in the United States has dramatically increased the availability of natural gas. Natural gas prices are low, and it produces about half as much carbon. Consequently, demand for natural gas is going up, and demand for coal is going down, and fast. While natural gas is the main threat, a growing demand and diminishing costs for renewable energy, like wind and solar power, also takes away from coal demand, said West Virginia University law professor Patrick McGinley. He added that on top of all this, it’s getting harder to produce cheap coal in the Appalachia region because a century of mining has depleted supply, and so the costs of mining new coal are going up. This is all a huge problem for coal, because electricity is about 90 percent of the coal market, said Andy Roberts, research director for global thermal coal markets at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. He said the trend is unlikely to reverse. But it was a big, failed bet on the international coal market that ultimately pushed companies to a point where they couldn’t pay off their debts, forcing them to file for bankruptcy reorganization. About five years ago, the big coal companies  — Arch, Alpha and Peabody — took out massive loans to invest in metallurgical coal, a type found in the Appalachia region. They thought fast-growing Asian countries, particularly China, would want the coal to facilitate economic development. But China’s growth slowed, and the demand never materialized. The companies have been unable to pay back their debts on this project, and that’s what sent them into bankruptcy, Godby said. Regulations may make electricity companies apprehensive about investing in coal down the line. This is the best way to think about how environmental regulations affect coal: If you’re an electricity company considering building a new coal-powered plant or rehabilitating an outdated one, you’re already on the fence about whether that’s a good investment, because of the threat of natural gas. But then you remember you might have to face strict carbon emission limitations down the line, which convinces you to go with a natural gas plant instead of a coal plant. Take President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a major initiative that would affect coal-powered plants by reducing carbon emissions. It isn’t in effect yet, and it faces court hurdles. Even so, the uncertainty of what kinds of carbon limitations coal plants will face, and the possibility that they could be significant, has already reduced coal plant investment, Roberts said. ""So, investment in coal plants is now basically nil,"" Roberts said. ""And when the CPP begins in earnest in 2022, coal demand, already suffering, will more rapidly and inexorably decline."" Similarly, the 2015 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards is a federal regulation that has had a significant impact on the coal industry and contributed to coal-powered plant closures. But it’s impossible to tell how much of the changes in the coal market can be attributed solely to the regulations, rather than the regulations plus the market forces. Multiple experts we asked said that so far, it’s primarily been the market putting pressure on coal. But looking toward the future, as coal becomes more vulnerable and environmental rules get bigger, regulations may play a larger role.   ""Yes, as Secretary Clinton notes, the market is sorting this out,"" Roberts said. ""Competitive natural gas, the ‘market,’ does indeed have something to do with that. But so do the CPP and federal subsidies for renewable generation. The combination of all these elements has been toxic for coal companies and lethal for those with too much debt. In reality, the ‘market’ for coal is partially economic but increasingly regulatory."" In October, Appalachian Power President Charles Patton said coal power won’t be able to rebound ""with or without the Clean Power Plan"" — the economics just don’t make sense. Our ruling Clinton said, ""The market is making this decision. The market has driven down the cost of coal, so you have companies going bankrupt."" Economic forces on both the national and international markets are the main reason coal’s prominence in the American energy sector is now vulnerable, forcing coal-burning plant closures and several high-profile bankruptcies. For a long time, coal has been impervious to government regulation. But more recently, regulations — a non-economic force — might be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, especially going forward now that coal is on shaky ground. Clinton’s claim is missing this important context, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-market-forces-made-coal-compa/

EPA regulation will force $31 million upgrade to Pinellas County ditch, U.S. Rep. David Jolly says
","A voter at an Orlando debate asked U.S. Reps. David Jolly and Alan Grayson whether climate change presented the greatest threat the world currently faces. That’s when Jolly steered the conversation into a ditch. The Indian Shores Republican answered that ""agents of terror"" are the greatest threat against America, but the effects of climate change are real and will need to be addressed. He said he preferred tax credits and federal money for research instead of stricter environmental and energy regulations from Washington. ""What won't work is the president's Waters of the United States regulation that's going to cost Pinellas County, just one county, between $400 million and $2.5 billion,"" Jolly said on April 25, 2016. ""It will cost them $31 million to fix a single ditch."" We wanted to know if there was a new regulation forcing Pinellas County to spend $31 million to fix a ditch. What we found out is that the price is an old estimate, and there's little consensus how the Environmental Protection Agency is actually changing the rules. Ditch debate Jolly’s campaign said his example came from a letter the business lobbying group Associated Industries of Florida sent to members of Congress on Aug. 12, 2014. The letter asked the state’s congressional delegation to support changes AIF wanted for a new rule concerning the Clean Water Act. Before we get swept up in regulatory minutiae: The original Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 after pollution issues and disasters like Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio of 1969 and Lake Thonotosassa fish kills in Florida. The legislation was supposed to regulate discharges into waterways and wetlands, but environmentalists and industry groups have long debated which bodies of water the act encompassed. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 raised questions about the law’s reach, so the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers aimed to clarify what waters were federally protected, or ""waters of the United States"" (known as WOTUS, really). The agencies published a proposed rule change on April 21, 2014, that addressed several issues, including whether the law applied to ditches and in which circumstances. That did anything but dry up debate. Groups like the National Association of Counties and Republican attorneys general from several states flooded the EPA with objections to the rule. (Florida later joined the call for courts to review the rule.) We’re sticking to ditches for this fact-check. Opponents were concerned that if the rule reclassified a ditch as a water of the United States, county governments could be on the hook for upgrading them to meet EPA rules. In its letter to Congress, AIF said upgrades would be costly. AIF’s initial assessment was based on a ""preliminary analysis"" commissioned by the Florida Stormwater Association, a group of the state’s stormwater management officials. The analysis looked at eight waterways and the estimated cost to bring them in line with the new regulation. Among the eight examples was ""Pinellas Park Ditch #5,"" a 1.3-mile-long flood control canal known as Bonn Creek that empties into the Joe’s Creek Watershed. The ditch, with mostly concrete banks, was designed to handle stormwater runoff. The analysis said the ditch wasn’t currently under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, but it would be under the proposed rule change. The report estimated it would cost $31.3 million to make the ditch compliant with the Clean Water Act’s accepted phosphorous and nitrogen discharge levels. Whether any upgrades to that ditch would be that expensive — or even necessary — is still up in the air. Jon Devine, senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said the analysis Jolly cited doesn’t say why it would cost $31.3 million, and is out of date as a talking point. ""It’s based on the proposed rule, not the final rule, and the final rule took account of a lot of input — including that of municipal stormwater dischargers,"" Devine said. Critics did manage to alter the current of the discussion. After the rule was announced in April 2014, the public was invited to comment. Their concerns about ditches led to changes in the final rule, which was announced in May 2015, and published in June. Among the revisions was that ""the rule further reduces existing confusion and inconsistency regarding the regulation of ditches by explicitly excluding certain categories of ditches, such as ditches that flow only after precipitation.""   The short version: If a ditch that handles stormwater wasn’t under federal jurisdiction before, it wouldn’t be under the new rule. When we contacted AIF for comment on the revised rule, the group said they were not currently working on the issue and had nothing to add. ""The bottom line is that the final Clean Water Rule does not change, in any manner, the way stormwater systems have always been covered under the CWA and, therefore, does not result in any new costs for CWA compliance,"" EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones told us in an email.  If the EPA doesn't require a status change, that would leave the ditch in local control. Devine noted that the EPA usually allows state agencies to decide most of their own policies. ""The states establish what criteria apply to particular waterways, based on their state-designated uses,"" he said. ""Though this is subject to EPA oversight, in my experience (the) EPA is extremely deferential to state judgments."" But EPA reassurances haven’t settled these turbulent waters. Kelli Hammer Levy, chairwoman of the Florida Stormwater Association’s legislative committee and a section manager for Pinellas County watershed management, disagreed with the EPA’s assertion. She said the rule’s reach was not yet fully known, and provisions in it would change the ditch’s status. ""Bonn Creek would be classified as a tributary in this case because it has a bed, bank and high water mark and discharges into a (water of the United States),"" Levy said in an email. Pinellas County isn’t alone in not accepting what the EPA says. Many state officials across the country still didn’t trust the parameters of the final rule, which was set to go into effect in August 2015. It has been put on hold nationally because of pending litigation from more than a dozen states. Our ruling Jolly said that under a new federal regulation, it will cost Pinellas County ""$31 million to fix a single ditch."" His figure comes from a 2014 report that claimed it would cost the county that much to make a stormwater ditch in Pinellas Park compliant with Clean Water Act pollution guidelines under a new rule. But the report didn’t specify why it would cost so much, and didn’t reflect changes the EPA made to the rule in 2015. Jolly didn’t make up the $31 million estimate, but his wording makes it sound as if the EPA is definitely forcing crippling regulatory costs on the county. The agency denies the rule change affects how ditches are classified, but the scope of the new rule is still far from settled. Debate abounds about how specific waterways would be affected by the final rule, which currently is under a court stay pending litigation. There’s no irrefutable evidence of an imminent (and expensive) federal takeover of the ditch in question. We rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa52d834-16ed-4684-b426-bc07f5e3e85a",/factchecks/2016/may/09/david-jolly/epa-regulation-will-force-31-million-upgrade-pinel/

$15-per-hour proposal in Cleveland 'most aggressive' increase in US?
","Superlatives like ""the most"" and ""the greatest"" catch our fact-checking eyes. So we felt compelled to look into a statement by Joe Roman, the CEO and president of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, a regional pro-business organization, on a proposal to raise the city’s minimum wage. On April 25, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Raise Up Cleveland, a union-affiliated PAC, delivered 28,000 signatures to the city council from registered Cleveland voters who support a minimum wage of $15 per hour. The current minimum wage across Ohio is $8.10. ""We have serious concerns about a Cleveland-only wage hike that could put the city in a competitive disadvantage in the region and state,"" Roman said, according to the Plain Dealer. ""As proposed, the hike is the most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country."" National awareness of the movement called Fight for $15 has been boosted by Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and $15 minimum wage increases have been enacted by cities in California, Washington and New York. So what could make the Cleveland proposal the ""most aggressive?"" Here’s what we found out. Judith Malone, the director of communications at the Greater Cleveland Partnership, sent us this statement, expanding upon the CEO’s definition of ""most aggressive:"" According to our examination, no other municipality or state has enacted a +80% increase in their minimum wage. If passed, Cleveland would have the highest broadly applied municipal minimum wage in the nation on January 1, 2017....If the current proposal is approved, Cleveland’s minimum wage would be two times higher than 24 states in the nation and by far the highest in the Midwest region. A chart created by the left-leaning National Employment Law Project backs up this claim. A $15 per hour minimum wage has been enacted by the Washington cities of Seattle, SeaTac (a suburb of Seattle that went to $15.24 in 2013) and Olympia. California cities that approved the $15 minimum include San Francisco, Emeryville, Los Angeles, Mountain View, El Cerrito and Santa Monica. As proposed, the Raise Up Cleveland increase would go into effect Jan. 1, 2017. This is a departure from the way other states and cities have imposed new minimum wage hikes, according to Allison Laffen, a policy associate with the National Conference of State Legislatures, which studies state labor and wage policies. ""Often in legislation, the increases are proposed incrementally, as in New York and California, where it reaches $15 by 2018 and 2022,"" Laffen said. ""A one-step increase to $15, effective immediately, could be described as more aggressive."" Laffen also pointed out that Cleveland’s minimum wage, at $8.10, is lower than any other municipality that has passed or is considering a $15 minimum hike. Only Flagstaff, Arizona, at $8.05, is lower than Cleveland’s, and their $15 per hour proposal would phase in by 2021. Mark Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the low cost of living in Cleveland is another factor to consider. For example, the cost of living in San Francisco is  206 percent pricier than in Cleveland. ""A $15 minimum wage in a city like San Francisco would only be equivalent to about a $5 minimum wage in Cleveland,"" Perry said. ""Therefore, adjusted for the cost of living, it would be hard to justify a $15-an-hour minimum wage in a city like Cleveland, with a cost-of-living that is about 20 percent below the national average."" But the union pushing the Fight for $15 in Cleveland defends its stance. Anthony Caldwell, the director of public affairs for SEIU District 1199, said in an email, ""Our Fight for $15 movement has broad support among members of the community. When polled on support for a $15 per hour minimum wage beginning this January and indexing it to inflation, 77 percent of Cleveland voters supported our cause. And that support crossed all racial, gender and geographical lines within Cleveland."" When asked whether the Greater Cleveland Partnership would be more supportive of a minimum wage increase that stepped up gradually, or was more in line with Cleveland’s cost of living, they declined to comment further. Our ruling A proposed $15 minimum wage in Cleveland is the ""most aggressive minimum wage increase in the country,"" according to the head of the Greater Cleveland Partnership, a chamber of commerce group. It turns out that Cleveland, with a minimum wage of $8.10, is at the lowest starting point of any municipality that has passed or is considering a $15 hike.  Also, the Cleveland proposal would increase the wage to $15 at once instead of building up gradually, as most other cities have done.

Joe Biden misstates daily deaths in United States from cancer
","Vice President Joe Biden, the Obama administration’s point person on advancing cancer research, traveled to the Vatican on April 29, 2016, to discuss technological progress in medicine. During that speech, Biden said, ""In the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer."" A few days later, Biden’s office posted the text of that speech on Medium. When we looked into this statistic, we found a discrepancy. In the American Cancer Society’s ""Cancer Facts & Figures 2016"" report, the group wrote that ""about 595,690 Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2016, which translates to about 1,630 people per day."" That’s roughly half of what Biden said. When we contacted Biden’s office, spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak said the 3,000 figure refers to the daily number of cancer deaths in the Americas as a whole — not just in the United States — in 2012, the most recent year for which the World Health Organization has full data. We were able to verify that statistic here; officially, the number is 1.3 million annually, or just over 3,000 per day. Biden’s office has changed the text in the Medium article to ""more than 1,600"" during the course of our reporting. They also inserted the following correction: ""*The initial number provided for daily cancer deaths in the United States was 3,000 — which is roughly the number of daily cancer deaths across the broader Americas."" Our ruling Biden said in his Vatican speech that ""in the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer."" Actually, that’s the number of deaths for the Americas as a whole, not for just the United States. After we contacted Biden’s office, they changed the number listed in the Medium article to the correct number, ""more than 1,600.""

Sen. Blunt misstates opponent Jason Kander's position on Guantanamo Bay
","The race for Missouri’s U.S. senate seat is heating up between incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt and Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt said Kander supports President Obama’s plan to close Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. military prison in Cuba housing suspected terrorists, and transfer prisoners to mainland prisons. Blunt tweeted out a petition against the plan 11 times on his campaign account between April 18 and April 20. The petition says, ""Jason Kander supports his plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil. Tell national Democrats and Jason Kander that bringing suspected terrorists to U.S. soil puts Missouri families at risk."" This statement piqued our interest, because Kander made headlines in February for coming out against this plan. So we decided to look into the claim. Obama has tried to close Gitmo ever since he took office in 2009. The Missouri House passed a resolution later that year that opposed the closure. It urged Congress to ""reject any act of asylum, containment, transport, imprisonment, or medical care in regard to suspected terrorists from any United States operated foreign prison present within the State of Missouri."" Kander, who was serving as a state representative at the time, voted against this resolution. At the end of February of this year, the White House again released a plan for closing the detention center. Part of the plan includes transferring detainees who cannot be released in foreign countries to a U.S. prison facility. One of the proposed facilities is a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which sits a few miles from the Kansas-Missouri border. Kander released a statement opposing this plan after it was announced by the president. ""Our focus right now needs to be defeating ISIS, and we can’t risk the possibility that the terrorists housed at Guantanamo could rejoin the battlefield,"" said Kander. ""These dangerous prisoners should not be transferred to the United States, and I strongly urge President Obama to reconsider this plan."" His spokesman Chris Hayden said Kander has never supported legislation on the federal level to close Gitmo and has opposed executive action. ""He did not think that a non-binding resolution in the Missouri legislature was the best way to keep us safe from terrorists,"" Hayden said. Blunt has accused Kander of flip-flopping on the issue. Tate O’Connor, spokesperson for Blunt’s campaign said, ""Jason Kander may wish to un-ring the bell, but he cannot."" He said Kander is only trying to appeal to Missouri’s popular vote by opposing Obama’s plan. But Kander never officially stated his position on closing Gitmo until February. Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which seeks to get Republicans elected to the Senate, released a video last November saying the committee couldn’t find his stance on bringing the prisoners to the U.S. Blunt is going against the message from his fellow Republicans when he says Kander supported Obama’s plan in the past. Our Ruling Blunt says Kander supports Obama’s plan to bring the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. Kander voted against a 2009 resolution in the Missouri legislature that called on Congress to keep the facility open. But that doesn’t mean he supported Obama’s plan to close the prison. He took no official position until February, and even the National Republican Senatorial Committee said they weren’t sure where he stood before then.

Pants on Fire: Cruz says White House sponsored U.N. resolution that would ""shred 1st Amendment""
","In an email to supporters March 28, 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas criticized the Obama administration’s approach to fighting terrorism. The email, with the subject ""If I Am Elected President, America Will Have a Commander-in-Chief Committed to Defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism,"" reprinted a Cruz op-ed column published that day in the New York Daily News. Cruz wrote the op-ed after New York City Police Chief William Bratton criticized his call to monitor Muslim neighborhoods in the aftermath of the Brussels terrorist attacks. Cruz, who since has dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination for president, defended his plan to monitor Muslim neighborhoods by citing the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek, which has been connected to the architects of the Brussels attack. Then, he turned to President Barack Obama’s approach to terrorism and the differences between their two philosophies: fighting ""radical Islamic terrorism"" as Cruz and other Republicans call it, or fighting extremist groups, as Obama has clarified. ""In the wake of 9/11, there was a broad consensus in favor of a common-sense domestic counterterrorism strategy,"" Cruz wrote. ""But over the last seven years, the focus on protecting the homeland has been lost. The Obama administration has even joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a U.N. resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal."" It’s no secret Cruz and Obama disagree on what to call terrorists. But is it true the Obama administration ""joined Islamist governments"" to sponsor a United Nations resolution to ""make discussion of radical Islamism"" illegal in contravention of the First Amendment? U.N. resolution The Cruz campaign did not answer our queries about the basis of his U.N. claim, but Josh Greenman, opinion editor for the Daily News, replied by email that Cruz’s statement reflected the senator’s ""interpretation of United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18.""         The U.N. Human Rights Council adopted that resolution in March 2011 with the purpose of ""combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence, and violence against persons based on religion or belief."" The resolution promotes religious tolerance and calls on member states to ensure proper representation of religious minorities. The resolution was a compromise, reached in 2011 after more than a decade of negotiations. In 1999, Muslim states, through the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, began introducing resolutions intended to combat  what they saw as the defamation of religion, often through the criminalization of blasphemy. Western states opposed the proposals, arguing they interfered with free speech. By 2011, the different parties agreed to modify the resolution to drop any references to blasphemy or defamation. The resolution passed unanimously after that compromise. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it a ""landmark achievement."" PunditFact checked a statement related to Resolution 16/18 on Jan. 14, 2015. PunditFact found Mostly False a claim that the Obama administration, through the resolution, supported Muslim allies trying to establish an international blasphemy standard. One clause in the resolution supported that claim: In a list of ""actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance, peace and respect,"" the resolution calls on states to adopt ""measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief."" To defend the United States’ ability to support a resolution with that language without violating its Constitution, PunditFact reported, State Department officials Michael Posner and Suzan Johnson Cook cited a 1969 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Brandenburg v. Ohio. In its ruling, the high court held that all speech is protected ""except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" Therefore, the State Department officials said, the resolution language was in line with U.S. law. PunditFact determined that negotiating with Muslim allies to tone down language on blasphemy and defamation laws did not equate to supporting their cause. However, the resolution language that leaves a door open to criminalization -- an interpretation some Muslim countries have insisted is the correct reading of the agreement -- bumped the rating to Mostly False, rather than False. Cruz goes further Cruz’s claim is more extreme than the one PunditFact checked in 2015. Cruz says that the same resolution could ""shred our First Amendment"" and threaten to make discussion of radical Islamic terrorism illegal. A web search for experts on Muslim states and the U.N. led us to Turan Kayaoglu, an associate professor at the University of Washington Tacoma who studies the intersection of religion, human rights and international relations. Kayaoglu stressed that no U.N. resolution could in any way threaten the United States’ First Amendment. Whenever the United States signs an international document, Kayaoglu said by telephone, it insists on restrictions to exclude anything that would infringe on First Amendment rights. Kayaoglu said this insistence goes back to 1966’s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a landmark agreement on international human rights that the United States also worked to ensure would not supercede its Constitution. As for the other portion of Cruz’s claim, Kayaoglu emphasized that Islamic countries attempted to criminalize blasphemy, or hate speech, through Resolution 16/18, which the U.S., European Union and other actors rejected, as explored by PunditFact. By claiming that the resolution would ""make discussion of radical Islamic terrorism illegal,"" Kayaoglu said, Cruz is interpreting the resolution in the same way as Islamic states, rather than through the understanding emphasized by the U.S. and E.U. When member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation attempt to criminalize blasphemy, they usually are focused on ""things like defaming Muhammad,"" Kayaoglu said. Blasphemy laws could extend to discussion of the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram and other terrorist groups. Or, as Cruz calls it, ""radical Islamism."" ""In an interesting way, what Sen. Cruz is believing, is he’s following the interpretation of Islamist governments that’s been rejected repeatedly by the Obama administration and other European governments,"" Kayaoglu said. When the resolution passed in 2011, Clinton, then secretary of state, offered the United States’ interpretation of the agreement: ""The United States strongly supports today’s resolution, which rejects the broad prohibitions on speech called for in the former ‘defamation of religions’ resolution, and supports approaches that do not limit freedom of expression or infringe on the freedom of religion,"" she said. Our ruling Sen. Ted Cruz said that the Obama administration has ""joined Islamist governments in sponsoring a U.N. resolution that would shred our First Amendment by threatening to make discussion of radical Islamism potentially illegal."" The United States in 2011 voted in support of United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18, which promotes religious tolerance. That approval only came after the U.S. and its western allies successfully negotiated to have language criminalizing blasphemy dropped from the resolution to ensure it comports with free speech rights and the First Amendment. Cruz’s interpretation of the resolution’s wording, one expert said, more closely resembles that of Islamist governments than the Obama administration. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Trump didn't say ‘good’ in reference to family separations; he said ‘go ahead’ to debate moderator

 Trump wrong to blame pandemic for Foxconn struggles
","President Donald Trump and Wisconsin’s Foxconn project are undeniably linked. Trump was at the June 2018 groundbreaking in Mount Pleasant, and when a series of media reports detailed the possibility Foxconn could scale back or call off its plans in Wisconsin in early 2019, Trump stepped in directly. The president spoke to then-CEO and Chairman Terry Gou, and the company then announced it was still building a liquid crystal display manufacturing plant here. So it wasn’t surprising to hear Trump back the company even as we learned it failed to meet the job targets to receive any subsidies for the second straight year. In an Oct. 17, 2020, interview with WTMJ-TV’s Charles Benson, Trump said the company was still going to deliver on its promised 13,000 jobs. ""They will do what I tell them to do. They will do what’s supposed to be done. Because they did make promises,"" Trump said. ""If they don’t meet the standards, you shouldn’t give them the tax credits, but they will end up being a great investment for your state. … If I win the election, Foxconn is going to come in with money like no other company has come into our country, you watch."" But it was Trump’s explanation for Foxconn’s lack of progress that struck us as particularly interesting. Asked why the company hadn’t met expectations, Trump said, ""No. 1, you had a pandemic."" Since the Foxconn deal was signed in 2017, officials have repeatedly referenced the changing marketplace and Foxconn’s resulting strategy shifts as factors in the slow ramp-up in Mount Pleasant. Trump didn’t mention either of these factors, citing only the pandemic as a cause. Let’s check out what Foxconn promised and how fair it is to blame COVID-19  for the lack of progress. Foxconn and Wisconsin signed an initial memorandum of understanding in July 2017 that said the company ""agrees to … create up to 13,000 jobs with an estimated average salary of $53,875 over a period of up to six years."" A formal agreement signed in November 2017 moved that up a bit, saying Foxconn agrees ""to the best of their ability, to projected employment of 13,000 jobs of hourly and salaried personnel of Wisconsin payroll between 2018 and the end of 2022."" In a deal brokered by then-Gov. Scott Walker and approved by the GOP-led Legislature, Wisconsin agreed to provide as much as $3 billion in subsidies (cash payments made to the company) and hundreds of millions in infrastructure improvements. In exchange, the company pledged to invest up to $10 billion and build a Generation 10.5 plant to make giant display panel screens. The deal established job thresholds for the subsidies for each year along the way — a minimum to get the lowest available subsidies, and a maximum to get all of them. In the time since, local and state government have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure, but the company has repeatedly downsized its plans and fallen short of its promises. Foxconn failed to quality for even the minimum tax credits in 2018 or 2019. The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a private-public partnership that oversees the state’s deal with Foxconn, reported Oct. 12, 2020 that the company had hired only 281 people eligible for credits — compared to the expectation of 2,080 and minimum of 520 — and made only $300 million in capital expenditures through the end of 2019. Meanwhile, the company had dropped the Generation 10.5 plans in favor of a Generation 6 plant, which conflicts with the agreement reached with the state. State officials have attempted to renegotiate the deal with Foxconn to reflect the company’s current reality, but that so far has not happened as the company hasn’t provided specifics on its plans for the site. Wisconsin Secretary of Administration Joel Brennan cited Foxconn business challenges, a changing marketplace and the pandemic as elements of the conversation on how to move forward.   ""There is no manufacturing to speak of going on at that facility right now,"" Brennan told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""I don’t know that there is a lot of certainty about what is going on there."" In short, Foxconn is falling short, and it has been since long before the pandemic. ""It has been clear for more than 16 months that Foxconn was no longer pursuing the project proposed, evaluated, negotiated, and contracted for with WEDC,"" WEDC Secretary and CEO Missy Hughes said in a statement to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Further, the pre-pandemic job creation numbers submitted by Foxconn for 2018 and 2019 fell short of the minimum for each year. That’s why we have been encouraging Foxconn for the last year and a half to align its agreement with WEDC with its evolved plans and vision in Wisconsin."" In the time since Trump’s comment, new documents and media reports have further illuminated Foxconn’s lack of progress. These don’t factor into our rating since they weren’t widely known at the time of the statement, but they support the prior evidence. An Oct. 7, 2020, memo from the state Department of Administration — first reported by The Verge — noted: The Generation 6 facility on the site now is more of an assembly facility than a fabrication facility, according to a DOA expert. It ""may be better suited for demonstration purposes rather than as a viable commercial glass fabrication facility."" The facility ""if operational, would be the smallest Generation 6 (factory) operating anywhere in the world. It is less than one-twentieth the size of the promised Generation 10.5 project and would employ, if it ever became fully operational, only a small fraction of the local residents who WEDC expected to be employed."" Foxconn has a ""pattern of hiring spikes,"" where they have added employees near the year-end job reporting deadline, then cut ties soon after. Foxconn has changed one building’s purpose ""at least temporarily"" from manufacturing to storage. Foxconn’s hiring likely dropped so far in 2020, rather than dramatically ramping up as the contract requires. After this surfaced, Foxconn founder Terry Gou issued a statement reiterating a desire to expand on the Mount Pleasant site. ""The world has changed a lot since Foxconn’s partnership with Wisconsin began, but Foxconn’s commitment to the state has not wavered,"" Gou said. ""Market conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic have altered the timing of our expansion, the specifics of our manufacturing plans, and our product lines have changed. But through it all, Foxconn has pressed forward with its Wisconsin plans."" Asked why Foxconn has fallen short of expectations, Trump said ""No. 1, you had a pandemic."" The pandemic no doubt has played a role in Foxconn’s 2020 struggles, where the state expects the company to fall even farther off of its projected hiring levels. But the project was foundering long before that. The benchmarks that showed Foxconn struggling all occurred before the pandemic — the company fell short of even minimum hiring targets in 2018 and 2019 while investing nowhere near the money initially projected by this point for what was to have been a Generation 10.5 facility. Referencing the pandemic as the primary reason for Foxconn’s struggles is flat wrong. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2020/oct/23/donald-trump/trump-wrong-blame-pandemic-foxconn-struggles/
"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Donald Trump']","
Did Trump confuse the public option with Medicare for All?
","During the final presidential debate, President Donald Trump claimed that 180 million people would lose their private health insurance to socialized medicine if Democratic presidential nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president.  ""They have 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine — you won’t even have a choice — they want to terminate 180 million plans,"" said Trump.  Trump has repeated this claim throughout the week, and we thought the linkage of Biden’s proposed health care plan with socialism was something we needed to check out. Especially since Biden opposed Medicare for All, the proposal by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would have created a single-payer health system run completely by the federal government, and has long been attacked by Republicans as ""socialist.""  The Trump campaign did not respond to our request asking where the evidence for this claim. Experts called it a distortion of Biden’s plan. Experts agreed the number of individuals who have private health insurance either through an employer-sponsored plan or purchased on the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace is around 180 million people.  The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan health policy organization, estimated in 2018 about 157 million Americans had health insurance through their employer, while almost 20 million had insurance they purchased for themselves.Together, that adds up to about 177 million with private health insurance. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF).  Biden supports expanding the ACA through several measures, including a public option. Under his plan, this public option would be a health insurance plan run by the federal government that would be offered alongside other private health insurance plans on the insurance marketplace.  ""The marketplace is made up of multiple insurers in areas,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy fellow at the Urban Institute. ""Sometimes there are five or more (plans), sometimes there is only one. Biden is talking about adding a public option in the marketplace. You could pick between these private insurers or you could pick the public option.""  Getting rid of the so-called ""employer firewall"" is also part of Biden’s proposal.  This firewall was implemented during the roll out of the ACA. It was designed to maintain balance in the insurance risk pools by preventing too many healthy people who have work-based coverage from opting instead to move to a marketplace plan. And it all came down to who qualified for the subsidies that made these plans more affordable.   Currently, those who are offered a health insurance plan through their employer that meets certain minimum federal standards aren’t eligible to receive these subsidies, which come in the form of tax credits. But that leaves many low income workers with health care plans that aren’t as affordable or comprehensive as marketplace plans.  Biden’s plan would eliminate that ""firewall,"" meaning that anyone could choose to either get health insurance through their employer or through the marketplace. That’s where many Republicans argue that we could start to see leakage from private health insurance plans to the public option.  ""The problem is healthy people leaving employer plans,"" said Joseph Antos, a scholar in health care at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. That could mean the entire work-place plan’s premiums could go up. ""You could easily imagine a plan where it spirals, the premiums go up, and then even more people start leaving the plans to go to the public option.""  Blumberg, though, said that because the marketplace would still include private health insurance plans alongside the public option, it doesn’t mean everyone who chooses to leave their employer plan would go straight to the public option.  She has done estimates based on a plan similar to the one Biden is proposing. She estimates that only about 10% to 12% of Americans would choose to leave their employer-sponsored plans, which translates to about 15 million to 18 million Americans.  KFF also did an estimate and found that 12.3 million people with employer coverage could save money by buying on the exchange under the Biden plan.  But, ""it’s not clear all of those people would choose to leave their employer coverage, though, as there are other reasons besides costs that people might want to have job-based insurance,"" Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the program on the ACA at KFF, wrote in an email.  Either way, none of the estimates are anywhere close to the 180 million that Trump claimed.  Overall, experts said no, what Biden supports isn’t socialized medicine.  ""Socialized medicine means that the government runs hospitals and employs doctors, and that is not part of Biden’s plan,"" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, wrote in an email. ""Under Biden’s plans, doctors and hospitals would remain in the private sector just like they are today.""  However, Antos said in his view that the definition of socialism can really vary when it comes to health care.  ""I would argue in one sense, we would already have socialized medicine. We have massive federal subsidies for everybody, so in that sense, we’re already there,"" said Antos. ""But, if socialized medicine means the government is going to dictate how doctors practice or how health care is delivered, we are obviously not in that situation. I don’t think the Biden plan would lead you that way.""  And in the end, Antos said invoking socialism is a scare tactic that politicians have been doing for years.  ""It’s just a political slur,"" said Antos. ""It’s meant to inflame the emotions of those who will vote for Trump and meant to annoy the people who will vote for Biden.""  Trump said 180 million people would lose their private health insurance plans to socialized medicine under Biden.  While about 180 million people do have private health insurance, there is no evidence that all of them would lose their private plans if Biden were elected president.  Biden supports implementing a public option on the health insurance marketplace. It would exist alongside private health insurance plans, and Americans would have the option to buy either the private plan or the public plan. While estimates show that there are a number of Americans that would likely leave their employer-sponsored coverage for the public plan, they would be doing that by choice and the estimates are nowhere near Trump’s 180 million figure.  Experts also agree that the public option is not socialized medicine, and it’s ridiculous to conflate Biden’s plan with Medicare for All.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

Trump repeats flawed claim that Biden opposed Trump’s coronavirus travel restrictions on China
","In the final presidential debate, Democratic candidate Joe Biden repeated his claim that President Donald Trump has mishandled the nation’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Trump shot back in defense, and claimed that Biden himself thought that the administration was wrong in restricting travel from China on Jan. 31, 2020, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading in the United States.  ""When I closed he said I should no't have closed,"" Trump said. ""He said this is a terrible thing, you are a xenophobe, I think he called me racist. Now he says I should have closed it earlier.""  ""I did not say either of those things,"" Biden responded. ""I talked about his xenophobia in a different context, not about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States."" As debate moderator Kristen Welker interjected to ask another question, Trump continued: ""He thought I shouldn't have closed the borders. That's obvious."" This isn’t accurate.  Biden did not directly say that he thought Trump shouldn’t have restricted travel from China when he did. The former vice president did accuse Trump of ""xenophobia"" in an Iowa campaign speech the same day, Jan. 31, that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced the administration's travel restrictions on people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the U.S. Biden said: ""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science."" RELATED: Fact-checking whether Biden called Trump ‘xenophobic’ for restrictions on travel from China Biden’s presidential campaign told the Washington Post Fact Checker that his accusations were not related to the travel restrictions, claiming he wasn’t aware of the restrictions during his speech since the event started shortly after they were announced. The campaign also noted he made similar remarks in an opinion column published Jan. 27 in USA Today. And in his comments in Iowa, Biden did not mention the travel restrictions. On Feb. 1, Biden mostly repeated his remarks from the campaign stop, tweeting: ""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."" Biden did not say whether he supported or opposed the Trump travel restrictions until April 3, when his campaign said that he supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China. ""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" the campaign told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too."" Trump said, ""When I closed he said I should not have closed. ...He said this is a terrible thing, you are a xenophobe, I think he called me racist. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. … He thought I should not have closed the border. That’s obvious."" Biden didn’t take an official position on the China travel restrictions until months after they were first enforced. And while he has called Trump a racist and xenophobic, those comments weren’t explicity in reference to the travel ban.  Trump’s claim contains an element of truth, but overstates and takes Biden’s comments out of context.

No, fight against coronavirus isn't rounding the corner, as Donald Trump said
","In the final presidential debate of 2020, President Donald Trump repeated a characterization of the coronavirus pandemic that he had used previously, including at a town hall one week earlier. ""We are rounding the turn,"" on coronavirus, Trump said in the Oct. 22 debate in Nashville. ""We are rounding the corner."" No one knows the future course of the coronavirus pandemic. But ""rounding the corner"" suggests that significant and sustained improvements are being made in the fight against the virus, and that’s not the case in the U.S., according to the data. The number of coronavirus cases is climbing once again, after falling consistently between late July and mid-September. Cases are now at their highest point since early August, with almost 60,000 new confirmed infections a day, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. That’s only about 10% lower than the peak in late July.   Epidemiologists are worried that the change in seasons could only make matters worse, as colder weather drives more people indoors, where the virus can spread more efficiently. ""The winter is going to be long and hard,"" Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at Boston University told PolitiFact. ""I do worry about the path of the current metrics."" Hospitalizations today are lower than in previous spikes, but in the past few weeks, there has been a modest spike in hospitalizations.   And the positivity rate, which measures what percentage of tests come up positive for the virus, also went up again during the past few weeks. This is a concern because higher positivity rates are an indicator of community spread.   The one encouraging change is that the number of deaths has eased somewhat. Since a peak in August, deaths have fallen fairly consistently due to a combination of factors, including improved understanding of how to treat the disease.   That said, deaths have settled in at about 800 a day, which is a substantial level and is keeping total deaths per week in the United States above normal levels.   ""Our experience over the last several months has made us better at managing disease among infected people,"" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor of public health at Claremont Graduate University. ""However, I do not think we should be overconfident, lay back and rely on medicine simply because we’re better at treating COVID."" Trump said, ""We are rounding the turn"" on coronavirus. ""We are rounding the corner."" No one can predict the future course of the pandemic, but the notion that we are ""rounding the corner"" would imply significant and sustained reductions in the spread of the virus. In reality, that hasn’t been happening. Cases have been rising steadily since mid-September, hospitalizations have been rising for almost two weeks, and positivity rates have been rising since the end of September.

Fact-checking Trump’s claim that Pennsylvania ‘never opened’ after coronavirus closures
","President Donald Trump has criticized some governors for imposing restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus, and at a rally in Erie on Tuesday, he lambasted Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf.  Trump told his supporters that Pennsylvania ""never reopened"" after Wolf ordered the shutdown of ""non-life-sustaining businesses"" in March, soon after the outset of the pandemic. ""What the hell is going on with your state?"" Trump said. ""You guys never opened.""  Day-to-day life in Pennsylvania hasn’t returned to normal, and it may not until a coronavirus vaccine is widely available. But the state’s schools and businesses aren’t uniformly shuttered as they were in the spring.  All 67 Pennsylvania counties are in the ""green"" phase of the Wolf administration's three-phase reopening plan and have been since July 3, meaning most businesses may operate at 75% capacity, and school districts may decide whether to offer in-person instruction. Lebanon County, east of Harrisburg, was the last county to move from ""yellow"" to ""green.""  Pennsylvania’s lockdown began on March 19, when Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close to help stop the spread of the virus. Two weeks later, Wolf issued a statewide stay-at-home order, and one week after that, he announced that schools would remain closed through the end of the academic year.  At that point, all counties were in the ""red"" phase, with severe restrictions imposed by Wolf.   In mid-April, the governor announced the criteria for counties to reopen — fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per 100,000 residents reported to the state in the previous 14 days. He said the state would also assess whether a county had enough testing and contact tracing, and he set May 8 as a target date to begin lifting restrictions.  He followed through.  That day, 24 counties moved from ""red"" to the ""yellow"" phase of reopening, and over the next two months, all counties moved into ""yellow"" and eventually to ""green,"" the least restrictive phase.  Now that all Pennsylvania counties are in ""green,"" it has been up to each of the state’s 500 school districts to determine whether or not to offer in-person instruction. Philadelphia will welcome some students back to classrooms on Nov. 30, and Pittsburgh plans to reopen on Nov. 9. Students in the Central Bucks district returned on Sept. 30.  All Pennsylvania counties have remained in the ""green"" phase even as case counts have climbed to the highest level since April, and Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine said as recently as Oct. 14 that the state has no plan to impose any new restrictions.  ""We're in a much better place than we were in the spring,"" Levine said. Besides, whether Wolf has the power to impose another lockdown remains unsettled. In September, a federal judge struck down key elements of the governor’s virus mitigation strategy, labeling the limits he imposed on businesses and gatherings unconstitutional. The state appealed the ruling, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed to restore the restrictions on gatherings until it rules on Wolf’s petition for relief. The state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which displays real-time data on confirmed cases of the virus, shows that Philadelphia, Delaware, Berks and Centre counties all have more than 2,000 cases per 100,000 residents, well above the threshold the state deems safe. Two dozen other counties have more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 residents.  But so far, Wolf has not imposed any new restrictions.  Trump said Pennsylvania ""never opened."" That’s not true. Most businesses were closed and residents were ordered to stay home in April, but restrictions have been lifted gradually since May, and no new lockdowns have been ordered even as case counts climb.

Mark Kelly did not take a Chinese communist banner to space
","In her bid to remain a U.S. senator for Arizona, Republican Sen. Martha McSally told voters that she’s standing up to China, and claimed that her Democratic opponent, astronaut Mark Kelly, has done just the opposite, even once taking a ""Chinese communist banner"" to space with him. ""Let me tell you a story, it started in 2003, while he was active duty, Mr. Kelly went over on this Chinese communist government-funded trip, 2003, 2004, 2005, said it was the most meaningful thing in his life other than going to space,"" McSally said during an Oct. 6 debate in Phoenix. Astronauts get to take just a few things with them to space, and an astronaut who supports her, McSally said, took the U.S. flag and a flag of his state when he went to space. ""But what Mark Kelly decided to bring to space was the banner, the Chinese communist banner from this forum, this junket that was paid for by China, of all the things that he could have brought to space,"" McSally said. Kelly responded that he didn’t know what McSally was talking about or where she got her information. ""She might have found something on the internet,"" he said. We asked McSally’s campaign for information, but the links the campaign provided do not support the claim that Kelly went on a Chinese-government funded trip to the forum or that he took a communist banner with him to space. Kelly in 2003, 2004 and 2005 participated in what’s known as the Young Leaders Forum, an annual program of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. The National Committee is an American nonpartisan nonprofit that seeks to encourage mutual understanding between citizens of the two countries. The Young Leaders Forum brings together young professionals from the United States and China during a multi-day conference. The location of the forum alternates between the countries each year: In 2003 it was in China, in 2004 it was in the United States, in Arizona. Kelly went to space in 2001 as pilot for STS-108 Endeavour and in 2006 as pilot for STS-121 Discovery. The National Committee on U.S.-China Relations told PolitiFact that the banner that Kelly took to space aboard Discovery in 2006 was made expressly for him by the National Committee, in honor of his shuttle flight and his participation in the Young Leaders Forum. ""The claim that Mark Kelly took a ‘Chinese communist banner’ into space is wholly false,"" said Joseph Weed, director of communications for the group. The National Committee sent PolitiFact pictures of Kelly’s banner, which includes the name of the program spelled out in both English and in Chinese. It also sent a picture of a certificate signed by Kelly, which said the banner and a U.S. flag were flown aboard the space shuttle Discovery to the International Space Station in July 2006.   McSally’s campaign sent PolitiFact a link to an article published by the Washington Free Beacon a few days before the debate. The Sept. 28 post said ""the Chinese government invited"" Kelly ""to an all-expenses-paid retreat at a countryside resort in 2003."" The article described the Young Leaders Forum as ""a five-day junket cohosted by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, which is ‘under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.’""  ""Kelly would participate in the 2004 and 2005 conferences as well. He called the experience ‘one of the absolute highlights of my life, second only to flying in space,’ and even took a forum banner into space in 2006,"" the article said. McSally’s campaign also noted that the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations says on its website: ""The National Committee, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA), and the Forum's U.S. sponsors — led in 2019 by Chubb and Xcoal — cover all lodging, food, and program costs of the YLF retreat for the first two years of our fellows' participation, allowing them to attend one Forum in the United States and one in China."" But the U.S. organization says McSally’s claim here is wrong, too. From 2009 onward, the program adopted a new model, Weed said. The National Committee covered all expenses for American and Chinese fellows when the program was conducted in the United States. When it was in China, from 2009 onwards, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs covered in-country expenses for the forum, including room and board, venue, and some activity costs. When Kelly participated, in the early 2000s, the National Committee and its U.S. sponsors covered all of Kelly’s expenses, including but not limited to transportation, room and board, activities, conference fees, and entry fees for all Young Leaders Forum fellows, Weed said. The events Kelly attended were not ""paid for by China,"" Weed said. The National Committee interacted with the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs for administrative purposes, in order to conduct the program, he said. ""This was for things like receiving permissions and communicating with Chinese citizens,"" Weed said. ""These administrative interactions had no financial part in the program and no funding came from Chinese sources."" Jacob Peters, a spokesman for Kelly’s campaign, noted that Kelly brought an American flag into space in 2001. A 2001 NASA picture shows Kelly and a mission specialist holding a bag of several American flags; a caption for the photo says a U.S. flag recovered from the debris of the World Trade Center after 9/11 was also aboard. (The United States flag is also featured in the uniforms of American astronauts, including Kelly’s.) Peters also said that McSally left out important context as to why Kelly considers the Young Leaders Forum a meaningful life event — at the 2003 function, Kelly met his future wife, Gabrielle Giffords. At the time, Giffords was an Arizona state senator and later became a U.S. congresswoman. McSally said Kelly took to space a ""Chinese communist banner."" This is wrong. Kelly did not take to space a banner of China’s communist government. Kelly took to space a banner made for him commemorating both his space flight and his participation in young leaders conferences in 2003, 2004, and 2005. A U.S. flag was also on board. The annual Young Leaders Forum is organized by a U.S. group that seeks to bring together young American and Chinese professionals, so they better understand each other’s country.  The National Committee on U.S.-China Relations said China did not pay for Kelly’s participation, and that the U.S. organization’s interaction with a Chinese institute was only for administrative purposes.

Biden’s income sources aren’t such a big mystery
","When Joe Biden left office in early 2017 after four years as vice president, his finances reflected the salary he earned as a longtime public servant. He and his wife, Jill, a teacher and professor, reported adjusted gross income of just under $400,000 on their joint tax return form in 2016. In the years that followed, though, their adjusted gross income ballooned: to about $11 million in 2017, plus another $5.6 million over 2018 and 2019. The change intrigued social media users. One Facebook post says, ""Joe & Jill Biden’s income went from $396,456 in 2016, to $16,596,979 in 2017-2019. Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s among several posts that have tried to raise questions about the sources of the Bidens’ wealth. The post compares a one-year income figure to a combined three years, inflating the difference somewhat. But the figures themselves are right on the money: The Bidens reported earning $396,456 in 2016 and a total of $16,596,979 from 2017 to 2019 — which includes $11,031,309 in 2017; $4,580,437 in 2018; and $985,233 in 2019. But the big mystery postulated in the claim — ""Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?"" — is not such a big mystery. Many of the answers are detailed in the tax documents the Bidens have made public, which make clear that their big income gain for those years came mostly from fees for speaking engagements and book deals. Most of Joe Biden’s paid speeches from late 2017 through mid-2018 were part of a tour promoting his November 2017 book ""Promise Me, Dad,"" a New York Times bestseller about the loss of his son Beau to brain cancer.  Biden’s book-tour events brought income ranging from a low of $8,000 to one ""VIP experience"" that commanded nearly $235,000 and included preferential seating and a reception, according to his presidential financial disclosure form. Biden earned a total of $1.8 million from 30 book tour events, based on the disclosure. The book sold more than 300,000 copies, Forbes reported.  ""Promise Me, Dad"" was part of a deal Biden struck with Flatiron Books to write two non-fiction works as well as a third book with Jill Biden, according to Publishers Weekly, which reported that the three-book deal was worth $8 million. Besides his book tour, Biden participated in events such as the MPSF Speaker Series in California, where he delivered four speeches around the state for a total of about $500,000, according to the financial disclosure. From late 2017 through July 2019, he had 19 speaking engagements that earned him a total of $2.4 million, the disclosure says. The Bidens’ sources of income from 2017 through summer 2019 also included Jill Biden’s speaking engagements, which brought in about $700,000, and Joe Biden’s job as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, which paid an annual salary of $540,484, according to the disclosure.  The money the Bidens earned from book deals and speaking engagements was routed through two S corporations they formed, CelticCapri Corp. and Giacoppa Corp. In his 2019 presidential financial disclosure form, Joe Biden lists $425,000 in salary and $2.8 million in a distributive share from CelticCapri. A Facebook post says Joe and Jill Biden’s income jumped from $396,456 in 2016 to a combined $16,596,979 in 2017-2019, and asks ""Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?""

The Biden campaign logo does not pay homage to a Chinese socialist slogan
","For months, President Donald Trump and his allies have falsely accused Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden of being a socialist. They’ve also attacked Biden for his son’s ties to China. Some Facebook users say they can prove Biden’s affinity for China — look no further than his campaign logo, they say. ""Ever wonder why the E in the Biden poster is 3 red stripes. It has a meaning,"" says an Oct. 20 post. ""Click the Wikipedia link below to see. Coincidence? I don’t think so!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found hundreds of similar posts using CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool — several of which point back to an Oct. 20 post on Gab, a right-wing social media platform. We took the bait and researched ""three red banners."" It has nothing to do with the Biden campaign. The phrase is an ideological slogan that was used in China during the late 1950s. The ""three red banners"" referred to three aspects of Chinese socialism: the Great Leap Forward, the General Line and the People’s Commune. ""The purpose of the slogan ‘Three Red Banners’ was to help make China a strong and prosperous country in the shortest possible period by building ‘socialism with Chinese characteristics,’ that is, by avoiding certain limitations built into other nations’ experiments with communist/socialist models,"" wrote X.L. Woo in ""Two Republics in China: How Imperial China Became the PRC."" Facebook users say the three red stripes that make up the ""E"" in Biden’s name in his campaign logo refer to this decades-old Chinese socialist slogan, which Woo wrote ""ended in failure."" Biden’s campaign says otherwise. ""The three red lines were inspired by the American flag, the red stripes on the American flag,"" a Biden campaign spokesperson told PolitiFact. The rest of the Biden campaign’s logo is blue and white, alluding to the other colors of the flag. We could find no other evidence that the three red stripes are intended to pay homage to China.

Joe Biden did not say he would wait till after election to “let you know what I stand for”
","Joe Biden has been dodging questions about whether he is open to court packing, or expanding the number of justices on the Supreme Court. On Oct. 13, the Democratic presidential nominee said he is not a fan of the strategy. In a town hall two days later, he said he would give his position only after seeing how the confirmation process now under way for Judge Amy Coney Barrett is handled.  Social media posts suggest, though, that Biden will not say what he stands for on any issue until after the election. One Facebook post says, ""Biden said, ‘The day after I’m elected I will let you know what I stand for, bc if I tell you now it will be all over the news’ ???? Did he really just say this??"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because Biden did not say this. The purported quote is a distortion of comments he made about whether he would support packing the court. Biden has outlined his positions on a wide range of other issues. The basis of the Facebook claim appears to be a comment Biden made at a campaign stop in Phoenix on Oct. 8.  When asked about the Supreme Court, Biden replied, ""You’ll know my opinion on court packing when the election is over. Now look, I know, it’s a great question, and I don’t blame you for asking. But you know the moment I answer that question, the headline in every one of your papers will be about that ... other than focusing on what’s happening now,"" a reference to the Barrett nomination proceedings. (The comment begins at the 47-second mark in this video.) Biden has since pivoted and said he will declare a position on expanding the Supreme Court prior to Election Day, based on the handling of the Barrett nomination. In a portion of a ""60 Minutes"" interview released Oct. 22, Biden proposed creating a bipartisan group of constitutional scholars who would study this and other court issues. President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have sought to have Barrett confirmed and seated before the election, while Democrats wanted the president and Senate to wait until the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election is known. A Facebook post says Biden said, ""‘The day after I’m elected I will let you know what I stand for, bc if I tell you now it will be all over the news."" Biden did not say this, and the quote does not accurately reflect his position. It’s a distortion of statements he has made about when he will state his view on whether to expand the Supreme Court.

No evidence that California sent 440,000 Nov. 3 ballots to ineligible voters
","A post on Instagram with the word FRAUD emblazoned at the top makes this statement: ""Voter fraud? California sends 440,000 ballots to ineligible voters."" President Donald Trump seized on the claim on Twitter, exclaiming: ""Rigged Election!"" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  An analysis that the post relies on does not cite any evidence of fraud or rigging. And while it suggests some voter registrations may be out of date, it doesn’t show that 440,000 on the registered voter list are ineligible to vote. Citing the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered that ballots for the Nov. 3 general election be mailed to all registered California voters. About 21 million ballots were sent in early October. The analysis cited in the Instagram post was done by Election Integrity Project California, a watchdog group that scrutinizes voter registration records. The analysis is detailed in an Oct. 17 letter to the California Secretary of State’s Office. The letter says the project’s review of California voter registration files as of Aug. 18 found that the vast majority of the 440,000 — 416,633 people — were registered on or before Nov. 4, 2008, and have not voted or updated their registrations since then. The letter concludes that those voters have ""likely"" died or moved. But if the group’s numbers are correct, it means only that those people haven’t voted in recent elections and haven’t changed addresses within California — not that they are ineligible to vote. How many of those people might be ineligible has not been established.  In the past several presidential elections, about 20% to 25% of registered California voters did not cast a ballot, according to data compiled by the California Secretary of State’s office, and participation tends to be far lower in other elections. The 416,633 voters cited by the analysis account for about 2% of California’s roughly 21 million registered voters. The analysis also said that another 3,342 names match a state Death Index record; and 19,802 people who appear to be registered twice and ""likely"" were mailed two ballots. Michael Wexler, an attorney for the Election Integrity Project California, told PolitiFact that the Instagram post’s use of the word ineligible ""reasonably comprises the names of voters who are deceased (hence no longer eligible to vote anywhere) or no longer reside at the registration address (hence not eligible to vote there)."" The letter is essentially a new version of an April 28 letter that used a slightly higher number, 458,895. Here’s what we found when we reviewed the earlier letter: Election officials acknowledge that some ballots are mailed erroneously to ineligible voters, given the lag time between a voter moving or dying and the receipt of official notices. Ongoing maintenance of voter rolls includes updates of death records from the Department of Public Health weekly and change-of-address information from the Division of Motor Vehicles daily. So election experts said they strongly doubt so many ballots would go to Californians who died or moved.  Justin Levitt, associate dean for research at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, where he teaches constitutional law with a focus on election administration, said: ""Even if there are some registration records that are not perfectly accurate, that does not mean that they will be used to cast ballots that are counted. There are plenty of other safeguards in the process to make sure that individual ballots are not counted if they happen to be cast on behalf of people who have died or moved, including a signature-matching system that is rather vigorous."" A post on Instagram claims that California sends 440,000 ballots to ineligible voters, and raises the specter of voter fraud. The analysis that the post is based on cites no evidence of fraud and provides no evidence that California sent 440,000 ballots for the general election to ineligible voters.

Does Forest want to open state aid to 'rich' North Carolina families?
","North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has cast his opponent as a threat to public schools. And in last week’s gubernatorial debate, Cooper said Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest would allow ""rich"" families to use public tax dollars on a private school education. ""What Dan Forest really wants to do with our schools is starve them for funding, then use those tax dollars to help rich people send their kids to private school using vouchers,"" Cooper said. Cooper made a similar claim during a September online forum about education issues. Cooper said Forest ""has one goal for our public schools: Starve them for funding, then use those tax dollars to help rich people send their kids to private schools using vouchers. That’s right. Not only does he support vouchers, but he also wants to take the income limits off.""  Is it true that Forest wants to use tax dollars to help ""rich people"" send their kids to private school? When reached by PolitiFact, Forest didn’t reject that idea. Cooper is talking about Forest’s plan to modify Opportunity Scholarships, which are part of a state government program that offers financial aid to families who want their child to enroll in a participating nonpublic school.  The program has been controversial since its inception in 2013, with opponents saying it takes public dollars and spends them on private schools that may use religious-based curricula. In 2015, the North Carolina Supreme Court supported the program’s constitutionality in a 4-3 decision. Since then, lawmakers have increased the program’s funding while Cooper has proposed phasing out the program. As of now, the grants can be as high as $4,200 per year and they’re only available to low-income families. To receive the full amount under the current plan, a household of four must earn less than $48,470 annually to qualify. We asked the Cooper campaign what he meant when he said Forest would open the program to ""rich"" families. Cooper campaign spokeswoman Liz Doherty said Cooper was referring to Forest’s support for eligibility expansion. Forest made headlines last year when he announced that he supports opening the program to every family in North Carolina.  He has released videos praising the program, pointing to the positive aspects of an evaluation conducted by N.C. State University that said it found test score increases among voucher recipients were ""positive, large, and statistically significant."" Forest’s campaign website says he wants to ""expand the eligibility criteria to allow every family in North Carolina the chance to choose a school that works for them.""  To ensure that poor people get grants before rich people, Forest says he would institute a ""weighted lottery system."" We asked the Forest campaign for more details on how Forest’s lottery system would work. We also asked why Forest believes the scholarships should be available to high-income families. Spokesman Andrew Dunn said the campaign would not be responding. Cooper said Forest wants to use tax dollars ""to help rich people send their kids to private school using vouchers."" Cooper was referring to the fact that Forest has said he wants to make North Carolina’s Opportunity Scholarship program available to ""every family in North Carolina."" That language suggests high-income families could access the funds. However, Forest says he’d implement a weighted lottery system to ensure low-income families have the best chance of accessing funds. It’s unclear how that system would work.  Cooper’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, specifically Forest’s stated intent to give preference to poor families.

Fact-checking Trump’s overblown statement about ballots missing his name
","A theme of President Donald Trump’s final rallies of the 2020 campaign is that ""phony"" ballots are everywhere.  Speaking at a rally in Erie, Pa.,Trump continued his attacks on the integrity of the election and mail-in ballots, saying without specifics ""they have the phony fake ballots all over the place."" ""They're throwing them in the garbage can. Oh, they happen to have the name Trump on them. Isn't that shocking?"" Trump said Oct. 20. ""How about the ones that were printed without my name on it, right? They had everything on it. They had every race, they had everything. You had the Senate, you had everything, they forgot to put me down."" We contacted the Trump campaign about ballots without his name and did not get a response. It’s possible that Trump was referring to faulty ballots in one precinct in Los Angeles, which he talked about on Twitter and in an Oct. 8 interview on Fox News. On Oct. 5, Los Angeles elections officials learned that a small percentage of mail ballots omitted the presidential race entirely. That meant that it wasn’t only Trump’s name that was missing, but also Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The faulty ballots were mailed to a single precinct of just over 2,100 voters out of a total of more than 5.6 million registered voters in the county, according to an Oct. 5 statement by the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk. The affected voters in Woodland Hills were contacted via roboball and email and the county sent them new ballots. As of Oct. 21, there were no additional reports of ballots elsewhere omitting the presidential race, Mike Sanchez, a spokesperson for the elections office, told us. His office attributed the faulty ballots to a printing error. The voters who were sent a corrected ballot will only be allowed to vote once. The return envelopes have a bar code with the identification for each voter so that election officials can log in that the person cast a ballot, preventing a second ballot from the same voter being counted. On Sept. 17,  Trump tweeted about another ballot screw up, that time in Michigan. The ballot omitted Vice President Mike Pence’s name and made it appear as if Trump was running with Jeremy Cohen, who is a Libertarian candidate.  Trump said it was deliberate, but the secretary of state called it a misprint. About 400 ballots were downloaded by local election clerks with candidates for vice president listed incorrectly, said Tracy Wimmer, spokesperson for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. The error happened when clerks were downloading the ballots for military and overseas voters. Wimmer told PolitiFact that the problem was resolved within a few hours.  ""The misprint was the result of an isolated human error, and it would not happen again,"" Wimmer told PolitiFact. ""We do not know how many of these ballots were sent to voters, but clerks were instructed to immediately alert voters of the error and send a corrected ballot. Voters who use the incorrect ballot instead of corrected ballots will still have their vote counted."" As of Oct. 19, of the nearly 3 million ballots requested in Michigan, 1.5 million have already been returned. In his Erie rally, Trump also commented about ballots thrown in the trash. A New Jersey mail carrier was charged by federal prosecutors who said he discarded 1,875 pieces of mail including 99 ballots.  In Luzerne County, Pa., news reports stated that an election worker discarded nine military ballots in September. Election officials said that sometimes military ballots arrive inside envelopes that do not clearly mark them as ballots, and there was confusion. Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said it was an error.  RELATED: Trump whiffs describing Wisconsin ballot case Trump said ""phony"" ballots ""were printed without my name on it."" We found an instance of about 2,000 ballots sent to a single precinct in Los Angeles that skipped the presidential race entirely — not just his name, but Biden’s and the other candidates, too. The county quickly replaced those faulty ballots.  Errors are not evidence of a conspiracy to favor one candidate or commit fraud.

Trump campaign ad takes Biden out of context three times on taxes
","An ad from President Donald Trump’s campaign takes former Vice President Joe Biden out of context three times, falsely claiming that Biden repeatedly told voters he plans to raise their taxes. The 30-second ad deceptively edits remarks that Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, made at separate campaign events in South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio, omitting critical context in each case that would leave a different impression about what he said. ""An economy in ruins,"" the ad concludes. ""That's what Joe Biden's tax increase means for you."" The ad ran on TV as recently as Oct. 21. It resembles a similar spot released Sept. 16, which also cut Biden’s South Carolina remarks out of context and made claims about his tax plan.  But Biden and his campaign have been clear throughout the campaign that he intends to focus any direct tax increases on the wealthiest people and corporations. Biden has repeatedly pledged to avoid raising taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 per year. Independent tax analysts who assessed Biden’s plan in the spring and summer of 2020 agreed that it does not call for direct tax increases on anyone below that threshold. Some lower earners could see small hits to their after-tax incomes due to the indirect effects of Biden’s proposed increase to the corporate tax rate, the early tax analyses said. But the highest earners and corporations would be hit hardest under Biden’s proposals, which include: Increasing the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Raising the top federal marginal income tax rate for individuals to 39.6%. Placing a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on incomes above $400,000. Taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners. Several of the same tax groups have since updated their analyses to incorporate a number of tax credits Biden has proposed that would target middle-class and lower earners.  The updated reports from the Tax Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, Tax Policy Center and Penn Wharton Budget Model show Biden’s plan bringing in smaller overall tax revenues, because of the tax credits, than original estimates assumed.  The updated analyses also show the tax credits offsetting the indirect effects facing lower earners as a result of the increased corporate tax rate in the first year under Biden’s plan.  The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Here’s a look at how the ad presents Biden’s words out of context: How the ad quotes Biden: ""If you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut."" The missing context: This quote is from a Feb. 27 campaign event in Conway, South Carolina. The Trump campaign ad gives the misleading impression that Biden told the crowd he plans on raising taxes on all Americans if elected president. But that’s not what he said. The full context shows Biden was addressing one person who indicated moments earlier that he or she had benefited from the tax bill that became law under Trump. The ad cuts out the part of the clip where Biden specified that taxes would be raised ""if you benefited from that."" ""Well, you did. Well that’s good. I’m glad to see you’re doing well already,"" Biden said, directly addressing that person in the audience. ""But guess what, if you elect me, your taxes are going to be raised, not cut, if you benefited from that.""  How the ad quotes Biden: ""And here’s how it works. I’m going to raise taxes."" The missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 10 campaign event in Erie, Pa. The Trump campaign ad cuts Biden’s remarks short, leaving out the ensuing lines in which Biden specified that his tax plan would only raise taxes for corporations and the highest earners. The full context shows Biden was talking about his plan to spur job growth and an economic recovery from the recession brought on by the pandemic. ""And here’s how it works. I’m going to raise taxes,"" Biden said. ""I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand. But you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay their fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay.""  How the ad quotes Biden: ""You’re going to get a tax raise."" The missing context: This quote is from an Oct. 12 campaign event in Toledo, Ohio. The Trump campaign ad again omits key portions of Biden’s remarks. The full context shows he was talking about raising taxes on people with taxable incomes over $400,000 per year. ""I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year,"" Biden said. ""If you make more than 400, beep your horn, because you’re going to get a tax raise. Well, I’m going to raise your tax slightly, if you’re making over 400. But look, you’re not going to pay a penny more. In fact, tens of millions of middle-class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most. Raising their kids, trying to get affordable healthcare, buying their first home, or saving for retirement. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share. I’m going to raise back the tax cut he gave for corporate America.""  A Trump campaign ad claims Biden repeatedly told Americans he's going to raise their taxes.  That’s not what Biden actually said in the three clips highlighted in the ad, which were edited to pluck specific comments out of context. And it’s not what Biden’s tax plan would do, either. Biden and his campaign have repeatedly said his tax plan does not call for direct tax increases on anyone making less than $400,000 per year.
