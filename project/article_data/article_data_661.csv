Rhode Island state Sen. Nicholas Kettle says that states with right-to-work laws don’t run deficits and have better business climates than other states.
","
State Sen. Nicholas D. Kettle wants Rhode Island to become the first ""right-to-work"" state in the Northeast -- a place where workers in union jobs could choose to opt out of union membership and paying dues.

The freshman Republican from Coventry has introduced one piece of legislation that would make union membership optional for teachers and another that would put a non-binding referendum on November’s ballot asking voters to support a right-to-work law for all people in Rhode Island.

On Jan. 27, he appeared on WHJJ’s ""The Helen Glover Show"" to talk about the bills.

""If Rhode Island became a right-to-work state in general, that would be a huge magnet to draw business here,"" said Glover. ""It would certainly do a lot to move us out of that ‘worst place to do business’ that apparently everybody knows about.""

""Absolutely, and you don’t have to look very far for what works,"" Kettle responded. ""If you look at states that are right to work, they constantly do not have budget deficits and they have very good business climates. So Rhode Island just needs to a pass a right-to-work law and that would help out this state tremendously, along with other legislation that needs to occur to help out the business community.""

Other fact-checking organizations, including PolitiFact National, have looked into similar statements that connected right-to-work laws to economic benefits, including higher job creation and lower unemployment rates. Although they found proof of a correlation, they could not prove causation.

Kettle pointed to two different indicators of fiscal health in right-to-work states: a lack of budget deficits and good business climates.

For the first, he referred us to a report on past, current and projected budget deficits from the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. He also gave us a list of right-to-work states compiled by the nonprofit National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, of Springfield, Va.

Twenty-three states have enacted right-to-work laws since 1947 when passage of the federal Taft-Hartley Act first allowed them to do so. Indiana was the most recent state to join the list -- and the first since Oklahoma in 2001 -- after Gov. Mitch Daniels signed right-to-work legislation on Jan. 31, 2012.

For this analysis, however, we are not including Indiana as a right-to-work state because the most recent economic data available predates the signing of the legislation.

So to be clear, the right-to-work states we’re examining are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. That’s 22 in all.

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which compiled figures for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 45 states were facing budget deficits for the 2012 fiscal year. Nineteen of them are right-to-work states. As of Jan. 9, most states had closed their shortfalls, but seven, including one right-to-work state, were still facing mid year gaps.

For the 2013 fiscal year, 29 states are facing shortfalls. Eight right-to-work states are on the list.

Because Kettle said that right-to-work states ""constantly,"" or consistently, do not have deficits, we looked at the three most recent years, too. For 2009, 2010 and 2011, nearly all of the so-called ""union"" states and the right-to-work states had projected deficits.

It’s clear from the data that few states -- whether right-to-work or states that require workers to pay dues to the unions that represent them -- have escaped financial hardship during the recession.

For the second part of Kettle’s claim -- that right-to-work states have good business climates -- he directed us to a Wall Street Journal commentary published last year in which Harvard economist Robert Barro said, ""There is evidence that right-to-work laws -- or, more broadly, the pro-business policies offered by right-to-work states -- matter for economic growth.""

Barro cited a 1997 study that compared employment in counties close with the border between states with and without right-to-work laws.

The 1997 study, done by University of Minnesota economist Thomas J. Holmes summarizes overall job growth in states with and without right-to-work laws.

""Manufacturing employment in the states without right-to-work laws is virtually the same now as it was in 1947, but manufacturing employment has increased 150 percent in the right-to-work states,"" he wrote. ""Of the 10 states with the highest manufacturing employment growth rates, 8 are right-to-work states; of the 10 states with the lowest growth rates, none is a right-to-work state.""

In his more localized research, Holmes  found that from 1947 to 1992, in areas within 25 miles of the state borders he looked at, manufacturing job growth was 26 percentage points higher in right-to-work states than in union states.

But Holmes was not able to pinpoint right-to-work laws as the reason for the difference.

""First, the results do not say which policies matter,"" he wrote. ""Right-to-work states historically have pursued a number of other smokestack-chasing policies, such as low taxes, aggressive subsidies, and even, in some cases, lax environmental regulations. Thus, my results do not say that it is right-to-work laws that matter, but rather that the ‘pro-business package’ offered by right-to-work states seems to matter.""

Because Kettle used the words ""business climate,"" we also decided to look at indexes that rank states in that particular area. We considered the most recent rankings done by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, CNBC, Forbes and the Tax Foundation. The majority of the states at the top of those rankings have right-to-work laws and the majority at the bottom do not.

We also contacted Joseph A. McCartin, a Georgetown history professor who is an expert on the history of labor and opposes right-to-work laws. He pointed to a study by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute that showed that despite passage of a right-to-work law in Oklahoma in 2001, its unemployment rate has increased at about the same rate as six of its neighbors, all union states, over the last decade.

The only study we found that attempted to isolate the effects of right-to-work laws is a working paper by economists at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Claremont McKenna College. The authors focused on Idaho and Oklahoma, the two most recent right-to-work states before Indiana. They found evidence of increased manufacturing employment in Idaho due to the adoption of a right-to-work law, but not in Oklahoma.

Our final call was to Edward M. Mazze, distinguished professor of business administration at the University of Rhode Island. He said that low energy costs, low taxes and the presence of a skilled work force are the primary factors in creating a good business climate, not a right-to-work law.

Our ruling

Kettle said not only that right-to-work states do not run deficits, but that they ""constantly"" do not.

But the source he used for this claim clearly shows that since 2009 many right-to-work states have had budget deficits. For 2013, a much smaller share of right-to-work states are facing deficits than union states, but in past years the ratios have been very close.

Clearly, then, this part of the claim is not accurate.

For the second part of the claim -- that business climates are better in right-to-work states -- the research is not as clear. We found one study that found a greater historical increase in manufacturing jobs in select counties in right-to-work states than in neighboring counties in union states.

But the author of that study was emphatic in saying that he could not prove that the increase was due to right-to-work laws. And the author of the Wall Street commentary Kettle cites also says pro-business policies matter for growth, not right-to-work laws specifically.

The same can be said of the multiple business climate indexes we found. They did generally rank right-to-work states higher than union states, but they considered many other factors, including tax policy, that could account for the better rankings.

We could not find any studies to prove Kettle’s claim -- that right-to-work laws lead directly to better business climates.

Overall, we rate Kettle’s statement Mostly False.

"['Oregon', 'Housing', 'Doug Thomas']","
Can you really get a home near Oswego Lake for less than $150,000?
","
A fight over just who should have access to the waters of Oswego Lake is always simmering. Some say the lake belongs to the whole community and needs to be public. Others are coming down on the side of leaving access where it is now, largely with those who live on the lake or have access through easements.

In defense of the status quo, Doug Thomas, president of the board of directors for the Lake Oswego Corporation (the organization that manages the lake) had this to say: ""Every 10 years or so, someone makes a challenge as to why everyone and anyone can’t come into the lake … But the shareholders built this lake and have maintained it for over a hundred years. Why would we let everyone have access to our backyards?""

Then he added an important dimension to the debate, telling The Oregonian that ""We’re not exclusive. There are homes for sale on and around the lake right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy.""

We might be a little out of touch, but ""exclusive"" is, in fact, one of the first words that comes to mind when we think about Lake Oswego. Generally speaking, the city carries a reputation as an upscale community for those who take home more than most. It seemed to us that $150,000 for a home in the area was a stretch -- let alone a home that sits on or near the lake.

We couldn’t help ourselves; we had to check his claim.

Our first call was to the Clackamas County assessor’s office. Lynn Longfellow, a sales analyst there, admitted to having heard something about Thomas’ comment earlier. She was similarly confused. She guessed there might be some condos with access to the lake for under $150,000, but she doubted there was anything on the lake for that price.

The cheapest she could remember a house on the lake going for was $300,000 -- a short sale with some slide issues. ""I can’t imagine anything (else) on the lake selling for $300,000,"" she said. Let alone $150,000.

Still, she was kind enough to run us last year’s sales data, so we could take a closer look for ourselves.

As far as waterfront property goes -- that means canals and the lake itself -- the cheapest sale documented was for just over $500,000. If you’re talking Lake Oswego and Lake Grove generally, six homes went for less than $150,000. None of them looked as though they’d be in areas with easement rights -- though we can’t say for certain as the map on the Lake Corp. website isn’t definitive.

If you take a look at condos specifically, things look a little more promising. About 44 condos in the whole of Lake Oswego -- half of those listed -- went for less than $150,000. Few of them were in the estimated easement areas, but we did find a couple, including one in Lake Grove that went for just over $100,000.

To put that figure in a little bit of context, though, of the 580 stand-alone homes sold in the area last year -- and the figures aren’t completely final -- six sold for less than $150,000, while more than 200 sold for $500,000 or higher.

To check the current market, which seemed to be Thomas’ focus, we pulled up current listings in the area on the Windemere Real Estate website. First we searched for strictly waterfront properties under $150,000. Not a single one came up. When we left the waterfront part out, 20 properties popped up, about five of which appeared to be close enough to potentially have lake access via an easement -- though we can’t be sure. Those five properties were all condos. The cheapest listing that explicitly mentioned lake access was for a condo priced at $100,000.

Based on that quick search, it seemed like Thomas might be right as far as homes around the lake go -- so long as you consider a condo a home. But there is still nothing directly on the lake, house or condo, that appears to be available for less than $150,000.

Still, we’re hardly professionals when it comes to real estate, so we phoned Hasson Realtors, an agency that works in the area, for another take.

Bill Marquard, one of the real estate agents with Hasson, was happy to help. He quickly found around 10 condos that were listed for less than $150,000 and would have lake access. Some condos at a property that was formerly an apartment complex even had docks.

""You definitely have condos,"" Marquard said. ""You can get into Lake Oswego and have access to the lake for definitely under $150,000."" But as for stand-alone houses, ""I wouldn't say impossible but very, very difficult.

""What's your definition of a home?"" he asked.

Finally, we wanted to talk to Thomas. After all, he’s the one who made the statement we’re ruling on. After repeated phone calls, we finally got him on the line. He said condos are just as much a home as a house and he pointed out the apartments-turned-condos that were going for under $150,000.

""I'm not trying to mislead anybody,"" Thomas said. ""I think everybody always assumes that these properties are expensive.""

So that brings us to our ruling.  Last week, Thomas told the Oregonian that there were ""homes for sale on and around (Oswego Lake) right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy."" So far as we can tell, there’s nothing on the lake, condos or otherwise, that hits that mark. There are some condos with lake access that go for less than $150,000. But that price is hardly the norm.

Those are important details -- and his statement ignores them. We give this a Half True.

"['History', 'Pundits', 'Veterans', 'Texas', ""Lawrence O'Donnell""]","
Lawrence O'Donnell says critics called the original GI Bill welfare
","In a promotional spot for his MSNBC program, Lawrence O’Donnell speaks proudly of his father attending college on the post-World War II benefits package that transformed the nation.

O’Donnell further says of the original GI Bill: ""It’s the most successful educational program that we’ve ever had in this country -- and the critics called it welfare.""

They did? Austin lawyer Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, urged us to check this after seeing the ad in January.

After asking MSNBC to elaborate, we looked for authoritative recaps of how the far-reaching law came to be.

President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, the ""GI Bill of Rights,"" into law in June 1944, according to the Veterans Administration’s online history of the agency. Broadly, the history says, the act provided millions of veterans with up to four years of education or training, plus a monthly subsistence allowance; offered them federally guaranteed home, farm and business loans with no down payment; and provided for unemployment compensation of $20 weekly for up to 52 weeks for veterans who had served 90 days or more.   

The VA’s web post is silent on the act’s progress through Congress -- and any related criticism.

Next, we turned to the American Legion’s online post of a 1949 article by a Washington reporter, David Camelon, recapping the law’s roots. This story says the American Legion drafted the proposal in 1943 and lobbied for it the first part of 1944 -- surprisingly drawing early opposition from other veterans groups, including the Disabled American Veterans.

According to the article, that group’s representative, Millard Rice, sent a Feb. 22, 1944, letter to Walter George, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, objecting to the proposed unemployment benefits. Rice’s letter said, in part: ""The lazy and 'chisely' types of veterans would get the most benefits, whereas the resourceful, industrious and conscientious veterans would get the least benefits, if any."" The article says Rice and others assumed too many veterans would idle for the 52 weeks of unemployment payments.

Despite such critiques, a revised version of the proposal shortly won unanimous Senate approval, according to the article. In the House, though, Rep. John Rankin, chairman of its committee for veterans affairs, had misgivings about the unemployment compensation element.

In his 2009 book, ""Beyond the Bonus March and GI Bill,"" Stephen Ortiz, an assistant professor of history at Binghamton University, says Rankin ""viewed the educational features (of the GI Bill) with skepticism, believing that only a small percentage of already privileged veterans would take advantage of them. Moreover, he treated the unemployment features with outright disdain. An ardent white supremacist, Rankin feared the unemployment provision’s impact on the work habits of the African Americans in his state and region. African Americans would not quickly rejoin the work force, he argued, if they were being paid generous unemployment benefits. Rankin complained further that it would ‘spoil’ them.""

In a telephone interview, Ortiz told us that no critics called the GI Bill ""welfare,"" but some admirers later considered the law a welcome step toward the United States becoming more of a social-welfare state.

Back to our timeline: House committee members sent their version of the legislation to the House, which gave unanimous approval in May 1944, the American Legion story says. A House-Senate conference committee convened to iron out differences between the bodies. By early June 1944, its members had resolved many provisions though, the article says, they broke down seemingly over which agency would oversee veteran job placements, a standoff that the article calls a camouflage for continued uncertainty over the measure’s 52-20 unemployment compensation feature. The impasse ultimately cleared after a Georgia member of  the conference panel flew in overnight to vote for the compromise, the story says.

By email, MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski sent us two batches of excerpts, some attributed to members of Congress as quoted in the 1944 Congressional Record. Many of the excerpts covered objections noted in the American Legion magazine article.

A memo from Melissa Ryerson, a producer of O’Donnell’s program, says some lawmakers and critics also fretted over the GI Bill’s ""broad"" education provisions. The memo also suggests that objections mentioning ""relief"" or ""the dole"" were equivalent to modern-day references to welfare. ""If Mr. O’Donnell had used the word ‘relief’ instead of ‘welfare’"" in the advertisement, the memo says, ""no one would have understood what he meant.""

A sampling of MSNBC’s excerpts:

-- Comments from Rep. Rankin about fearing a ""tremendous inducement to certain elements to try to get employment compensation. It is going to be very easy… to induce these people to get on federal relief."" Another Rankin comment, suggesting the proposal would reward those who delayed seeking work: ""The bane of the British Empire has been the dole system."" He also aired a racist comment, saying: ""If every white serviceman in Mississippi… could read this so-called GI Bill, I don’t believe there would be one in 20 who would approve of it...  We have 50,000 Negroes in the service from our state and in, in my opinion, if the bill should pass in its present form, a vast majority of them would remain unemployed for at least another year, and a great many white men would do the same.""

-- A 1950 Saturday Evening Post article stating: ""The education and training section of the GI Bill became, in reality, a relief act or a bonus act… more than 15 million veterans [were still] entitled to an average of 40 months of schooling at government expense, including subsistence.""

--A comment attributed to Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951: ""Colleges and universities will find themselves converted into educational hobo jungles… [The GI Bill] is a threat to American education [and] education is not a device for coping with mass unemployment.""

We spotted the same comment in a November 2004 commentary on the GI Bill’s origin by writers Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen. Before quoting Hutchins’ ""hobo jungle"" warning, the commentary says: ""Racist politicians opposed provisions of the bill that would ‘put money in the pockets of black vets’ and some elitist educators opposed higher education as a benefit.""

By 1956, the commentary says, the law had helped to produce 450,000 engineers, 238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, 22,000 dentists, and more than 1 million other college-trained men and women. Also, it says, 11 million of 13 million houses built in the 1950s were financed with GI Bill loans.

Ortiz and Nancy Beck Young, a University of Houston historian who has studied the legislative history of the GI Bill, each told us it would be incorrect to say critics called the proposal welfare.

Beck Young told us in a telephone interview that members of Congress were intent on ensuring returning troops did not face the fate of World War I veterans, some of whom marched on Washington only to be ignored and then mistreated. While there were concerns about the unemployment provisions and the measure's overall cost, she said, they ""did not call it welfare. The (congressional) debates were about fine-tuning. Everybody realized something that had to be done; something generous.""

Beck Young cautioned against ""cherry-picked research. It’s not right to say they called it welfare.""

Our ruling

We found no evidence of critics referring to the GI Bill as welfare. Yet some fretted that the law’s unemployment compensation element would encourage laziness. We see a touch of truth to O’Donnell’s claim, which we rate Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/17/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-critics-called-original-gi-/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Paul Sadler']","
Paul Sadler says he and others gave Texas teachers three pay raises and health insurance
","
Facebook was but a gleam in a Harvard student’s eye the last time Paul Sadler held public office. But the former Democratic state legislator embraced the social networking site’s political potential after he declared his candidacy to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison late last year.

And on Jan. 27, 2012, Sadler posted this Facebook update: ""In the time I worked on education issues, we passed 3 pay increases for teachers and provided them with health insurance.""

Teachers got all that in Sadler’s legislative era? We wondered.

Sadler, a lawyer who works with the Wind Coalition energy advocacy group, won election to the Texas House on Nov. 6, 1990. For 12 years, he represented the East Texas district around Henderson, and for eight years he chaired the House Public Education Committee. Also, in 1997 and 2001, he headed committees on taxes and public school financing. During his legislative tenure, he also served on and chaired committees on health insurance for teachers and other education subcommittees.

In response to our inquiry, Sadler campaign spokesman Jeff Rotkoff told us that in 1995, Sadler helped lead an overhaul of state education laws that tied teacher pay hikes to increases in state education aid, which brought raises in 1997 and 1998. And in 1999, Rotkoff said, Sadler sponsored a $3,000-a-year pay raise for teachers.

In 2001, Rotkoff said, Sadler wrote a proposal that created a health insurance program for school employees.

Separately, we confirmed that: 

So, multiple raises accounted for.

And what about Sadler’s claim about ""providing"" teacher health insurance?

In 2001, Sadler authored House Bill 3343, the ""Texas School Employees Uniform Group Health Coverage Act"" (that’s TSEUGHCA, if you speak Gaelic), which was signed into law June 15, 2001. It created the TRS-ActiveCare program, a state-managed insurance pool.

At the time, most districts offered insurance plans to their employees, including teachers, according to an August 2000 TRS study. Texas Education Agency data show teachers made up about half of school employees in 2000.

The TRS study says, though, that only 38 percent of about 535,000 Texas public school employees had coverage comparable to that of state employees. Some 50 percent had insurance that did not compare favorably to state coverage, and 12 percent of employees did not sign up for district-offered coverage, the study says.

Only 350 employees in 17 of the state’s 1,000-plus districts were offered no coverage at all, the study says.

Sadler told us his 2001 proposal was intended both to extend coverage to all school employees and to raise the quality of coverage so that all employees had access to comparable insurance.

According to a 2001 report by the nonpartisan House Research Organization, the 1991 Legislature had directed school districts to give employees coverage equivalent to that of state workers, but the law lacked enforcement provisions.

Gregg told us in interviews that the 2001 TRS-ActiveCare program was created to acquire and administer group insurance from a third party, and the law also gave all teachers $1,000 per year toward its cost. Association of Texas Professional Educators lobbyist Josh Sanderson told us via email that the $1,000 stipend was intended to be an annual payment but was cut to $500 in 2003 for full-time teachers and then, in a 2006 special session, rolled into a $2,500 raise in educators’ pay.

According to a May 2002 guide to the law produced by the Legislative Budget Board, after the first sign-up deadline of Sept. 30, 2001, small districts and other entities employing a total 147,000 people had joined TRS-ActiveCare. Larger districts were added later, though not all chose to participate.

Currently, Texas State Teachers Association spokesman Clay Robison told us by email, all Texas teachers have access to insurance comparable to state employees’. ActiveCare covers more than 445,000 employees and dependents, he said, and 89 percent of eligible districts and similar education entities participate in the program. Austin and Houston are examples of large districts that have their own health plans, he said.

Sadler said that although nearly 40 percent of school employees had comparable coverage before 2001, he believes such accounting doesn’t give an accurate picture of the 2001 law’s impact. He said he didn’t remember the 1991 mandate that districts offer comparable coverage, but it obviously had little effect.

Of his work on teacher pay raises and insurance, Sadler said, ""I know it changed the landscape.""

Teacher lobby groups have hailed Sadler’s advocacy.

In a Dec. 2, 2001, Statesman news story, TSTA director of governmental relations Jay Levin credits Sadler with helping to bring about the 1999 raise of $3,000 and the health insurance program for teachers. Robison told us it’s fair for Sadler to claim credit for the pay raises and insurance initiative because he chaired the public education panel through those years. Gregg likewise said Sadler merits a goodly share of the credit. ""Sadler was the leading proponent for pay increases and later health insurance for educators,"" Gregg said.

Our ruling

Sadler played a pivotal role in ensuring several teacher pay raises and also was key to lawmakers giving school workers including teachers access to insurance benefits equal to those accorded state employees.

However, contrary to Sadler’s Facebook wording, the latter development did not provide teachers with insurance. Nearly every Texas teacher had access to some kind of coverage before the 2001 action. Still, the Sadler-authored change gave every school employee access to insurance equivalent to state workers’ coverage.

We rate Sadler’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/17/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-he-and-others-gave-texas-teachers/
"['Tennessee', 'Congress', 'Wealth', 'John Duncan']","
Congressman Duncan says fewer than 10 percent of U.S. House members are wealthy
","
The wealth of Congress members has long been a sore point with many voters, who rightly or wrongly, often equate power with monetary riches.

The question of who is wealthy – and who isn’t – again became part of the collective discourse with the rise of the Occupy Wall Street movement and its rallying cries against the wealthiest ""1 percent.""

U.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, challenged the notion that Congress is filled with rich fat cats in a Washington Report newsletter to constituents in December 2011. The six-page report, which included the congressman’s update on various legislative matters, was prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense.

""It may be hard for some to believe,"" Duncan wrote, ""but fewer than 10 percent of those in the House are what anyone would classify as wealthy.""

Mark Harmon, a University of Tennessee journalism professor and a former member of the Knox County Commission, challenged the congressman’s claim as erroneous and ""out of touch"" in a guest column published in the Knoxville News Sentinel on Jan. 15, 2012.

The claim sounded suspicious to us, too, so we contacted the congressman’s office and asked how he had reached that conclusion. Duncan’s press spokesman, Patrick Newton, provided us with a statement that the congressman himself had written in response to Harmon’s column.

Duncan, who represents the 2nd Congressional District in East Tennessee, wrote that his comments were based ""in part on personal conversations with many members (of Congress), but primarily on an annual report of the 50 wealthiest members of Congress by Roll Call, a very non-partisan Capitol Hill newspaper.""

""Although there are some members of Congress who are multi-millionaires, money mostly made before they came to Congress, the great, great majority are not, including me,"" said Duncan, who has been in the House for 24 years and served as a state trial judge before he was elected to Congress.

Getting a true reading of a Congress member’s wealth can be difficult, but there are organizations that attempt to ascertain the net worth of elected leaders.

Members of the U.S. House and Senate are paid $174,000 annually; lawmakers who hold leadership positions are paid slightly more. But many members of Congress were wealthy before they arrived in Washington and have substantial net worth.

Members are required to file annual financial statements, but they are allowed to report the value of their assets in broad ranges. For example, if someone owns $1,100 worth of stock in a company, the exact value of that stock is not reported. Instead, its value is listed in the range of $1,001 to $15,000. Lawmakers are not required to list the value of their primary residence.

The purpose of such a reporting system is to provide lawmakers with some financial privacy, while allowing some level of public scrutiny of their income. But Duncan and other lawmakers argue the broad reporting ranges often make lawmakers look much wealthier than they actually are.

Roll Call, a nonpartisan newspaper that focuses on Capitol Hill, analyzes the data and compiles an annual list of the 50 wealthiest members of Congress. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money’s influence on politics, also uses the data to estimate the wealth of all 435 House members and 100 senators.

Even though the two organizations analyze the same data, each uses a different methodology that sometimes causes them to reach different conclusions.

Roll Call calculates a Congress member’s minimum net worth by adding the minimum value of all their assets and subtracting the total minimum value of all their liabilities. The Center for Responsive Politics calculates a member’s net wealth by adding together his or her range of assets and then subtracting his or her range of liabilities. The center then calculates the midpoint of the resulting range and lists that figure as the lawmaker’s net wealth.

We’ll look first at Roll Call’s list of the 50 wealthiest members of Congress, since Duncan said that is the primary basis for his claim that fewer than 10 percent of House members are wealthy.

In its most recent rankings, published Aug. 18, 2011, Roll Call concluded that the net worth of the 50 wealthiest Congress members ranged from a high of $294.21 million (Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas) to a low of $6.21 million (Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas).

Twenty-nine of the lawmakers on the 50 wealthiest list were House members and 21 were senators. If one uses this list as a benchmark for deciding which lawmakers are wealthy, as Duncan apparently did, then just 6 percent of the 435 House members would be considered wealthy.

But is that really a fair measure of wealth? Is $6.21 million – the estimated net worth of the least  affluent member on the 50 wealthiest list – really the cut-off point at which most Americans would consider someone to be wealthy?

Given that the median net wealth for the country at large was $96,000 in 2009, according to the Federal Reserve, we wondered how an economist would define wealthy.

We put that question to Scott Winship, a fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Both institutes are left-leaning think tanks in Washington.

Winship pointed out that Federal Reserve data shows the top 10 percent of wealthiest Americans in 2007 had a net worth of at least $971,000. That equates to roughly $1 million in 2010 dollars, ""so if you want to look at the entry point to the top 10 percent of wealth as your definition of ‘wealthy,’ you can use $1 million as an easy cut-off,"" Winship said.

Bivens, however, suggested a better measure might be the top 5 percent of wealthiest Americans, who had a net wealth of at least $1.8 million in 2007.

When we apply the $1 million benchmark suggested by Winship, it's clear that members are Congress are much wealthier than average Americans.

The Center for Responsive Politics says its analysis of financial disclosure statements, released on Nov. 15, 2011, shows that 250 current members of the House and Senate are millionaires. In the House, 183 members -- or 42 percent -- had an average net worth in excess of $1 million in 2010.

Applying the $1.8 million benchmark suggested by Bivens, the numbers drop, but not by much -- 137 House members, or 31 percent, had an average net worth of at least $1.8 million.

For the record, Duncan says the Center for Responsive Politics’ latest rankings came out after he had finished his newsletter. But he reiterated his belief that using both minimum and maximum figures makes Congress members appear far wealthier than they really are.

We concede that the center’s use of an average range could skew numbers, but 435 is a large enough sample size to conclude that aberrations would balance out -- where one member’s net worth could be exaggerated, another’s could be understated.

Duncan’s net worth, by the way, ranged from $169,022 at the low end, $660,000 on the high end and the mid-range estimate hitting $414,511. And, again, the numbers do not include the value of a member’s primary residence.

Our ruling

While it is difficult to get an exact measure of congressional riches, House and Senate members are clearly much better off financially than the average American. Roughly one-third of House members, or 31 percent, have an average net worth not including their primary residence of at least $1.8 million, putting them among the 5 percent of wealthiest Americans.  Even more, 42 percent, have a net worth in excess of $1 million.

Under either measure, Duncan’s claim that fewer than 10 percent of House members are wealthy is way off base. We rate this claim False.

Did Elizabeth Ames Jones flip-flop on resigning?
","
Elizabeth Ames Jones’ resignation from the Texas Railroad Commission on Feb. 13, 2012, came weeks after state Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio began claiming that she was violating the Texas Constitution by remaining in her post while also running against him. 
A day after she resigned, Austin American-Statesman reporter Jason Embry on Twitter pointed to a January 2011 blog post he wrote in which Jones is quoted as saying that she would ""never"" leave her post on the commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas. 
We put Jones’ change of heart to our Flip-O-Meter. 
Embry’s Jan. 25, 2011, blog post was written as Jones was traveling the state to announce her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after this year. The post quotes Jones as saying outside the Texas Capitol: ""The days of backroom deals, secret earmarks, wasteful pork-barrel spending will come to a screeching halt when I am elected."" 
According to the post, Jones also said she would not resign her commission seat to concentrate on her campaign, though she wouldn’t seek re-election in 2012. Next, the post points out that Michael Williams, then Jones’ colleague on the commission and an expected Senate candidate, had already announced his resignation from the three-person commission, effective April 2, 2011. 
""I would never leave my post,"" Jones was quoted as saying. 
The Quorum Report’s Texas Energy Report included the same ""never"" statement from Jones in its story about her Austin campaign stop. ""She’s not following colleague and fellow hopeful Michael Williams’ lead by resigning her seat on the three-member panel,"" says the story, before quoting Jones as saying she would ""never"" leave her post. 
About nine months later, Jones switched races, jumping into the Republican primary contest against Wentworth for this state Senate seat. Fourteen weeks after that, she quit the commission. 
We searched — on the Internet and in newspaper archives — and talked to representatives of the Wentworth and Jones campaigns for evidence that Jones had otherwise vowed not to leave the commission. We found no additional ""never"" proclamations from Jones, though the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Dallas Morning News reported her saying during her January 2011 announcement tour that she would not resign from the commission. 
On Dec. 9, 2011, Wentworth, who faces Jones and Donna Campbell of New Braunfels for the Republican nomination, issued a statement suggesting that Jones could not legally fulfill a constitutional requirement that statewide elected officials live in the capital and also qualify as a resident of the San Antonio-rooted Senate district. Jones disputed his analysis, saying she had legal advice indicating that she could continue on the commission while pursuing the Senate seat. 
In a statement announcing her resignation, Jones noted that she had tried to resolve the legal dispute by asking Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott ""to issue an opinion vindicating my right to finish my term on the Texas Railroad Commission."" However, her statement suggested, that hope was dashed by a Feb. 6, 2012, lawsuit, which sought to stop Jones from receiving her state paycheck. She said any such suit would prevent the attorney general from issuing an opinion until its resolution. 
As we closed out this look, we asked Jones for an interview. She wasn’t immediately available. 
In an earlier telephone interview, Jones’ political consultant, Todd Olsen, argued that Jones had not flip-flopped by resigning from the commission after previously saying she would not quit it. 
Olsen noted that Jones’ January 2011 comment that she would ""never leave"" her post was made when she was running for a different office and under different circumstances. Olsen said that Jones spoke after Williams had announced his resignation and that if she had followed suit, the Railroad Commission would have been left inoperable with only one commissioner (until the governor named a replacement). 
Olsen also noted that Jones clearly could not have been speaking to whether she’d stay on the commission while running for the Texas Senate. 
Another facet, in Olsen’s view: In late 2010 and early 2011, lawmakers were discussing how to restructure the Railroad Commission, possibly reducing it to a single position from three, a proposal that Jones did not support. Olsen speculated that if the question Jones was answering related to that possible shrinkage, Jones would make the same ""never"" vow today. 
Our ruling 
Jones initially said she would never leave her post, meaning resign. She later did so, nearly 11 months before the term ends. 
It’s believable that the commission’s circumstances and other factors changed in the intervening year. Regardless, Jones’ resignation after saying she’d ""never"" quit the commission amounts to a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2012/feb/17/elizabeth-ames-jones/did-elizabeth-ames-jones-flip-flop-resigning/

Rick Scott says he will repeal 1,000 regulations in 2012
","
Gov. Rick Scott really doesn't like regulations, and he's been pretty clear about that since his first day in office. This year, he says he's got 1,000 regulations in his sights. 
""My administration eliminated burdensome regulations to make it easier to do business in Florida,"" he said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C. on Feb. 11, 2012. 
""And we're poised to get rid of over 1,000 more regulations in 2012,"" he added. 
His statement left the audience applauding and us wanting to know more. Is that repeal count right?

In his first executive order Jan. 4, 2011, Scott ordered state agencies to freeze all pending administrative rules -- developed with permission from the Legislature by agencies to implement state law -- and examine existing ones that could be ripe for repeal.

His campaign against rules also made the first year in office more complicated. In a brush with the Florida Supreme Court, a majority of justices argued Scott overstepped his constitutional authority by requiring a newly created office to sign off on proposed agency rules. 
The court didn't overturn his order, so Scott's three-person team of reviewers -- known as the Office of Fiscal Accountability and Regulatory Reform -- continued to analyze and issue recommendations on these rules and existing rules. Rules cover a lot of ground, including education, environment, elections, restaurants, barbering, interior design, real estate ... you get the point. One target was a rule related to the illegal act of dwarf-tossing, a September 2011 Tampa Bay Times story reported. 
A total of more than 20,000 rules are in the Florida Administrative Code. 
Scott's rule-reviewing office keeps track of these efforts at FloridaHasARightToKnow.com. You can see here how many rules have been identified for repeal. At one point that was above 1,000, but it's now around 800. 
There's no tally for how many of those have been wiped from the books (unless you look up each rule and cross-check it at www.flrules.org). So we asked Scott's staff to tally how many rules have been repealed and how many were ""poised"" for repeal.

Since June 1, 2011, agencies have repealed 478 rules, said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz, with 173 being repealed in 2011, and 305 so far in 2012.

Plus, 351 rules are progressing through the necessary procedure for repeal as set in the Administrative Procedure Act, involving notices, waiting periods and opportunities for public comment.

Another 270 rules, relating primarily to water management districts, could be repealed during the 2012 legislative session.

For 2012, that's 926 rules (305+350+270) that have been or are slated for repeal.

Wait, there's more! Scott's not the only leader with rules on his mind. Florida legislators embarked on their own mission, ordering agencies in 2011 to review the economic impact of their rules and present biennial reports.

Combining the efforts of Scott and the House gives you a bigger number: 2,210 rules and rule subsections recommended for repeal, and 1,624 recommended for revisions, according to a Feb. 13, 2012, House staff report. Most of the rules came from the departments of Environmental Protection, Health, and Business and Professional Regulation. 
We should be clear that we're not passing judgement on the public good of getting rid of these various rules. Frankly, the rules are too diverse to make sweeping judgments about them, and some simply wipe out rules that accompany outdated, and meaningless, statutes.  
Instead, we wanted to to see if Scott was accurately describing the magnitude of the changes he's pushing through. Scott is proud of his focus on eliminating state rules (even bragging about it on pre-recorded messages to callers of the governor's office placed on hold). We looked at the numbers and saw he's around where he said he would be, at 926 rules set to be repealed. But a good chunk -- 270 -- would come with the help of the Legislature. We rate this Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2012/feb/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-will-repeal-1000-regulations-2012/

Gov. Scott Walker says $247,000-per-job CAPCO program was approved by former Gov. Jim Doyle
","
Issue No. 1 in Madison: Jobs.

Gov. Scott Walker and lawmakers of both parties say the state should be doing more, with much debate centered on proposals to boost companies poised for rapid growth.

The idea is for the state to use millions of dollars to ""seed"" venture capital funds -- pools of money that are invested in young firms with high growth potential. But legislation has been bogged down by a debate over whether or not to use state certificated capital companies, or CAPCOs, to handle the investments.

A previous $50 million program, which ran from 1999 through 2008, used three out-of-state CAPCO firms and had disappointing results. A Journal Sentinel analysis determined it resulted in the creation of only 202 new jobs at a cost of $247,000 per job. The Feb. 12, 2012 story said the program was the result of poorly drafted legislation and had minimal state oversight.

The headline: ""State spent millions for 202 jobs.""

Facing a near-certain recall election, Walker that day used his Twitter account to highlight the story as a failure of the previous administration, that of Democrat Jim Doyle. (Other tweets included the fact he stopped for ham and rolls after church.)

His tweet: ""Headline ‘State spends millions for 202 jobs’, missed rest of sentence:, ‘under program approved by Gov Doyle.’""

In other words, the poor performing program was created under Doyle. And that’s where the blame should fall, Walker says.

Did Doyle approve the plan?

The legislation creating the program was introduced in 1997 and passed and signed into law the following year -- not by Democrat Doyle, but by then-Gov. Tommy Thompson, a fellow Republican now running for a U.S. Senate vacancy.

Doyle didn’t take office until 2003, five years after the CAPCO bill was signed.

Indeed, the proposal had bipartisan support. It was authored by Democratic state Sen. Gwen Moore, now a congresswoman from Milwaukee. Among the 89 members of the state Assembly who voted in favor of the bill March 25, 1998: Walker himself.

Walker’s tweet gained a broader audience the following day. WTMJ radio talk show host Charlie Sykes picked up on the topic and in a three minute segment linked Doyle to the CAPCO program five times. He called it ""a Jim Doyle idea,"" and said the program was ""one of Jim Doyle’s signature venture capital bills.""

In an email, Sykes acknowledged that the program was created under Thompson. And he pointed out that Walker had tweeted on the subject the day before.

We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to explain the tweet, but he didn’t respond.

Our conclusion

In the wake of a story about poor jobs results of a state-sponsored program, Walker sought to pin the blame on his predecessor, Jim Doyle. But he was off by five years, two governors -- Thompson and successor Scott McCallum -- and one political party.

As governor, Doyle didn’t have anything to do with approving the CAPCO bill. But as an Assembly member, Scott Walker did. Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2012/feb/17/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-247000-job-capco-program-was/

Rob Portman says unemployment would be 10 percent if entire workforce were considered
","
Economists view unemployment data that the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases each month as a way to gauge whether the nation is shaking off the effects of the recession that’s hindered U.S. growth since December 2007.

Politicians use those statistics to claim credit for economic healing, or blame rivals for failing to get the job done. Falling unemployment rates are seen as beneficial to President Barack Obama’s re-election prospects, so Republicans have been eager to minimize recent unemployment reductions.

When the BLS released reported that unemployment dipped to 8.3 percent in January 2012 - the lowest rate in nearly three years - Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, greeted the news with a statement that claimed the BLS measurements neglected other data that would reveal higher unemployment.

""It’s good to see that there has been some improvement in the unemployment rate and that people are starting to get back to work,"" Portman said. ""However, this doesn’t take into account the 3-million-person reduction in labor force participation compared to pre-recession levels. If those people were still counted within the labor force, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, which is a more accurate gauge of the current jobs environment.""

PolitiFact Ohio asked Portman where he got his statistics and why he believes they’re more accurate than the more-commonly used official unemployment estimates.

His office said that the official unemployment rate measures only people actively seeking jobs. It doesn’t account for people who have quit their search for employment and found something else to do, like staying home with their children or going back to school.

Portman’s office attributes much of a drop that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has observed in the nation’s labor force participation rate to people who have dropped out of the workforce in this fashion but would prefer to have jobs. The labor force participation rate fell to 63.7 percent last month, down from 66 percent when the recession began in December 2007.

That change is important for Portman’s calculations. His staff walked us through the math.

If the labor force participation were still at 66 percent, civilian workforce would be around 159.9 million people instead of today’s 154.4 million people - a difference of about 5.5 million. To be conservative in his estimates, Portman went with 3 million. He added that to both 12,768,000 (people who are currently unemployed) and 154.4 million (today’s civilian workforce) to compute a new unemployment rate.

Working through the math, the 15,768,000 people who are actually unemployed under Portman’s scenario would be divided by 157,400,000, the number he computes as the actual civilian workforce, translating to a 10 percent unemployment rate.

""Thus, there are 3 million people who would work if they could, but instead are sitting on the sidelines due to the sluggish economy,"" said Portman spokeswoman Christine Mangi. ""That means 10 percent of the population that wants to work cannot. This is a useful measure of true unemployment.""

Portman’s office cited a research paper written by GOP economist at Hamilton Place Strategies. It cites a similar figure as Portman - 3.2 million - as the number of ""missing workers who should be participating in the labor force but are not actively seeking work."" It acknowledges that the peak rate of 67 percent labor force participation during the dot-com bubble was expected to decline because of demographic shifts, such as retirement of Baby Boomers. But it asserts that current labor participation is 1.3 percentage points lower than those demographic estimates would predict, ""the equivalent of 3.2 million missing workers.""

A January report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office used a similar approach. It estimated about a third of the 2 percent decline in labor participation between 2007 and the second half of 2011 reflected factors other than the downturn, such as the aging of the Baby Boom generation. Because the report was produced before the most recent unemployment statistics were released, its labor participation and unemployment rates vary slightly from the latest numbers.

""Had that portion of the decline in the labor force participation rate since 2007 that is attributable
to neither the aging of the Baby Boomers nor the downturn in the business cycle (on the basis of the experience in previous downturns) not occurred, the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 would have been about 1.25 percentage points higher than the actual rate of 8.7 percent,"" that CBO report says. Those numbers together produce a percentage close to Portman’s, although it reflects statistics from the end of 2011, not January 2012.

BLS economist Jim Walker declined to assess Portman’s calculations, but said BLS would never assume that an extra 3 million people added to the workforce would all be unemployed. He also noted that his agency tracks the number of people outside the workforce who say they want a job. Those individuals must have searched for work during the past year, but not the month before they were surveyed.

BLS counted 4,697,000 such people in December 2007,  the month the recession officially began, and 6,319,000 of them in January 2012. The 1,622,000 increase is significantly less than the 3 million rise that Portman claims occurred over that period. Walker also pointed us to a research paper produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago which attributes just under half of the 3.3 percent decline in the U.S. labor force participation rate since 2000 to shifting demographics, like the retiring Baby Boomers.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and former Labor Department chief economist, suggested a third BLS statistic would best show the true proportion of people who want jobs but lack them. In January 2012, according to BLS, 15.1 percent of U.S. workers were either working part-time jobs even though they desired full-time work or were unemployed but wanted a job and had looked for one within the past year. In December 2007, the month the recession began, BLS listed that number at 8.8 percent. At that time, regular unemployment rate was 5 percent

""It seems like Sen. Portman used a lower measure than he could have come out with,"" said Furchtgott-Roth. ""Rather than doing his own calculations, it seems like he should use theirs, since they have gone to the trouble of measuring it with their monthly survey of 60,000 households.""

Labor participation peaked around the turn of the century, Furtchgott-Roth said. In addition to Baby Boomer retirements and a shortage of jobs during the recession, the size of the workforce has been depleted by an accelerated number of people who have gone on the Social Security’s disability rolls. According to the Social Security Administration, the number of people collecting disability benefits rose from 7.1 million in 2007 to 8.2 million in 2012. Furtchgott-Roth says unemployment is a particular problem for recent college graduates.

Portman’s assertion is partly accurate. Nobody disputes his contention that the recession elevated the number of Americans who want jobs but are not seeking to be part of the workforce, and that the nation’s official unemployment rate would be higher if those people were included.

But there’s no consensus on how to find the best alternative number.

BLS itself produces options that fall on either side of Portman’s suggested number. The extra 3 million people that Portman counts as unemployed is an estimate -- one that includes all people but not participating in the workforce as unemployed. That’s something BLS cautioned against.

That Portman opted to use an estimate, rather than one of the many alternative unemployment indicators that BLS calculates, undermines his assertion that the 10 percent unemployment rate is a ""more accurate gauge of the current jobs environment,"" than BLS numbers.

Those are important details needed to evaluate his claim.

Rick Santorum ad says Mitt Romney favors cap and trade
","Here’s the visual: Mitt Romney is armed and tearing through an empty warehouse, firing on his target, Rick Santorum.

It's not the real Mitt Romney; it's a look-alike. Santorum is a cardboard cutout, and the ammo in the gun is mud.

The Santorum campaign ad, ""Rombo,"" is airing in Michigan ahead of the state’s presidential primary. Its message: Romney is attacking his rivals to mask his own record.

""Romney and his super PAC have spent a staggering $20 million brutally attacking fellow Republicans. Why? Because Romney’s trying to hide from his big government Romneycare and his support for job-killing cap and trade.""

Here, we’re testing the claim that Romney supports cap-and-trade legislation to fight pollution.

About cap and trade

Cap and trade seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their caps are allowed to sell emission credits to other companies that need them.

Republicans at one time praised cap and trade as a market-based environmental solution, but recently conservatives have taken to condemning it as an energy tax. Nowadays, you won’t hear Republican presidential candidates say anything but ""no"" to whether they favor it.

They’re so eager to declare their opposition, the candidates at times have fudged their own records on the subject.

Where Romney stands

We didn’t hear back from the Santorum campaign when we asked for backup for this claim. Romney’s campaign sent us several of his past statements on cap and trade.

In August 2011, speaking at a town hall in Lebanon, N.H., Romney emphasized the need for energy independence.

""My focus as it comes to this topic is to get us off of our dependence on foreign oil, to use our natural gas, to drill for our oil, to use our coal, clean coal, to develop nuclear power, to use solar and wind and efficiency measures, that’s my priority. There are other people who would like to put in place a cap-and-trade program and dramatically increase the cost of energy. That’s their view. And by the way, that would kill a lot of jobs. And I don’t think it’s going to solve the problem of global warming.""

In October 2011, speaking at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Romney was asked directly whether he favors it.

Here’s a portion of his answer: ""I do not believe in a cap-and-trade program. By the way, they do not call it America warming, they call it global warming. So the idea of America spending massive amounts, trillions of dollars to somehow stop global warming is not a great idea. It loses jobs for Americans, and ultimately it won’t be successful, because industries that are energy-intensive will just get up and go somewhere else. So it doesn’t make any sense at all. My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us.""

That’s a slight change from some of his earlier statements about global warming, where he said he believes climate change is, at least in part, caused by human activity.

""I believe that climate change is occurring – the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control,"" Romney wrote in his 2010 book No Apology.

Going back further, when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he considered joining a regional cap-and-trade compact known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But when it came time to sign the deal, Romney backed out citing ""a lack of economic safeguards,"" according to POLITICO.

We think that’s good evidence that Romney once held at least cautious support for cap and trade. But the Massachusetts episode also shows that he withdrew his support when the policy was tested against economic considerations.

Our ruling

Santorum’s ad says a machine-gun wielding Romney is firing mud to hide his own support of ""job-killing cap and trade.""

While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said he’s opposed to it. And when asked for evidence of Romney's support for cap and trade, the Santorum campaign failed to produce any. We rate the claim False. UPDATE, Feb. 22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a ""safety valve"" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. ""You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. ""He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms.""

To Pizer, these carbon limits don’t fit the definition of cap and trade. ""Maybe you’d call it the same family, but it’s different because you’re telling each source, ‘here’s what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs.’ This idea of trying to limit businesses’ exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade.""

We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romney’s administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles’ opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations ""fit the broad definition of cap and trade."" But he added, ""it’s in the eye of the beholder.""

We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters.

The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact. He has opposed it since, which is the basis for ruling Santorum's ad claim False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/16/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-ad-says-mitt-romney-favors-cap-and-t/

In ""Rombo"" ad, Rick Santorum says Mitt Romney adviser equated Massachusetts health care law with Obama's
","
In the run-up to the Michigan primary, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum released a television ad titled ""Rombo"" that portrayed rival Mitt Romney as a gun-toting mudslinger. In the ad, a Romney look-alike, clad in a pitch-perfect white dress shirt and a tie, aims a paintball gun at cardboard cutouts of Santorum, hoping to cover them with mud.

The visuals made the ad an instant classic, but the ad’s substance has received less attention in the media. We thought we’d look at one of the ad’s claims.

One of the on-screen visuals said, ""Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare."" Is that correct?

First, we should note that we’ve looked at previous claims that Romney’s health care law and Obama’s were similar and have found them to be generally accurate.

To check the claim in the ad, we first turmed to the cited source for the claim, a transcript from rushlimbaugh.com. During his Oct. 13, 2011, show, the conservative talker discussed an appearance the previous night by Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.

We located the transcript for that episode of O’Donnell’s show. Here are some excerpts:

O’Donnell: One of Gov. Romney's health care reform consultants was MIT economist Jonathan Gruber. He attended five of the 12 meetings at the Obama White House in 2009, including the meeting with the president. Joining me now, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jonathan Gruber. Thanks for joining me tonight, professor.

Gruber: You bet, Lawrence. Good to be here.
   
O’Donnell: All right. Come on, come clean. You were in the room with President Obama discussing health care reform. And you did, in fact, work with the Romney administration in Massachusetts. Come on, professor, you have to tell us the truth.

Gruber: The truth is that the Affordable Care Act is essentially based on what we accomplished in Massachusetts. It's the same basic structure applied nationally. John McDonough (the executive director of Health Care For All, a Massachusetts consumer health advocacy organization and) one of the other advisers who worked in both Massachusetts and advised the White House, said it's the Massachusetts bill with three more zeros. That's basically a good description of what the federal bill did.

O’Donnell: It is kind of laughable that we've actually reach the point where we have the great investigative reporter Michael Isikoff actually going in there to get these kind of diary facts in the White House to sort of prove what we all know. I want you to listen to what Mitt Romney had to say when he was signing the bill in Massachusetts.

(In video clip) Mitt Romney: I want to thank the many, many people in this room who were critical to crafting and coaxing the bold health care initiative that I'm about to sign. Jonathan Gruber at MIT devoted hours and hours to an essential econometric model.

O’Donnell: That's for the econometric model, professor. He didn't mention you last night in his answer, when he was asked about, you know, who helped him and who helped President Obama?

Gruber: I'm hurt, Lawrence. I think I'll live.

So, Romney’s hat-tip in the signing ceremony confirms that Gruber helped put together portions of the Massachusetts health care bill. And we think it’s fair to use the term ""blueprint"" to describe Gruber’s comment that ""the truth is that the Affordable Care Act is essentially based on what we accomplished in Massachusetts. It's the same basic structure applied nationally.""

Chamber of Commerce ad says 'Obamacare (hit) Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes'
","
A new attack ad hitting Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, focuses on ""government interference"" and ""more taxes.""

""Tell Jon Tester the Washington way isn't the solution,"" a folksy voice intones. ""We need less government and lower taxes.""

The big number the ad uses to drive its point home: ""Obamacare (hit) Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes.""

We wondered: Did the Affordable Care Act of 2010 contain a $500 billion tax increase?

The ad

Here’s the full wording of the ad, spoken over black-and-white images including worried faces and ominous dark clouds:

""When it comes to fixing America's troubles, is the solution more government interference, more taxes? That's the Washington way. Sadly, it's become Jon Tester's way, too. Tester cast a deciding vote for Obamacare, even though Montanans oppose this massive government intrusion into their health care. And then hitting Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes to pay for it. Tell Jon Tester the Washington way isn't the solution. We need less government and lower taxes.""

We asked the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which paid for the ad, for support for its tax claim. But we didn’t hear back.

However, words on the screen show the source: ""CBO Testimony, 3/30/11.""

We tracked down the March 30, 2011, testimony from the Congressional Budget Office, ""Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation Enacted in March 2010."" It summarizes analyses by CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation from before and after the health care law was enacted. (And it looks at not just the Affordable Care Act, but also the Reconciliation Act, which contained some health care provisions.)

The health care laws created a mandate for Americans to buy health insurance, created insurance exchanges and federal subsidies to make insurance more affordable and significantly expanded eligibility for Medicaid. To pay for that boost in Americans’ health care coverage, it reduced the rate of growth in Medicare payments, imposed a tax on health insurance plans with high premiums and raised some taxes on high earners, along with other changes to the tax code.

How much money are the laws expected to raise?

The 2011 CBO report shows the ""estimated budgetary effects"" of the laws in Table 1. The estimate from March 2010 — when Tester voted — shows revenue generated by the law from 2010-19 would be $525 billion.

That’s certainly in the ballpark of the ad’s ""more than $500 billion"" number.

Here’s the catch: That’s revenue from ""taxes, fees and penalties,"" the CBO testimony says.

How much of that $525 billion was estimated to come from taxes?

The tax breakdown came from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which published its revenue estimates on March 20, 2010. Its total was $409 billion.

The list includes a few small measures that not all experts agree are taxes (we’ve looked before at many of the health care law’s provisions to determine which are taxes and which aren’t) — which pulls that number closer to $400 billion.

By the same token, it doesn’t happen to list revenue from the penalty payments that will be required of employers who don’t provide insurance and people who don’t buy insurance, which were estimated to bring in $65 billion, according Table 2 of a CBO estimate from March 20, 2010. That’s just as well, since the question of whether those penalties are taxes is the subject of legal challenges to the health care law and not something we’ll settle in this item. Still, the penalties are in the tax code — so there’s at least a scenario where the tax burden from the law is $465 billion, better supporting the Chamber of Commerce claim than $400 billion.

Meanwhile, we’re not trying to weigh which of those taxes is ""new"" — certainly some of them are merely increases in existing taxes, experts told us.

What it means

Meanwhile, at least one expert we talked to said he found the distinction between taxes, fees and penalties to be overly picky. He finds it reasonable to cite the full $525 billion number from CBO.

""Someone could quibble that some of the fees do not represent a ‘tax increase,’"" said James Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ""but I cannot fault anyone for saying that the ACA increased taxes by $525 billion.""

He had a different problem with the ad’s statement: ""It lacks context because it does not talk about the benefits of the health care expansion that the increased revenues help pay for,"" he said.

Henry Aaron, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, mentioned another piece of context: The health care law calls for sizable subsidies to help people buy health insurance. Some economists treat these transfers as ""negative taxes.""

""So, if one wants to talk about what is 'hitting' American families, it would be appropriate to count increased payments made to them as well as increased payments they make to the government,"" he said.

What’s that number? It’s not simple to say, Aaron pointed out — $1,1trillion is the net value of the insurance coverage provisions in the law. $504 billion of that is the number without counting Medicaid and CHIP spending that goes directly to states. Another portion, $777 billion, includes mostly spending for direct subsidies but also some other items. We found a CBO estimate that premium and cost-sharing subsidies would cost $350 billion. Bottom line? The tax burden on Americans increases — but it's offset by what taxpayers get in return.

A Daily Finance article in 2010 called it a ""myth"" that heath care reform would raise ""your"" taxes, noting, ""Most people will not see a tax increase."" The AARP, which supported the health care law, pointed out that cost savings from the law would depend ""on whether your income is on the high side, whether you have ‘Cadillac’ employer-sponsored health care coverage and how often you go to tanning salons ... among other things."" Families USA, a liberal group that pushed for the health care law, pointed out lower taxes and lower premiums for 28.6 million Americans under the law.

Our ruling

A Chamber of Commerce ad attacking a Montana Democrat says, ""Obamacare (hit) Americans with over $500 billion in new taxes."" That’s a fair number for total revenue raised by the 2010 health care law as estimated when Tester voted — but the number for just taxes is lower, likely between $400 billion and $465 billion. Meanwhile, the ad talks about the tax bill ""hitting Americans,"" but not the substantial federal subsidies headed their way under the same legislation. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Rick Scott says Florida's unemployment rate had second-highest drop in the nation
","
The unemployment rate in Florida is on the mend, said Gov. Rick Scott at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 11, 2012. As evidence for his claim, he cited the state’s unemployment rate.

""In my first year in office, unemployment has dropped more than 2 percentage points, down from 12 percent to 9.9 percent, the second-largest drop in the nation,"" Scott said.

We wanted to know if Scott had his numbers right, particularly on whether Florida has seen the second-largest drop in the nation.

We should note that it’s too early to say whether Scott should get credit for putting Florida’s economy on the road to recovery. In the speech, he’s clearly claiming some credit, but we’ve examined Scott’s campaign promise to create 700,000 jobs, and -- for a variety of reasons -- we’ve rated it Stalled.

Here, we’re looking only at Scott’s numerical claim, that unemployment is down during his first year in office, and that it’s the second-largest drop in the country.

To check his claim, we turned to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In December 2010, the month before Scott took office, the unemployment rate was 12 percent. In December 2011, the most recent month for which statistics were available, the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent.

So unemployment dropped 2.1 percent.

The BLS also ranks states based on how much unemployment has fallen. Sure enough, Florida was in second place in December 2011, right behind Nevada, which dropped 2.3 percentage points, from 14.9 percent to 12.6 percent.

We should note that Florida’s rate has dropped the second-most because the state’s unemployment rate has been one of the highest in the nation. And even with the 2.1 percentage point decrease, Florida still has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. (Nevada is No. 1.)

That mitigates the significance of Scott's claim but not the veracity of it. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/16/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-unemployment-rate-had-sec/

Donald Trump wrongly says 14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote
","One of Trump’s rallying cries as Election Day nears has been that the election system is rigged and rampant with voter fraud. We’ve debunked this idea in more than one way, but more recently, Trump offered several statistics to back his claim up during a rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Oct. 23. One of those claims was this: ""14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote."" Trump’s remark stood out to us and piqued our interests. We found that Trump is referencing a study that has been criticized and rebutted multiple times for the methodology it uses. Trump’s proof was rebutted Trump was citing a 2014 article posted on Monkey Cage, a blog hosted by the Washington Post, his campaign told PolitiFact. The blog post was a precursor to a study that discussed the impact noncitizens could have on the November 2014 election. The authors —  Jesse Richman and David Earnest — determined more than 14 percent of noncitizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Richman and Earnest used data collected from a Harvard-affiliated Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). The duo concluded that CCES’ data provided ""sufficient samples"" to conduct their research. Trump accurately cites the study, but its findings have been highly contested. Three experts wrote rebuttals of the study’s findings after the Post article appeared, and the study spawned another peer-reviewed article. The main issue with the study is the sample size and the unreliable database of Internet respondents. Shortly after Richman and Earnest’s study was published, the CCES released a newsletter encouraging researchers not to use its data in that way. ""The example for this analysis is Richman, Chattha, and Earnest (2014), which presents a biased estimate of the rate at which non-citizens voted in recent elections,"" the letter says. The CCES researchers — Stephen Ansolabehere, Samantha Luks and Brian Schaffner — reiterated their point in a Washington Post analysis last week. (This analysis became the subject of a study published in 2015 by the same authors.) Ansolabehere, Luks and Schaffner say a small percentage of respondents, who are citizens, accidentally misidentify themselves as noncitizens on the survey. This is because the respondents didn’t read the question carefully and accidentally selected the wrong response to the question. How do they know this? Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, said the group has conducted surveys where they ask people questions regarding their citizenship and some people change their answers. ""When we took out people who changed their answer on the citizenship question and only look at people who answered consistently that they were noncitizens, we found no reported noncitizens who voted,"" Schaffner told PolitiFact. News 21, a national investigative reporting project, found 56 cases of noncitizens voting across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Rick Hasen, an election expert at University of California at Irvine’s School of law, told PolitiFact that Trump’s statistic is bogus. He also cited Ansolabehere, Luks and Schaffner’s study rebutting Trump citation. Hasen wrote in the Wall Street Journal recently that ""the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded last month than only a ‘tiny fraction’ of voters are noncitizens and that there is no evidence it is a serious problem."" Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said there are substantial legal deterrents that are in place to keep a noncitizen from voting. First, it’s a criminal offense to unlawfully vote in a federal election. Second, this offense is worthy of deportation, even without a conviction. ""Voting renders an individual permanently inadmissible — again, even without a conviction,"" Pierce said. ""This means that if someone were to be found inadmissible for having voted, they could never return to the United States, even temporarily, no matter the circumstances. Voter identification laws and regulations for registering to vote vary from state to state. In September, the Supreme Court blocked Kansas, Georgia and Alabama from requiring residents from proving they are a U.S. citizen while registering to vote, due to concerns that people who actually are citizens do not have paperwork readily available to prove it. Our ruling Trump said, ""14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote."" Trump is citing a study that has been refuted by the experts who actually gathered the underlying data. Trump’s remark references an unreliable data point that uses a small sample size to represent an entire population.

Half True: Clinton says she sponsored 400 bills, worked with GOP
","Hillary Clinton insists that her track record as a U.S. senator is proof that she could bring a spirit of bipartisanship to a presidential administration. Speaking from her campaign jet following a rally in Pittsburgh on Oct. 22, Clinton said her prior political experience shows she’s been willing to work with Republicans. ""I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every Republican I served with,"" she said. ""I think last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor. You don’t get that done unless you work with folks on the other side."" We wanted to check whether Clinton sponsored or co-sponsored 400 bills, and whether she was as chummy with her Senate rivals as she claimed. Tallying bills Clinton won election to the U.S. Senate in 2000 to represent New York and was re-elected in 2006. Her tenure was from January 2001 to January 2009, when she resigned to become secretary of state. We first wanted to know to which 400 bills Clinton was referring. She’s used that figure before, such as the Oct. 9 presidential debate, but we couldn’t find a clear definition of which legislation she meant. We contacted Clinton’s campaign, which sent us a list of 400 measures they said had passed Congress and become law. The list included more than bills, which are written by lawmakers and become laws if they pass Congress and are signed by the president. Clinton’s list included resolutions, which often are used to express lawmaker opinions or affect congressional workings, and amendments, which are parts of bills added on while legislation is being considered. Clinton’s 400-bill list also includes House versions of her measures (bills, amendments and resolutions) that passed. Again, Clinton said ""bills"" as a senator, not ""House bills,"" not ""amendments,"" and not ""resolutions."" Those things may eventually have the effect of laws, but that doesn’t mean they are bills that ""have my name on them."" According to the official website for federal legislative information, Congress.gov, Clinton introduced 713 pieces of legislation over her two terms. Of that count, 363 were Senate bills, while the rest were amendments or resolutions. Of the bills Clinton sponsored, only three actually became law. One established a historic site in New York, one renamed a post office and one named a highway. Her Democratic New York counterpart Charles Schumer was the single co-sponsor for all three. (Co-sponsoring is just a way for a lawmaker to show he or she supports a piece of legislation after it has been written.) The laws were uncontroversial and passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and voice vote in the House before being signed by President George W. Bush. Clinton is listed as a co-sponsor on 74 bills that became law. Of those, 27 bills were sponsored by a Republican. Working with Republicans So Clinton is exaggerating a bit when talking about the number of bills she sponsored or co-sponsored. But what about her claim that she worked in a bipartisan fashion? According to our count, of the 363 bills she introduced in the Senate, 93 were co-sponsored by Republicans, or about 26 percent. A single Republican co-sponsored 48, while two or more members of the GOP signed onto 45 of the bills. We also checked GovTrack.us for Republican senators who co-sponsored a Clinton bill. Republicans were listed as a co-sponsor 241 times in the 355 bills she sponsored that were referred to a Senate committee. But that could include the same senator listed multiple times in different bills. Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, for instance, co-sponsored six pieces of Clinton legislation. Four of those measures had 10 or more Republican co-sponsors, so there’s plenty of duplication. Clinton’s campaign noted that almost every Republican senator co-sponsored a Clinton bill at one time or another. They provided a list showing that 57 of the 65 GOP senators who served at the same time as Clinton signed onto her bills. Experts who study Congress have told us that the number of sponsored or co-sponsored bills signed into law isn’t a thorough measure of effectiveness or productivity for a member of the Senate. Adding amendments, writing language for bills, holding hearings and helping constituents are all good indicators of performance. ""By any reasonable standard, including the private comments of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle when she was in the Senate, she was very effective,"" American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman Ornstein told PolitiFact for an earlier fact-check. Our ruling Clinton said ""400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor"" in the Senate, which is proof I worked ""with practically every Republican I served with."" Clinton’s list includes a lot of things that don’t meet the strict definition of a bill as we’d know it from middle school civics. Clinton passed three of her own bills, plus an additional 74 she co-sponsored. There is evidence Clinton worked with Republicans while in the Senate. About 26 percent of the bills she sponsored had support from a Republican. Clinton’s claim is partially accurate.

Clinton: School boards' anti-Catholic scare tactics in 1928 election
","A warning to political junkies: This has very little to do with the burning issues of the presidential campaign. Sometimes, we just like to fact-check claims about history. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton dropped an intriguing nugget in our laps when she spoke at the Alfred E. Smith memorial dinner in New York on Oct. 20, 2016. After making joke after joke at Donald Trump’s expense, Clinton turned serious and reminded her audience of the anti-Catholic bigotry Al Smith faced when he ran for president in 1928. Most of the arguments against Smith stemmed from the belief that Smith would be a puppet for Rome and the pope. One conspiracy theory was that the pope and Smith would ban protestant versions of the Bible. ""It is important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president,"" she said. ""Don't forget, school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible."" We wondered if that was so. The Clinton campaign pointed us to a New York Times article from 2011. In the article, historian Robert Slayton at Chapman University described the hysteria stirred up by Smith’s candidacy.  ""Feelings were so strong that they swirled into a hurricane of abuse, a crescendo of fear and hate blasting through eight weeks,"" Slayton wrote. ""The school board of Daytona Beach, Fla., sent a note home with every student. It read simply: ‘We must prevent the election of Alfred E. Smith to the Presidency. If he is elected President, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.’ "" Clinton made the school boards plural; Slayton only mentioned one. We asked Slayton if he had an image of the note. He didn’t, although he said the anecdote might have come from a 1932 book The Shadow of the Pope by Michael Williams. We tracked down the book in the stacks at the Georgetown University library. Williams described something appreciably different from what Clinton and Slayton had said. Williams wrote about a Sunday school -- a class held on Sundays to teach about religion --, not a public school board. ""On September 16, 1928, a Sunday school in Daytona Beach, Fla., (said the Daytona Times), was reported as acquiescing in a plan whereby the children were handed cards and told to pass them on the their mothers. ""It is stated that the cards declared: ‘We must prevent the election of Alfred E. Smith to the Presidency. If he is chosen President, you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.’ ""  Williams went on to write that this plan ""is reported to have originated in St. Paul, Minn., and to have been used in other places."" So it’s possible that other Sunday schools did this, but we don’t really know. We’ve tried without luck to find the Daytona Times report. If anyone reading this is able to find the article, or find an example from St. Paul, we welcome the help. Our ruling Clinton said that in 1928, school boards sent kids home with a note warning that if Al Smith were elected president, they would not be allowed to own or read a Bible. It appears that reference tracks back to a 1932 book, and a newspaper article before that, that spoke of a Sunday school in Daytona Beach passing out a note. There is a chance that other Sunday schools in other states did likewise, but we don’t have proof of that. There is a big difference between a Sunday school and a public school.  The anti-Catholic sentiment Clinton talked about was real and there’s credible evidence that the note she described went home with some children.

Context is crucial in defining how many countries now harbor ISIS
","The terrorist group ISIS continues to be a focus of the 2016 presidential campaign. During the final presidential debate in Oct. 19, Donald Trump said the group has spread significantly. Hillary Clinton ""gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there,"" Trump said. ""And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries."" ""We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place,"" Trump said later in the debate, ""and right now, they're in 32 countries."" As we've noted before, Trump's claim that Clinton is responsible for ISIS rates False. But we wanted to know if Trump's count of countries with an ISIS presence is correct. The short answer: No. But experts we consulted said counts can vary depending on how you define whether ISIS has a serious presence in country. If you use a broad definition, Trump's count is probably too low. By a stricter definition, it's too high. We asked the Trump campaign for the source of the candidate's tally but we didn't hear back. Where ISIS's impact is felt Claims about ISIS (also known as the Islamic State, ISIL and Daesh) being in 32 countries seem to originate from a blog post two years ago on The Long War Journal website. The post described ""a partial list of reported or suspected ISIS/Islamic State activity outside Iraq and Syria since Jan. 1, 2013."" That's a broad standard because it includes the United States and Canada, which are countries where ISIS has no known military presence. Additionally, it's not clear if any significant terror networks are operating in the United States or Canada, and many of the attacks that do occur seem to be coming from ISIS wannabes. ""Context is always key,"" said Bill Roggio, editor of the Long War Journal and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a right-center think tank. As a practical matter, Trump's count of 32 countries from 2014 would be out of date because ISIS' strength has ebbed and flowed in various regions of the world, Roggio said. ""If Trump had said the Islamic State is operating in 32 countries to various degrees or had supporters in 32 states, the actual number is probably larger."" Roggio said he could easily come up with a list of 37 countries, including countries where ISIS supporters have actually launched attacks — places like Spain, Canada and Italy, where officials claim to have broken up ISIS cells and arrested people. Some attacks have come from pre-existing terror networks that have pledged affiliation with ISIS. Roggio said it's legitimate to include countries where self-declared supporters have launched attacks because ""that's exactly what the Islamic State and al-Qaida tell people to do. To me, we wouldn't refrain from calling out someone who identifies as a Nazi or a KKK member just because they didn't sign the membership rolls somewhere."" Another source, the National Counterterrorism Center has listed ISIS attacks, big and small, in 27 countries between September 2014 and June 2016.  Trevor Thrall, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed us to data from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism reporting that in 2015, ISIS-related terrorist attacks took place in 33 countries. ""This is not quite the same, of course, as saying ISIL is 'in' 33 countries. Many of those attacks — most of those occurring outside Iraq in particular —- were conducted by lone wolves or by ISIL affiliated groups, not ISIL per se,"" Thrall said. CNN's running tally lists attacks in 31 countries, including Iraq and Syria. Strong physical presence By the narrow standard, where some sort of military presence — or at least an established network — is required, Trump's count is too high. A June 2016 Congressional Research Service report identified nine countries where ISIS had a serious presence. That's a far cry from 32. The State Department's ""Country Reports on Terrorism 2015,"" survey says that last year, beyond its operations in Iraq and Syria, ISIS was claiming affiliates along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, in northern Nigeria, the North Caucasus region in southern Russia, Algeria, Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. That's a total of 11 countries. The areas outside Iraq and Syria are identified as ""governates"" in this Institute for the Study of War map from November.  William McCants, director of the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World at The Brookings Institution, said that in July the Islamic State was claiming governates in 14 countries (including Cameroon, Chad, and Niger). In August, NBC News obtained what's known as a ""heat map"" from the National Counterterrorism Center indicating that there were ""aspiring branches"" of ISIS in six additional countries: Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Somalia, Tunisia and Mali. That would bring the count to 16.  ISIS itself has also claimed to have ""covert units"" in Turkey, France and Lebanon, according to McCants. That would bring the total, at best, to 19. Our ruling Trump said ""ISIS is in 32 countries."" As the experts noted, context is important here. If lone wolf attacks by ISIS wannabes or people with access to ISIS propaganda who are exploring attacks are included, Trump's number is a little low. But if you look at countries where ISIS has a sizable, established presence, Trump's number is too high.

World TB deaths shoot up -- on paper
","A reader of a recent statement from the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders might be forgiven for thinking we are losing ground in the battle against tuberculosis. ""The World Health Organization’s annual look at the global state of tuberculosis this year makes for a shockingly bad report card,"" the statement began. It then noted ""WHO’s report reveals that more people are dying of TB and more people are left undiagnosed and untreated than last year, creating a cycle of TB transmission and death."" We went to the WHO tuberculosis report to see if more people are dying of TB and if so, does that amount to shockingly bad news. The answer is that while Doctors Without Borders has its numbers right, the increase is the result of better reporting, which people in public health, including Doctors Without Borders, see as a plus in the battle against any disease. The WHO tuberculosis update In 2015, WHO estimated that tuberculosis killed 1.4 million people directly and was the proximate cause of death for an additional 0.4 million people infected with HIV. Together, the death toll was 1.8 million. In 2014, WHO estimated the total number of deaths at 1.5 million, with about 1.1 million who died exclusively from tuberculosis and another 0.4 million who were HIV-positive. So that’s pretty clear. The total death toll rose by about 300,000. But as the authors of the latest report spell out, the change stems from better counting, not in the growing reach of the disease. ""The TB epidemic is larger than previously estimated, reflecting new surveillance and survey data from India,"" the report said. Prudence Smith, a WHO spokeswoman, explained that between 2013 and 2015, India shifted from a reporting system based on paper to one that lives on the Internet. ""In addition,"" Smith said, ""the country has made case notification legally mandatory."" In the world of tuberculosis, India is a huge deal. It is home to more than 25 percent of all TB cases and deaths worldwide. With better raw data in hand, the estimated death toll in India more than doubled between 2014 and 2015. While that might seem shocking, what really happened is that the earlier estimates low-balled deaths by a huge amount. So, has the situation deteriorated? Not really. There are two ways to measure progress. You can estimate deaths and from that, you can estimate the TB death rate within the population. The same WHO report said both deaths and the death rate are down dramatically since 2000. We looked at estimates from another respected source, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. In an Oct. 8, 2016, Lancet article, the institute looked at the trend between 2005 and 2015. As you can see in this chart, the University of Washington group’s estimates mirror those of the WHO.  Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us the numbers can seem confusing. Kates said there’s been a strong effort to amp up the accuracy of tracking TB for some time, and she doesn’t find the latest figures surprising. ""Newer methods, better data, and so on yield better estimates and that sometimes makes understanding the trends and messaging about them much harder,"" Kates said. Doctors Without Borders spokeswoman Brienne Prusak said the latest figures paint a dire picture. Prusak noted that the report shows that TB deaths topped those by HIV/AIDS. Kates, WHO and Doctors Without Borders applaud the improved TB monitoring. They also all say that funding to combat the disease falls well short of what’s needed. The WHO said the global effort ought to be in the neighborhood of $8.3 billion. Current spending is about $2 billion shy of that. The 2015 estimate from the WHO has a special significance. It is the starting point in a 20-year plan to not just stop tuberculosis, but to end it. Our ruling The group Doctors Without Borders called the latest WHO report on TB shockingly bad and noted that more people are dying from the disease. That statement about the rise in the deaths ascribed to tuberculosis is accurate. Estimated deaths rose by about 300,000 people. But much of that increase has more to do with better reporting and more complete data than an actual increase in deaths. As the WHO report noted, experts came to believe that earlier estimates were too low. This was largely driven by the numbers out of India. Looking back 10 years, the trends in the number of deaths and the TB death rate show steady improvement. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

Maggie Hassan says ISIS advertises lax U.S. gun laws
","As gun policy takes a central role in New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate race, Democrat Maggie Hassan is warning that terrorists are trying to exploit federal laws to obtain firearms. Hassan brought up the point in the first televised debate against Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. ""With her solution, terrorists can still today — and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it — buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America,"" Hassan said on the debate stage at New England College. Is it really a point terrorists are spreading? Let’s look. PolitiFact has already looked into Hassan’s claim that Ayotte voted against a proposal to expand background checks and found it Mostly True.  Here we are going to look at what ISIS says about buying guns in America. Hassan’s camp pointed us to a series of news articles in which members of various terrorist groups talk about the ease of getting guns in the U.S. A former Islamic State recruit told the New York Times in August that the terrorist group tries to draw its recruits from within the U.S. because they can buy guns without a middleman. ""For America and Canada, it’s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb — they have open gun policies,"" Harry Sarfo told the Times from a German prison, when explaining attitudes within the terror group. ""They say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don’t need to have a contact man who has to provide guns for them."" Hassan’s camp also directed us to a 2011 video featuring American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn in which he talked about lax gun laws in the U.S. and urged followers to take advantage of them. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,"" Gadahn said, according to CNN. ""You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" Gadahn was with al-Qaeda, not ISIS. Still, he urged terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. Those two examples are enough to show that terrorists have advertised the U.S. gun laws, and ""it is something they think about internally,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Still, it’s difficult to determine if these are part of a widespread advertising campaign, or just isolated examples. A lof of ISIS communication is never circulated on the internet, Gartenstein-Ross cautioned. On other occasions, PolitiFact has examined whether people can buy guns without background checks. Currently federal law requires prospective gun buyers undergo background checks when they buy guns from federally licensed dealers -- but there are notable exceptions.  Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" has to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. So if an individual buys a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet, or at a gun show, he or she would not be subject to a background check. It’s worth noting that private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person. Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, has previously told PolitiFact. Additionally, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically. Congressional efforts to expand background checks for purchases made at gun shows or online have failed. A recent review by the New York Times found the majority of guns used in 16 recent mass shootings were obtained legally, including the attack in Orlando that left nearly 50 people dead. The shooter in that incident, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before he gunned down patrons at the Pulse nightclub. Our ruling  Hassan said the Islamic State knows its followers can buy firearms ""online and at gun shows"" and is ""advertising it."" An interview in the New York Times with a former Islamic State recruit shows group members acknowledge American recruits can buy guns, so long as they don’t have a record. And a 2011 video from an al Qaeda spokesman urges terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. There is little evidence to suggest a widespread advertising campaign, but it’s hard to tell, because not all ISIS communication is on the Internet, either.

Bizarre campaign ad wrongly ties Trump and David Jolly together on abortion
","The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released a bizarre ad in October warning that a vote for Congressman David Jolly in the 13th Congressional District is a vote for Donald Trump's right-hand man. The ad ties Jolly and Trump together through photoshopped images and shared views on opposing abortion rights and defunding Planned Parenthood.  ""Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose,"" says the narrator in the ad. This remark stood out to us, so we wanted to take a look at each man’s view on abortions. Moreover, the goal of the ad and its methods have been widely criticized, so we’ll examine the relationship between Trump and Jolly. The evidence linking Trump and Jolly’s stances on abortion is hard to pinpoint, given the fact both have talked about abortion in different ways. What’s not hard to pinpoint is the relationship between Trump and Jolly, which just doesn’t exist. Jolly has never met Trump, nor is he supporting him for president. Trump and Jolly on abortion Trump and Jolly are are on the same side of the abortion spectrum, but their views are hard to lump together as one and the same. Jolly’s campaign told PolitiFact Florida he calls himself pro-life, but has never supported or voted to outlaw abortion entirely. At the congressional debate on Sept. 19, Jolly was asked if it's right for a woman to abort her baby if she finds out she has Zika in the early stages of pregnancy. Jolly responded: ""I think that is her choice, but for the health of the mother or the health of the baby, or the life of the mother, I think there should be exceptions permitted to terminate the pregnancy. Yes, I do."" There are other exceptions Jolly embraces, too, including instances of rape or incest. Jolly may say he doesn’t support outlawing abortion, but what does his voting record say? The DCCC points to the ""Life at Conception Act"" (H.R. 1091) that Jolly co-sponsored in 2014. This act would give a fetus the same rights as a human beings from the moment of fertilization. This is clearly an anti-abortion rights bill, but as PolitiFact concluded in 2014, there’s a lot of murkiness that courts would have to sort through before it would be clear if abortion would be outlawed. Whether or not Trump wants to outlaw abortion is hard to determine. In March, Trump stated women should be punished for having an abortion. (You can read the whole remark in context here.) But he backed off saying women should specifically be punished to stating general opposition to abortion.   ""If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,"" the Trump statement says. ""The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions."" Recently at the third presidential debate, Trump was asked if he wants the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, which would essentially dissolve a woman’s right to abortions.   Trump said: ""Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states."" Jolly does not support Trump This ad has been highly criticized for its bogus images showing Trump and Jolly photoshopped together. Like the claim, the ad attempts to paint Trump and Jolly as one in the same — and allies if both Jolly and Trump win. This association is not accurate. At the congressional debate, Jolly said he doesn’t support Trump and told the Tampa Bay Times he never met him. Jolly’s spokesperson reiterated that point to PolitiFact Florida on Oct. 20 and said Jolly will not be supporting Trump in this election. Jolly called on Trump to drop out of the presidential race in December after Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslims. At the time of the press release, Jolly was running for Marco Rubio’s seat in the U.S. Senate. ""While ISIS is beheading innocent people for their religious practices, Trump is betraying our freedoms,"" Jolly said in a statement. ""His brutal, bullying bigotry runs contrary to the very principles our forefathers fought so hard to defend. We are either a party of protecting the constitution and religious liberties or we're not. America should insist on a security test but never a religious test."" Our ruling An ad from the DCCC said, ""Just like Donald Trump, David Jolly wants to outlaw a woman's right to choose."" Trump and Jolly both favor restrictions on abortion, but their views cannot be directly equated to outlawing all instances of abortion. Moreover, the claim, and the overall theme of the ad — that Jolly would be an ally to Trump — is highly misleading. Jolly does not support Trump. We rate the DCCC’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/24/dccc-lgo/bizarre-campaign-ad-wrongly-ties-trump-and-david-j/
"['History', 'Wisconsin', 'Tim Kaine']","
Is the Democratic Party the oldest continuous political party in the world?
","It’s widely stated that the Democratic Party is the oldest political party in the world. PBS says the party is the ""world’s oldest existing political party."" In a 2003 book review, the Washington Post called the party the ""world’s oldest political party."" And at a rally in Wisconsin, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine repeated the claim: ""When I was standing on that stage, and the balloons were falling after Hillary (Clinton) had accepted the nomination, and my 81-year-old mother was there with me, and all of our extended family, my mom said to me: 'Tim, this is the greatest night of my life,'"" Kaine said in an Aug. 5, 2016 appearance in Milwaukee. ""Now, she was saying that partly because of me, but, but she was saying it because it was a historic night for the oldest continuous political party in the world, and for the first time in the history of the United States, to have a woman nominated for president."" We decided to take a stroll through the history books to see if Kaine was right about the Democratic Party being the oldest continuous political party in the world. The experts we reached gave us an answer: Yes, but. ""It’s a very common statement and it’s largely true, but it’s a little complicated,"" said Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University. U.S. history Both parties can trace their beginnings to the start of George Washington’s time as president (1789), but the path is more direct for Democrats. The political parties that eventually developed in the United States were the first modern political parties in the sense that they drew broader representation from the general electorate than political groups in other nations. The Democratic Party traces its roots to the early 1790s. At that point, Congress was starting to divide into two groups, said John Aldrich, a Duke University political science professor who wrote the book, ""Why Parties?: The Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America."" But as a modern-looking continuous political party, it dates to either 1828, with the election of Andrew Jackson or 1832, when the party held its first national convention. Republicans could trace their roots back to Washington’s administration as well -- but the word ""continuous"" is key in this context. ""The Democrats have established their claim that they’re the oldest continuous political party because the name changes less,""Jillson said. ""The (two sides’) agendas, though, go all the way back to the first Washington administration in the 1790s."" The Republican Party can trace itself -- by three different names -- to Washington’s first years, during which Alexander Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury and Thomas Jefferson was Secretary of State and they argued with each other in Washington’s cabinet, Jillson said. ""The two parties grow out of that (those arguments) and so it’s right to say that the Democrats are the oldest continuous party but the Republicans could make the claim that under three different names their party is just as old,"" he said. The Federalists, originally associated with Hamilton’s policies, became the Whigs, which became, ultimately, the Republicans, Jillson said. But the line from Federalists to Republicans is more obscure, Aldrich said. Most would say that while there are some connections, the Whigs and the Republicans were really new parties, especially when compared to the more or less direct line between Jefferson and today’s party, Aldrich wrote in an email. The Republican Party says its founding came in the 1850s. The Republican National Committee describes its formation at a meeting in Ripon, Wisconsin, in 1854 and the party’s formal organization at a convention in Michigan that same year -- long after the Democrats. It held its first national convention in 1856. In the whole world? ""In the U.S., we know the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party and so the question is, is it older than other parties elsewhere in the world?"" said Casey Dominguez, an associate professor at the University of San Diego’s Department of Political Science and International Relations. There are only a handful of other democracies in the world to compare to, she said. Our experts primarily compared the U.S. political parties to those in Great Britain. American political parties are recognized for their broad electorate that tends to line up behind the two major political parties, whereas that dynamic came much later in Britain, Jillson said. When political parties were developing in the United States, the British counterparts were more aggregations of elites. The Conservative and Liberal parties in Britain can trace their roots to well before the founding of the United States. But it was not until the Great Reform Act of 1867 that Britain began to develop modern parties in the sense that a broader swath of the electorate was able to participate. Our rating Kaine said that the Democratic Party is ""the oldest continuous political party in the world."" The political parties that developed in the United States were the first modern political parties in the sense that they drew broader representation from the general electorate than their predecessors in other nations. In the U.S., the Democratic Party is older than the Republican Party. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/24/tim-kaine/democratic-party-oldest-continuous-political-party/

Joe Morrissey hits and misses in claim about Redskins' training camp
","Joe Morrissey says Richmond fumbled in 2013 when it signed a long-term deal to bring the Washington Redskins’ summer training camp to the city. ""We built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium,"" Morrissey said during an Oct. 17 mayoral candidates debate sponsored by ChamberRVA. There’s been been lots of arguing over whether the Redskins training facility - located behind the Science Museum of Virginia - has been good for the city. Boosters of the plan, including outgoing Mayor Dwight Jones, have said it was a way to bring in economic activity in the city; detractors say the deal was a give away city dollars. We won’t be able to settle that debate, but we’re curious about the factual claims in Morrissey’s statement: That the Redskins are the ""second richest team"" in the NFL and that the city built them a ""$14 million stadium."" Let’s start by saying Morrissey’s description of the training camp as a stadium is inaccurate. The facility has no structure with tiered seats surrounding a field. What the city built is essentially a two-story building and two football fields on a 17-acre tract. The first floor has a locker room and training rooms that the Redskins use during their three-week summer camp. When the team leaves town, the first floor is leased by Bon Secours hospital system as a men’s health center. Richmond planned to lease the second floor as office space, but has been unable to find tenants. The $14 million Morrissey said his figure on the cost to build the training facility was derived from two sources -- the city’s $10 million investment in the training camp as well as a $4 million state grant that Virginia provided to the Redskins. The state grant didn’t pay for constructing the facility; it was tied to an agreement between the state to encourage the Redskins, who are headquartered in Ashburn, to retain and expand their operations in Virginia. The cost to build the training camp wasn’t $14 million. It was $10 million, paid for by the city and built by Richmond’s Economic Development Agency, said Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for Mayor Jones. She added in an email that the EDA also paid for an additional $1 million to build a park at the site. Rent and naming rights are being used to make bond payments for the city’s investment, she said. But the city is also responsible for $500,000 payments to the Redskins each year during the course of the eight-year-agreement to cover some the team’s costs of training in Richmond. That’s paid for through sponsorships, in-kind services and not additional city funding, says a July 21, 2016 report to the City Council that Hawley sent us. In recent years, the city’s EDA has had to make payments to cover portions of the annual $500,000 bill because sponsorships and other revenues from the site haven’t met expectations. The second richest NFL team? This isn’t the first time Morrissey has said the Redskins are the ""second richest team in the NFL."" He also did so during a Sept. 29 interview on The John Fredericks show. Morrissey pointed us to an Associated Press article from August 2014 and an April 2016 posting on  sports news website that say the Redskins team was the third most valuable team in the NFL. The NFL value rankings are done every year by Forbes magazine, which looks at each team’s overall value as well as how much annual revenue they generate. They have shown that, for years, the Redskins have been in the top tier the most valuable football franchises. Forbes valued the team at $1.7 billion in 2013, $2.4 billion in 2014 and $2.85 billion in 2015. Each year that made them the third most valuable franchise among the NFL’s 32 teams. The Redskins’ annual revenue was $381 million in 2012, $395 million in 2013 and $439 million in 2014, Forbes reported. The 2016 estimates came out last month, and they show Washington has slipped in the rankings even though its value continues to increase. The Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots continue to dominate as the most valuable teams. But the New York giants and San Francisco 49ers, which are valued at $3.1 billion and $3 billion, respectively, have now barely pulled ahead of the Redskins in the rankings. Washington’s $2.95 billion overall value this year, ranks it fifth.The Redskins’ revenues of $447 million last year still ranked third, barely ahead of the Giants and the 49ers. Our ruling Morrissey said ""We built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium."" Morrissey’s gist - that Richmond spent a lot of money building a training facility for one of the richest teams in the NFL - is solid. But his statement is filled with exaggerated figures and terms. The facility is not a stadium; it mainly consists of two practice fields and a building containing a locker room and training rooms. The construction cost was $10 million. And the Redskins are the fifth wealthiest team in the NFL, according to Forbes.

Do Clinton donors 'throw gays off of buildings'? No, that's ISIS
","Donald Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scolded ""chest beaters"" for criticizing Trump’s (false) claims of voter fraud while ignoring worrying donations to Hillary Clinton’s foundation. ""We respect the principles of American democracy,"" Conway said on Meet the Press Oct. 23, 2016. But, ""if we’re so concerned about the principles of American democracy, as so many chest beaters were this week, ask Hillary Clinton why she takes tens of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings?"" We wanted to fact-check Conway’s claim. We found Conway is confusing a few points. First, Clinton herself hasn’t taken donations from foreign countries, which is illegal for political candidates. The Clinton Foundation, however, has taken donations from countries that have poor records when it comes to their treatment of women and the LGBT community (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman).   Second, Conway’s use of the present tense implies the Clinton Foundation continues to accept these donations, while the latest gifts came in 2014. The foundation has agreed to cease accepting foreign donations should Clinton win the presidency. And finally, same-sex relations in some of these countries is punishable by death, but they do not ""throw gays off of buildings."" That’s something done by ISIS, which is obviously not a Clinton Foundation donor. The donations As part of a memorandum of understanding between the Obama administration and the Clinton Foundation when Clinton was named secretary of state, the foundation agreed to disclose its donors (reported in broad ranges). The foundation has taken between $1 million and $5 million each from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. Kuwait donated between $5 million and $10 million, and Saudi Arabia between $10 million and $25 million. (Qatar’s 2022 World Cup committee gave between $250,001 and $500,000 while ""Friends of Saudi Arabia"", a group the New York Times reports was started by a Saudi Prince, donated between $1 million and $5 million.) The Emirati as well as part of the Saudi and Omani gifts came in 2014, according to the Wall Street Journal. Altogether, that’s $18 million to $50 million from these countries. The donations supported the foundation's charitable efforts and the countries are considered allies of the United States. ‘Hate’ and ‘disrespect’ women Adult Saudi women must obtain permission from a male guardian to travel, marry or exit prison and may be required to provide consent to work or access health care, according to Human Rights Watch. They are also not allowed to drive or seek divorce. Women in the UAE also have to seek permission from a male guardian to marry and, once married, the law mandates obedience to her husband. The country does not specifically prohibit domestic violence and allows for punishment with certain conditions. In Qatar, the same provisions for marriage and obedience prevail while marital rape and domestic violence are not criminalized. Kuwait does not prohibit domestic violence, sexual harassment or marital rape. Oman bans gender-based discrimination in theory, but women are discriminated against in divorce, inheritance and child custody cases in practice. ‘Throws gays off buildings’ PolitiFact Arizona has previously reported that extramarital sex, including same-sex intercourse, is punishable by death in the UAE and for Muslims in Qatar. Men engaging in sodomy can be stoned to death and non-married men are subjected to 100 blows of the whip and one-year banishment in Saudi Arabia. They face up to seven years in prison in Kuwait. Kuwaiti law also prohibits ""imitating the opposite sex in any way."" Same-sex relations carry a penalty from six months to three years in Oman. But Conway’s description of gay men and women being thrown off of buildings is not accurate for these countries. It is ISIS that throws men suspected of being gay off of buildings. As a terrorist group, they cannot and have not donated to the Clinton Foundation. We asked the Trump campaign if Conway misspoke when she conflated ISIS’ actions with those countries that have donated to the Clinton Foundation. We did not hear back. Our ruling Conway said Clinton ""takes tens of millions of dollars from countries that hate women, that disrespect women, that throw gays off of buildings."" Conway is talking about donations the Clinton Foundation has taken from U.S. allies is the Middle East for humanitarian project. Her statement is exaggerated and muddles a few facts. Clinton, as a political candidate, cannot take donations from foreign countries. The Clinton Foundation has accepted $18 million to $40 million from countries that have treated women and gays harshly. The latest gifts came in 2014 and are not current as Conway implies. Furthermore, there’s no evidence that these countries have thrown gays off of buildings. Conway may have been thinking of ISIS, which has not and cannot donate to the Clinton Foundation.

Donald Trump says Ford is moving all small-car production to Mexico
","One of Donald Trump’s signature issues in his 2016 presidential bid has been stopping the outflow of American jobs to other countries. During a visit to Delaware, Ohio, he cited a recent example of a major American company moving some of its work out of the United States. ""Companies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico,"" Trump said. ""Ford is moving all of their small-car production to Mexico. When I'm president, if a company wants to fire their workers and leave for Mexico or other countries, then we will charge them a 35 percent tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States."" Is it really true that ""Ford is moving all of their small car production to Mexico""? We’ll take a closer look. On Sept. 14, 2016, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced at an event with Wall Street analysts that ""we will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States"" over the next two to three years, according to Reuters. Ford had already announced that it would be investing $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production starting in 2018. ""During contract talks in 2015, Ford confirmed that it would move Focus and C-Max production out of its Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The United Auto Workers Union said at the time that Ford planned to build the next Focus in Mexico,"" Reuters reported. The Focus and the C-Max are considered small cars. The company cited declining interest among U.S. consumers for smaller cars and growing sales for bigger vehicles in an era of low gasoline prices. It also cited Mexican labor costs that are about 40 percent lower than than in the United States. ""That's what it takes to compete in that (small car) segment,"" Fields told CNN. So Trump is right that the company is moving all small-car production in North America to Mexico. However, he overlooked a salient point -- that both the company and the United Auto Workers do not expect any jobs to be lost at the Wayne plant. Instead of building small cars, the Wayne facility will transition into producing SUVs and pickup trucks that are more popular in the United States. ""Our U.S. workforce at that plant will be making those new vehicles,"" said Ford spokeswoman Christin Tinsworth Baker. In the past five years, Ford has invested $12 billion in U.S. plants and created nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs, Baker said. In all, the company has 85,000 U.S. employees. In a September interview with Fox News, Trump mischaracterized the changes at Ford, saying the company planned to ""fire all their employees in the United States and … move to Mexico."" The company aggressively countered that allegation. In an interview with CNN, Fields was asked whether the company would cut any U.S. jobs as part of the relocation of work to Mexico. He said, ""Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the U.S. And that's the way it will continue to be."" In his speech in Ohio, however, Trump stuck closer to the facts. Our ruling Trump said that ""Ford is moving all of their small-car production to Mexico."" That’s correct as far as it goes, but framing it that way ignores an important qualifier -- that no U.S. jobs will be lost in the transition. The company says that workers at the Ford plant in question will instead make SUVs and pickups.

Jill Stein, Green Party candidate, correct about U.S. bombing seven countries
","Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential nominee, charged the major-party hopefuls with failing to tell Americans how they’d tackle challenges including foreign conflicts. Stein, speaking at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump a couple of nights before the last 2016 presidential debate: ""They are very busy talking about grabbing women’s genitalia so that they don’t have to reveal that they cannot tell you what are we going to do about this crashing economy, what are we going to do about the climate that is barreling down on us, this catastrophe of the climate."" Stein drew our curiosity when she went on: ""They don’t have a solution to the expanding wars except more wars. We are already bombing seven countries and now we do appear to be engaging in this war crime in Yemen where we have been partnering with the Saudis in this war crime for the past year. They do not want to talk about that."" Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has sided with Yemen’s government against Houthi rebels in a continuing war. For this fact check, we wondered if the U.S. is bombing seven countries. That at least has been so: In September 2014, PunditFact rated True a bombed-countries claim by Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker. Lizza referred to President George W. Bush and his successor, Barack Obama, in a tweet that said: ""Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4."" At the time, the U.S. on Obama’s watch had bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. When we asked Stein for her backup information, spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa pointed out various web posts including a September 2014 CNN news story stating that Obama had ordered air strikes in seven countries through the bulk of his eight years in the office. Mindful that Stein spoke in the present tense, we checked on if the U.S. has lately been bombing seven countries. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries. The bureau annotates each incident with links to press reports. When we looked, the bureau’s accounts by country indicated the latest U.S drone strike in Pakistan occurred in May 2016; the latest strike in Somalia was in September 2016; and the latest U.S. strikes in Yemen and Afghanistan were in October 2016. Separately, we noticed, the Department of Defense said in an Oct. 11, 2016, web post that countries including the U.S. battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, have conducted 15,634 air strikes to date -- 10,129 in Iraq, 5,505 in Syria -- with the U.S. conducting 6,868 in Iraq and 5,227 in Syria. In a Sept. 30, 2016, post, the U.S. Air Force said attacks from the air have affected ISIL’s ""ability to fight and conduct operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan."" Too, in August 2016, the New York Times reported the U.S. had ""stepped up a new bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Libya, conducting its first armed drone flights from Jordan to strike militant targets"" in Libya’s coastal city of Sirte. That news story quoted Obama saying during a news conference that the airstrikes were critical to helping Libya’s fragile United Nations-backed government to drive Islamic State militants out of Sirte, which the group has controlled since June 2015. Obama promised the air campaign would continue as long as necessary to make sure that the extremist group ""does not get a stronghold in Libya,"" the newspaper said. Our ruling Stein said: ""We’re already bombing seven countries."" We identified seven countries lately bombed by the U.S.: Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq and Libya.

Utilities behind solar amendment are trying to trick voters into ending net metering, Al Gore says
","In the Miami area to stump for Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore wanted to enlighten a crowd of supporters about a controversial ballot measure on solar energy. Gore said the utility companies that back Amendment 1 make it sound like it fosters solar, but the true aim is darker than that. He called it a ""phony baloney"" initiative propped up by utilities. ""The things they claim protect solar are protections you already have,"" Gore said at Miami Dade College’s Kendall campus on Oct. 11, 2016.  ""But they are trying to fool you into amending your state Constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering and do in Florida what they did in Nevada and just kill the solar industry."" Does Amendment 1 allow utility companies to stop net metering? And what is net metering, anyway? We wanted to shine some light on a very contentious energy proposal. Solar squabble Amendment 1, called ""Rights of Electricity Consumers Regarding Solar Energy Choice,"" has drawn fire for crowding out a more grassroots solar power amendment that failed to make this year’s ballot because it didn’t garner enough signatures — in part because utility companies contributed millions to Amendment 1’s war chest. The Florida Supreme Court determined the language of the amendment was not misleading and approved it 4-3.  It is widely considered a deliberate attempt by utilities to erect barriers to competition and prevent third-party leasing of solar. Utility companies have given most of the almost $22 million being poured into the amendment campaign.  Florida is one of five states that do not allow a property owner to have a third-party installer put solar panels on their roof and sell the power back to them. The amendment will leave that ban in place, but, if the ban on solar leasing and sales were removed, the language in the amendment could discourage third-party sales. It gives utility companies the right to impose new fees on all solar customers to compensate for the loss of revenue when solar customers don't buy their power, making solar sales and leasing less economical. Audio surfaced this month of Sal Nuzzo, a vice president at the utilities-backed James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, at an energy summit calling the amendment ""an incredibly savvy maneuver"" that ""would completely negate anything they (pro-solar interests) would try to do either legislatively or constitutionally down the road,"" according to the Miami Herald. He also said that because solar power is a popular idea among customers, ""we can use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu"" to get voters to approve protections for non-solar customers. Before that story, environmentalists and solar advocates said they were tipped off by the very wording in the amendment: ""State and local governments shall retain their abilities to protect consumer rights and public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do."" The first clause protects a person’s ability to put solar panels on their house. That’s really not a big deal at the moment, since current law already allows that. The second half is the controversial part, because critics like Gore say it will allow utility companies to end a process called net metering. What’s that, you ask? Say you have solar panels on your roof. When the sun is out, the panels are generating power. They may even generate more than your house needs. Meanwhile, most homes still need traditional electric service from utility companies so that they can have power at night. Net metering allows someone to sell excess solar-generated power to the utilities. Those people would also enjoy a lower bill because they draw less electricity from the traditional, power plant-supplied grid. Utility companies nationwide have argued that this is unfair, because homes with solar panels are getting all the benefit of being connected to the grid without having to pay as much for the upkeep of generators and transmission lines as other customers. Traditional customers, they say, are subsidizing solar customers. ""The concern is that if you get all your power for free, you’re not paying your fair share,"" Stetson University law professor Lance Long said. Solar promoters disagree with those claims. They argue that instead of costing non-solar customers more, solar energy brings more value to the electricity distribution system than it takes away. A Brookings Institution study in May looked at net metering in several states and concluded that when solar customers sell their power back to the electric utility through net metering, it actually helps non-solar customers in a few ways. The study said adding solar power reduces the need to build new power plants to meet peak demand, curtails costly grid maintenance, lowers reliance on oil and gas power generation, lowers utility rates, increases energy security and saves customers money. Amendment 1 opponents therefore fear that utilities will lobby the state to allow a surcharge on solar customers or, as Gore said, change the policy for net metering. If Amendment 1 is approved, state officials could define what it means to ""subsidize"" solar power and lessen the economic benefits of third-party solar power for homes and businesses. It’s a reasonable concern, since Florida utility providers have already grumbled about ending net metering. Florida Power & Light told the state Public Service Commission in June 2015 that it didn’t see the practice as sustainable, repeatedly referring to ""subsidies required to support rooftop solar."" Ending net metering would strangle a vital revenue source for those third-party solar companies. Those businesses often install solar panels on houses for free or reduced cost, then make money by leasing the equipment and selling excess power to utilities. The chance to cripple competitors would give utilities a big incentive to kill net metering. As Gore mentioned, that’s what happened in Nevada, which reduced net metering payments so much that major third-party companies left the state, dropping new panel installations by 92 percent in the first quarter of 2016. That follows a national trend of utility companies being hostile to some types of solar arrangements. But no one, not even Oscar-winning environmentalist Gore, knows for certain what Florida’s utility companies would do about net metering, or potential extra fees. Both are possible, or even likely, depending on your point of view. But neither are definite if Amendment 1 passes. Changes wouldn’t be automatic, either. A spokeswoman for Consumers for Smart Solar, the utility-backed group behind the initiative, pointed out ""Amendment 1 gives utilities no authority whatsoever."" Legal experts we contacted said that’s accurate; Florida’s Public Service Commission, which sets rates and handles utility regulations, would have to approve utilities’ requests. And since net metering is a part of state statute, the matter would likely end up before the state Supreme Court.   That’s when Amendment 1 would really kick in: It would give utilities a much stronger argument that one way or another, solar customers should be paying a higher electric bill. ""It (the amendment) would create a constitutional right for utilities, and not just a regulation,"" Florida State University law professor Hannah Wiseman said. ""It raises the stakes."" Our ruling Gore said electric utilities ""are trying to fool you into amending your state Constitution in a way that gives them the authority to shut down net metering."" Amendment 1 doesn’t immediately give utilities authority to do anything, on its face. But it would potentially give them a constitutional argument to eventually charge solar customers more, or change net metering policies. There’s no certain proof that Florida regulators would approve either, but experts told us it’s a very reasonable suspicion.  The amendment is widely considered to be deceptively worded and erects barriers to solar power that would favor traditional utilities. Gore is right to warn solar proponents it would work against their broader efforts. Nonetheless, he went a bit too far to say the amendment would automatically grant utilities unchecked ""authority"" to kill net metering. We rate his statement Half True. Clarification, Oct. 24, 2016: This fact-check was updated to clarify that third-party sales of electricity from solar power are banned in Florida. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b5fa6588-4ecc-454f-9a48-028843014ede",/factchecks/2016/oct/21/al-gore/utilities-behind-amendment-1-are-trying-trick-vote/

Trump right on Obama's deportation numbers, wrong about nobody talking about it
","At the last presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton tried to make a case on why their own immigration plans are the best for the nation. Trump, the Republican nominee, touted his vision of a wall along the southern border and plans to get undocumented criminal immigrants out of the country. He also brought attention to President Barack Obama’s deportation record. ""President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it. Nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported,"" Trump said. Deportations and what to do with millions of people in the country illegally are highly controversial topics. Trump himself has not stuck to one approach about it. There’s no doubt many people have been deported under Obama’s presidency --- but we were curious about Trump’s claim of ""millions"" and on lack of information about it, ""nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it."" Here’s what’s known about deportation numbers. The Department of Homeland Security issues yearly statistics on enforcement actions. The latest available is for fiscal year 2014, which is Oct. 1, 2013, to Sept. 30, 2014. From fiscal years 2009 to 2014, there have been more than 2.4 million removals, according to DHS data. Fiscal year 2009 includes data for a few months in which Obama was not in office. Still, if we add just the full fiscal years in which he has been office, and for which data is available (2010-2014), there have been over 2 million removals. That corroborates Trump’s claim that ""under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country."" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also issues removal data. But its removal totals equals the sum of two actions: ""removals"" and ""returns."" Removals account for people moved out of the country based on a formal order from a judge. Returns track people who were encountered by ICE, but who chose to depart the United States prior to a resolution of their immigration case. Even then, ICE data shows that more than 2 million people have been moved out of the country while Obama has been in office, supporting part of Trump’s claim. ‘Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it’ In the debate, however, Trump also claimed these millions of deportations have not been spoken about. ""Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it,"" Trump said. But there is extensive reporting that shows otherwise. For years, news outlets have reported on Obama’s deportation numbers. Some examples: 2010: The Washington Post reported that ""the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants."" 2012: NPR reported that the Obama administration ""deported a record 1.5 million"" in his first term. 2014: An analysis by The New York Times found that since Obama became president, ""two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all."" 2016: The New York Times reported in June that Obama ""has carried out many more deportations than previous presidents, setting a record of more than 2.4 million formal removals."" Even immigration advocates have called out Obama for his deportation record, challenging his campaign promise to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Obama was dubbed the ""Deporter-in-Chief"" in 2014 by Janet Murguía, president of the National Council of La Raza, an immigrant advocacy group. ""For the president, I think his legacy is at stake here,"" Murguía told Politico in March 2014. ""We consider him the deportation president, or the deporter-in-chief."" We pointed out the Politico article to Trump’s campaign and a spokesperson said, ""That was published over two years ago."" But Trump’s claim at the debate did not specify that deportations under Obama are not currently being talked about -- which would still be an inaccurate statement. Obama addressed the ""Deporter-In-Chief"" moniker in a 2014 interview with Jorge Ramos, a Fusion and Univision anchor. Ramos told him 2 million deportations under his presidency had destroyed families and that he was called ""Deporter-in-Chief."" Obama said it was ""not true"" when Ramos said he could’ve stopped deportations. ""There certainly has been a lot of folks who have focused on Obama’s deportation record,"" said William Stock, an immigration lawyer and president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""No one can argue that not only have there been hundreds of thousands of removals each year, but there have also been a lot of people talking about those removals."" The number of deportations under Obama have been raised by the press, advocacy groups and even at congressional hearings with Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a Trump adviser, Stock said. Our ruling Trump said ""Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it, but under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country, they've been deported."" More than 2.4 million people have been deported under Obama’s presidency. But Trump’s claim that ""nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it,"" is completely wrong. Not only is federal data issued about it on a yearly basis, there has also been extensive media coverage about it. Immigration advocates have called out the president for it and congressional hearings on deportations have also taken place. Trump’s claim is partly right. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/21/donald-trump/trump-right-deportation-numbers-wrong-talks-about-/
"['Social Security', 'Pennsylvania', '  AFSCME']","
The story behind an attack ad’s blast of Pat Toomey’s plan for Social Security
","Opponents of Senator Pat Toomey are making sure his past ideas about Social Security stay front and center. Social Security, of course, was a much hotter topic a few years ago. Many Republicans, including former President George W. Bush, pushed for allowing younger workers to contribute portions of payroll taxes into government-approved private mutual fund accounts. It was a movement for a partial privatization of Social Security. But that plan never gained much traction and lately politicians on both sides of the aisle have been reluctant to talk about privatizing Social Security and have instead focused on other means of reform or at least used less divisive terminology than ""privatization.""   A recent ad from AFSCME throws Toomey into this mix. It accuses him of previously favoring the privatization of Social Security and, yes, uses the dreaded p-word: ""Because as a senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed."" We’ll break down this fact check into two parts: Toomey’s previous beliefs on Social Security privatization and then whether Wall Street would in fact make billions off such a plan. Ted Kwong, a spokesperson for Toomey, said over email Toomey once supported younger people placing portions of their payroll taxes into ""government-regulated private accounts."" (He did not answer a question about the Senator’s current position on Social Security privatization). This is backed up in several past interviews conducted with Toomey. Shortly after he was elected to the Senate, a New York Times article noted he intended ""to continue to push for allowing young people to invest part of their Social Security payroll tax."" Toomey told the Scranton Times-Tribune in 2010 workers on the verge of retirement would be guaranteed their current benefits.    In his book, The Road to Prosperity, he laid out his beliefs in greater detail (Yes, Toomey has a book. It’s currently ranked 1,491,962 on Amazon’s top-seller list). Toomey wrote that older workers would continue to use the current Social Security system, ""But younger workers should be given a choice. Those who would prefer to stay in the current system should be allowed to do so….Others, however, should be free to deposit a portion of the payroll taxes they already pay into personal savings account instead of sending their hard-earned money to Washington."" In the book, Toomey gave an example of a beneficiary of this program as a young worker who could invest this portion of the payroll tax ""in a bundle of stocks and bonds"" and earn a much higher return than Social Security. In other words, he would want the worker to invest the money. That’s where Wall Street comes in. Right now, payroll tax for Social Security goes to a trust fund that is then invested into special securities overseen by the U.S. Treasury that are only available for the trust fund. Max Skidmore, author of The American System of Social Security: Separating Fact From Fallacy, said the administrative costs of this system are effectively nothing. They are less than one cent per dollar. That wouldn’t be the case with investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. If somebody were allowed to take a portion of their payroll tax that would normally go to Social Security and invest it, they would face much higher administrative fees. Skidmore said it would be difficult to estimate, but the total could easily reach the billions if many people were to opt for a personal account as proposed by Toomey and others. Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, said these fees would be comparable to what Americans see with their 401(k)’s, which have administrative fees. A University of Chicago study estimated if Social Security was partially privatized in one of the plans proposed by Bush fees paid to banks could be as high as $940 billion over 75 years.     As for whether Toomey’s plan of letting only younger workers put a portion of their payroll tax into a personal account should still be considered privatization, Munnell said yes. ""When people were discussing this issue,"" she said, ""that is what was being discussed.""   Our ruling A recent AFSCME ad claimed Pat Toomey supported Social Security privatization during his time as Senator:  ""Because as a senator Toomey stood up for Wall Street. He wanted to privatize Social Security and invest it in the stock market. Wall Street would make billions in fees even if the stock market crashed."" In the past, PolitiFact has tried to emphasize the difference between privatization and partial privatization because Democratic and Republican politicians have tried to distort it. Toomey has not supported full privatization, which would mean completely overhauling the system so everyone’s proceeds of the payroll tax would go to personal accounts that could be privately invested. This ad doesn’t give the full picture. It doesn’t say he was for full privatization but also doesn’t make clear the difference between full and partial privatization. Toomey has supported partial privatization of Social Security. In the plan he wrote about -- and plans favored by past politicians -- young workers were expected to invest in stocks and mutual funds that are synonymous with Wall Street. The companies with whom people did their investing would earn sizable fees.    We rate the claim Mostly True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ea4ae91e-977f-4f04-8e7c-00f22441a842",/factchecks/2016/oct/21/afscme/story-behind-attack-ads-blast-pat-toomeys-plan-soc/

Russ Feingold says U.S. ally Saudi Arabia exports extreme Islam that teaches Americans are the devil
","Near the end of an hourlong interview at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Oct. 7, 2016, Russ Feingold was asked about his criticism of Saudi Arabia in the fight against international terrorism. The Wisconsin Democrat, who is seeking to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, gave this answer: ""Here is a country that is a friend; at least an ally. A country that we have a good relationship with, that can help us in a lot of ways -- not just with oil, but in military situations such as what’s going on in a number of places in the Middle East. ""Having said that, though, this regime has embraced Wahhabism. Wahhabism is an extreme form of Islam that they have paid to export throughout the world. ""This Wahhabism is the principle force -- going from Pakistan to Ethiopia to Mali and now to Kosovo -- that is turning perfectly moderate Muslim peoples, peace-loving peoples, into people who adopt an extreme religious approach where the women are all covered up and they are basically taught that Americans are the devil. ""How can we allow a country to be perceived as a friend -- across the board, without any questions -- when they are doing such a terrible thing?"" So, has a U.S. ally ""paid to export throughout the world"" Wahhabism -- ""an extreme form of Islam"" that basically teaches ""Americans are the devil""? Saudi is an ally As Feingold intimated, Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally, even if the relationship is sometimes uneasy. Saudi Arabia has been a close ally in the Middle East since World War II, the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in April 2016, even as differences on issues such as Iran have strained the relationship. In testimony before a congressional committee in May 2016, a Middle East scholar from the Brookings Institution led off by saying: ""On the one hand, the Saudi government is a close partner of the United States on counterterrorism. On the other hand, Saudi support for an array of preachers and non-government organizations contributes to an overall climate of radicalization, making it far harder to counter violent extremism."" Politico Magazine was more blunt. In 2014, it named Saudi Arabia No. 2 on its list of America’s 25 most awkward allies, saying: ""No country buys more U.S. weapons than the autocratic, oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchy, and no country — with its obscurantist interpretation of Islam, medieval punishments and harsh treatment of women — makes for a more embarrassing U.S. ally."" It paid to export Wahhabism

Estimates on the dollar amount vary, but there is widespread agreement that Saudi Arabia pays to export Wahhabism. UCLA history professor James Gelvin, whose research specialties include Social and cultural history of the modern Middle East, told us it’s been estimated that since the 1960s, Saudi Arabia has spent $100 billion spreading Wahhabism through schools, mosques, the media and other means. Saudi expert David Andrew Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, told us he’s not convinced the amount is that high but there’s no question billions have been spent. And an August 2016 news article in the New York Times, in which three dozen academics, government officials and experts on Islam from multiple countries were interviewed, stated there has been ""lavish spending on religious outreach for half a century, estimated in the tens of billions of dollars."" Wahhabism is extreme The Times article said Wahhabism, the Islam taught in and by Saudi Arabia, is named after an 18th-century cleric who founded it and is a ""literalist, ultraconservative form of Sunni Islam"" whose adherents ""often denigrate other Islamic sects as well as Christians and Jews."" Westerners typically understand Wahhabism to be an austere form of Islam based on a literal reading of the Koran, as PolitiFact National noted in rating as Pants on Fire a claim that a school President Barack Obama attended in Indonesia taught Wahhabism. Indeed, the Islamic State adheres to strict, literal interpretations of the Koran and Islamic teachings that are rooted in Wahhabism, which is the dominant faith in Saudi Arabia, as PunditFact has reported. William McCants, director of the Brookings Institution’s Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World, told us Wahhabism ""is one of the most intolerant forms of Islam."" And in Gelvin’s view, Wahhabism ""has squeezed out other, more moderate forms of Islam and in many places in the Middle East, it is the only game in town."" Americans are the devil? Thie final part of Feingold’s claim is more debatable. ""I would agree with everything except the ‘Americans are the devil,’"" Islamic specialist Khaleel Mohammed, a religious studies professor San Diego State University, told us. ""Having studied there, I must say I never found any insinuation as such. But, I would agree that Wahhabism promotes ‘occidentophobia’ (anti-Western sentiments among Muslims)."" Weinberg, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called that part of Feingold’s claim debatable and other experts use different characterizations. The Brookings Institution’s McCants told us that ""official Saudi textbooks teach that Christians are seeking to destroy the religion and must be hated as a consequence."" Calling Feingold’s devil reference ""a bit of an exaggeration,"" Gelvin said Wahhabism conflicts with American values such as equal rights for women and popular sovereignty, ""and acts as the gateway drug for many who go on to become jihadis."" Our rating Feingold says Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has ""paid to export throughout the world"" Wahhabism -- ""an extreme form of Islam"" that basically teaches ""Americans are the devil."" Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally, albeit sometimes with strained relations. It has paid to export Wahhabism and Wahhabism is an extreme form of Islam. But it’s not clear that Wahhabism teaches that Americans are the devil.

Portman quotes Strickland's own words about 'mixed and spotty' record on guns at Ohio debate
","Republican Sen. Rob Portman fired back at former Gov. Ted Strickland’s own words about gun rights during the final debate in Cleveland for U.S. Senate. The phrase he used -- ""mixed and spotty"" -- was featured earlier in the campaign season in an attack ad by Fighting for Ohio PAC, a political action committee that supports Portman. ""Gov. Strickland in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA,"" Portman said, when a question was posed to him about the candidates’ records on gun issues. ""I’m not talking about years ago, I’m talking about this campaign. He has said he has a ‘mixed and spotty’ record on this issue and that he can be criticized for it. Those are his words, not mine. So I don’t know where he is on this issue."" Here, we wanted to know if Strickland bragged about a sterling NRA rating in the same campaign in which he acknowledged a spotty record. When Fighting for Ohio PAC used the ""mixed and spotty"" line, we rated its ad False, because Strickland’s quote was misleadingly juxtaposed with figures about Ohio’s lost jobs and tax hikes under Strickland’s governorship. Portman is on firmer ground, because Strickland’s ""mixed and spotty"" remark did emerge in the context of guns. Strickland confirmed that he was running for Portman’s Senate seat on Feb. 25, 2015. In his 12 years as a U.S. Congressman, Strickland opposed measures to restrict gun ownership. So it was surprising to Ohio political observers when Strickland appeared at forums in Cincinnati and Columbus and talked up measures for more rigorous background checks and prohibiting gun sales to suspected terrorists. ""Ted’s views about gun violence and gun safety have been deeply influenced as a result of the multiple horrific incidents of gun violence that our country has suffered, and particularly after the Sandy Hook tragedy,"" Strickland’s spokesman David Bergstein told reporters Democratic primary opponent P.G. Sittenfeld questioned whether Strickland’s change of heart on guns was motivated by the tragedy or by political timing. A recording more than two years after the attack surfaced that Sittenfeld used to his advantage. On March 10, 2015, Strickland was a guest on WOSU’s ""All Sides with Ann Fisher,"" and took a call from a listener named Jeffrey. Caller: ""Hey there. Gov. Strickland, I know you are a big supporter of the president and when you campaigned for him in 2012 you wrote an article about his support for the Second Amendment. I was just wondering how you continue to say you support the Second Amendment when you have been lobbying for additional gun laws when you were working in D.C."" Strickland: ""Well, I have not lobbied for additional gun laws and, my brother, let me put my record in front of you. As a congressman, I had an A and most of the time an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association. That has been my position, and it is my position."" Strickland had to clarify his stance on guns in a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board interview of Democratic primary candidates for Senate in February 2016. It was taped, and is the source of the ""mixed and spotty"" line. ""Has my position changed over time? It has,"" Strickland said. ""My record is mixed and spotty and I can be criticized for that."" Our ruling Portman said Strickland ""in this campaign bragged about his A-plus rating with the NRA. ...
