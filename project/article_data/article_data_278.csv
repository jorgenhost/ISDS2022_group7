No, taxpayer funds were not used to remove rock deemed by some to be racist from UW-Madison campus
","Chamberlin Rock has a storied history on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The 42-ton boulder, named for former university president and geologist Thomas Crowder Chamberlin, is a rare example of pre-Cambrian era glacial erratic that experts say is likely more than 2 billion years old, according to an Aug. 8, 2021 report in the Wisconsin State Journal.  The rock has been on the campus for decades, but recently became a source of strife over an old nickname.  According to the State Journal, in a 1925 story the rock was referred to with a phrase including the N-word. At that time, the Ku Klux Klan was active on the Madison campus.  The recent rediscovery of the nearly 100-year-old news article caused a re-evaluation of the boulder, which became a reminder to some of Wisconsin’s troubling past.  Because of that reference, the decision was made to move the boulder off campus, to a location near Lake Kegonsa, where it can still be used for educational purposes by the geoscience department, the State Journal said.  But the removal has caused other tensions, which were expressed on Twitter on Aug. 7, 2021, by Rachel Campos-Duffy, a host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" and wife of former Wisconsin congressman Sean Duffy.  ""It cost the university $50k (your tax dollars) to remove this ‘racist’ rock,"" she wrote. ""These are the priorities of the woke UW Madison Taliban."" In the tweet, she linked to the State Journal story.  For this fact-check, we’ll be focusing on her claim that Wisconsin taxpayers were on the hook for the rock removal.  There is not even a pebble of truth to that. The State Journal report itself, the very story Campos-Duffy linked to and the touchstone for her claim says the cost of the removal would be funded by private donations. That is, not tax dollars. And not tuition money.  Just to be sure, we reached out to Gary Brown, the university’s director of campus planning and landscape architecture.  ""The cost for relocation of the glacial erratic was less than $50,000 (I don’t have all the bills in yet, but it will indeed be less than $50,000),"" Brown wrote in an email on Aug. 13, 2020. ""The funding is coming from the chancellor’s office using non-taxpayer dollars."" Brown went on to say that this was always the case for the rock removal, and the source of money has consistently been listed as donations. The donor, or donors, have not been named.  We tried to reach Campos-Duffy, but did not hear back. Campos-Duffy claimed ""It cost the university $50k (your tax dollars) to remove"" a rock considered by some a symbol of racism. But the university did not use taxpayer money. Indeed, university officials have repeatedly stated that donations were going to be used to fund the removal of the rock. They were even quoted as saying such in the article Campos-Duffy cited.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280978BD100>],/factchecks/2021/aug/14/rachel-campos-duffy/no-taxpayer-funds-were-not-used-remove-rock-deemed/

Stefanik catches Cuomo misstating law on gun industry liability
","In July, several weeks before he resigned amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law that seeks to hold gun manufacturers liable for the harm their products cause. The law targets the illegal or improper marketing or sale of guns, opening their manufacturers up to civil lawsuits on the ground that the weapons pose a ""nuisance."" The law is a workaround to a 2005 federal law signed by then-President George W. Bush, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which largely shields the firearms industry from liability over shooting deaths. During a press conference to announce the bill’s signing, Cuomo said that the ""only industry in the United States of America immune from lawsuits are the gun manufacturers, thanks to George Bush and the NRA."" (The National Rifle Association is a pro-gun group that lobbied for the measure Bush signed.) Cuomo offered a similar comment in a news release announcing the signing. ""The only industry in the United States of America immune from lawsuits are the gun manufacturers,"" the release said. Later that day, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., tweeted that Cuomo had his facts wrong. ""The Worst Governor in America once again attacks law-abiding Americans' Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Every time Cuomo says the firearm industry ‘is immune from lawsuits,’ it's false."" The Worst Governor in America once again attacks law-abiding Americans' Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Every time Cuomo says the firearm industry ""is immune from lawsuits,” it's false. Should've learned from Joe Biden's false claim. #2A https://t.co/h8fwFlIFgY   In the tweet, Stefanik linked to an article by FactCheck.org from April 8, 2021, that called out President Joe Biden for saying in White House remarks that gun manufacturers were ""exempt"" from being sued. ""If it's false for Biden to make this claim, then it is also false for Cuomo to make this claim,"" said Francis Brennan, a spokesperson for Stefanik. Brennan called the tweet ""100% accurate."" So who’s right, Cuomo or Stefanik? Stefanik is closer to accurate, we found. In 2015, PolitiFact gave then-presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton a False for a statement similar to Cuomo’s — that the gun industry is ""the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability."" The 2005 law provides wide legal protection for gun manufacturers and dealers. For example, if a person buys a gun legally and then uses the gun to intentionally kill someone, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. However, the immunity for manufacturers and dealers is not all-encompassing.  The federal law lists several situations where there is no legal immunity. For instance, the law does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, or those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if a gun, when used properly, causes injury because of a product defect, such as if the gun explodes when fired. Jake Charles, executive director of Duke’s Center for Firearms Law, said the federal law also has some exceptions that allow lawsuits in certain situations, ""if, for example, the dealer or manufacturer broke laws regulating the sale or marketing or firearms."" These provisions would come into play if the New York law is challenged in court, as is considered likely. John Goldberg, a Harvard Law professor, said he understands what Cuomo was getting at, even if his language wasn’t precise. ""If he (Cuomo) was asserting that gun manufacturers are never, ever subject to liability, then what he said is not accurate,"" Goldberg said. Scenarios like an exploding gun ""are not ones that politicians are arguing about."" Charles agreed. ""It’s true the firearms industry is not immune from lawsuits."" he said. ""Certain components of the firearms industry are, however, shielded from civil lawsuits to a degree that almost no other industry or market is.""  While Stefanik didn’t note it, Cuomo’s statement included another inaccuracy — that guns are ""the only industry"" with broad protection from lawsuits. The act ""is not the first federal law to grant a particular industry immunity from tort liability,"" Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University who edited a book on gun industry litigation, told PolitiFact in 2015. For instance, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks victims of online defamation from suing service providers, like Comcast, and content providers, like YouTube, for failing to monitor or remove defamatory posts uploaded by customers. In addition, under a law passed in the 1980s, victims of injuries that they say were caused by defective vaccines are not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers. The law established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us in 2015. For example,the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said makers of small planes cannot be sued over accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. Stefanik tweeted that every time Cuomo ""says the firearm industry ‘is immune from lawsuits,’ it's false."" Stefanik is basically right. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act grants gun manufacturers some immunity from lawsuits, but it does allow some suits to proceed, depending on the grounds for the lawsuit.  It’s also not accurate for Cuomo to say that the gun industry is alone in this protection; several other industries have similar protections, including service and content providers, vaccine makers, and general aviation manufacturers. That said, the federal lawsuit protection that Cuomo was referencing — immunity from suits stemming from killings by firearms — are the most hotly contested aspect of the law in the policy arena. We rate Stefanik’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C16C640>],/factchecks/2021/aug/13/elise-stefanik/refereeing-andrew-cuomo-elise-stefanik-firearm-ind/

North Carolina school leader repeats false claims about immigration, COVID
","In North Carolina, some local school board members are tying the rise in COVID cases on immigrants who are crossing the southern border. The comments come as school leaders consider mask requirements and other health protocols for the fall semester. In Union County, located southeast of Charlotte, school board members won’t require students or employees to wear masks to start the school year. Board member Gary Sides said he received emails from parents concerned that schools won’t be following the latest recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sides addressed those questions in the board’s Aug. 3 meeting, saying he has a ""trust issue"" with the federal government. ""If you’ve been following the news, you know that our southern borders — Texas, Arizona, southern parts of California — are basically open,"" Sides said about 1 hour and 55 minutes into this video, adding later: ""If this isn’t a super spreader event, I don’t know what is."" He concluded by saying: ""So, if our government is not going to address"" the immigration issue, ""then I have a hard time believing what they’re instructing the rest of us to do."" A day earlier, Cabarrus County school board vice chairman Tim Furr said something similar:  ""Until this government (stops) letting illegal aliens in by the thousands, coming across this border without masks with COVID, putting them on buses and sending them all over the United States, we’re just beating our heads against a wall, because these numbers are going to continue to rise."" Local and national media reported on both men’s comments. So are they right about the border and immigrants driving an increase in COVID cases? No. PolitiFact recently addressed this theory about cases at the national level. PolitiFact North Carolina found no evidence to substantiate them at the state level, or even in the board members’ home counties. Sides said the border is ""basically open."" Those comments, which aren’t true, echo those of Republicans in higher office.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis accused President Joe Biden of causing the current coronavirus surge because he ""imported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border."" PolitiFact rated DeSantis’ claim False, while also addressing some misconceptions about Biden’s current border policy.  Border encounters have skyrocketed since January, but it’s inaccurate for Sides to say they’re ""basically open."" While the Biden administration has allowed certain groups of migrants to file for immigration protection, it’s also turning away most people under a public health law that Vox once described as an extension of ""one of Trump’s most anti-immigrant policies.""  In June alone, Border Patrol tallied 103,014 expulsions under the law exercised by Trump, known as Title 42. Human Rights Watch says the rule illegally blocks refugees from their right to seek asylum, and the ACLU recently announced that it is taking the Biden Administration to court. In fact, one reason border apprehensions are up is because people are attempting to cross multiple times and failing, Nicole Hallett, a professor and director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, told PolitiFact in July. ""It is simply not true that the border is ‘wide open’ for ‘illegal aliens’ to cross,"" Hallett said. ""Customs and Border Protection apprehend individuals attempting to cross between border checkpoints. The border is more secure than ever before. Fewer people are able to cross illegally without being apprehended than at any time in the past."" Sides said Biden’s immigration policy is a ""super spreader event."" There’s no concrete definition for a ""super spreader event."" However, they tend to feature a crowd of people in a small indoor space. Experts also use the term to describe events where one person infects an unusually high number of people. For example, one person at a choir practice in Washington infected 32 of the 61 people who attended. Experts told PolitiFact it’s fair for people to be concerned about the virus spreading among those living in tight quarters, such as migrant detention centers or prisons. They said some migrants may even be contributing to COVID-19 caseloads. ""But given the extensive transmission already in the U.S., the immigration contribution is akin to pouring a bucket of water into a swimming pool,"" William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, told PolitiFact for its check of DeSantis. ""It’s hard to measure and pretty trivial."" Experts say there’s no proof that immigrants are responsible for surges in cases across the country. In fact, it’s very difficult to track where they go after entering the U.S., said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council. ""There is no such data source"" tracking where migrants go, he said. ""They’re going to a wide variety of different locations and the government has privacy rules, so they can’t just give out addresses."" It’s also wrong for Sides to say migrants aren’t screened for COVID-19, which he claims about 1 hour and 57 minutes into this video. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact in April that immigrants are screened for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19. The agency said people presumed to be sick with COVID-19 are sent to local health systems for testing, diagnosis and treatment. The agency reiterated those practices in a recent statement to the Washington Post. A CBP spokesperson said migrants are given personal protective equipment the moment they are taken into custody and that they’re required to wear face masks ""at all times."" ""If anyone exhibits signs of illness in CBP custody, they are referred to local health systems for appropriate testing, diagnosis, and treatment,"" the statement says. ""CBP takes its responsibility to prevent the spread of communicable diseases very seriously. We value our partners in local communities whose work is critical to moving individuals safely out of CBP/USBP custody and through the appropriate immigration pathway."" Migrants may actually be one of the most-tested groups in the country, Reichlin-Melnick said.  ""Nearly every immigrant who is encountered and released gets COVID tested because they’re released to nonprofit organizations,"" he said. ""The nonprofits test everybody because they can’t accept someone into their shelter if they have a positive COVID test."" Despite being tested frequently, ""the data is pretty clear: Migrants are not testing positive at any higher rate,"" Reichlin-Melnick said. Experts pointed out that, if the theory about immigrants were correct, cities along the southern border would likely have disproportionately higher COVID rates than the rest of the country. But that’s not the case.   There’s ""no increase in COVID-19 cases in areas (around the) border where migrants cross or where they go after crossing,"" David Wohl, a physician who studies infectious diseases at UNC, told PolitiFact NC. ""More obvious to (almost) any objective observer is that this is scapegoating and conflation of two different issues that have become very political,"" Wohl said. Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, told PolitiFact the same thing in an interview for the recent check of DeSantis. ""The pattern of distribution of coronavirus cases does not correspond in any way to immigrant movement,"" Caplan said.  It’s important to note that COVID cases are rising in North Carolina and across the U.S. because of delta variant infections in unvaccinated people. (Gov. Roy Cooper relayed that analysis from doctors during his most recent press briefing. And experts echoed that message in interviews with PolitiFact NC.) Whether those North Carolinians are U.S. citizens is not something the Health and Human Services Department tracks.  So it would be difficult for Sides to prove migrants are responsible for large COVID-19 outbreaks in North Carolina. (Under our rating process, the burden is on the politician or speaker to prove his claim. In this case, Sides didn’t respond to our questions.) Gov. Roy Cooper’s office has ""no information"" to support the claims by Furr and Sides, spokeswoman Mary Scott Winstead told PolitiFact NC. North Carolina does track demographic data such as race and ethnicity that could, in theory, point to migrants as the cause of a major outbreak. But currently, that’s not what the data suggests. According to DHHS data, the state’s non-Hispanic population makes up 81% of total cases while its Hispanic population accounts for roughly 19%. (For context, Hispanic people are about 10% of North Carolina’s population) In the week of Aug. 1, the state recorded 14,223 cases among non-Hispanic people. It recorded 2,028 among Hispanic people and counted 8,662 cases for which demographic data wasn’t available. A caveat: the state doesn’t have demographic information for every positive COVID case. Sometimes the infected person doesn’t disclose their race or ethnicity. But it has ethnicity information for most cases, and the data show that non-Hispanic people have accounted for a majority of cases each week of the calendar year.  Rachel Graham, who teaches in the epidemiology department at UNC’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, says it’s possible the case numbers disproportionately represent people who have lifestyles that allow them to get tested for COVID-19 and take off work. Still, Graham said there’s ""no evidence"" to support Sides’ claim, referring to it as political ""flame-throwing."" In Sides’ home county, statistics aren’t much different from state-level data. In Union County, Hispanic people account for 28% of cases while non-hispanic people account for 72% of cases. The week of Aug. 1, the state counted 321 cases among non-Hispanic people, 73 cases among Hispanic people and 233 cases with missing information. Hispanic people make up 11.5% of Union County’s population. Sides said the border is ""basically open"" and causing a ""super spreader event,"" also casting immigrants as a key reason COVID cases are rising. The border is not ""basically open."" Border Patrol is turning away most people who attempt to enter the country. Meanwhile, there’s no evidence to support the theory that immigrants are the primary cause of increasing COVID cases. National trends show spikes in communities far from the border, and North Carolina data shows that most cases are among non-hispanics. We rate their claims False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BAEE40>],/factchecks/2021/aug/13/gary-sides/north-carolina-school-leader-repeats-false-claims-/

Fact-checking a TikTok post about a 0.05% risk of dying from COVID-19
","A TikTok user broke out a pen, a sheet of paper and her cell phone camera to show the math she used to find the chances of someone dying from COVID-19. But experts said her method is not the right way to assess this risk.  In the July 26 video, a woman named Brittany Gresh divided the global total for COVID-19 cases (193 million at the time) by the world population (7.8 billion) to get ""your chance at getting COVID"" — 2.4%. She then divided COVID-19 deaths (4.1 at the time) by 193 million, to get 2.1%. To get the total chance of dying if you got COVID-19, she multiplied both percentages to get ""0.0005, or 0.05% chance of dying from COVID."" ""This is what they want you to be afraid of,"" she concluded.  The TikTok video was shared on Facebook, where it was flagged for potentially sharing false content. (Read more about our partnerships with Facebook and TikTok).  Health experts said that Gresh’s math is an oversimplification and lacks context. Dr. Josh Michaud, associate director for Global Health Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, explained that part of what Gresh calculated is called the case fatality rate, which is the number of deaths divided by the number of reported cases. But Michaud said that at this stage, such an estimate is based on numbers that are underreported and incomplete. ""You can use different methods to try and estimate what the true percent of people infected is, but it is just an estimate and a guess. All of these numbers have to be taken with a big grain of salt,"" Michaud said. Dr. Katrine Wallace, epidemiologist and adjunct assistant professor of epidemiology at University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, also told PolitiFact that it’s difficult to ascertain a case fatality rate during an ongoing pandemic, when numbers keep changing.  Organizations such as the World Health Organization, Johns Hopkins University, and Kaiser Family Foundation each keep a daily tab on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world. When the TikTok video published on July 26, their metrics showed that cumulative cases were around 193 million, which is in line with the number Gresh used. But by the morning of Aug. 11, the total number of reported cases worldwide had grown to around 204 million. Deaths from COVID-19 are also underreported. The WHO found that in 2020, 1.8 million deaths were reported, but the organization estimates the true number of losses last year was nearly double — 3.3 million. ""Many countries still lack functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems with the capacity to provide accurate, complete and timely data on births, deaths and causes of death,"" information on WHO’s website says. Wallace pointed to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic as an example. (Reports vary on the case fatality rate for SARS –– some say 9.6% and others report 11%.) ""It took us two years to get a case fatality rate from that epidemic,"" she said, ""and a lot of it was based on following up on cases that ended up passing away from long term complications and following up on cases that were suspected cases that nobody coded correctly at the beginning of that pandemic."" Wallace told PolitiFact that the ""0.05% chance"" ignores the different types of risks that individuals across the world face, including a person’s age, health status or how widespread  COVID-19 is in their community. For example, Wallace said, a person who lives in Florida, where reported cases have topped 2.7 million, is at a higher risk than someone who lives in Vermont, a state whose population is 34 times smaller and where the per capita case rate is about a third of what Florida has experienced. Florida’s positive case rate was reported to be 12,892 per 100,000 people, as of Aug. 9 compared to Vermont’s 4,058 cases per 100,000. On a larger comparable scale, the country of Greenland, where the population is 56,225 people, has only reported 182 cases during the pandemic. That pales in comparison to what a person might encounter in the United States, which has amassed nearly 36 million cases among its more than 328 million people. ""Risk is not uniform across the world,"" Wallace said. ""So she’s doing this calculation like this is your risk of dying globally, and the reason you don’t see that statistic is because it really isn’t applicable to anybody."" Dr. Emily Smith, epidemiologist and assistant professor at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said that using the global population and the reported number of 193 million cases to calculate the chance of getting COVID-19 only encompasses the number of people who have had the disease — not the number of people who could still get it. Anyone who hasn’t already had COVID-19 or who hasn’t been vaccinated yet is at risk, she said. ""The reason this has caused (a) global pandemic is because everyone has the chance to get COVID,"" Smith said. ""No one has pre-existing immunity. We’ve never heard of anyone that’s immune. Everyone’s chance at baseline is essentially 100%.""  It can’t be predicted who will get very sick or who will die, Smith said, noting that both people with or without pre-existing conditions are at risk. Almost 80% of people who died from COVID-19 were older than 65, according to the CDC.  But in recent months, as more older people are vaccinated and the delta variant spreads, they state that younger people aged 18-49 are now the biggest increase of hospitalized patients. ""(There’s) lots of cases of perfectly healthy or young people who also get very sick or who also die,"" she said. ""So, probability, numbers and math are good for thinking about population health, but they’re not so good for thinking about your individual risk."" Smith said the number of reported COVID-19 cases will always be an undercount, because not everyone gets tested for COVID-19. Many people catch the virus and never show symptoms, or only show mild symptoms, and don’t know they are infected with the virus. Wallace agreed: ""Any rates that we see in the real world data about testing, we know are undercounted."" PolitiFact reached out to Gresh for comment. She stuck by her claim, stating that she used the numbers available at that time which ""are not incorrect nor misinformative."" ""I did not say nor did I insinuate the global percentage related to individual chance,"" she wrote. ""In fact, I repeatedly made the statement the math reflected (accurately) the chances of being ‘a person on this earth catching and then also dying from COVID.’""   A TikTok video said the chances of dying from COVID-19 are 0.05%. The percentages used in the video don't account for the varying factors of risk that individuals face around the world, such as their age, where they live and comorbidities.  In addition, both experts and data show that the number of people in the world who have not yet been infected or vaccinated are still at risk of catching the virus and they aren’t included in the count. Mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic people who don’t get tested are being left out as well. It’s too early to accurately calculate a case fatality rate for a pandemic that is ongoing. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097089040>],/factchecks/2021/aug/13/tiktok-posts/experts-break-down-numbers-catching-or-dying-covid/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Coronavirus', 'Ken Paxton']","
Is the Biden administration 'not even testing' migrants released in the U.S.?
","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton joined conservative host Chris Salcedo on his Newsmax show Aug. 7 to sound off against the Biden administration and its immigration policies as the COVID-19 delta variant fuels another nationwide wave.   ""As you know, Biden and NGOs are releasing illegal aliens into Texas with the China virus ... and they are losing control as the infected are wandering off inside of Texas cities with free reign inside those cities and towns,"" Salcedo said. ""This is exactly what we filed our lawsuit about several months ago,"" Paxton replied, referring to an April suit that accuses the Biden administration of encouraging COVID-19 spread in border communities. ""And it relates to the president just letting people in.""  ""They’re not even testing these people,"" Paxton said.   Paxton’s first claim that the Biden administration is ""just letting people in"" is a claim that has been widely repeated and roundly debunked. PolitiFact has found that, although tens of thousands of people cross the border undetected, the vast majority of migrants encountered by Border Patrol are sent back to Mexico under Title 42 — a Trump-era policy designed to curb COVID-19 spread that the Biden administration has left in place. Rather, this fact check focuses on Paxton’s claim that the administration is ""not even testing these people"" being released into the U.S. We found that while there are testing protocols in place, there are examples of cracks in the system through which some untested migrants slip through.  COVID-19 testing protocols have existed at the border under both the present and former administrations. Testing is done via a patchwork of federal agencies, local governments, organizations and contractors at various stages of the immigration process.  In April, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security told PolitiFact that it works with state authorities, local authorities and non-governmental organizations to ensure that ""100% of noncitizens"" are tested for COVID-19 ""at some point during their immigration journey."" The agency also has told PolitiFact that a negative coronavirus test is required by the federal government before entry to the U.S.  ""CBP takes its responsibility to prevent the spread of communicable diseases very seriously,"" a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson told PolitiFact in a statement. ""We value our partners in local communities whose work is critical to moving individuals safely out of CBP/USBP custody and through the appropriate immigration pathway.""  While local governments and non-governmental organizations test migrants released from Border Patrol custody, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement test those released in areas without local testing capability. U.S. Health and Human Services is responsible for testing unaccompanied children.   The agencies did not provide a list of the third-party non-governmental organizations or contractors performing tests. Nonetheless, we do know of some examples of local testing being performed. In Brownsville, for instance, the city conducts a rapid test to each person Border Patrol drops off at the city’s bus terminal. As of Tuesday, the city had tested 13,443 migrants for COVID-19, with 1,249 testing positive and quarantining in the U.S. — a positivity rate of 9.3%. (As of Aug. 6, Texas' positivity rate was 17.3%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) In Laredo, the Holding Institute, a nonprofit, tests migrants released by Border Patrol and quarantines those who test positive, although the nonprofit did not respond to a request for testing numbers Friday. The agencies also didn’t provide comprehensive testing numbers for migrants released into the U.S. However, a federal document obtained this month by NBC News shows that, over the previous two to three weeks, more than 18% of migrant families and 20% of unaccompanied minors tested positive for COVID-19 before leaving Border Patrol custody. Migrants who test positive before being released are given hotel rooms in which to quarantine.  Federal officials attribute the high COVID positivity rate among undocumented migrants to ""the highly transmissible Delta variant combined with lengthier stays in crowded facilities,"" NBC News reported. Paxton’s office did not respond to a request for comment.   It’s unclear how many migrants may be bypassing COVID testing screens as they wind their way through the immigration system and are released by Border Patrol. But the El Paso Times revealed Thursday one such example in Laredo.   The Times reported about an agreement between Border Patrol and the city of Laredo in which migrants released by the agency would be put on buses bound for Austin, Dallas and Houston without being tested. A city spokesperson told the Times that the agreement was a result of strained testing capacity.   ""If these migrants do test positive, or if any one of them needs care at the hospital, we can’t. We don’t have capacity at the hospital,"" spokesperson Noraida Negron told the newspaper. ""Our NGOs were literally busting at the seams.""  During a Newsmax interview, Paxton claimed that federal officials are ""not even testing"" migrants who are released by Border Patrol into U.S. communities.   The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said that ""100% of noncitizens"" are tested for COVID-19 ""at some point during their immigration journey,"" and that this testing is performed by a mix of federal agencies, local governments and non-governmental organizations.  While there are numerous clear examples of testing happening before migrants are released into the U.S., we know of one recent example in which strained testing capabilities led to untested migrants being released. However, the full scope of untested migrants is unknown.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979CD500>],/factchecks/2021/aug/13/ken-paxton/biden-administration-not-even-testing-migrants-rel/

Yes, about 324,000 Americans per year experience domestic violence during pregnancy
","U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, is part of a federal push to protect pregnant people from domestic violence.  Moore introduced legislation Aug. 3, 2021 along with lawmakers from New Hampshire, Illinois and North Carolina that would fund research on the relationship between intimate partner violence and health. The legislation comes after incidents of domestic violence increased last year amid social isolation created by the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home orders.  If passed, the bill would launch two studies. One, from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, would examine whether domestic violence victims are more at risk of maternal mortality or severe maternal morbidity. The other, from the National Academy of Medicine would look at whether domestic violence increases the risk of suicide, substance use and drug overdose among pregnant and post-partum people.  It would also issue grants to nonprofits, health care providers and other groups working to improve health outcomes for survivors of intimate partner violence, and instruct the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to create guidance for health care providers to look for signs of abuse in patients.  Moore, who is herself a survivor of domestic violence, has worked on other bills in Congress that sought to curb violence and give support to survivors.  ""324,000 pregnant people experience domestic violence during their pregnancy,"" she tweeted Aug. 3, 2021 about the latest piece of legislation, ""which creates trauma that stays with survivors, impacting their physical and emotional health."" There’s no question that enduring violence creates trauma. But is the statistic in the first part of Moore’s claim correct?  Let’s take a look at the source.  When asked for evidence of the claim, Samara Sheff, communications director for Moore’s office, sent a backgrounder for the legislation which attributes the statistic to an article about abuse during pregnancy from the March of Dimes, a nonprofit that works to improve the health of moms and babies.  That article, which says that more than 320,000 women are abused by their partners during pregnancy each year, cites the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a professional association of doctors with those specialties.  In a February 2012 assessment of intimate partner violence by the association’s Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women, the organization wrote that about 324,000 pregnant people in the United States each year were abused during their pregnancy.  Intimate partner violence has been associated with poor pregnancy weight gain, infection, anemia, tobacco use, stillbirth, pelvic fracture, placental abruption, fetal injury, preterm delivery and low birth weight, the assessment says, though it added that more research on the topic was needed.  Pregnant and postpartum people are at nearly twice the risk of death by homicide than people who are not pregnant or postpartum, a 2016 study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found.  More than 3.5 million people give birth in the U.S. each year.  Moore said that 324,000 pregnant people experience domestic violence during their pregnancy.  That number is backed up by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  We rate her claim True.    ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D5FC00>],/factchecks/2021/aug/13/gwen-moore/yes-about-324000-americans-year-experience-domesti/

No evidence actor Mike Mitchell’s death was linked to his COVID-19 vaccine shot
","Actor and former bodybuilder Mike Mitchell died July 23 from a heart attack in Turkey, a country that had begun offering COVID-19 vaccine booster shots a month earlier to health care workers and people over 50. Mitchell, who got the booster, was 65 years old. An Aug. 8 Instagram video suggests the third shot was to blame for Mitchell’s death. It highlights what appear to be Facebook posts Mitchell made following each of his three vaccine shots, dated Feb. 22, March 20 and July 16. The video then cuts to a July 24 headline announcing Mitchell’s death. Screenshots of the comments under some of Mitchell’s posts have also circulated online. One of them appears to show Mitchell responding to a commenter’s question by saying he received two shots of Sinovac-CoronaVac, the Chinese vaccine which the World Health Organization approved for emergency use in June, followed by the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Mitchell’s Facebook page is now private, so we couldn’t verify whether the Facebook posts depicted in the video came from him. What the post fails to mention is that Mitchell had a history of heart issues. In 2007, Mitchell said he was forced to quit bodybuilding after he had five major heart operations. In his hometown newspaper in Scotland, Mitchell was quoted as saying his doctor warned him never to train again after his heart stopped for almost 10 minutes during one of these procedures. News reports from People and TMZ credited a representative for Mitchell as saying the cause of death was a heart attack. We reached out to his talent agency for details, but did not hear back. The post mirrors other social media claims falsely tying the vaccines to the deaths of celebrities, including ​​rapper DMX, baseball legend Hank Aaron and boxer Marvelous Marvin Hagler. As of Aug. 11, the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, lists 1,434 reports of myocardial infarctions, or heart attacks, occurring after vaccination in the U.S. The agencies that run VAERS caution that these reports alone are not enough to determine whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse event. Anyone can submit a report, and researchers use the reports to see whether an adverse event warrants further study. The CDC doesn’t consider heart attacks a serious adverse event of interest for the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. Other heart conditions like myocarditis and pericarditis, are being studied as possible side effects of some vaccines, including Pfizer’s. The CDC says they’re occurring mostly in male adolescents and young adults. Myocarditis and pericarditis are conditions that inflame the heart or the membrane surrounding it. Either of these conditions can result in a heart attack. According to the CDC, most of the vaccinated patients with myocarditis and pericarditis who received care responded well to treatment and quickly recovered. Without access to Mitchell’s autopsy results, we can’t say what caused his heart attack. But we found no evidence that it was related to the vaccine. ""It’s important to remember that heart attacks occur all the time, vaccine or no vaccine,"" said Dr. Ira Taub, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children’s Hospital in Ohio. ""With over 160 million vaccinated Americans, it is inevitable that some will have a heart attack after vaccination. However, that’s very different than saying that the heart attack is caused by vaccination."" The American Heart Association advises people with a history of cardiovascular risk factors, like heart attacks, to get vaccinated. This is because infection can be more severe for this population, and the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the potential risks. Mitchell lived in Turkey, which began vaccinating people in January with the Sinovac-CoronaVac shot, a vaccine the WHO only recently validated for emergency use. According to the WHO, a large phase 3 trial in Brazil found that two weeks after the second dose, the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine was 51% effective against symptomatic infection, and 100% effective against both severe infection and hospitalization. Turkey authorized the use of a third COVID-19 shot in June — and included Pfizer’s vaccine as an option — as the first people to get vaccinated got their shots roughly six months earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported. The CDC has not yet advised people in the U.S. on whether to receive a COVID-19 booster shot, but that may change soon. An Instagram post suggests that Mitchell’s fatal heart attack was tied to his third COVID-19 shot. But there is no evidence linking his heart attack to the vaccine, and the post failed to mention that he had a history of heart conditions and surgeries. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D5F4C0>],/factchecks/2021/aug/12/instagram-posts/no-evidence-actor-mike-mitchells-death-was-linked-/

Per-mile fee would be tested, but no proof plan is aimed at making cars obsolete
","The $1 trillion infrastructure bill making its way through Congress would take a step toward creating a fee that would tax every mile Americans drive to pay for the upkeep of roads and highways. But the bill would only launch a pilot program to test a motor vehicle per-mile user fee. It would not create a fee.  And, if in the future such a fee were created, it’s anyone guess how much it would be — or whether it would replace or be on top of the federal gasoline tax, which currently pays for road building. Which means a viral image goes too far in claiming that the bill’s provision would halt car-driving. ""Buried on page 508 of the 2,702 page infrastructure bill is a pilot program for a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee, which is basically a long-term plan to make it too expensive to drive a car,"" says the image, which references a blog post that makes essentially the same claim. The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The infrastructure bill passed the Senate, 69-40, on Aug. 10. The legislation states that the pilot program for the user fee is envisioned as a possible way ""to restore and maintain the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and to improve and maintain the surface transportation system."" The pilot program, according to the bill’s text, would ""test the design, acceptance, implementation and financial sustainability of a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee,"" and provide recommendations for establishing such a fee.  Volunteers would be recruited to test different methods of recording miles driven by passenger and commercial vehicles. They would pay the fees and then be reimbursed by the government. The pilot program would run from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2026. A report would be issued on ""whether motor vehicle per-mile user fees can maintain the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and improve and maintain the surface transportation system."" While the prospects of a user fee being approved are unknown, the idea to include it in the infrastructure bill was floated in March by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but then quickly walked back. The fee has long been discussed as a means of replacing the gas tax as the country moves toward electric cars, said Michele Nellenbach, vice president of strategic initiatives at the Bipartisan Policy Center. States have been doing their own pilot programs in the context of replacing gas taxes as well. If a federal fee were created, both it and the gas tax could be charged for some period of time while Americans move from gas-powered to electric-powered cars, Nellenbach said.  But even if it were created, we don’t know now how much it would be or whether it would be enough to make car-driving obsolete. And there are other variables that would help determine whether a fee would make driving a car more expensive. According to a Tax Foundation analysis: A per-mile user fee could be done with a flat fee per mile, or with different rates for different locations. The Highway Trust Fund is projected to run out of money by the end of 2021, so it is highly unlikely that a mileage fee could replace the gas tax in time, which would mean finding ways to add revenue or to the fund, through a fee or by other means, or to reduce its expenditures. A Facebook claim states that the federal infrastructure bill includes ""a pilot program for a national motor vehicle per-mile user fee, which is basically a long-term plan to make it too expensive to drive a car."" The legislation does include a pilot program to test a per-mile user fee among volunteers who are willing to participate. But there isn’t evidence now that it would become permanent or, if it did, that such a fee would end up making driving so prohibitively expensive as to make it obsolete.

No evidence airline crews walking off flights to protest vaccine mandate
","A Facebook post cheered on airline crews for walking off of their flights to protest their employers’ vaccine mandates — but there’s no evidence such protests are happening. The Aug. 8 post claims that ""flights across America (are) all backed up because pilots/crew are walking off boarded flights."" ""They are refusing the mandated jab,"" the caption reads.   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There have been flight cancellations, but they were for other reasons. Airlines and unions representing flight crews confirmed that this Facebook post is false. During the first week of August, Spirit Airlines canceled hundreds of flights due to a cascading effect of weather delays, system outages and staff shortages. Thousands of passengers were left stranded by the cancellations. But the staff shortages didn’t have anything to do with vaccines. CEO Ted Christie told CNBC that because of the continuing delays, Spirit flight crews had reached the maximum hours they could legally work each day and timed out.  ""The rumor about crews walking off because of vaccine rules is completely untrue,"" a Spirit spokesperson told PolitiFact.  American Airlines experienced the same problem, caused by severe weather at its Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport hub. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots for American Airlines, said the claim was false. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants across 17 airlines, also rejected the claim. Sarah Jantz, spokesperson for American Airlines, said the company hasn’t announced a vaccine mandate, but it does offer incentives including an extra day off in 2022 and a $50 bonus. United Airlines announced on Aug. 6 that all U.S.-based employees will be required in the fall to get vaccinated and upload their vaccination records to the airline’s internal system. The mandate is expected to take effect five weeks after the Food and Drug Administration announces full approval of a COVID-19 vaccine — the vaccines are currently authorized for emergency use — or five weeks after Sept. 20, whichever comes first.  Have any United Airline crew members walked off of flights in protest? No, says airline spokesperson Leslie Scott. Even before the mandate, 90% of flight attendants and 80% of pilots had already been vaccinated and uploaded their vaccination cards as proof.  Other airlines are following suit and updating their vaccine policies, including Hawaiian Airlines, which announced on Aug. 9 that all of its U.S.-based employees must receive their final shot by Nov. 1. The only exemptions will be for medical or religious reasons. In the two days after the announcement, communications manager Tara Shimooka said, the company was not seeing any walk offs. Frontier Airlines announced a policy urging all of its direct employees to be vaccinated by Oct. 1. But it’s not a mandate –– employees who can’t be vaccinated or choose not to will be asked to regularly provide a negative COVID-19 test.  Since May 17, Delta has required all of its new hires to get vaccinated.  A Facebook post claimed that flights have been backed up because airline crews across the country were walking off of boarded flights to protest a vaccine mandate. Spirit and American Airlines have both had numerous flight cancellations due to issues including bad weather, staff shortages and system outages. But both airlines said no crew members have walked off flights to protest vaccine requirements.  United, Frontier, Delta and Hawaiian Airlines have each implemented vaccine mandates or policies for their employees, but representatives for each of the companies rejected the claim that crew members have protested them..

Conservative pundits say Biden and Democrats want more lockdowns. That’s not accurate
","Some right-wing commentators are warning that the White House and Democrats around the country are plotting another round of stay-at-home orders and business closures, public-health measures that devastated the economy and divided the nation in 2020, even as they slowed the spread of COVID-19. But they’re basing these claims largely on innuendo and conjecture rather than facts.  ""White House chatter is that lockdowns for delta variant all but a done deal,"" conservative commentator Jack Posobiec wrote on Twitter July 29. ""Virtually all blue states are cooperating with WH/CDC. They’re aiming for late 2nd week of August, per WH official."" A few days later, conservative host Dan Bongino said on his podcast, ""they want to lock it down again. … The libs will never let coronavirus panic go."" The claims from Bongino and Posobiec appeared to hinge on White House statements that the administration would listen to guidance from health officials in developing its response to the delta variant outbreak. A Fox News article on those statements was headlined: ""White House won't rule out future lockdowns, school closures if CDC says so."" But in each case, the claims left out what the White House has affirmatively said on the matter: that it’s doing what it can to promote vaccination and mask wearing in areas affected by the delta variant, to avoid the need for the lockdowns, shutdowns or school closures.  ""We are not going back to that,"" President Joe Biden said in a July 27 statement. Since then, Biden has repeatedly spoken against lockdowns and instead emphasized vaccination to stem the rise of the delta variant. And we found no evidence for Posobiec’s claim that any such measures are being coordinated with, or advocated by, Democratic governors. Biden has an incentive to avoid another round of lockdowns, which would imperil the country’s fragile economic recovery. ""Our economy has come a long way over the last six months,"" Biden said in remarks in July about his legislative agenda, including for infrastructure.  ""We can’t slow down now."" The Fox News report was based on a back and forth during a press briefing between reporter Peter Doocy and White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre. Doocy: ""So, President Biden says that we are not returning to lockdowns, shutdowns, and school closures, but he also once said that we didn’t have to wear masks anymore once we were vaccinated. So why should Americans trust him now?"" Jean-Pierre: ""We listen to the scientists; we listen to the expert(s)."" Doocy: ""If scientists come to you at some point down the line and say, ‘It is our opinion that there should be shutdowns and there should be school closures,’ you would do that?"" Jean-Pierre replied: ""We listen to the CDC"" and expert guidance. She also said that Biden wants all schools to reopen. Posobiec’s post, in which he called lockdowns ""all but a done deal,"" appeared that same day. In response to the Fox News report, Jean-Pierre tweeted part of Biden’s July 27 statement against a return to lockdowns.  The next day, Jean-Pierre was asked by a reporter whether there are ""conversations in the White House, or between the White House and scientific advisers, about more lockdowns, partial lockdowns, or anything along those lines?""  The United States has the tools to fight the variant, she said, and ""we are not going to head towards a lockdown."" Bongino’s report cited a different White House statement. He played a clip of White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s Aug. 2 briefing when she was asked about the potential for more guidelines on COVID-19. Here’s what she said:  ""The President is keeping the option open of making sure that the CDC and our public health officials can make recommendations on what’s needed to keep the American people safe. I’m not in a position to preview that or to get ahead of any decisions they may make."" ""We’ve been clear we’re not going back to the shutdowns of March of 2020. We are not going back to the economy shutting down. We’ve made too much progress. Too many people are vaccinated. There’s been too much progress on the economic front. But, again, he has said from the beginning that we’re going to be guided by the science, guided by our public health experts, and we’re not going to take options off the table of what they may recommend."" Bongino called Psaki a flip-flopper. ""They want to lock it down again,"" Bongino said. ""Why? Because they need an excuse to bankrupt you to have you more dependent on government.""  When Biden announced new rules July 29 to push more federal workers to get vaccinated, he said: ""We have the tools to prevent this new wave of COVID from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw happen last year.""  He made nearly the same remarks on Aug. 3 and Aug. 6.  To be clear, a shutdown in which there are widespread closures of businesses or public facilities is a more severe step than guidelines, such as the CDC’s recommendations on wearing masks in schools. When Biden was asked July 30 ""Should Americans expect more guidelines coming up, more restrictions because of COVID?"" he replied: ""In all probability."" Federal health officials have also dismissed the idea that lockdowns will be needed. ""I don't think we're going to see lockdowns,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s ""This Week"" Aug. 1. ""I think we have enough of the percentage of people in the country, not enough to crush the outbreak, but I believe enough to not allow us to get into the situation we were in last winter,"" Fauci said. Dr. ​​Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told ""Good Morning America"" Aug. 2: ""We want to avoid lockdowns at all costs. But that means we’re going to have to do some other things that won’t necessarily be welcomed by people, such as the new recommendation of wearing masks in indoor gatherings, even if you’re vaccinated."" Some Democratic governors say they’re leaving their options open, but pushing vaccination to avoid any need for shutdowns. ""I am not here to announce capacity limits or closures or anything like that,"" Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said Aug. 5. ""In fact, everything we are currently doing is aimed at preventing just those scenarios."" At a press briefing, a reporter asked North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper whether he would consider bringing back limits on nursing home visits, mask mandates and business shutdowns if vaccination rates lag.  ""The health and safety of North Carolinians remains the primary objective here, so all options are on the table,"" Cooper said Aug. 4. ""But we really believe people now know what to do to protect themselves and other people and our primary focus is going to be on vaccinations ... We don't want to do those other things if we don’t have to."" Cooper spokesperson Ford Porter told PolitiFact that a stay-at-home order and business restrictions ""are not currently under consideration."" Bobby Leddy, a spokesperson for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, told PolitiFact that even some less restrictive rules aren’t being discussed. ""There are no plans for statewide mask requirements, gathering limitations or vaccination verification,"" Leddy said. Hawaii Gov. David Ige signed an executive order Aug. 10 limiting social gatherings to no more than 10 people indoors and no more than 25 outdoors. But Ige did not call for a widespread lockdown. Michael Fraser, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said he hasn’t heard about states moving toward stay-at-home orders. ""As someone who works with all state health officials nationwide, I can unequivocally share that no one is planning a return to stay-at-home orders at this time or in the near future,"" Fraser said. ""That being said, we all need to get this variant under control and if things get worse, I am sure some folks will want to discuss putting all mitigation strategies back on the table."" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker cautioned against ruling out any mitigation options. ""There were people last summer who thought we should rule out a potential additional mitigation and you saw what happened in September, October, November, December,"" he said in an interview with Fox 32 Chicago aired July 20. ""I mean it was worse than it was in April and May."" Still, asked a week later about business owners concerned about the prospect of a shutdown, Pritzker said his focus was on mask use and getting people vaccinated. ""Barring the introduction of a new variant that requires a change of course, the state is not looking to implement past mitigation measures when there is an effective vaccine available,"" Pritzker spokesperson Jordan Abudayyeh told PolitiFact. Posobiec said the White House plans to call for lockdowns to curb the spread of the delta variant. We found no evidence of that. The Biden administration has said it’s listening to guidance from public health officials, but emphasizing vaccinations and mask wearing to avoid the need for lockdowns or school closures. Biden has repeatedly said that between vaccines and masks, the U.S. has the tools to combat this wave without resorting to shutdowns. We rate this claim False.

It’s common for hospitals to be full, but COVID-19 adds unusual burdens
","Should people be worried that the number of COVID-19-related hospitalizations reported in their area might overwhelm health care systems?  Posts on social media would have you believe that there’s no cause for alarm — even if cases of COVID-19 are on the rise near you.  Tampa nurse Erin Marie Olszewski shared such a post on Instagram. ""It’s not unusual for hospitals to sit at max or near max capacity on any given day,"" Olszewski’s post — a screenshot of one of her tweets — reads. ""The media would like you to think this is a new thing, but it’s not.""  Her post on Instagram was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In an email to PolitiFact, Olszewski pointed to a Johns Hopkins University webpage with weekly hospitalization trends. The data, from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, spans a time period from late July 2020 to the present, and ""displays the 7-day trend in overall and COVID-19-specific hospitalization occupancy data."" The numbers show a fairly steady level of occupied hospital beds over the past year. ""COVID is not the reason for busy hospitals,"" Olszewski wrote in the email.  But her post suggests that the impact of rapidly increasing COVID-19-related hospitalizations is routine for health care systems. It’s not, and it’s putting an unusual strain on hospitals. Representatives from hospital associations said it isn’t unusual for hospitals to operate close to their maximum capacity. This is because hospitals are continually adjusting their capacity based on demand.  ""They may have some rooms on a floor or in a specific unit that are physically there, but since they aren’t staffed, they aren’t available for patient use,"" said Marc Lotter, a spokesperson for the Florida Hospital Association. ""Should the need rise, hospitals will staff those beds and make them available.""  Hospitals are careful to maintain enough capacity for unexpected circumstances and emergencies, Lotter said, but to contain costs, they do not keep rooms staffed or available if they aren’t in use or likely to be needed.  But not all capacity utilization is the same. A heavy load of COVID-19 patients places an unusual strain on hospital capacity. As of Aug. 11, HHS data indicates that nationwide, about 76.4% inpatient beds in the U.S. are in use — and 10.5% of those beds are in use for COVID-19-specific reasons. Nationally, 75.4% of ICU beds in the U.S. are in use, and 22.2% of those beds are in use for COVID-19.  In Olszewski’s home state of Florida — a recent COVID-19 hotspot — the numbers are far higher: 90.1% of ICU beds are in use, and nearly half of those are being used for COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, 86.2% of inpatient beds are in use, more than a quarter of them for COVID-19-specific reasons.  ""There is no question many Florida hospitals are reaching their max capacity and beyond,"" Lotter said.  He referenced Aug. 5 data from his group indicating that 60% of hospitals surveyed in Florida were expecting to face a ""critical staffing shortage in the next seven days,"" which he said would affect capacity. Additionally, 27% of surveyed Florida hospitals expected that they would need to expand into ""non-care areas"" such as conference rooms and cafeterias, to accommodate patients in the next seven days. In areas where COVID-19 patients account for a high percentage of hospitalizations, there are ""implications for everyone who needs care for emergent or non-emergent reasons,"" said Thomas Jordan, a spokesperson for the American Hospital Association. ""Caring for COVID-19 patients is resource-intensive, including from a materials perspective — PPE, oxygen, etc. — and also from a space perspective,"" he said. ""COVID-19 patients must be isolated from non-COVID-19 patients by either placing them in the same units as other COVID patients or in single occupancy rooms.

State Sen. Glenford Shibley says that Rhode Island is the only state that does not arm campus police at public colleges
","
Rhode Island has long struggled with whether to arm its police on public college campuses.

In January, state Sen. Glenford J. Shibley introduced legislation that would allow officers who patrol the campuses of the state’s three public institutions -- the University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island -- to carry guns as long as they go through the requisite training.

""Rhode Island is the only state where officers at state-supported institutions carry out their duties unarmed,"" said a General Assembly news release issued on the Coventry Republican’s behalf,  announcing the introduction of his bill on Dec. 9.

At a hearing Feb. 28 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Shibley repeated that statement, according to a Journal story, and expressed frustration with the state’s inaction on arming campus police.

""What’s the holdup?"" he said. ""Who’s waiting for what tragedy?""

Shibley’s claim intrigued us. Does the Ocean State really stand alone when it comes to allowing police on public campuses to carry guns?

Let’s begin with some history. The Board of Governors for Higher Education first considered arming campus police at Rhode Island’s public institutions in 2000. URI conducted its own study two years later but decided that the time wasn’t right to make the move.

In 2003, Brown -- a private institution -- decided to arm its police officers. Three years later, after the university’s sworn officers each received training in diversity, weapons and use-of-force, they were armed with semiautomatic pistols.

The state Board of Governors formed a committee in 2008 to take another look at arming campus police in the wake of the 2007 killing of 32 people at Virginia Tech by a lone gunman, and other shootings at schools elsewhere in the country.

In its March 22, 2010, report, the committee said that it had reached consensus that the Board of Governors should consider a plan to arm campus police at one or more of Rhode Island’s public institutions. But no action has been taken since then.

When we called Shibley, a former police officer and assistant director of Rhode Island’s municipal police academy, he said he made the claim about the state’s singular status based on a fact sheet provided by Lt. Charles P. Wilson, a former police chief in Ohio, now the third shift patrol supervisor at the campus police department at Rhode Island College.

The fact sheet states, ""Where legislation enabling campus law enforcement is concerned, only [Rhode Island] has language which specifically restricts campus police from carrying firearms.""

Shibley urged us to contact Wilson, who, he said, had carried out years of research on the arming of campus police.

Fifteen years, to be precise, said Wilson, who with his wife, Shirley A. Wilson, an associate professor of management at Bryant University, has written academic papers on general attitudes toward campus law enforcement and opposition to arming campus law enforcement.

He sent a spreadsheet he compiled on law enforcement agencies at 2,050 four-year educational institutions around the country. The spreadsheet, which he said took three months to compile, was based on information gleaned from school web sites, correspondence with individual campus police officers, state and federal reports and some 200 phone calls. He said he plans to use the spreadsheet as the basis of a research paper.

Wilson divided the schools according to whether they are private or public and also according to whether they have their own police officers on campus or instead use security guards. The latter is an important distinction. Campus police officers generally go through the same training as municipal police officers and learn how to safely handle guns. Security guards do not necessarily receive firearms training.

Rhode Island’s public educational institutions all use campus police officers. All officers are trained in firearms as part of mandatory training at the municipal police academy.

Of the 2,050 schools Wilson surveyed, 712 have police officers instead of security guards only. Of that number, 693 -- or 97 percent -- allow their officers to carry guns.

We asked Wilson about Shibley’s claim. He told us that for years, three states were often cited as prohibiting their campus police officers from carrying guns: Rhode Island, Iowa and Oregon.

But Iowa and Oregon have reversed their policies in recent years.

The Iowa Board of Regents approved firearms for campus police on Oct. 31, 2007. Within two weeks, the police officers at Iowa State University were armed.

And in Oregon last October, the state Board of Higher Education allowed the University of Oregon to convert public safety officers into full-fledged police who would be able to carry guns.

But it’s important to note that campus police officers at the university currently are not armed. Wilson expects them to be issued firearms by the end of this year, but the school still needs approval from the Oregon Board of Higher Education to take that step.

The only published survey we found that looked at firearms and campus law enforcement was done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. The bureau released its most recent survey in February 2008. It was based on information collected about 750 four-year schools in 2004 and 2005.

The survey supported Shibley’s premise -- that the majority of colleges that use police officers allow them to carry arms -- but it’s outdated and does not break out its results on a state-by-state basis.

Our ruling

Shibley said that Rhode Island is the only state that doesn’t arm the police officers at its public educational institutions.

While Brown armed its officers six years ago, URI, CCRI and RIC haven’t followed suit.

The vast majority of U.S. schools that have police officers let them carry guns. That’s a fact confirmed by the U.S. Department of Justice and by Wilson, the RIC police supervisor.

Wilson is the only researcher we could locate who has broken down the issue by state, and according to his findings, Rhode Island is the lone hold out when it comes to allowing police at public schools to carry arms.

But even though campus police in Oregon are allowed by law to carry guns, they are not carrying guns yet. That’s an important detail that Wilson accounted for in the fact sheet he gave Shibley.

By glossing over this point, Shibley’s aim was slightly off the bull’s-eye, but he didn’t miss the target altogether. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Ron Wyden puts a number to the soaring cost of college - 439 percent
","
Clarification appended: An earlier version of this story failed to note that one of the numbers was seasonally adjusted. The omission does not affect the ruling. 
A college degree is widely seen as a ticket to success. But nowadays, it’s also an express ride to something else -- debt. Deep and ever-expanding debt.

Politicians talk a lot about the rising costs of college and college debt. President Barack Obama talked about it during his State of the Union address in January when he told colleges to get their costs under control or face a loss of taxpayer support.

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., is also talking about the costs. But in a statement Wyden made recently about college costs, he was very specific. ""Between 1982 and 2007, the cost of a college education increased 439 percent,"" he said Feb. 9.

That’s a big and not the least bit fuzzy number, the kind that always quickens the breathing here at PolitiFact Oregon.

Let’s examine it.

We start by asking Wyden where he got his numbers. His staff pointed us to a 2008 study by The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, a respected and nonpartisan think tank that dives deeply into the funding and cost and effectiveness of colleges.

Sure enough, there on page 8 is a graph that shows the cost of college tuition and fees soaring 439 percent between 1982 and 2007. That increase far outstrips the rise in cost for such things as health care and the increase in median income.

Darcie Harvey, a policy analyst for center, said the results were based on government data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which complies the Consumer Price Index. That index is the federal  government’s official measure for the direction of prices.

If you adjust the numbers seasonally -- college isn't usually a year-round expense, the increase for tuition and fees from 1982 to 2007 is even higher - 455 percent, according to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

""First, college tuition continues to outpace family income and the price of other necessities, such as medical care, food, and housing."" the center’s 2008 study found. ""Whatever the causes of these tuition increases, the continuation of trends of the last quarter-century would place higher education beyond the reach of most Americans and would greatly exacerbate the debt burdens of those who do enroll.""

We also looked at other statistics from other nonpartisan sources  to see if they back up Wyden’s claim that tuition and fees are rising, and to check on whether the trend Wyden noted has continued in more recent years.

The National Center for Education Statistics, which is the data-collecting arm of the U.S. Department of Education, shows an unmistakable and relentless increase in college costs.

""Between 1999-2000 and 2009-10, prices for undergraduate tuition, room, and board at public institutions rose 37 percent, and prices at private institutions rose 25 percent, after adjustment for inflation,"" the agency reported last year.

A recent report from the College Board, the same people who bring you the SAT test and closely monitor college costs and aid, found that between 2006-07 and 2011-12, average tuition and fees at public four-year colleges and universities increased annually an average of 5.1 percent above inflation.

The College Board data, which is based on surveys sent to nearly 4,000 post-secondary institutions across the country and historical statistics from the U.S. Department of Education and National Center for Education Statistics, go even deeper.

For the 1991-92 school year, annual tuition and fees at a four-year public university on average were $2,107. They climbed to $8,244 in 2011-12 -- an increase of about 291 percent.

The College Board also provides data in ""constant dollars,"" which are adjusted for inflation. Those numbers showed an increase from $3,495 to $8,244, or about 136 percent.

Even though the assortment of studies and analyses measure different elements (some look only at tuition and fees while others include room and board) and survey different periods of time, taken together they leave no doubt.

While we might prefer more recent statistics, the trend hasn’t changed. Wyden’s numbers -- that the cost of college increased an astounding 439 percent from 1982 through 2007 -- and his underlying point are correct.  We rate this claim: True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1E61C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/07/ron-wyden/ron-wyden-puts-number-soaring-cost-college-439-per/

Santorum says when his grandfather came to the U.S. in 1925, 'there were no government benefits'
","
On a number of occasions, Rick Santorum has used speeches to tout the theme of self-reliance and limited government, including one claim about government programs at the time his grandfather immigrated to the United States. 
Here’s an excerpt from his Feb. 29, 2012, speech near Knoxville, Tenn.: 
""Eight or nine months ago, President (Barack) Obama, responding to Paul Ryan’s budget, gave a lecture on all these wonderful programs that Ryan was going to cut or change. Programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps and housing programs and Medicaid and Medicare. He listed them all. He said America is a better country because of these commitments. And then he read off his teleprompter, he said, ‘I will go one step further. America was not a great country until these commitments.’ 
""So the president of the United States did not believe America was great until people came into power in Washington who raised your taxes, took your freedom and then redistributed your hard-earned dollars to someone that Washington believed deserved it more than you did. In his mind, that’s the greatness of America. 
""That’s what makes America not different or great -- it makes it like every other country in the world. And by the way, all of us came from those countries because we didn’t want those countries to take care of us. When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits."" 
There’s a lot to digest here, but we’ll focus in this item on whether it’s true that when Santorum’s grandfather arrived in the United States in 1925, ""there were no government benefits."" 
We contacted the Santorum campaign about this statement but received no response. 
But did hear from a dozen historians and economists and read a number of scholarly papers on the subject and found that the pre-1925 history of social welfare spending in the United States was complicated and nuanced. 
There were two major sources of payments to individuals prior to 1925 -- veterans benefits and workers' compensation. We’ll take a closer look here: 
Veterans benefits: The federal government began funding benefits for Civil War veterans in 1862, initially based on a physical examination to determine the severity of a wartime injury. In time, however, the threshold for receiving a benefit was lowered -- first to less obvious wartime ailments, then to retroactive wartime claims that had never been previously been reported and then, in 1890, to servicemembers who had a disability not related to their military service. 
""Pensioners and federal expenditures swelled after 1890, and the amount the government spent on pensions that year alone was $106 million,"" Peter Blanck and Chen Song wrote in a 2003 paper in the William and Mary Law Review. The 1890 Disability Pension Act, they wrote, was called the most expensive and liberal pension measure ""ever passed by any legislative body in the world"" at the time. 
The law was expanded further in 1904 through an executive order by President Theodore Roosevelt, defining ""disability"" to include old age, as long as the beneficiary had at least 90 days of service and an honorable discharge. Three years later, the 1890 law was replaced by a new one that granted pensions to veterans over 62, with increases in payments as they aged. ""In 1907, it was estimated that the 1890 Act had cost more than $1 billion,"" Blanck and Song wrote. ""Between 1870 and 1910, the proportion of veterans receiving pensions rose from 5 percent to 93 percent."" A veterans’ health system also began in the aftermath of World War I. 
This was not a trivial portion of the population. In a different paper, University of Arizona economist Price V. Fishback wrote that ""roughly 40 to 48 percent of the elderly in the North and Midwest in the early 1900s were receiving pensions"" through the system. This was such a significant group, Fishback wrote, that ""it likely altered the political calculus in ways that delayed the adoption of old-age assistance and pensions in the United States for a decade or two."" 
The presence of federal benefits created, and reinforced, a broad interest group. 
""At its height in the 1890s, the (Union veteran) pension scheme consumed almost half of the federal budget and was intimately linked to the Republican Party's strategy to maintain the soldier vote and hold the White House,"" Blanck and Song wrote, adding that ""it galvanized interests of the constituency of disabled (Union) veterans, who were increasingly important to the Republican and Democratic parties in the upcoming national elections."" 
Worker compensation: A federal worker-compensation law to help civilian government workers injured or made sick on the job was adopted in 1908, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website. Starting in 1911, states began passing such laws, and by 1929, laws were in effect in all but four states. Some states ran the compensation systems themselves, others required employers to pay into private plans, and some gave employers a choice between the two. 
While these are the clearest examples that run counter to Santorum’s claim, there are a few other efforts worth noting. 
Local government aid to the poor: During the period Santorum is talking about, local governments were responsible for providing benefits to the poor, Fishback told PolitiFact. These payments tended to be modest. Fischback cited a study by Brendan Livingston of Rowan University that looked at welfare policies in Massachusetts -- generally considered the most generous state in the first decades of the 20th century -- and found that local governments were spending an amount equivalent to about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all income earned by state residents on relief for the poor. Private charities were spending at about twice that rate. 
By 1925, most states also had ""mothers' pensions"" on the books, which allowed widows to raise their children without having to put them in orphanages, according to Fishback’s paper. By then, a handful of states also had means-tested pensions for the elderly, and a sizable number had pensions for the blind. And states or municipalities often operated mental hospitals, old-age homes, orphanages and general hospitals, all for the public benefit. 
""The 1920s were years when state and municipal expenditures expanded rapidly and public and social services continued the professionalization that had started mainly after World War I,"" said Michael B. Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Schools and universities: While education isn’t a direct payment to individuals, it’s worth pointing out that they represented a government-provided benefit in kind. ""Primary and secondary education were already overwhelmingly paid for by taxes from the late 1800s on,"" said Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis. 
Meanwhile, higher education had land-grant subsidies -- federally backed institutions dating back to the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890. ""Because they were public institutions, tuition was cheaper on account of public subsidies,"" said Gary Gerstle, a historian and political scientist at Vanderbilt University. ""This was clearly a government benefit."" 
Health funding for mothers and newborns. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act, which gave states matching federal funds to build and operate prenatal and child health care centers. The bill grew out of an investigation begun under President William Howard Taft, which found that ""nearly 80 percent of U.S. women did not receive proper prenatal care -- a fact starkly illustrated during World War I when thousands of men failed to pass their physicals due to afflictions stemming from inadequate medical care as children."" 
Adding it up 
How much did such expenditures add up to? Researchers from the Urban Institute pointed us to old editions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States. One table shows a compilation for expenses for federal, state and local governments for selected years between 1902 and 1970. 
We chose 1922, the year closest to 1925, and found that the ""public assistance"" category amounted to $57 million, the ""other public welfare"" category totaled $71 million and ""veterans services otherwise not classified"" was $505 million. Combined, these three categories were 6.8 percent of expenditures at the three levels of government combined. Even if this overstates the amount, it’s clear that the amount of government benefits was not zero. 
Santorum does have a point that social welfare spending by 1925 was relatively small compared to what it would ultimately become, because two major programs, Social Security and Medicare, didn't start until later. 
""The most obvious feature of social expenditures at the turn of the 20th century was how much smaller they were in comparisons with the levels at the turn of the 21st century,"" Fishback wrote. 
As we noted in a previous fact-check of Santorum, federal entitlement programs have grown significantly, particularly after the establishment of Social Security in the 1930s and Medicare in the 1960s. In 1958, such payments accounted for 25.4 percent of the federal budget and grew to 65.1 percent in fiscal year 2011. 
This is not purely a result of policy decisions; it’s also a result of technological advances and demographic trends. The cost of medical care has risen significantly over the years due to technology and advances in treatments (a topic we earlier discussed here), and the percentage of the population that is elderly has grown from 4.1 percent in 1900 to 12.2 percent in 2000. 
It’s also worth noting that the specific individual Santorum cited -- his newly arrived immigrant grandfather -- wouldn’t have benefited from military pensions or a land-grant college upon his arrival on these shores, and his ability to collect worker compensation would have depended on what state he lived in upon his arrival. Similarly, the local aid to the poor he would have qualified for would have varied significantly depending on what city or county he lived in, and it would have been small by the standards of later decades. 
""I’d go easy on Santorum for this one,"" said Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron. ""There wasn’t much back then."" 
""Santorum is not alone in making these mistakes,"" Fishback told PolitiFact. ""I would bet that the vast majority of people including many social scientists do not know what our social welfare system looked like in 1925."" 
Still, Aaron and Fishback are among many economists we contacted who were skeptical about the underlying message of Santorum’s claim -- that life was better before the New Deal programs of the 1930s and the Great Society programs of the 1960s. 
Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, notes that inflation-adjusted per capita disposable income grew from $6,537 in 1929 to $32,659 in 2011 -- a fivefold increase. 
""Life is unquestionably better, unless you think two-earner households, busy spouses, and dirtier homes are not worth SUVs, air conditioning, and weekend in Paris,"" said Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland. 
Our ruling 
Contrary to what Santorum said, millions of Americans in 1925 would have either qualified for benefits directly, such as payments to veterans, or have been protected by workers' compensation laws that provided benefits to those who became disabled by their jobs. And state and local governments had the longstanding role of paying support to people who were disabled or indigent. This provides a much more complex picture than Santorum is painting. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097057580>],/factchecks/2012/mar/06/rick-santorum/santorum-says-when-his-grandfather-came-us-1925-th/

George LeMieux says Connie Mack’s only 'real job in the real world' was events coordinator for Hooters
","
An attack ad from George LeMieux links U.S. Rep. Connie Mack with Hooters, the home of big-busted gals in short shorts and tight T-shirts who serve up eye candy along with tasty chicken wings.

The ad depicts Mack as a reckless party boy:

""Connie the fourth took seven and a half-years to finish college. … Drunken Brawls. … Arrested. … Road rage. … His only real job in the real world? An ‘events coordinator’ for Hooters!""

The ad shows a voluptuous woman sporting a cowboy hat as a grinning Mack dances around holding a ""rent tent"" sign. (See the ad here.)

LeMieux and Mack are opponents in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, but LeMieux isn’t the first to holler about Mack’s Hooters’ experience. It’s been a common attack on Mack for more than a decade.

But was LeMieux correct to claim that Mack’s job as an ""events coordinator’’ for Hooters was Mack’s only ""real job in the real world?""

The Feb. 27th ad followed a Miami Herald article dissecting Mack’s past. PolitiFact Florida previously ruled on a separate claim in the ad, that Mack failed to pay his child support, rating it False.

Mack’s jobs cited by his campaign

Mack’s campaign website says he worked in the past as ""a business executive with Fort Myers-based LTP Management before becoming an independent business and marketing consultant.""

Mack received his bachelor’s degree in 1993. He won a seat in the state House of Representatives, representing Broward and Palm Beach counties in 2000. He then moved to Lee County and won a seat in Congress in 2004.

Mack campaign spokesman David James said that Mack was a marketing executive for LTP Management for about seven years, from 1994 to 2000. The company owned and operated several Hooters franchises in Florida, as well as Dan Marino's Town Tavern and Lulu's Bait Shack. LTP didn’t respond to our requests for an interview.

Mack never received a paycheck directly from Hooters, but ""we never denied he worked on behalf of Hooters,"" James said. James also objected to Mack being called an ""events coordinator."" He was actually a ""marketing executive,"" James said.

As evidence of other work experience, James said Mack built boats at Marine Concepts in Fort Myers while in high school. Mack also had a series of full-time traveling sales jobs before and after college graduation, including selling Nautilus exercise equipment and MEDX spinal rehab equipment.

""Both were full time, salaried,"" James wrote. ""Nautilus hired him before he finished his degree - but it was not a part-time gig. The spinal rehab equipment job with MEDX was full time. One followed the other."" Mack also briefly had a sales job for Hilton Grand Vacations, he said.

In the past, Mack has listed his work experience as LTP Management and his own marketing group, CM and Associates. Those were the only two jobs he listed on a 2002 Miami Herald editorial board questionnaire for the prior five years.

We are limited in analyzing Mack’s private sector work history for a few reasons. For starters, much of it was before he was elected, which means that there was no requirement for him to document it for public review. Once he ran for office and was elected, documents we saw that asked him questions about his work -- such as the Herald’s editorial questionnaire or state disclosure forms about income in 1999 and in 2000 -- didn’t require that he provide details such as how much of his time was spent on Hooters-related assignments. And since Mack worked in marketing, unlike law, he may not have even had to document how much time he spent per restaurant for his own employer.

LeMieux’s evidence

LeMieux’s campaign said the Hooters claim in their ad came from the February Miami Herald story that stated that Mack worked for a ""consultancy to promote Hooters"" and a 2011 column in the Palm Beach Post which was written as a mock image makeover for Mack:

""Issue No. 1: Work experience.

""Problem: Before trading on the name of your father (a U.S. senator) to begin your current career as a full-time servant of the people in 2001, the most meaningful employment you had was as a ‘special events coordinator’ for a bunch of Hooters restaurants. Boiled down to its essence: You were the go-to guy for folks who wanted to have scantily clad waitresses appear at their events.

""Solution: You will be effective in a Democratic-controlled Senate, because you already know what it's like being surrounded by a bunch of boobs.""

Our ruling

LeMieux’s ad states ""Congressman Connie Mack’s only real job in the real world? Events coordinator for Hooters!""

It’s true that most of Mack's work experience in the private sector was with a company that owned and operated Hooters restaurants in Florida. This was the time soon after Mack's graduation from college and before his election to a full-time public office, a period of about seven years.  
But the company he worked for owned and operated other restaurants, including Dan Marino's Town Tavern and Lulu's Bait Shack. Mack's campaign said he was marketing executive, not an events coordinator, and also said that Mack had other sales experience prior to that. Meanwhile, the LeMieux campaign couldn't offer specific evidence that Mack's work experience was solely with the Hooters restaurants, which the ad calls ""his only real job in the real world.""  
One of the principles of the Truth-O-Meter is that campaigns have the facts to back up their claims. On this one, the LeMieux team largely comes up short. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.

Claim: Atlanta area is national leader in water conservation
 ","
Atlanta may be known as the capital of the South. Or for its place in civil rights history. Or for the fact that an alarming number of its road names include the word ""peachtree.""   

Now a local water official thinks the metro area deserves another claim to fame: leader in water conservation.

Pat Stevens is chief of the Environmental Planning Division of the Atlanta Regional Commission, which staffs the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District. This district manages the region’s water supply.

Stevens told a group of business leaders that the planning district is outpacing even California, which has earned national attention for its water conservation efforts.

""The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District is now the national leader in conservation,"" Stevens told the crowd, according to a Jan. 24 story on AccessNorthGa.com.

""We have out-California'ed California,"" Stevens said.

We were curious. Since when was this region a leader in water conservation?

Water is a precious commodity in Georgia, so much so that the state has been battling Alabama and Florida in federal court for water rights for decades.

The state’s water supply is uncertain, and in 2001, state legislators created the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District to develop the region’s water policy and coordinate its implementation.

We called up Stevens, who told PolitiFact Georgia that she typically says that the planning district is ""a"" national leader in conservation, not ""the"" national leader, but she doesn’t dispute the accuracy of the news story. We evaluated her quote as published.

We also sought out top experts in water conservation for their assessments.

They acknowledged that the Atlanta region has made improvements in its water planning, but all thought that calling the area ""the"" national leader, or even ""a"" national leader, goes too far.

""None of that is true,"" said Mary Ann Dickinson, executive director for the Alliance for Water Efficiency, a national water conservation group.

""I wouldn’t say that metro Atlanta is the leader in conservation efficiency by any means,"" said Jenny Hoffner, the director of the water supply program for American Rivers, a national group that advocates for clean water and conservation.

""On its face, it’s a silly claim. But that’s not to say that Atlanta hasn’t made some great strides,"" said Charles Fishman, a journalist who specializes in water issues.

Stevens cited several specifics to defend her statement. We’ll address the major ones here.  
  
* Nowhere else in the country have so many local governments come together to do this kind of work over such a short period of time: The metro water district covers 15 counties from Hall to Coweta counties, an area that includes more than 90 cities and dozens of water systems.   
  
It was founded in 2001, decades after similar organizations in places such as Southern California and Las Vegas were founded.   
The North Georgia district is relatively young. But at least one larger area -- California -- is implementing specific water conservation goals. A 2009 law requires the state to reduce urban per-capita water use 20 percent by 2020.   
  
As of 2009, the local district’s plans were less ambitious. Water planners expect a 13 percent reduction in water use by 2035 if water systems follow district rules. The district has since made changes to its rules that are not accounted for in this prediction.   
* Declines in per-capita water use: According to metro water district numbers, per-capita water use has declined from 149 gallons per day in 2000 to 110 gallons in 2010. 
Critics said that outside factors such as the economy might play a role in this reduction Utility use typically declines during a downturn. 
* Following North Georgia water district conservation rules is mandatory: The 2001 state statute establishing the water district requires members to follow the district’s rules or face permit revocation. 
No permit has been revoked for water conservation problems, a Georgia Environmental Protection Division spokesman said. 
California also sanctions water suppliers who fail to comply with its water conservation statute. They are not eligible for state water grants or loans. 

Experts gave PolitiFact Georgia other rebuttals to the metro district’s claims.

Dickinson noted that the district does not fund conservation efforts such as low-flow toilet replacement rebates. That’s the responsibility of local governments and water services.

By way of contrast, Dickinson cited the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. This water district has budgeted $19.1 million this fiscal year to fund business and consumer rebates on things such as more efficient toilets, sprinklers, washing machines, and for pulling out water-thirsty turf, according to its spokesman.

All the experts we interviewed noted that the North Georgia district has not set specific, mandatory water use reduction goals as California has done.

They also listed programs they think are innovative and more effective at reducing water use. They included a law in Orlando that requires developers to install reclaimed water lines to new subdivisions. In San Antonio, nonprofit businesses can get low-flow toilets for free, including installation.

The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District certainly deserves credit where credit is due. Per-capita water use is down (though the cause is disputed) and current rules do aim to conserve water.

But we found no consensus that the region has a reputation as a national leader in water conservation, much less as ""the"" national leader.

Given what we found, a stronger claim is that the region is playing catch-up. The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District was formed decades after similar organizations elsewhere, and it doesn’t fund conservation efforts that other areas have.

"['Ohio', 'Income', 'Taxes', 'Jim Renacci']","
Jim Renacci says the top 50 percent pay nearly all the income tax
","
Whether it’s the so-called ""99 percenters"" occupying Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett publicly suggesting that billionaires like himself should pay more taxes, or President Obama calling for tax hikes on households earning more than $250,000, the share of taxes borne by the nation’s wealthiest Americans remains a hot topic.

Freshman GOP Rep. Jim Renacci - a self-made businessman who is among the wealthiest members of Congress - explored the subject with a group of constituents who attended a Town Hall meeting he hosted Feb. 13, 2012, in Medina.

At the meeting, Renacci attempted to shoot down a ""misconception on wage earners and income taxes paid,"" citing the percentage of the nation’s taxes paid in 2009 based on income levels.

""The top 1 percent (of income earners) paid 36.7 percent (of the taxes). The top 5 percent paid 58.7 percent, and the top 10 percent paid 70.5 percent.""

Renacci continued as the figures were projected onto a screen: ""The top 25 percent pay 87.3 percent of the taxes paid in this country. The top 50 percent pay 97.7 percent. So, it’s interesting when you hear the story that the wealthy need to pay more of their share.""

Trackers from a Democratic Super PAC called American Bridge recorded the meeting and sent some video highlights to reporters. The data Renacci presented to his constituents piqued PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity, so we decided to learn more.

Renacci cited Internal Revenue Service taxation data compiled by the Tax Foundation in Washington, an organization that calls itself non-partisan but is widely regarded as conservative. Its board of directors includes Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the top economic advisor to Republican John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008, and former congressman William Archer, a Texas Republican who chaired the House Ways and Means Committee.

We consulted the Tax Foundation report he used as well as articles on the same subject from sources such as Kiplinger.com, a personal finance website.

The numbers were consistent between sources, identifying the top 1 percent of taxpayers as those with an adjusted gross income of at least $343,927. That group, roughly 1.4 million taxpayers, reported 16.9 percent of the nation’s income and paid 36.7 percent of the taxes in 2009.

The top 5 percent, those with adjusted gross incomes of at least $154,643, earned 31.7 percent of the nation’s income and paid 58.7 percent of the taxes. Those in the top 10 percent made at least $112,124. They earned 43.2 percent of the nation’s income and paid 70.5 percent of the taxes.

The income cutoff for the top 25 percent in 2009 was $66,193. Folks with that income or higher earned 65.8 percent of the nation’s income, and paid 87.3 percent of the taxes. To be in the top half of all taxpayers, one had to make $32,396. That group’s share of total earnings was 86.5 percent and its share of taxes was 97.7 percent.

That means those in the bottom 50 percent of income earners accounted for 2.3 percent of taxes paid.

Since Renacci publicly mused about whether the ""top 10, 25 or 50"" percent pay their share under the current system, we also decided to examine why the top half of the households pay such an overwhelming percentage.

According to National Journal magazine, the Earned Income Tax Credit is a big reason why. The program allows working families making under $49,000 (with three children) or $41,000 (with one child) to get a refundable tax credit whose size depends on marital status and family size. The refunds, by design, can sometimes exceed what people pay in taxes, it says.

Before 1986 tax reforms adopted under GOP President Ronald Reagan expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, low-income Americans paid 0.02 percent of individual income taxes while the top one percent paid about 24.6 percent. The share of income taxes borne by the highest Americans rose to its current levels, while the share of income taxes paid by the poor dropped.

Nearly two thirds of low-income taxpayers who don’t pay income taxes do pay payroll taxes, according to a report by the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. More than half of those who pay neither tax are elderly. More than one third are non-elderly with yearly incomes under $20,000.

The statistics Renacci cited to his constituents were accurate. The top 1 percent of the nation’s taxpayers do pay 36.9 percent of its income taxes and the top half of earners do pay 97.7 percent of the nation’s income taxes.

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says president ignored debt problems in State of the Union
","
Firing up a crowd of supporters in Ohio ahead of Super Tuesday, Mitt Romney chided President Barack Obama for his economic record.

""He gave a speech the other day at his State of the Union address. He didn't even mention the deficit or the debt, even as the world is reeling, watching what's happening in Europe, recognizing that, unless we change course, we will face that as well and, yet, he has nothing to say about it,"" Romney said at a rally in Cleveland on March 2, 2012.

No mention of the deficit or the debt? We decided to give the speech a read.

2012 State of the Union

The first evidence we found that Romney’s claim is bogus shows up in the 12th paragraph of the speech, given Jan. 24, 2012.

""In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.""

About midway through the speech, Obama tossed out this proposal for paying down the national debt:

""In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.""

In offering a plan for helping under-water homeowners, he gave this assurance it wouldn’t push the country further into the red:

""I’m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates. No more red tape.  No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.""

Obama framed his proposals on tax cuts saying, ""A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.""

Then, about the deficit: ""When it comes to the deficit, we’ve already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.

""Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else –- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t do both.""

That’s six mentions of either the deficit or the debt.

Our ruling

Romney said that Obama ""didn't even mention the deficit or the debt"" in his State of the Union address.

We never heard back from Romney’s campaign about that claim, and we’re at a loss to understand how he could make it. At least six different times in his 2012 State of the Union address, Obama mentioned the debt or deficit by name. And if Romney meant that Obama made no mention of how to address the government’s debt problems, well, yes he did. He proposed paying down the debt using money no longer being spent in Iraq and advocated for letting a top-bracket tax cut expire so as not to add to the deficit.

For a ruling we turn to our Truth-O-Meter definitions: This statement ""is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."" Six mentions in a speech in which Romney said there were none? That’s Pants On Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809735CB40>],/factchecks/2012/mar/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-president-ignored-debt-problems-s/
"['Environment', 'History', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Wisconsin is ""Badger State"" because of early miners, Gov. Scott Walker says
","Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker wants to make it easier for a proposed iron ore mine, said to be worth more than $1 billion and packing potentially thousands of jobs, to win state approval.

The Republican governor, who made creating 250,000 private-sector jobs his signature campaign promise, mostly touts expected economic benefits. But, pointing to symbols on the state flag, he also argues that mining is central to Wisconsin’s history.

In a Feb. 23, 2012 interview on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee, Walker expressed hope that the Legislature would pass a bill to ""streamline"" the mine approval process. Then he made a claim about the state animal that might surprise some of us in Wisconsin who weren’t paying attention in school.

""If there's any state in America that should be able to"" adopt a mining bill that balances job creation and environmental safety, ""it should be the Badger State,"" Walker said.

""Because we're called the Badgers not because the animals are abundant here, but because we got nicknamed the Badgers because, back before we were a state, our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining. We should be able to do it again here in Wisconsin in 2012 and beyond.""

To be sure, the main issues involving the proposed mine are money and the environment. We found to be Mostly True a claim that the mine proposed for near Hurley in far northern Wisconsin could generate billions of dollars of economic activity over 100 years.

Meanwhile, one Wisconsin conservation organization has said a mining bill pending in the Legislature would allow groundwater to be polluted and ""our most sensitive wetlands to be filled in with mining waste.""

But given the governor’s new tack on promoting mining, we wondered whether Wisconsin, known more for brewing, milking and sausage making, got its Badgers nickname because of mining.

Wisconsin mining origins

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie pointed us to a Wisconsin Historical Society article that explains the importance of mining in the state’s history.

It said in part:

""In the early nineteenth century, Wisconsin lead mining was more promising and attractive to potential settlers than either the fur trade or farming. Its potentially quick rewards lured a steady stream of settlers up the Mississippi River and into Grant, Crawford, Iowa, and Lafayette counties in the early nineteenth century. By 1829, more than 4,000 miners worked in southwestern Wisconsin, producing 13 million pounds of lead a year.""

As for mining’s connection to the badger, Werwie cited the state symbols section of the 2011-2012 Wisconsin Blue Book. It says that images on the state flag include a ""yeoman (usually considered a miner) with a pick,"" a mining pick and shovel, and  13 lead ingots that represent ""mineral wealth,"" as well as a badger.

The Blue Book continues:

""History, rather than the law, explains Wisconsin’s unofficial nickname as the ‘Badger State.’ During the lead-mining boom that began just prior to 1830 in southwestern Wisconsin, the name was first applied to miners who were too busy digging the ‘gray gold’ to build houses. Like badgers, they moved into abandoned mine shafts and makeshift burrows for shelter. Although ‘badgers’ had a somewhat derogatory connotation at first, it gradually gained acceptance as an apt description of the hardworking and energetic settlers of the Wisconsin Territory.""

The state historical society and the Blue Book are as solid as lead as sources on state history.

We also found similar accounts about the connection between mining and the badger nickname in the historical society’s ""Dictionary of Wisconsin History"" and in a 1918 Milwaukee Sentinel article.

Few miners ‘badgers’?

But an article from the winter 1992-1993 edition of the historical society’s Wisconsin Magazine of History raised questions.

Then-Marquette University history professor Karel Bicha wrote that proving the conventional wisdom about mining and the badger nickname ""leads the investigator along an evidentiary pipeline which is ludicrously tenuous."" That’s because the traditional understanding, he said, ""derives largely from ‘tradition’ rather than verifiable ‘history.’""

""Tradition aside,"" Bicha continued, ""it is legitimate to wonder whether there were ever, in reality, any cave- or dugout-dwelling miners. If so, who first observed them in their natural or man-made hillside orifices and divined the inelegant nickname ‘badgers’ to refer to them?""

He goes on to say there is plenty of evidence of large numbers of miners living in cabins and other dwellings, but little evidence that more than a small number lived as ""badgers,"" or that they stayed in their caves or dugouts for very long.

Nevertheless, Bicha concludes:

""Realistically, the importance of the sobriquet ‘badgers’ lies not in its origin but in its diffusion. The diffusion of the term undoubtedly occurred by the same rapid and undocumentable process of oral transmission characteristic of slang, argot and jokes.

""Within two decades of its creation the expression had become divested of its specific association with both miners and the lead region. By the mid-1840s it made no difference whether the badger tradition was rooted in past reality or possessed no more inherent substance than the legend of William Tell. It was synonymous with Wisconsin and its people -- all of its people."" University of Wisconsin-Madison folklore professor James Leary, director of the Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures, notes -- somewhat disturbingly -- that badgers had quite a different definition in the British volume known as the 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue. Badgers were ""a crew of desperate villains who robbed near rivers, into which they threw the bodies of those they murdered.""

Yikes.

But Leary reassured us that the origin of the badgers nickname in Wisconsin is from mining. ""There’s no doubt about that,"" he said.

Our rating

Walker said Wisconsin is called the Badger State because ""our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining."" At least one scholar suggests that the number of miners who lived like badgers was relatively small. But he and other authorities agree that the dwelling habits of at least some of the miners are what gave Wisconsin its nickname.

"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Taxes', 'Michael Doherty']","
Michael Doherty claims New Jersey towns are artificially lowering property values to receive more school aid
","
State Sen. Michael Doherty wants to see action taken immediately to address what he considers a fraudulent practice in many New Jersey municipalities where property values are being lowered to secure more school aid from the state.

In a Feb. 28 interview on NJToday, Doherty claimed that activity was documented in a report issued by the state comptroller.

""And the other one was a report by our state comptroller, Matthew Boxer, and he pointed out that many towns are artificially lowering the real estate values that they report to Trenton, and they do that because that also means they get hundreds of millions of dollars of additional school aid,"" Doherty (R-Warren) said. ""This is the kind of fraud that needs to be addressed immediately.""

Fraud? Money? PolitiFact New Jersey was intrigued.

But after reviewing the comptroller’s August 2010 report, we found that Doherty is exaggerating its findings.

The comptroller’s report shows that some municipalities ""artificially"" reduce property tax collections through the use of tax abatements, possibly leading to the increased need for school aid, according to the report.

However, tax abatements are allowed under state law and don’t represent an act of ""fraud."" Also, while such abatements may indirectly generate additional school aid, their purpose is to attract investment to areas in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation.

First, let’s explain what a tax abatement is.

Through tax abatements, municipalities reduce or eliminate property tax bills for certain landowners, who are typically businesses and developers. In the case of long-term abatements, property owners are exempt from paying taxes, but must contribute so-called ""payments in lieu of taxes,"" or PILOTs.

But none of that PILOT money goes to the local school districts, which also are losing the property tax revenue. As a result, such tax abatements may increase the need for state aid, according to the comptroller’s report.

""The school district still needs the state aid at the enhanced level since the district itself does not see the benefit of the PILOT amounts, and taxpayers throughout the state pay the resulting bill,"" according to the report.

So, Doherty is correct that tax abatements may result in sending more school aid to those communities.

But we found two problems with Doherty’s characterization of tax abatements.

First, Doherty’s ""fraud"" claim suggests that such practices are somehow illegal. The comptroller’s report raises multiple concerns about the tax abatement process, but still indicates that such tax exemptions are permitted under state law.

Secondly, Doherty suggested that the purpose of tax abatements was to generate additional school aid.

But tax abatements are meant to ""encourage rehabilitation and redevelopment of distressed areas,"" according to the comptroller’s report. The increase in municipal revenue through PILOTs also was cited by some officials ""as a motivation to grant abatements,"" the report states.

The comptroller’s report does not claim the purpose of tax abatements is to receive more school aid, according to Peter McAleer, spokesman for the comptroller’s office.

McAleer told us that determining such a purpose ""would require reading the minds of those who grant the abatements, and it’s impossible to make an across-the-board conclusion about the state of mind of hundreds of different local officials.""

But Doherty argued that municipalities are manipulating the numbers and school districts are using the low real estate values as justification for demanding greater school aid.

""So my statement is 100 percent accurate,"" Doherty told us. ""I see the big picture...I see how it affects the school funding formula and the distribution of school aid.""

Our ruling

In an NJToday interview, Doherty said, according to the comptroller’s report, many municipalities are ""artificially lowering"" real estate values to secure more school aid, a practice he referred to as ""fraud.""

The senator is right that tax abatements may lead to greater school aid in communities with these tax-exempt properties. But he’s wrong to claim those practices constitute ""fraud,"" and that their direct purpose is to generate additional school aid.

We rate the statement Mostly False.

Gwinnett leader's boast on employment mostly right
","
At the beginning of each year, Atlanta-area residents can count on colder weather, higher heating bills and politicians bragging about the counties they lead.

In Gwinnett, like most counties, Commission Chairwoman Charlotte Nash gave her State of the County address. Her speech was on Feb. 15. Like any other State of the County address, Nash spoke proudly of Gwinnett’s progress, including a list of achievements that sounded impressive.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether two of these claims, particularly with all the talk about jobs and unemployment, were correct.

""[E]mployment in Gwinnett is up more than 3 percent over last year, and unemployment is the lowest of the five core metro counties,"" Nash told an audience of county leaders and boosters.

First, we wondered which counties was Nash referring to in her speech. Her communications director, Joe Sorenson, said they are the counties with the five largest populations: Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett.

The Georgia Department of Labor keeps data that looks at employment and the unemployment rate in each one of the state’s 159 counties. In December 2011, the most recent month available before Nash’s speech, the unemployment rates were as follows in each county.

Clayton: 11.8
Fulton: 9.8
DeKalb: 9.7
Cobb: 8.5
Gwinnett: 8.4

We’ll note that Clayton’s labor force, at 133,243, is one-third to one-quarter of the size of the other counties. The others have labor forces that range from 372, 274 in Cobb to the highest, 485,690, in Fulton.

On that point, Nash was right.

As for employment growth in Gwinnett, we had a problem with Nash’s numbers. PolitiFact Georgia subtracted the number of people employed in Gwinnett in December 2010 from those in the workforce in December 2011. The increase was 2.2 percent by our count, not more than 3 percent as Nash said.

Sorenson said Nash’s speechwriters made a mistake in the final draft of her address. They initially wrote that employment had risen by 2.3 percent, but they transposed the numbers and it read 3.2 percent. (Sorenson and his staff compared employment between June 2011 and June 2010 to come up with 2.3 percent. We used different months.) The communications staff ultimately changed it in the speech to ""more than 3 percent.""

Nash’s staff was unaware of the error until contacted by PolitiFact Georgia.

""It’s one of those silly things that I hope doesn’t reflect on a really good chair,"" Sorenson said.

Nash’s first statement was accurate, but the second part was not because of the editing error. We rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A39CD40>],/factchecks/2012/mar/05/charlotte-nash/gwinnett-leaders-boast-employment-mostly-right/
"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says Obama, if reelected, would drive debt to $25 trillion in 2017
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell says the country can’t afford another four years of President Barack Obama.

""[The president’s] budget would call for about $25 trillion in debt by the end of his term, if he was re-elected,"" McDonnell, a Republican, said at Politico’s Feb. 24 State Solutions Conference.

The total U.S. debt stands at about $15.5 trillion. About two-thirds of it is owed to investors and the rest is owed to trust funds for government programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

McDonnell’s statement caught our eye. If Obama is re-elected, would his policies really lead to a  $9.5 trillion expansion of the national debt by the time the president leaves office in January 2017?

Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, stressed to us that McDonnell’s statement was made during an hour-long ""extemporaneous"" exchange over a range of issues. Then he offered a clarification.

Martin said in an email that McDonnell had cited a figure on what the debt would be at the end of a 10-year projection contained in the president’s budget for the current 2012 fiscal year.

Martin pointed to White House summary tables for that budget estimating it would lead to a total national debt of $26.3 trillion in 2021. The tables essentially assume that policies in the budget will be carried out for a decade.

On Feb. 13, more than a week before McDonnell made his statement, the president introduced his budget for fiscal 2013, which starts Oct. 1. The White House projected the plan would lead to gross national debts of $25 trillion in 2021 and $25.9 trillion in 2022.

""Under the terms of his introduced budgets, the president, if re-elected, would leave office in January 2017 with the national debt estimated to reach approximately $25 trillion by 2021,"" Martin said.

But that’s not what the governor said. McDonnell said the debt would hit the $25 trillion mark by the end of a hypothetical second Obama term in January 2017. There’s a considerable difference.

The president’s current spending proposal projects the debt will grow to $21.3 trillion by the end of fiscal 2017 -- the last year for which a two-term Obama would submit a budget. That’s still a leap from the current debt, but $3.7 trillion below what McDonnell said.

To put that number in focus, $3.7 trillion is also the entire amount this year’s federal budget. The sum would roughly cover four years of government spending on Social Security or six years of outlays for defense.

Jason Peuquet, research director at the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget, said that while 10-year projections are important to budget, they are also extremely volatile. ""These things are about 100 percent guaranteed to be not right on the mark,"" he said.

Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition -- an organization that advocates balanced budgets -- does not put much stock in measuring debt by simple dollars. Gordon said it’s best to look at it in proportion to the country’s Gross Domestic Product -- the total goods and services produced -- because that compares the debt to a nation’s ability to pay.

U.S. total debt is now about 101 percent of GDP. The White House projects it would peak at 107.8 percent of GDP in 2014 under Obama’s budget before dropping to 102.3 percent in 2021.


Our ruling

McDonnell said that if Obama is reelected this year, his budget policies would push total U.S. debt to about $25 trillion by the time the president’s second term expired in 2017.

The governor’s spokesman qualified the statement. McDonnell, he said, cited a White House projection of the national debt in 2021 if Obama’s policies are continued. Indeed, the administration has estimated a $25 trillion debt that year.

But in 2017 -- at the end of a second Obama term that McDonnell addressed with dread -- the debt would be $21.3 trillion. That’s still a heavy load, but significantly less then the governor claimed.

McDonnell’s statement is based on the element of truth that the debt will continue to rise under Obama’s policies, but greatly exaggerates by how much. We rate his claim Mostly False.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Congress', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
David Dewhurst says Ted Cruz slurred Republican senators including John Cornyn as ""graybeards"" and ""spineless jellyfish""
","
David Dewhurst says another Republican candidate to succeed U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison isn’t likely scoring points with incumbent Senate Republicans.

Dewhurst, the Texas lieutenant governor, said of Ted Cruz in a Feb. 22, 2012, statement: ""How effective will a senator be who slurs his GOP colleagues and party activists, including Sen. (John) Cornyn, as ‘graybeards’and ‘spineless jellyfish?’""

Did Cruz, a lawyer and former Texas solicitor-general, refer to established GOP senators -- all 47 --  in those terms?

The Dewhurst statement refers to a Feb. 21, 2012, Dallas Morning News news article noting Cruz’s decision not to endorse Cornyn at that time to be the party’s Senate whip. In contrast, the story says, several other Texas Republicans running for the Senate--Dewhurst, former ESPN announcer Craig James and former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert--aired support for Cornyn.

The News’ story quotes Cruz saying he won’t decide his vote for the whip post until after November’s elections once it’s clear how many ""constitutional conservatives"" got elected. ""I’m not going to prejudge,"" the story quotes Cruz saying. It later quotes him saying he’s not ruling out support for Cornyn in the end.

According to the story, Cruz and Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., argue that the Senate is at a ""tipping point"" and they predict a dramatic power shift with a handful of new conservatives to prod fellow Republicans toward more urgency when it comes to slashing spending and curbing government.

""It’s not a win for conservative principles to get a spineless jellyfish,"" Cruz is quoted saying.

The story then says that Cruz routinely compares himself to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who won his seat in 2010. ""In every one of those states,"" Cruz said, ""the party graybeards were supporting somebody else. The establishment had somebody who was already picked to be quote ‘a member of the club.’""

The story then says Cornyn, as part of the Senate leadership, ""apparently is one of those graybeards,"" reporter Todd J. Gillman wrote.

Cornyn chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is dedicated to electing Republican senators. And in 2010, Cornyn supported then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist over Rubio for the Sunshine State’s Senate seat, the News’ story notes, after which he conceded he’d made a mistake and further agreed to remain neutral in party primaries. DeMint pledged not to undermine incumbent Republicans in his quest for allies willing to ""rock the boat,"" the story says.

A Nexis search revealed no other Cruz references to graybeards, though he previously invoked jellyfish. According to a July 26, 2011, Dallas Morning News commentary by Gromer Jeffers Jr., Cruz said at a July 2011 meeting of the Denton County Republicans: ""All of us have been burned before by candidates who sound good on the trail and got into office and turned into spineless jellyfish. The basis of my campaign is a proven conservative record of over and over again standing up, fighting for conservative principles and winning on a national level.""

By email, we asked Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch if Dewhurst had additional backup for Dewhurst’s claim.

Hirsch pointed out a November 28, 2011, Morning News’ blog post, based on blogger David Jennings’ interview of Cruz. Jennings had written that day that Cruz told him that before each of four senators -- DeMint, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mike Lee of Utah and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania -- endorsed his candidacy, ""their single most important question was this: Could he stand up to the leaders of the Republican Party? Cruz said that each of the men told him that the leadership of their own party had been their biggest hurdle, not Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. They wanted to make certain that he knew this and would be willing to look Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell in the eye and tell him no.""

Morning News’ reporter Robert Garrett added: ""By indirectly attacking McConnell, ...whose No. 2 sidekick in the leadership is expected to be (Cornyn), isn't Cruz unnecessarily alienating his party's leaders even before he gets to Washington?""

We asked Cruz’s campaign if it had anything to share regarding Dewhurst’s claim.

By email, Cruz spokesman James Bernsen called Dewhurst’s claim false and scurrilous. Cruz has never called Cornyn by those names, Bernsen said. And when he bemoans ""spineless jellyfish,"" Bernsen said in a telephone interview, Cruz is not referring to any senators in particular. ""It’s referring to people in the Republican Party in general who are not as committed to conservatism,"" Bernsen said. ""He doesn’t mention individual people like that.""

Bernsen said in a follow-up email: ""Ted has never once stated, suggested, or referred to Sen. Cornyn as anything other than what he is - an honorable and effective public servant who fights for Texas.""

Our ruling

Cruz used the terms ""spineless jellyfish"" and ""graybeards"" when talking about Republican candidates and conceivably even senators whom he views as insufficiently conservative. On that, Dewhurst has a defensible point.

However, It’s less clear that Cruz was talking specifically about Cornyn. True, his ""graybeards"" reference can be read to draw in Cornyn. But there’s no evidence that Cruz has directly labeled Cornyn (or any individual senator) as a spineless jellyfish.

Marcy Kaptur claims Dennis Kucinich opposed senior drug coverage when she supported it
","
Congressional redistricting in Ohio has turned two veteran incumbents from the same side of the aisle, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich, into Democratic primary opponents in the new 9th District.

Each has a long record to boast, or defend, in what amounts to a fight for survival -- as shown by a 30-second TV ad for Kaptur that Kucinich says misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors.

PolitiFact Ohio previously looked at two of the claims -- ""When Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no""  and ""When Kaptur helped get $15 billion more for veterans care, Kucinich voted no."" We rated both Half True.

Now we'll look at a third statement: ""When Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, Kucinich voted no.""

The ad cites as its source the role call vote on the Stenholm Amendment to Congressional Resolution 290 of March 23, 2000.

Yes, that is 2000.

Bill Clinton was in the White House, John McCain had just ceded the race for the Republican presidential nomination to George W. Bush, anxiety over Y2K had passed, unemployment was at 4 percent and the federal budget showed a surplus.

Much credit for the latter was claimed by a Republican congressman named John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Now Ohio's governor, he was bringing his last budget resolution to the floor -- and, touching on a topic raised frequently in more than 14 hours of debate, promising a prescription drug plan for seniors by the end of the year.

According to the Kaptur campaign, Kucinich voted against the prescription drug plan offered by conservative Democrats in their alternative budget proposal, the Stenholm Amendment, at a time ""when there was no alternative with a chance.""

Kucinich voted for another Democratic plan that failed. He would have considered the Stenholm plan a ""halfway measure,"" Kaptur's campaign spokesman said -- ""He wanted the perfect, not the good.""

Kucinich's campaign answered that he voted against the Stenholm Amendment advanced by ""Blue Dog"" Democrats ""because it it also included about $4 billion more in military spending than even the Republicans had proposed.

""He supported and voted for the budget plan advanced by the Democratic leadership of the House, which included $40 billion over fiscal years 2001 through 2005 and $155 billion through fiscal year 2010 for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and premium and cost-sharing protections,"" Kucinich's campaign spokesman added. Kaptur, incidently, also voted for that plan.

In fact, the House considered and rejected five budget proposals before passing the resolution offered by Kasich, according to the Congressional Record's account of floor proceedings and the Congressional Research Service:
  
Both voted against the budget resolution advanced by Kasich, which passed 211-207.

That brings us back to the claim in the ad: ""When Kaptur fought for the Democrats' prescription drug benefit for seniors, Kucinich voted no.""

We think that claim isn’t accurate on a number of counts.

Kucinich did in fact vote no when Kaptur voted yes on one budget proposal. But labeling that proposal as ""the Democrats’ prescription drug benefit for seniors"" is inaccurate. It was one of four Democratic proposals and not leadership’s plan (which Kucinich and Kaptor both supported.  

It is misleading to imply that Kucinich’s no vote was a vote against a prescription benefit. His vote came on a resolution encompassing the entire $1.8 trillion federal budget that contained, among many things, the prescription benefit Kaptur’s ad cites..

Ultimately, a dozen years later, the question of whether the plan Kaptur’s ad touts was better is moot. The Spratt Amendment supported by both Kucinich and Kaptur actually won more votes than the Blue Dog proposal that Kaptur backed but Kucinich opposed, but neither was going to win passage  from the House's Republican majority.

Is the Pasco County school district keeping up with class size requirements?
","
In seeking reelection to a third term, Pasco County schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino is touting the district’s record as proof of her successful leadership. 
In a press release announcing her bid, she cited statistics ranging from graduation rates to the number of new schools built as evidence that ""the District School Board of Pasco County continues to shine with Fiorentino at the helm."" 
Fiorentino’s facts and figures are generally correct, but they don’t always tell the full story. We evaluated several statements from her press release. Here, we're examining if the district ""opened 22 new schools over six years to keep pace with growth in student population and implement the class size amendment."" 
The school district’s own website contradicts Fiorentino on this one. It lists just 20 new schools as having opened from 2005 through 2011. Fiorentino said Friday that the press release contained a typo and agreed that the correct number is 20. 
This building boom did take place to help the district deal with rapidly increasing enrollment. The district’s student body grew from 59,474 at the end of the 2004-05 school year to 66,696 by the end of 2010-11. And, for a time, the new schools did help reduce class sizes district-wide. 
But when it came time to implement the class size amendment in 2011-12, even with enrollment changed only slightly, the district did not meet the 2002 voter requirement for smaller classes. 
The state imposed a $4 million penalty against Pasco for its failure to comply, the fourth-highest fine among the 35 districts that did not meet the rule. Fiorentino and the School Board have since submitted a plan to the state Department of Education for meeting the amendment in 2012, which could reduce the punishment. 
While the district did open many new schools to cope with growth and class size, it didn’t open the same number Fiorentino said and it didn’t meet class size rules every year.

Pasco County schools have graduation rates above the state average and dropout rates below the state average, says Heather Fiorentino

Fiorentino’s facts and figures are generally correct, but they don’t always tell the full story. We evaluated several statements from her press release. Here, we're looking at whether the district has graduation rates ""substantially higher than the state average"" and dropout rates ""below the state average."" 
The press release puts it this way: The district ""increased graduation rate of 88.5 percent (Florida calculation) and 85.5 percent (National Governors Association calculation), which are substantially higher than the state average."" It also ""secured [a] dropout rate of 1.0 percent, which has plummeted below the state average."" 
State reports show that Fiorentino rightly states the district’s graduation rates, and that they are higher than state averages, which were 81.2 percent and 80.1 percent, according to the two different calculations. Pasco’s rates are also up significantly from 2006-07 on both the state (73.7 percent) and governors association (67.8 percent) measures. 
Pasco also was among a small handful of districts that did not have significant gaps in the rates among its various demographic groups. 
Fiorentino accurately touts the district’s improved dropout rate. State reports show the district dropout rate was 1.0 percent for 2010-11, down from 3.5 percent in 2006-07. The overall state rates were 3.3 percent in 2006-07 and 1.9 percent in 2010-11, so Pasco did show better improvement than the state. 
Fiorentino is on solid ground in these two numeric claims about the district’s academic performance. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C6E600>],/factchecks/2012/mar/04/heather-fiorentino/pasco-county-schools-have-graduation-rates-above-s/
"['Jobs', 'Legal Issues', 'Women', 'Wisconsin', 'Christine Sinicki']","
State Rep. Christine Sinicki says Sen. Glenn Grothman said that women belong “at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies.”
","
The night Republicans voted to curtail court awards for women claiming workplace gender bias, state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) bitterly denounced the motives of a GOP senator who led the move.

Sinicki charged that Sen. Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) had openly pined for a bygone ""Leave it to Beaver"" world of stay-at-home moms during a Senate hearing.

""His words were to the effect of, he didn’t believe women belonged in the workplace,"" Sinicki quoted Grothman as saying. ""He believed that women belonged at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies.""

In her speech on the Assembly floor, she pointed to Republicans, who argued the law subjected business to frivolous claims.

""Well, I just wonder how many women in this room, particularly on that side of the aisle, believe that. You worked hard to be here, didn’t you? But yet you’re about to go along with the notion that women don’t belong in the workplace, and women don’t belong making as much money as men.""

Sinicki co-authored the 2009 bill to allow people to seek punitive damages in state court while alleging employment discrimination. So her emotion as Republicans moved to overturn that law may be understandable.

But that’s a strong claim about what Grothman said.

To be sure, Grothman’s unvarnished attacks on welfare benefits, affirmative action, early sex education and many other government programs have endeared him to conservatives, while inspiring liberal scorn and even a blog that tracks his utterings.

And we know Grothman thinks a ""war on men"" -- in the form of affirmative action -- is favoring women and discouraging job prospects for males, according to his 2010 speech at a tea party rally in Washington County.

But did he endorse sending women back to the kitchen?

Grothman told us he never said that.

So we went to the tape … or tried to anyway.

Sinicki suggested we seek out archived WisconsinEye video of an exchange between her and Grothman at a March 2009 Senate committee hearing, when the Sinicki-sponsored measure moved toward becoming law.

We watched it. Twice.

But there was no such statement.

Turns out Sinicki’s memory betrayed her. With help from her staff, we found the dust-up at an August 2007 public hearing on the matter. The bill did not advance that session, when partisan control of the Legislature was split.

At the time, Democrats pointed to equity studies showing Wisconsin women’s pay badly lagging males in similar jobs. Allowing punitive damages could help level the playing field, they said. Grothman, the leading critic on the other side, argued the pay statistics were skewed by instances in which women chose to take a break from working, and therefore fall behind males who keep working. Republicans also argued existing law already made discrimination illegal.

This is how the 2007 exchange went:

Grothman: ""In my personal experience, the reason most men make more than most women is that most men set themselves up or view themselves as breadwinners in the family. So, frequently it’s not unusual to have a guy working 50 or 60 hours a week and the gal’s working 35 or 40 hours a week. So of course the guy makes more.

""So when I view these sort of bills, I kind of view them as a hatred for that sort of family, or whatever you call it.

""Do you view that (sort of family) as a problem, or do you view that as maybe one of the major factors as to why the average man makes more than the average woman in this country?""

Sinicki: ""I’m kind of appalled at the senators’ comments, to tell you the truth.""

Committee chairman Sen. Spencer Coggs, D-Milwaukee: ""Yeah, I hear ya.""

Sinicki: ""Sen. Grothman, I don’t know when the last time you looked at what a typical family looks like. The typical family is not the family of the 1950, '60s or even the 1970s. A lot of families now are single mothers. Women have made great strides in this country to get good education -- you know what we even go to college now. Isn’t that amazing? Women so many times do the exact same job as men. We have woman surgeons. We have woman lawyers. We have woman legislators. Thank God I’m a legislator because (that means) I get paid the same as you!

""I don’t even know how to answer that question because I know if you look at any average city block, in any average city in America, you’re going to find a large percentage of households that are headed by women, that are the breadwinners.

""This is the year 2007. Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver are very difficult to find nowadays.""

Grothman: ""My concern is this. If there is a family who elects to live like Ward and June Cleaver, that you feel it’s up to the government to stick their nose in the thing … and find a way for there to be another woman who makes more money to compensate for it. It’s kind of social engineering.""

That is the crux of the exchange.

Before we -- and Sinicki’s staff -- reviewed the exchange, Sinicki told us her clear memory was that Grothman said at the 2007 hearing that ""women were never meant to make as much money as men, they belong at home.""

But we found no such comment.

Sinicki told us she felt Grothman’s comments implied he felt a woman’s place was not in the workplace. Grothman told us he said nothing of the kind, and that Sinicki had missed his point.

Our take is that at the hearing, Grothman made clear he thinks anti-female bias is trumped up, and he decried government intervention on pay. But he made no remarks about what role women should assume in society.

We asked him to elaborate on his opinions.

""Women are great workers,"" Grothman said, noting there are five women on his staff. ""I love women working.""

Grothman said he objects that some people are hostile to the idea of women staying home. He personally sees value in it.

""It’s nice if women can stay at home with their children,"" he said, adding: ""It’s nice if guys can support their families.""

Our conclusion

In arguing against repeal of an anti-gender-bias bill, Sinicki summoned up her memory of comments by Grothman when the Legislature debated the original bill in 2007.

She didn’t quote Grothman directly but claimed he said, in effect, that women had no business in the workplace and should be at home ""cooking and cleaning and having babies.""

Grothman did speak up for families where the woman has chosen to stay home to raise children. But that’s a far cry from him saying the whole world should do that, and that women ""belong"" at home.

"['New Jersey', 'Deficit', 'State Budget', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says he cut $13 billion in state spending over two years
","
By Gov. Chris Christie’s account, he arrived in Trenton and slashed billions of dollars of state spending in two years.

In a state capital thriving off freewheeling use of tax dollars,  Christie said he immediately closed a $2.2 billion gap left by his predecessor. Then, the governor claims, he wielded his budget ax to eliminate another $10.7 billion.

In an interview on ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that aired on Feb. 21, the same day the governor delivered his budget speech, Christie described his fiscal prudence to a national audience.

""Let's look at what I've done in New Jersey, OK? And that's the best gauge to gauge and to judge a politician. Not what they say in a talk show with you, but what they've done,"" Christie said. ""And in two years, what we’ve done is to protect the most vulnerable here, even when we had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years.""

OK, let’s judge the governor by his actions.

When Christie took office halfway through the fiscal 2010 budget year, his predecessor’s spending plan had a $2.2 billion shortfall. Christie used several measures to close the gap, including cutting $475 million in local school aid.

That’s $2.2 billion of the $13 billion Christie claims he cut. It’s at this point that the governor mixes real money with a theoretical figure.

Much of Christie’s claim hinges on a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. The structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all statutory spending obligations were fully funded.

However, the budget supersedes state statute. So, although certain levels of spending on different programs may be required, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise.

And that’s largely how Christie handled the structural deficit in his first budget. He skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment and didn’t fully fund the school aid formula or property tax rebate program, among other measures.

So, Christie didn’t cut that money. He never spent it.

""While $13 billion might represent the total deferrals and non-funding what otherwise would be required programming, the actual cuts in state operations, in state government, were substantially less than $13 billion,"" said Raphael J. Caprio, a Rutgers University professor who researches local and state budgeting and finance. 
And the structural deficit didn’t go away. For the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year. 
Though Christie uses the structural deficit to his advantage when discussing his first budget, he dismissed the fiscal 2012 calculation as the ""old way of budgeting."" 
PolitiFact New Jersey sought a response from the governor’s office last week, and Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak issued a reply, admitting the governor got it wrong but criticizing our methods. ""This is just ridiculous. Do you people ever just let something pass as a plain-as-day slip of the tongue, human error? Of course he didn’t cut spending by $13 billion,"" Drewniak wrote in an e-mail. 
Drewniak, referring to a list he provided of statements Christie made at town halls and other forums, also said: ""My point in sending you all those instances of where he accurately explained the budgets, cutting spending and combined deficits was to illustrate the point that of course he knows what he cut from the budgets, and that he has explained it many times.""

The governor has cut state spending. The percent change differs depending on the point in time the governor’s first budget is compared with the budget he inherited. Either way, it’s a decrease of less than $3 billion.

Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said Christie has tried to make fundamental changes in state spending so the structural deficit doesn’t widen. ""He’s lowered actual spending and that’s sort of a new fiscal world for New Jersey,"" he said.

Our ruling

The governor said ""we had to cut state spending by 13 billion dollars over two years.""

That’s not true. Christie decreased state spending, but the total doesn’t near $13 billion.

Christie’s claim hinges largely on a $10.7 billion structural deficit. He used the measurement from his first year in office to his advantage. But the next year, he dismissed the structural deficit as the ""old way of budgeting.""

We rate the claim False.
