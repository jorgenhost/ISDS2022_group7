No, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez didn't say we have time to shoot down Chinese missiles
","Depending on who you ask, worries about a Cold War with China are well-founded or overblown. And while today’s chatter may be more about cyber attacks than nukes, we should be safe from airborne weapons—at least according to something a Facebook post claims U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said. ""We’ll never have to worry about China attacking us!,"" reads the text over a photo of the New York congresswoman that was published on Facebook on March 7. ""They are 12 hours ahead, so we’ll have plenty of time to shoot down their missiles!"" One commenter wondered how ""anyone can really be this dumb?"" ""Who is supporting her?"" another commenter said. ""Everytime she opens her mouth, she relieves all doubt."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez said the quote was fabricated. And we couldn’t find any credible evidence that she said this. First we searched for the quote on Google; there were only a few results. One user shared the quote attributed to Ocasio-Cortez on a Mississippi Gun Owners forum, though without a source, and someone else posted it on Godlike Productions, another internet forum. It also appeared on websites with a Ukrainian web address. We searched Nexis for old news stories with Ocasio-Cortez making the statement and came up empty. We also couldn’t find reports of anyone saying it.   Next, we looked for social media posts and news reports about the congresswoman and Chinese missiles, in case she said something similar to the quote, but we couldn’t find instances of Ocasio-Cortez discussing them. In September, a spokesman for her congressional campaign told FactCheck.org that ""the entire quote was fabricated."" ""She’s never even discussed Chinese missiles.

No, House Democrats did not vote to allow noncitizens to vote as part of HR 1
","A misleading social media post suggests that House Democrats want to give the right to vote to noncitizens. ""House Dems 228 yes 197 GOP no to allow illegal aliens to have right to vote. Let that sink in America!"" stated a March 9 Facebook text-post that was posted on a page called Donald Trump for President Martin County, Florida. The text post oversimplifies a vote in the U.S. House. The quote was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As Snopes points out, there are other variations of the claim going around.  Some conservative politicians and activists have been raising alarm about noncitizens voting, including President Donald Trump (often without evidence). There have been cases of noncitizens who have cast ballots, but they are statistically rare. The Facebook post provides no additional details. It is in reference to HR 1, the bill that calls for sweeping changes to voting rights and campaign finance. The Democratic-led House passed the bill March 8, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he has no plans to bring the legislation to a vote. Read more: Is HR 1 a voting rights expansion or federal power grab? The specific vote that relates to the Facebook post was on a motion before the final vote on the bill. The motion by Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said, ""It is the sense of Congress that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens."" Crenshaw’s motion was rejected 228-197, largely along party lines. The Facebook post was close on the vote margin but oversimplified it. There was one Republican who joined the Democrats against the motion, and six Democrats joined the Republicans in favor. By voting against a motion that said allowing illegal immigrants to vote devalues the franchise, it opened the door for conservatives to attack Democrats — although this Facebook claim is exaggerating. Just because Democrats voted against a motion reaffirming that illegal immigrants can’t vote doesn’t mean they voted to actually allow those immigrants to vote. The United States already has a law that prevents noncitizens from casting a ballot for president or other federal offices. HR 1 doesn’t change that law — and HR 1 doesn’t call for extending the right to vote to noncitizens. Crenshaw’s motion acknowledged this point about existing law, stating ""federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in elections for Federal office."" A vote on the ""sense of Congress"" is a way for lawmakers to express an opinion, but it is not legally binding. That means even if the motion by Crenshaw had passed, it would only have symbolic power. U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., called Crenshaw’s motion an effort to divert from the mission ""to expand voting rights to every American citizen in federal elections."" While noncitizens can’t vote in federal elections, they can vote in some local elections in certain jurisdictions. Crenshaw criticized such cities including San Francisco, which allows noncitizens to vote in school board elections, saying they had fallen into ""radicalism"" by extending the right to vote to undocumented immigrants. Crenshaw tweeted: ""Today I offered a motion to recommit #HR1 reaffirming that only US citizens should have the right to vote. Dems rejected it. Next time you go to the ballot box, keep that in mind. The future of their party is in cities like San Fran, where illegals can vote. Let that sink in."" A Facebook post said 228 House Democrats voted ""to allow illegal aliens to have right to vote."" The text post inaccurately describes what the vote was about. The post refers to a Republican-sponsored motion that said, ""It is the sense of Congress that allowing illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting power of United States citizens."" The motion only cited an example of noncitizens being allowed to vote in a local election whereas the Facebook text post uses scare language to imply that it's voting of all types. The motion was symbolic and would not have changed anything, since existing U.S. law already bans noncitizens from voting in federal elections. By voting against the measure, Democrats opened themselves up to attacks — but they simply didn’t move to allow noncitizens to have the right to vote.

Bobby Scott says women earn 80 percent pay of white men for 'similar' jobs
","U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently endorsed the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would protect women against wage discrimination. ""Women earn on average 80-cents on the dollar compared to white men doing similar jobs,"" he said at the start of a Feb. 26 hearing on the bill before the House Education and Labor Committee. Scott is chairman of the panel. PolitiFact has heard many versions of the 80-percent pay comparison and has found the statistic is often misused. Let’s take a close look at Scott’s statement. Stephanie Lalle, Scott’s deputy communications director, told us the congressman got the statistic from separate reports published in late 2018 by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, and the National Partnership for Women and Families. Both reports said the statistic comes from the U.S. Census Bureau. The latest gender-gap statistics from the Bureau show in 2017 women earned 80.5 percent of what men made - the same percentage as in 2016. The median earnings of men working full-time, year-round in 2017 was $52,146, compared to $41,977 for women. But there’s a catch: The statistics are across-the-board comparisons for all jobs lumped together and do not specifically compare men and women performing the same jobs. Many people, citing the statistic, wrongly use it as an apples-to-apples comparison of pay for equal work. Scott’s statement, however, is nuanced. He says women get 80 percent pay for doing ""similar"" jobs as white men, which is different than saying the ""same"" job as men. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data on similar jobs, comparing the median usual weekly earnings of full-time men and women in 121 occupations. Overall, it found that women earned 81.8 percent of what men made - slightly higher than the Census’ estimate. The women-to-men pay ranged from 59 percent for personal financial advisers, to 108 percent for dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers. Here are women-to-men pay comparisons for some other occupations: Women out-earned men in three occupations: wholesale and retail buying; frontline supervisor of construction trades and extraction workers; and, as we mentioned, dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers. Fact-checking Scott, however, requires a deeper dive. The percentages we just discussed compare the full-time weekly earnings of all women to all men in these occupations. Scott, in his statement, compared the earnings of all women to white men in similar jobs. The BLS’s data set that compares gender pay by specific jobs does not sort men and women by race. It does, however, categorize the jobs into 22 broad fields of work and, in each of those fields, breaks down women and men by sex. Overall in 2018, women earned 78.7 percent as much as white men in the same areas of work. The comparison of women’s pay to white men’s produces a bigger gender gap than the comparison to all men. That’s because white males tend to earn more than black males.  White men out-earned women in all 22 fields of work. Is it all discrimination? Scott, in his remarks, repeatedly linked the disparity to gender discrimination. The bill he endorsed says ""many women continue to earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work,"" and states, ""In many instances, the pay disparities can only be due to continued intentional discrimination or the lingering effects of past discrimination."" The bill would expand wage-disclosure requirements for employers and add protections for employees who investigate gender-pay at their workplace or claim gender pay bias. But, as PolitiFact has written before, many researchers have concluded the causes of gender pay disparity go far beyond discrimination. ""The most important source of the gender wage gap is that women assume greater responsibility for child-rearing than men,"" June O’Neill an economist at Baruch College, wrote in a 2010 op-ed for the The Wall Street Journal. ""That influences women's extent and continuity of work, which affects women's skills and therefore wages. In addition, women often seek flexible work schedules, less stressful work environments, and other conditions compatible with meeting the demands of family responsibilities. Those come at a price—namely, lower wages."" An 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh also concluded that the wage gap is not simply a product of sexism. CONSAD found that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other trends common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; they tend to have a shorter work history and take more time off from work for childbirth and child care. CONSAD said these factors, when considered, reduced the pay gap to between 4 to 7 percent which could be result of discrimination. A 2013 study by the American Association of University Women tried to even out the child-rearing effect on women’s pay. It found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. Our ruling Scott said, ""Women earn on average 80-cents on the dollar compared to white men doing similar jobs."" BLS statistics support Scott, showing the median pay of white men in 2018 was higher than that of all women in each of 22 job fields listed in the data set.   We take issue with Scott’s context, however. He presents pay disparity as the product of discrimination. But gender pay is a complicated subject and there are many reasons - in addition to discrimination - why a gap exists: women tend to work fewer hours than men; they tend to choose lower paying professions than men; they tend to take more time off than men to tend to children. Scott’s statement, and his entire speech, lack this framework. So we rate his claim Mostly True. Correction: Women earned 78.7 percent as much as white men, overall, in 22 broad fields of work in 2018, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. An earlier version of this story misstated the statistics.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F99C80>],/factchecks/2019/mar/13/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-women-earn-80-percent-pay-white-m/

It's True, Boeing 737 Max 8 still flies in US even as FAA calls for software updates
","Update: President Donald Trump announced March 13 that the United States was grounding Boeing's 737 Max 8 and Max 9 aircraft. Boeing lists three major American airlines that currently use the 737 Max — American (24 planes), Southwest (34 planes) and United (14 planes). The FAA said it made the decision after seeing ""new evidence gathered at the site and analyzed today."" The United States was the last holdout as other national air safety agencies from China to the European Union moved to ground the plane. The crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737-Max 8 led several lawmakers to call for the immediate grounding of that plane in the United States. Ethiopian Air Flight 302 disappeared from air controllers’ screens about six minutes after takeoff from Addis Ababa on a flight to Nairobi, Kenya. All 157 passengers died. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren was among those calling for immediate action. ""The United Kingdom, China, Australia, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and others have already grounded the 737 Max,"" Warren said in a March 12 news release. ""The world has now witnessed the second tragic crash of one of these planes in less than six months. The FAA should follow their lead, reverse their decision, and immediately ground this plane in the United States until its safety can be assured. While we do not know the causes of these crashes, serious questions have been raised about whether these planes were pressed into service without additional pilot training in order to save money. The FAA itself has indicated that software updates are likely coming. Any necessary changes must be made before, not after, more flights occur and more lives are potentially endangered."" Warren’s point about the FAA and software bears out. On March 11, the Federal Aviation Administration posted an airworthiness notification. While it emphasized that the investigation has just begun, it said it was keeping an eye on ""Boeing’s completion of the flight control system enhancements."" The FAA listed three software elements where it expected changes in what is called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. That system activates automatically, mainly during takeoff, when the plane is rising rapidly. (It was built to compensate for larger changes in the aircraft that made it more fuel efficient, but also affected how it handled when its nose is pointed up at a sharp angle.) There is speculation that the automated system contributed to the crash. More than keeping an eye on Boeing’s progress, the statement said ""the FAA anticipates mandating these design changes by (airworthiness directive) no later than April 2019."" An airworthiness directive is a big deal. It’s a legally enforceable rule ""to correct an unsafe condition."" ""When the FAA wrote that, it was telling Boeing to make those changes as soon as possible,"" Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University aviation safety professor William Waldock told us. Boeing complied. It announced March 11 that it was deploying software changes to the entire 737 Max fleet ""in the coming weeks."" The changes were underway after the first 737 Max crash in Indonesia in October 2018. Among other things, they will reduce the automated adjustments in the plane’s stabilizers (the moving parts on the tail of the airplane). But Waldock underscored that until investigators sift through the data in the Ethiopian Air plane’s black boxes and voice recorders, they won’t know the actual cause of the disaster. It's possible that the software in question was not responsible. Warren said the FAA had ""indicated that software changes"" were coming to the Boeing 737 Max 8 fleet. The FAA’s airworthiness notice not only indicated that such changes were on their way, it telegraphed that those modifications would be mandatory by the end of April. We rate this statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E9140>],/factchecks/2019/mar/12/elizabeth-warren/warren-faa-leans-boeing-fix-737-max-8-software/

Wisconsin governor takes half-step back on phasing out school vouchers
","From his time as state superintendent to his campaign for Wisconsin governor, Tony Evers has always put education at the forefront of his agenda. Specifically, public-school education. In his 2018 campaign for governor, the Democrat  promised to phase out, or eliminate, private school vouchers -- essentially taxpayer-funded scholarships that allow students to attend private schools. On Feb. 19, 2019, Evers told journalist Mike Gousha during an ""On the Issues"" event at Marquette University Law School that the move to eliminate vouchers wouldn’t come in his first budget. Instead, he said, the budget would focus on more transparency and accountability within the programs. This is what was said in the exchange with Gousha: Gousha: ""In terms of phasing out private voucher schools, that is not part of this budget that you’ll present next week?"" Evers: ""Phasing out? No."" Yet when Evers’ budget was released, it included provisions to phase out at least part of the voucher program. We’re turning again to our Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. In this case, we want to see if Evers has been consistent on not phasing out vouchers in his first budget. The background In a questionnaire given to 2018 gubernatorial candidates by the Wisconsin School Administrators Alliance, Evers said he supported greater transparency around vouchers and would work with the state Legislature to end the program. More specifically, Evers promised during the campaign to freeze enrollment in all four school voucher programs -- Milwaukee, Racine, the statewide program and the Special Needs Scholarship Program -- and eventually phase them out. The school voucher program started in Milwaukee and has been around for almost 30 years. The Racine program came in 2011, followed by the rest of the state in 2013 and 2014. The program allows parents to send their children to private schools, with a taxpayer-funded voucher, instead of public schools. Families must meet certain income limits to qualify for vouchers and must reapply every year. The Special Needs Scholarship Program, which began in 2015, is the only program that doesn’t have income requirements. The program allows parents of children with disabilities to send their child to a private school. What the bill says In 2019 Assembly Bill 56 -- the Evers budget, which is now before the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee -- there are several aspects that involve the voucher program. For instance, the budget would cap the number of participants in the programs, ensure teachers at schools participating in the program hold a license or permit issued by the state and require participating schools to be accredited by Aug. 1, 2019. But some changes being made to the Special Needs Scholarship Program seem to contradict the governor’s position that he is not phasing out school vouchers in this budget. On page 17, the budget says that starting in the 2020-21 school year, the state will not provide a special needs scholarship for a child to attend a private school unless they were attending one in the 2019-20 school year. What’s more, it says if the child doesn’t attend a private school under a special needs scholarship in any school year after the current enrollment year, DPI won’t give a scholarship to the child for any year after. That sure sounds like the beginning of the end for special needs scholarships for private schools. In other words, the start of phasing them out. Melissa Baldauff, Evers’ communications director, said the proposed changes to the special needs program shouldn’t be seen as a phase out. Rather, she said, they represent ending the expansion of voucher programs. She noted the special needs program wasn’t started until 2015. ""It was a significant expansion of the (school voucher) programs,"" she said. ""We’re not ending it. It’s just saying we’re not going to grow unsustainably anymore because taxpayers can’t afford to fund two separate education systems."" Fair enough. But in our view the language is plain -- it states that no new students will be admitted to the program. As such, the program will -- year by year -- get smaller until it is gone. Our rating Evers made a campaign promise to phase out school voucher programs and increase funding for public education. In an appearance at Marquette University, he said he would not begin to phase them out in his first budget. Once the budget was released, however, it was clear that he wants to phase out at least part of the program -- the part relating to students with special needs. For a partial change in position, we give Evers a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1BCC40>],/factchecks/2019/mar/12/tony-evers/wisconsin-governor-takes-half-step-phasing-out-sch/

Ernst uses flabby $93 trillion estimate for Green New Deal
","The Green New Deal — a bold, thinly detailed climate change-centered plan from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — has drawn heated reactions from Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa. When Ernst spoke against the New York Democrat’s proposal during a Senate session, she called it a ""raw deal."" And she made a provocative claim by displaying a large poster that read: ""At $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789."" At $93 trillion, Ernst’s claim uses a colossal figure. But it’s only about as strong as a clothespin in high wind. Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal is a House resolution — that is, a non-binding measure and not actual legislation. There’s also a companion measure in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in early March that the Senate would vote on the Green New Deal in the coming weeks.

Broadly speaking, the resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. The House version has far-reaching environmental goals, including ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible."" And it reaches into other domestic policy areas, as well. But the proposal doesn’t lay out any cost figures. And it has not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on such estimates. To back Ernst’s $93 trillion claim — a figure that spans 10 years — her office pointed us to a report on the Green New Deal by the American Action Forum, which describes itself as a center-right think tank. The forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative, nonprofit advocacy organization. Interestingly, the report does not state its bottom-line estimate of what the Green New Deal would cost. But if you add up the various figures, the cost is pegged at somewhere between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. So, Ernst is wrong when she flatly states that the Green New Deal will cost $93 trillion. By far, the largest expenses, as estimated by the American Action Forum, are for non-environmental parts of the proposal: $36 trillion for universal health care and up to to $44.6 trillion for guaranteed union jobs with a family-sustaining wage. The environmental costs include an estimated $5.4 trillion to transition to a ""low-carbon electricity grid."" But Ernst’s claim is even more misleading in that the report itself is full of assumptions, qualifiers and caveats. Indeed, the report starts with a caveat, saying the breadth of the Green New Deal’s proposals ""makes it daunting to assess"" using the ""standard tools of policy analysis. Nevertheless, this short paper is an initial foray."" And the report’s lead author, economist and American Action Forum president Douglas Holtz-Eakin, made it clear to us that the report aims to provide very rough estimates on a plan that’s only partially developed. ""It’s important to distinguish whether it’s tens of millions, tens of billions of dollars or tens of trillions of dollars,"" he said. ""That’s the important information."" Politico goes so far as to call the $93 trillion ""bogus."" But Holtz-Eakin’s work has held up to scrutiny before. He was the director of the Congressional Budget Office from 2003 to 2005 under President George W. Bush. According to the New York Times, he was often ""a thorn in the side of the Bush administration."" And Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us the American Action Forum report is ""a perfectly reasonable paper"" for what it is —putting an ""order of magnitude,"" rough cost estimate on a bare-bones proposal. As for the rest of Ernst’s claim — that $93 trillion is ""more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789"" — Ernst’s office said historical tables from the fiscal 2019 federal budget show total federal spending is $83 trillion since 1789. Holtz-Eakin told us he had not seen such a figure calculated. But both Holtz-Eakin and Gleckman told us Ernst's methodology doesn’t take into account 230 years of inflation, population growth and economic growth. Ernst says: ""At $93 trillion, the Green New Deal would cost more than the entire recorded spending of the U.S. since the Constitution went into effect in 1789."" A center-right think tank run by the former head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office estimates the cost of the Green New Deal, over 10 years, at between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. But the report itself described the estimates as an ""initial foray,"" filled with assumptions and caveats about a thinly detailed plan. No official government cost estimate has been done. And even if the high-end estimate of $93 trillion were accurate, comparing it with total federal spending since the Constitution is problematic, to say the least. Simply adding up federal spending, as Ernst did, doesn't take into account either inflation or population growth. Ernst's statement simply goes way too far.

Sinclair Lewis might have liked that quote about fascism and the flag, but it wasn't his
","Before his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on March 2, President Donald Trump embraced the American flag to the crowd’s cheers as ""God Bless the U.S.A."" by Lee Greenwood played. Social media posts about the moment followed, including one that claimed to quote Sinclair Lewis, who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1930. ""When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross,"" reads the text in a screenshot of a tweet that also shows a picture of Trump hugging the flag. It was posted to Facebook on March 5, and flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The tweet is by Randy Bryce, whose Twitter handle is @IronStache. He is a U.S. Army veteran who ran as a Democrat for Wisconsin’s 1st congressional district. It has been shared on Twitter more than 22,000 times and more than 500 people replied to it, including some who said that it’s not a Sinclair Lewis quote. We reached out to Working Families, a political group where Bryce is a senior advisor, according to his Twitter bio, to ask about the quote. A spokesman for the organization said in an email that ""it turns out Sinclair Lewis never wrote those exact words, though they’re commonly attributed to him."" Bryce updated his Twitter acknowledging that it’s not a Sinclair Lewis quote, the spokesman said. When we checked Bryce’s account on March 12, the tweet was still pinned to his page. But he had also tweeted excerpts from the Sinclair Lewis Society at Illinois State University, which notes on its website that though the quote sounds like something Lewis might have said or written, the society has never been able to find the exact quote. Whether Lewis said the quote about fascism is the society’s ""most asked question,"" according to its website. The society also lists passages from two novels he wrote that are similar to the quote attributed to him. In ""It Can’t Happen Here,"" he writes: ""But he saw too that in America the struggle was befogged by the fact that the worst fascists were they who disowned the word ‘fascism’ and preached enslavement to capitalism under the style of constitutional and traditional Native American liberty."" In ""Gideon Planish,"" he writes: ""I just wish people wouldn’t quote Lincoln or the Bible, or hang out the flag or the cross, to cover up something that belongs more to the bank-book and the three golden balls."" ""There was also a play by Sherman Yellen called ‘Strangers’ in the late 1970s which had a similar quote, but no one, including one of Lewis’s biographers, Richard Lingeman, has ever been able to locate the original citation,"" according to the society. In 2007, Harvard Magazine published a plea from a reader who sought ""the definitive source"" of the quote, which he said was ""attributed variously to Upton Sinclair, H.L. Mencken, and Huey Long, and to Sinclair Lewis’ ‘It Can’t Happen Here.’"" But the reader said online searches of the novel didn’t reveal the quote, and when we searched the book for the quote on Google Books, we couldn’t find it either. We emailed Harvard Magazine to find out if the publication has discovered the quote’s origins in the years since that reader’s request, but senior editor Jean Ann Martin said, ""sadly, we have not located a definitive source to date."" Certainly, many people have attributed the quote to Lewis—not just Randy Bryce or the Facebook poster. Lewis has ""long been quoted erroneously,"" according to a Nov. 6 Talking Points Memo story. It’s been pinned to other people, too. On Goodreads, the quote is attributed to James Waterman Wise. But lacking a credible, solid source for the quote, we won’t attribute it to anyone.

AOC wasn't fired from 'Hot Dog on a Stick,' as meme says
","This past weekend marked the start of daylight saving, which means we have more time to fact-check the many attacks on U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s fitness for office before the sun sets. One Facebook post published on March 8 sounds incredulous that Democrats could have elected her to Congress. ""Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez was fired from ‘Hot Dog on a Stick’ in 2008 — for incompetence,"" reads the text over a photo of a woman in what looks like a uniform. The post, which misspells the congresswoman’s first name, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez said the claim is false.  Hot Dog on a Stick, a hot dog company that started in Santa Monica, Calif., in 1946, didn’t immediately respond to PolitiFact’s email about the post. There are now 70 stores in seven states, according to the company’s website. But after searching online for mentions of Ocasio-Cortez and Hot Dog on a Stick, we couldn’t find any news stories suggesting that she ever worked there, or that she was fired from the company. Rather, Kathleen Shaffer, senior director of creative and communications for the Global Franchise Group, Hot Dog on a Stick’s parent company, told FactCheck.org that no person by the name Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was ever employed there, according to the group’s records. Next, we looked at the photo itself. A reverse image search of the picture turned up other posts with the same claim that Ocasio-Cortez is pictured, but also photos without any text, like this one from imgflip.com. It’s described as a ""Hot dog on a stick Template"" where users can ""caption this Meme."" The photo is included among several on a 2015 post on the website NeoGAF titled, ""Is there anything hotter than a girl in a baseball cap?"" The picture also appears on Reddit, where one user noticed the same discrepancy we did: The image doesn’t look like Ocasio-Cortez.

Did Michelle Obama have a staff of 23 while Melania Trump has just 4?
","  A recent viral image shared by the conservative group Turning Point USA sought to contrast the way the Obamas and the Trumps handle public money in the course of carrying out their work. The post said, ""Obama donated none of his salary. Michelle had a staff of 23. Trump donates all of his salary. Melania has a staff of 4."" Posted to Facebook on Aug. 1, 2018, this image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. It was also shared with PolitiFact by a reader.  Alleging that the Obamas ripped off taxpayers with lavish spending is a longtime attack line, and one that’s been regularly debunked. We knocked down such claims during Obama’s first term, as did FactCheck.org and Snopes. What about this viral image? There’s not much controversy about the presidents’ divergent approaches to salary donation. We are tracking Trump’s pledge to donate his presidential salary on the Trump-O-Meter and currently rate it a Promise Kept.  But what about the assertion that Michelle Obama ""had a staff of 23"" while Melania Trump ""has a staff of 4""? We found that it’s exaggerated. (Turning Point USA did not respond to an inquiry.) Shortly after her husband was sworn in, Trump said in a statement that she would slowly build out her staff. ""I am putting together a professional and highly experienced team, which will take time to do properly,"" the statement said. ""I am excited to be organizing and bringing together such a dynamic and forward-thinking group of individuals who will work together to make our country better for everyone."" In April 2018, the White House told CNN that the East Wing staff had reached 10 people. The following August, the Washington Post reported the same number of staffers — 10. In late June 2018, an official filing by the White House listed at least seven employees who had been cited in the CNN report as reporting to Melania Trump: • Lindsay B. Reynolds, assistant to the president and chief of staff to the first lady. • Stephanie A. Grisham, deputy assistant to the president and director of communications for the office of the first lady. • Anna C. Niceta, deputy assistant to the president and social secretary. • Reagan P. Thompson, special assistant to the president and director of policy for the office of the first lady • Emily K. Biddle, deputy social secretary • Vanessa M. Schneider, deputy social secretary • Anne H. LeHardy, communications coordinator Grisham told PolitiFact on March 12, 2019, that the first lady’s office had reached 12 employees. Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to Laura Bush from 2005 to 2009 and is now an executive in residence at the School of Public Affairs at American University, said that the size of Melania Trump’s staff ""is totally driven by the choice of the first lady, and to be fair to her, she said right from the beginning she was not interested in the quantity of her staff but rather in the quality. She has been clear that she is not going to be defined by past descriptions of the job, and certainly every first lady gets to redefine the role to suit her vision."" In any case, the post said that Melania Trump has four staffers, but that’s not accurate. What the post does get right is that Trump’s East Wing staff is smaller than Obama’s — though it’s misleading to single out Obama, since it’s also below that of most recent presidents. At 10, Melania Trump’s staff would be the smallest of any first lady since Mamie Eisenhower, said Allida Black, a research professor at George Washington University, in an interview with the Washington Post. We found that Michelle Obama's staff was about 25, similar in size to her immediate predecessors. In 2009, the Associated Press reported that outgoing first lady Laura Bush had a staff of between 24 and 26, while Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff reached 19 by March 2000. Sheila Tate, Nancy's Reagan's press secretary, told PolitiFact in 2011 that the first lady’s staff in her era tended to be 15 people. ""The role of the first lady has evolved over the centuries, and the hyper-active first lady that we are accustomed to today was something that came about in the 1970s,"" said Jennifer Highfield, president of the National First Ladies’ Library in Canton, Ohio. A smaller staff does have an impact on what a first lady can accomplish, said Myra Gutin, a communications professor at Rider University and author of the books, ""The President’s Partner: The First Lady in the Twentieth Century"" and ""Barbara Bush: First Lady of Literacy."" ""A smaller staff limits the first lady's reach in terms of advocacy for an issue, travel, speeches, and media,"" Gutin said. That smaller reach may be in line with Melania Trump’s wishes, said Katherine Jellison, an Ohio University historian who specializes in first ladies. While Melania Trump has advocated for reducing online bullying in an effort called ""Be Best,"" Jellison said she ""doesn't have the extensive public agenda that Eleanor Roosevelt, Michelle Obama, or some other first ladies had."" The post said that Michelle Obama ""had a staff of 23"" while Melania Trump ""has a staff of 4."" The number for Obama is in the ballpark, but the number for Trump is too low. Meanwhile, although Trump’s staff is smaller than Obama’s, it’s misleading to single out Obama, since Trump’s staff is also smaller than any first lady’s staff, Democratic or Republican, in decades.

Fact-checking claim about Kansas City Chiefs' stadium, illegal immigration
","A Facebook post claims that enough people crossed illegally into the United States in February to fill the Kansas City Chiefs’ football stadium. The claim needs clarification but is mostly accurate. ""Seating capacity: 76416,"" said the text at the top of a picture of a football stadium. A sign in the picture says ""Chiefs,"" referring to the football team from Kansas City, Mo. Text on the lower end of the photo adds: ""In February alone there were enough illegal immigrants who crossed the border to fill this stadium."" The March 11 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Kansas City Chiefs play at Arrowhead Stadium, which is able to fit 76,416 people, according to the 2018 NFL Record & Fact Book. (It also holds a Guinness record for crowd noise, PolitiFact Missouri found.) So that part of the claim is accurate. Did 76,416 people cross the border illegally in February? Close to it. The Facebook post doesn’t specify that it’s talking about the southwest border, but it likely is referring to southwest border migration data published monthly by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In February, Border Patrol agents made 66,450 apprehensions at the southwest border. Apprehension data is commonly used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. The number refers to apprehensions between ports of entry. Customs and Border Protection also releases monthly tallies on the number of people who wanted to come into the United States legally but were turned away by border officers. Lacking proper travel documents is one of the reasons why someone might be denied entry. This segment is classified as ""inadmissibles."" In February, 9,653 people were deemed inadmissible after presenting themselves at ports of entries along the southwest border. Adding the number of people apprehended for illegal entry and the number of people who wanted to come in legally but were denied entry results in 76,103 people. (It’s unclear if there’s overlap in the numbers; for instance, if someone denied legal entry later tried to come in illegally.) The post suggests that it’s mainly Mexicans who crossed the border illegally by featuring the Mexican flag in the middle of the stadium. Most immigrants now apprehended at the border are from Central America, not Mexico. One final note on the post's use of ""illegal immigrants:"" Many of the people crossing the border are seeking asylum protection. To apply for asylum, migrants need to be present in the United States. Federal and international laws allow immigrants to apply for asylum whether they arrived here legally or illegally.  With those caveats, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DFFF00>],/factchecks/2019/mar/12/blog-posting/fact-checking-claim-about-kansas-city-chiefs-stadi/

Comparing Manafort's sentence to life sentence for man who sold pot
","As far back as 2010, President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was hiding a lot of money from the IRS. Prosecutors accused him of laundering over $30 million in overseas income, using a network of companies to mask millions he earned as a political consultant and lobbyist for Ukrainian politicians. A jury convicted him on eight counts of tax and bank fraud. Under sentencing guidelines, Manafort faced over 19 years in prison. On March 7, when a federal judge gave him less than four years, the protests came quickly. ""Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, commits bank and tax fraud and gets 47 months,"" Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren tweeted a few hours after the judge announced his decision. ""A homeless man, Fate Winslow, helped sell $20 of pot and got life in prison. The words above the Supreme Court say 'Equal Justice Under Law' — when will we start acting like it?"" Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, commits bank and tax fraud and gets 47 months. A homeless man, Fate Winslow, helped sell $20 of pot and got life in prison. The words above the Supreme Court say ""Equal Justice Under Law""—when will we start acting like it? The juxtaposition that Warren cited is real, but there’s more to the backstory. In 2008, Louisiana man Fate Vincent Winslow sold $20 worth of marijuana to an undercover police officer working on a prostitution operation in Shreveport. But it wasn’t that single sale alone that landed him with such a severe sentence. Winslow had three prior felony convictions — 24 years earlier for simple burglary, another simple burglary conviction 15 years before, and possession of cocaine in 2004. He had no convictions for violent crimes. The sale netted Winslow $5 (the rest went to the men who provided the pot) but under Louisiana’s habitual offender law, at trial, prosecutors sought and got a life sentence for Winslow. Winslow appealed. Two judges found nothing unusual that merited leniency. ""The defendant has failed to rebut the presumption by showing that he is exceptional,"" they wrote in 2010. ""The fact that his prior offenses were nonviolent is, by itself, insufficient."" Winslow’s story has been well documented. The American Civil Liberties Union included his case in a 2013 report. News organizations have reported on his sentence. Winslow remains behind bars. Winslow would not have faced a life sentence were it not for the state’s three-strikes, law for repeat offenders. ""It would be very hard to find a Winslow case in the federal system,"" City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy said. ""The federal level has a heavy concentration on people smuggling and dealing the drugs in volume, and not possession and small sales. People convicted of serious drug charges are less likely to face a three-strikes issue because they face long sentences right off the bat."" Fordham University law professor John Pfaff echoed that point. ""Nationwide almost all people serving long sentences are in for violence, usually serious charges,"" Pfaff said. ""I can’t think of any federal cases that result in life for such a small amount of weed. Louisiana is in many ways uniquely harsh in this specific context."" It is also important to look at how Manafort’s white-collar offense and Winslow’s drug sale play out differently when it comes to habitual offender laws. Street criminals are much more likely to be subject to a three-strikes rule simply because street crime is much more common. The National White Collar Crime Center reported that in 2014, arrests for forgery, fraud and embezzlement totalled about 96,000. That same year, the FBI reported over 9.4 million violent and property crimes, including the sort of burglary offenses that Winslow had on his record — a nearly 100-fold difference. McCoy added that Winslow might have been hit with what she called the ""trial penalty."" It’s up to the prosecutors to push for the maximum sentence, if they choose. ""If you don’t take the plea deal they offer, you face the maximum,"" McCoy said. ""This is the way they force people to forgo the right to trial."" Katherine Maris Mattes, director of the Criminal Justice Clinic at Tulane Law School in New Orleans, said if Winslow were sentenced today, it’s possible he could have avoided a life sentence. ""There’s been a continual reduction in who is subject to the habitual offender statute,"" Mattes said. ""Recently, they changed the look-back period to five years. So if it’s been more than five years since a person completed their sentence for a previous offense, it breaks the chain of offenses for purposes of the law."" Winslow’s history went back 24 years to his first conviction. Mattes also noted that lower income offenders are far more likely to be caught up in a three-strikes law. Enforcement of street crime felonies is more widespread than white-collar investigations. This was Manafort’s first conviction, as the judge noted. He faces a second judge for sentencing on March 13 for related offenses. Warren juxtaposed Manafort’s 47-month sentence with the case of Winslow, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for selling $20 worth of marijuana. The basic facts are correct. To clarify, though, it was his three prior convictions, the oldest coming 24 years before, that made Winslow subject to Louisiana’s habitual offender law.

Is it true that Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium is considered the loudest in the world?
","The Kansas City Chiefs had an outstanding 2018-2019 season by all accounts. Their second-year quarterback Patrick Mahomes exploded onto the NFL landscape with a 5,097-yard, 50-touchdown season that made him the youngest NFL MVP since Dan Marino in 1984. The combination of Mahomes and head coach Andy Reid led to the Chiefs having one of the NFL’s most explosive offenses, an offense that propelled the team to a 12-4 record, an AFC West division title and a playoff win over the Indianapolis Colts. While the season came to a heartbreaking end in a 37-31 home overtime loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Kansas City Chiefs fans remain excited about the future. On Jan. 22, two days after the loss to the Patriots, state Sen. Kiki Curls, D-Kansas City, argued for a resolution, SCR4, designating the Kansas City Chiefs as the official football team of the state of Missouri in front of the Senate Rules, Joint Rules, Resolutions and Ethics committee. While presenting her arguments, Curls said, ""We are one of the biggest tailgating teams in the country and (Arrowhead) is considered the loudest stadium in the world."" Is Arrowhead Stadium really the loudest stadium in the world? We wanted to find out. Well, according to the Guiness Book of World Records, Curls, who did not respond to our request for comment, is right. On Sept. 29, 2014, Guiness measured an ear-shattering 142.2 dbA roar at Arrowhead Stadium in the Chiefs’ 41-14 rout of the Patriots. The record-breaking sound came with 8 seconds left in the first quarter after the Chiefs stuffed New England’s Shane Vereen for no gain on second down. To give you some context, 140 dbA is the estimated sound on the deck of a busy aircraft carrier. However, the Guinness record is for loudest crowd roar at a sports stadium, not loudest stadium overall. The record is basically the loudest moment recorded inside a sports stadium. These roars are far from authentic. Teams typically prompt the fans with ""get loud"" messages on the jumbotron, and fans are informed before the game that the team is attempting to break the record. While measuring authentic crowd noise throughout a game would be a better way to determine the loudest stadium, we were unable to find numbers measuring anything other than individual crowd roars. We did it.#LoudAndProud #ChiefsKingdom pic.twitter.com/qrNHbXc5MA ""One hundred percent (we can feel the energy of the crowd),"" Mahomes said in a January news release. ""Whenever you can go out in pregame warmups and feed on the energy because the fans are there packing the stadium that early, it truly is special. We feed off that the entire game."" Back in 1990, Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway asked the referee to quiet down the Arrowhead crowd. It happened again in 1992 in a game against the Oakland Raiders, this time with the referees threatening to take one of Kansas City’s timeouts if the crowd did not dial back the volume. The brief history of the unofficial title of world’s loudest stadium is interesting. Until 2013, supporters of Galatasaray, a Turkish football club, held the record for a March 2011 roar that reached 131.76 dbA. This mark was first bested by Seattle Seahawks fans at Centurylink Field on Sept. 15, 2013, with a 136.6 dbA reading. The record was then contested between the Chiefs and the Seahawks for the remainder of the season, with the Chiefs breaking the Seahawks’ record 28 days later only for Centurylink Field to later regain the top spot before Arrowhead set the current record in 2014. Some may point to the 76,416 max capacity at Arrowhead Stadium as opposed to the 67,000 capacity at Centurylink Field as the reason for the Chiefs holding the record. However, this fails to account for the structural differences between the two stadiums. The architectural director who designed CenturyLink Field, Paul Greisemer, said the stadium was designed to enhance crowd noise, pointing to the roof, closeness of the fans, and use of metal and concrete as the primary factors. ""It’s a metal roof, so it naturally is a very reflective surface,"" Greisemer said in an interview with KIRO Radio. ""As is the seating bowl, which is largely concrete. So there are a lot of those materials that are serving as sound mirrors, if you will, and bouncing the sound right back. ""The way the roof is angled, and the way the bowl captures all the sound that goes backwards and focuses it back towards the center of the stadium, you’re pretty much going to get the maximum affect right at the players."" So while the Guiness record isn’t a great measure of what is actually the loudest stadium throughout the game, Arrowhead Stadium has as good a claim as any stadium to the title of world’s loudest stadium. Curls said Arrowhead ""is considered the loudest stadium in the world."" The Guinness Book of World Records says Arrowhead Stadium’s 142.2 dbA roar during the Sept. 29, 2014, game against the Patriots is the loudest crowd roar ever recorded at a sporting event. This record, along with other examples of extremely loud crowds at Arrowhead Stadium, gives Arrowhead legitimate claim to the title of world’s loudest stadium. However, since the Guiness record is far from a perfect measurement, Curls’ claim could use some additional context.

"['Energy', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist says Florida is the Sunshine State, but ""we’re hardly doing any solar energy production”
","As he gears up to run against Republican Gov. Rick Scott, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist is making an issue of renewable energy. On the Nov. 18, 2013, edition of MSNBC’s The Ed Show, Crist touted alternative energy as a way to attract new industries and new jobs to Florida. ""We’re the Sunshine State, and we’re hardly doing any solar energy production,"" Crist told host Ed Schultz. ""We should be the global leader in solar energy."" Crist later told PolitiFact that Florida Power & Light has a ""pretty significant solar field,"" but added that ""we can be doing so much more, in my humble opinion. ... My understanding is that many other states encourage the use of solar energy much more than Florida"" does. After looking at Crist’s claim, we concluded that he has a valid point. One key way to look at the question is to measure installed solar capacity -- that is, the electricity-generating potential of installed solar equipment, including everything from a few solar panels on top of a home to an array of thousands of solar panels in the desert.  As of June 2013, California leads the nation with 3,761 megawatts of installed solar capacity. Arizona comes in second with 1,250 megawatts. New Jersey, which isn’t exactly known for its sunny skies but where roof-mounted units have proven popular, ranks third with 1,119 megawatts.  Florida, by contrast, has 202 megawatts, making it No. 10 in the nation. This might sound pretty good, but it’s well below the state’s potential. Florida actually ranks third in the country for solar potential. Yet its installed capacity trails such smaller and less-sunny states as North Carolina, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Pennsylvania. ""Relatively speaking, Florida is doing little to no solar,"" said Jim Fenton, director of the Florida Solar Energy Center at the University of Central Florida. Another measurement is what goals a state is setting. Twenty-nine states, plus Washington, D.C., and two territories, have a renewable portfolio standard policy -- utilities risk being fined if they don’t fulfill a certain percentage of a state’s energy needs through renewables such as solar or wind. Another eight states and two territories have less formal renewable energy goals.  Another 13 states have neither -- and Florida is one of them. As it happens, when Crist was governor, he directed the Florida Public Service Commission to develop a state renewable portfolio standard policy, with a goal of 20 percent renewable energy production by 2020. The PSC did approve a draft of the plan in 2009, and it was submitted to the Florida Legislature for consideration. But the Legislature didn’t approve it, so it never went into effect. There's another hurdle. Under Florida law, only a few utilities -- Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric -- can sell power directly to consumers. If a solar power generator wants to get into the state market, it must first sell to one of those utilities at cheaper wholesale rate. This undercuts the economic incentives to invest in solar, especially given the prevailing price of power in the state. ""Electricity rates have been relatively low in Florida so that’s the main reason why we haven’t done much here,"" Fenton said, adding that the cost of solar energy systems has dropped by 40-50 percent since 2009. ""Alternative energy will always be an alternative until it’s cheaper. It’s cheaper in New Jersey. It’s not cheaper in Florida -- yet."" In fact, to the extent that Florida has put solar capacity into use, most of it occurred when Crist was governor. In 2008, during Crist’s tenure, the state Legislature passed a renewable energy law that allowed utilities to build solar or wind projects generating up to 110 megawatts of energy without going through the normal regulatory review process. Florida Power & Light secured the entire amount, used in three installations. The FPL plants now account for more than half the state’s solar output. FPL spokesman Erik Hofmeyer said solar power is part of the utility’s overall energy mix and the utility ""is looking at more solar opportunities."" Still, considering the amount and intensity of sunlight hitting the ground in Florida, the amount of energy being produced is relatively small. ""Florida is in the dark ages, and we lag behind many, many other states that have goals and incentives and other policy mechanisms to promote and advance clean, renewable solar energy,"" said Wayne Wallace, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association. Our ruling Crist said that Florida is the ""Sunshine State, and we’re hardly doing any solar energy production."" On the one hand, Florida ranks in the top 10 states nationally for installed solar energy capacity. On the other hand, given how much sun Florida gets, it is something of an underperformer nationally, and its policies -- a lack of a renewable portfolio standard and the existence of strict laws governing electricity sales -- pose challenges to future development of the state’s solar resources.

Doonesbury says government shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy
","Lest we forget that the deal that ended the October government shutdown provided only some breathing room and not a lasting fix, the comic strip Doonesbury reminded us that a second crisis is possible. On Sunday, Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau offered this conversation between disembodied voices coming from the White House. ""Who’s calling please?"" ""Thirty extremists from gerrymandered districts. We’re going to take the economy hostage again and we’ll destroy it if we don’t get what we want."" ""But the last time you tried that, the economy bled $24 billion and you got nothing."" The conversation ends when the caller is transferred to the Obamacare hotline where all lines are down and the call goes dead. Our interest is in the claim of a $24 billion hit on the economy from the standoff over Obamacare and the debt ceiling. Eventually -- once the final economic data is released early next year -- we'll have a good idea of how much of a hit the economy took from the shutdown. But for now, we have to estimate it. So how large are the most reliable estimates? We found that the $24 billion figure, which emerged when the shutdown ended in mid-October, still holds water, although it’s at the high end of the estimates. Trudeau told PunditFact that he relied on the estimate from Standard and Poor’s. Analysts there wrote on Oct. 16 that GDP for the fourth quarter would be 0.6 percent less than it would have been. That translates into $24 billion. The losses stem from consumers trimming their spending, delays in processing export and import permits, small business loans that got held up and dozens of other tiny but significant ways that private-sector activity crosses paths with the government. At the peak of the impasse, estimates of the economic impact varied. JP Morgan came in at the low end with a 0.2 percent drop in GDP, or about a $12 billion hit. Economists at Goldman Sachs and the consulting firm IHS thought it would be 0.5 percent. About five days after the shutdown ended, Moody’s Analytics produced a damage report. They also thought half a percentage point off of growth, or roughly $20 billion, was the right number. Moody’s went a bit further and warned that the impact was not limited to just the days that the government remained shuttered. ""As long as lawmakers stay deadlocked over the direction of  the federal budget, the economic recovery will not gain momentum,"" chief economist Mark Zandi wrote. ""Consumers and businesses will remain on edge, holding back spending, investment and hiring."" About a week after the government re-opened, the White House produced one of the lower estimates. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers looked at eight different measures of economic activity and came up with a figure of about 0.25 percent which would mean about a $14 billion loss in growth. The council said such a drop cost the country 120,000 jobs. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy research arm of Congress, summarized what was known as of early November but did not offer its own estimate. That report emphasized it will be several months before all the hard data is in that will allow a detailed accounting. Also in November, Bloomberg News surveyed over 70 economists and found that the consensus was the shutdown had trimmed fourth quarter annualized growth by about 0.4 percent, or $16 billion. By mid December, top-level budget negotiations between Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., are slated to produce a spending plan that will carry the country beyond the Jan. 15, 2014, deadline set in the deal that ended the shutdown. There have been encouraging signs of compromise but even if a plan emerges, it must still make it through the House -- which is where the trouble started last time. Our ruling Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said the government shutdown cost the economy $24 billion. That is based on the highest of the independent estimates. The others are lower. Three prominent forecasters, Goldman Sachs, IHS and Moody’s assessed the damage at $20 billion. A survey of economists set $16 billion as the most likely figure. There is broad agreement that the political impasse produced uncertainty that puts an ongoing, if unquantified, damper on growth. Trudeau likes to say he aims for verisimilitude and he achieved that with his use of a high but defensible estimate from an independent source.

Senate Democrats joined forces with a handful of Republicans to successfully defend their bid to ease restrictions on transferring detainees out of the controversial military prison. The changes have yet to clear Congress. But the victory may be a sign that support for closing Guantanamo is growing.  \Chambliss, who opposes current efforts to close Guantanamo, warned during a Senate floor debate that the proposed changes could free terrorists to strike again. ""These are not abstract theories; they are facts. The recidivism rate is nearly 29 percent and has been climbing steadily since detainees began being released from Guantanamo,"" the Georgia Republican said. PolitiFact Georgia decided to unleash the AJC Truth-O-Meter to determine whether those really are the ""facts."" The proposal to alter detainee transfer rules is part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which would provide defense funding. Chambliss, who is vice chairman of the Senate’s Select Committee on Intelligence, co-sponsored a failed amendment that would have prevented the changes. How many former detainees have returned to terrorism is a central issue in the Guantanamo debate. A low recidivism rate could breathe life into President Barack Obama’s attempt to fulfill his 2008 campaign promise to close the prison. (We gave him a Promise Broken rating on the Obameter in August.) A high rate could kill it. But tracking former Guantanamo detainees isn’t as easy as counting prisoners released from a state penitentiary. The calculation relies on intelligence that the government keeps classified. Critics complain that the figures are impossible to verify because the names of re-offenders are not released. A few may have been branded as recidivists for merely criticizing the U.S. Some former prisoners may never have been terrorists in the first place, they say. A semiannual report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence addresses some of these criticisms by giving more precise descriptions for what counts as returning to terrorism. When an ex-detainee is ""confirmed of re-engaging"" in terrorism or insurgency, intelligence gatherers have found a ""preponderance of information"" showing the former prisoner is directly involved in activities such as planning attacks, financing operations or recruiting for terrorist groups. The group does not include those who only make anti-U.S. statements or call other former prisoners to talk about old times. When an ex-detainee is ""suspected of re-engaging,"" intelligence gatherers have ""plausible but unverified"" evidence or ""single-source reporting"" showing the former prisoner is directly involved. According to the latest ODNI report, which was released in September, 100 of 603 released detainees were ""confirmed of re-engaging,"" or about 16.6 percent. An additional 74, or 12.3 percent, were ""suspected of re-engaging."" Add them together and you get 28.9 percent, or ""nearly 29 percent,"" as Chambliss said.   As part of our assessment of the senator’s statement, we also considered whether the number of ""re-engaging"" ex-detainees is ""climbing steadily."" During the George W. Bush years, 532 detainees were released, according to the report. Of those, 97 were ""confirmed of re-engaging,"" while 70 were suspected of it. Under Obama, 71 detainees were released. Three were confirmed as returning to terrorism. Four are suspected. In other words, the total number has increased under Obama, but his percentage is lower than the Bush administration’s.   So, did Chambliss get it right? A spokeswoman for Chambliss says it’s common to combine the categories because ex-detainees often switch from the ""suspected"" to ""confirmed"" designation. Also, she says, intelligence gatherers have to detect some level of terrorist activity before it classifies someone as ""suspected."" But The Washington Post pointed out that when Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess Jr., then the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified before Congress in February 2011, he corrected Chambliss when the senator used a recidivism figure that combined the classifications. Burgess said the figure ""would not be confirmed by the Defense Intelligence Agency in terms of having returned to the fight or re-engaged."" In addition, the ODNI report makes clear that ex-detainees classified as ""suspected of re-engaging"" may not have done so. Chambliss’ decision to combine them with confirmed terrorists gives the impression that the data support his argument more forcefully than it actually does. Chambliss’ assessment that the rate of recidivists is ""climbing steadily"" also has some weaknesses. The number of suspected or confirmed recidivists has grown by a half-dozen or so since Obama took office, but his percentage is lower than that of the Bush administration. PolitiFact’s definition of ""Half True"" means that a statement is at least partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think Chambliss’ claim fits the bill. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097591480>],/factchecks/2013/dec/02/saxby-chambliss/chambliss-statement-partially-true-needs-context/

Facebook group says Congress has raised the minimum wage three times in 25 years while giving itself 15 raises
","The idea of raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour is becoming a hot button issue. Supporters say that wage is so low it forces the working poor to seek out food stamps to survive, adding to the burden of taxpayers and subsidizing the profits of low-paying companies such as Walmart and McDonalds. Critics say that raising the minimum wage kills jobs, makes it harder for companies to hire new workers, and adds to the costs of goods and services for everyone. (Nineteen states have their own minimum wage laws that exceed the federal base. Among them is Rhode Island, where the minimum wage, now $7.75, goes to $8 on Jan. 1.) Raise the Minimum Wage, a Facebook group that wants Congress to pass an $11 minimum wage, is criticizing Congress, claiming it’s quick to give itself pay increases but slow to raise the minimum wage. It posted a picture of the Internet's well-known ""Grumpy Cat"" accompanied by this message: ""Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times."" It has been shared more than 8,800 times. We wondered whether the data are correct. To count the number of minimum wage increases since 1988, we turned to the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor. Its handy chart shows that in 1981, Congress had set the minimum wage at $3.35 per hour, where it remained until April 1, 1990, when it rose to $3.80. Since then, there have been six additional increases. That's seven in all, not three as the Facebook post asserts. And how often has Congressional pay increased? For that data, we turned to a Nov. 4, 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank for Congress, which tracked pay going back to 1789. In 1988, members of Congress earned $89,500 per year. The following year, Congress passed a law establishing automatic pay increases for itself unless the House and Senate specifically voted to forego raises, which it has done repeatedly. The law was amended in 1991. Since then, members of the House have seen their annual pay increase 14 times. The Senate has received 15 increases, which is the number the Facebook post got correct. Members of both bodies now receive $174,000 per year, with leaders receiving additional pay. So where did Raise the Minimum Wage get the idea that there have only been three minimum wage increases? It comes from that fact that the seven increases were the result of three Congressional votes, in 1989, 1996 and 2007. By that standard, Congress has only voted twice to increase its pay, although those votes produced 15 pay hikes. One commenter on the Facebook page said, ""The minimum wage should be increased by the same percent each time Congress gets a pay raise."" In fact, the minimum wage is now 116 percent higher than it was in 1988. By contrast, the pay for members of Congress has increased by 94 percent and inflation has increased by 97 percent. Our ruling A posting by the Facebook group Raise the Minimum Wage said, ""Since 1988, Congress has raised its own salary 15 times 'to reflect rising costs.' But raised the minimum wage only three times."" Although Congress has scored 15 pay increases thanks to the automatic formula it adopted in 1989, it has also approved seven increases in the minimum wage during that period, not three. Because the posting ignores more than half the minimum wage increases since 1988 while giving the false impression that Congress has actively voted itself raises 15 times, we rate the statement Mostly False.

Scott Walker responsible for Wisconsin's low and dropping projected job growth, Democratic Party chief Mike Tate says
","Two days before Gov. Scott Walker released his political memoir, Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate used a fund-raising email to highlight what’s not in the book. He claimed Walker is doing a number of things badly, including: ""Failing at job creation and dropping Wisconsin to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state."" The Nov. 17, 2013, solicitation cites a low ranking and pins the blame squarely on Walker. Is Tate right? Tate's evidence  We asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff to flesh out the claim. She said Walker has been campaigning out of state for president since at least March 2013, when Walker told Politico at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he gave a speech, that he would be visiting Iowa in May 2013. Walker at the time (and since) acknowledged he was open to a presidential bid and he declined to pledge to serve a full four-year term if re-elected governor in 2014. Although Walker hasn’t declared himself a candidate for president, nor formed an exploratory committee, he has made many political trips across the country during 2013 and is increasingly mentioned as a potential GOP nominee, particularly since the release of his book. As for Wisconsin dropping to 45th in job growth prospects, Baldauff cited Forbes’ annual ""best states for business"" feature, published in September 2013. Wisconsin's projected annual job growth was put at 1.3% over the next five years. ""The Badger State adopted the slogan of 'Open for Business' in 2011, erecting signs along the state border,"" Forbes said. ""Results have been slow, but Wisconsin’s projected job growth has improved slightly, moving from No. 49 to No. 45 among the states."" So, one study ranks Wisconsin 45th for future job prospects, as Tate stated. But contrary to what he claimed, the state’s ranking actually rose, albeit not by much. Other rankings A May 2013 report from the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council ranked Wisconsin 15th in ""economic outlook,"" up from 32nd a year earlier, based on 15 policy variables such as taxes. But that report didn’t rank the states on future job growth and we didn’t find any others that did.  Several experts we checked with -- at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Wisconsin Budget Project and the Center on Wisconsin Strategy -- weren’t aware of any, either. As for the rest of Tate’s claim, he directly blames Walker, even suggesting his political travels were a contributing factor. But it goes without saying that the state’s projected job growth depends on more than the actions of one person. As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, a chief executive such as a governor has influence over jobs, but so do a host of other factors, such as national trends, that are beyond a governor’s control. Our rating Tate said Walker has dropped Wisconsin ""to 45th in the nation in job growth prospects while campaigning for president out of state."" Forbes rates Wisconsin 45th, although that’s a slight improvement, not a drop. And Walker bears some, but not all of the blame, for the ranking. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Tate a Mostly False.

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Taxes', 'Joseph Henchman']","
Tax Foundation official says only 25 percent of what people buy in R.I. is subject to sales tax
","Rhode Island’s 7-percent sales tax is the second-highest rate in the nation. Whether it should stay that way, be reduced or even abolished, is being examined by the Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal Act of 2013. During the commission’s most recent hearing, on Nov.19, it heard testimony from Joseph D. Henchman, vice president of the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. Among other things, he said part of the reason Rhode Island’s sales tax rate is so high is because it taxes so little.   ""Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax,"" Henchman said. ""Only Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have narrower sales taxes. You are exempting 75 percent of the economy from the sales tax already and imposing a higher rate on the rest that you do tax."" Is Rhode Island’s sales tax really as narrow as Henchman says? Like most state sales taxes, Rhode Island’s is limited to the sale of so-called tangible goods, not services, such as lawn-mowing or legal fees. It is further diminished by about 83 categories of exempted items such as food, most clothing, medicines, and, more recently, art works and wine.    Henchman told us he got Rhode Island’s 25 percent figure from analysis done by John L. Mikesell, chancellor’s professor of public and environmental affairs at the Indiana University. Mikesell is considered one of the nation’s experts on state taxation policies. Henchman said the figure came from a statistic Mikesell calls ""breadth of base,"" which estimates how much of a state’s commerce is subject to its sales tax. Mikesell starts by taking a state’s total sales tax revenue and determining how much in retail sales was needed to produce that amount, a figure he calls the ""implied retail sales tax base."" He then expresses that base as a percentage of the state’s total personal income, the amount of money residents in the state have to spend. In 2011, Rhode Island’s 7-percent sales tax raised $824 million, which, by Mikesell’s calculation, required $11 billion in taxable sales. Its total personal income that year was about $44 billion, according to the state Department of Labor and Training. The $11-billion figure is 25 percent of $44 billion, and that’s the 25-percent figure that Henchman cited. But there’s a problem. Mikesell is measuring the percent of a state’s total personal income that is captured by its sales tax. Henchman was talking about the percent of a state’s total personal spending that is taxed, a very different amount. To get that figure, you’d have to know the total amount of retail sales in the state. Coming up with that number is next to impossible because the state doesn’t track sales it doesn’t tax, said Paul Dion, chief of revenue analysis for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue. ""I can’t even tell you what our retail tax base is,"" Dion said. ""We’d have to extrapolate that."" In 2012, the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research was looking at that state’s sales tax rate and it used Mikesell’s percentage also, but it made the point that Mikesell’s comparison was to income, not sales. ""In other words, 26.19 percent of Connecticut personal income is spent on goods and services subject to the sales tax,"" the report said. When we got back to Henchman, he said Mikesell’s personal income figure provides a uniform number that allows state-by-state comparisons. Dion agreed, and said when he heard Henchman’s statement, that’s how he understood it. Our ruling Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation said: ""Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax."" But the figure he cited actually referred to personal income, not what people buy. In fact, no one knows what percentage of everything that Rhode Islanders buy is subject to the sales tax because no one calculates total spending. Dion might have understood what Henchman meant, but we have to go by what he said. We rule his statement False. Correction: In the initial version of this item, Joseph Henchman was incorrectly identified as John Henchman in the Source List.

Chain email says major Pacific trade deal could be taken up in Senate without committee review or debate
","A new chain email warns that President Barack Obama is about to grab ""the powers of a king"" through a new trade agreement with Pacific Rim countries. The email begins, ""A leaked copy of Obama's top secret Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) has been posted on our website and it is much, much worse than anyone anticipated. We can say goodbye to America's borders, our Constitution and the rule of law if Obama and Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., are able to ram this treaty through the Senate. And that's exactly what they're trying to do! Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says this ‘free trade’ deal is a clear violation of the separation of powers. Only the Senate is allowed to negotiate trade agreements under the Constitution. Harry Reid wants to fast-track this treaty, which will essentially grant Obama the powers of a king to negotiate all future deals."" The email goes on to say, ""If this treaty is fast-tracked through the Senate, it won't receive a committee assignment and it will be subjected to a straight up-or-down vote, with no debate."" We learned of the email when a reader sent it to us, asking for a fact-check. The email originated with Pray For US, a Henderson, Nev.,""online outreach Christian church and ministry."" Most Americans probably haven’t heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but if the trade agreement comes to fruition -- and that’s far from a certainty at this point -- it could be a very big deal. One thing it wouldn’t do, though, is give Obama king-like powers. The email is also wrong when it claims that the fast-track process in Congress rules out committee assignments and debate. That’s what we’ll be fact-checking here. Let’s start with the basics. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, if it’s enacted, would set the ground rules for trade between a dozen nations in the Pacific region. It’s been in negotiation for several years among the United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Combined, these countries account for roughly 40 percent of the world’s economy. The Obama administration has made the agreement a top priority for trade policy. Mireya Solís, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has called it ""the most ambitious trade initiative pursued by the Obama Administration, one that will have large ramifications for overall trade policy and the direction of the world trading system."" Trade deals often draw opposition from the left (due to such concerns as labor rights, environmental protection and an expansion of corporate power) and sometimes from the right (such as over a feared loss of national sovereignty). This has been true with the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well, with various proposed provisions drawing fire, including everything from pharmaceutical patent rules to rights for legal redress. The deal could be taken up under a process informally known as ""fast-track."" That refers to a procedure outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. According to the Congressional Research Service, when Congress passed this law, it granted the president the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs. Congress would then enact changes related to the agreement through legislation, using a procedure that streamlined and sped up the legislation’s path through Congress. The streamlined rules were designed to keep lawmakers from making changes that would threaten the international agreement. Here are some of the key elements of the fast-track process, taken from a CRS summary: • The president sends a final text of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress. Identical bills are required to be introduced in each chamber of Congress on the day they are received. • The bills are then referred to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, as well as other committees, if jurisdiction warrants. Each committee has 45 in-session days to report the bill to the floor. If that deadline passes without committee action, the bill is automatically sent to the floor. • On the floor, debate is set at 20 hours, evenly divided between those for the agreement and against it. The chain email is correct that when the eventual vote is taken, it is on the original text, without any amendments. And the measure needs 50 percent plus one to pass -- not the common Senate supermajority of 60 votes. While these rules do curb lawmakers’ ability to shape the agreement’s terms, the email is simply wrong to claim that legislation stemming from a trade agreement ""won't receive a committee assignment"" and that the agreement will have ""no debate."" We will note two other problems with the claim. First, whatever comes out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation won’t be a ""treaty,"" as the email claims. Under the Constitution, treaties require a two-thirds vote by the Senate. Second, fretting about how the Trans-Pacific Partnership could be passed under the fast-track process is putting the cart before the horse. Fast-track authority must be renewed periodically by Congress, and that authority lapsed on July 1, 2007. Since then, Congress -- under both Democratic and Republican majorities -- has not chosen to renew it. And with relations between the two parties, and between the House and the administration, thoroughly frayed, a renewal looks unlikely anytime soon. So it's possible that the agreement will be considered under fast-track, but it's far from certain. Our ruling The chain email said that ""if the treaty (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) is fast-tracked through the Senate, it won't receive a committee assignment"" and the agreement will have ""no debate."" The procedures laid out in the Trade Act of 1974 are designed to streamline the process of enacting trade agreements, but the process does in fact include committee consideration and floor debate. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BA2E40>],/factchecks/2013/nov/29/chain-email/chain-email-says-major-pacific-trade-deal-could-be/

Iranian official called Israel 'rabid dog,' accused U.S. of war crimes, says Rubio
","Forget the Senate’s ""nuclear option."" Congress’s latest point of tension is the nuclear deal with Iran. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is among those opposed to the six-month deal, in which the United States agreed to lessen sanctions on Iran in exchange for certain limits placed on Iran’s growing nuclear program. The deal was brokered by the P5+1, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany. In his press release, Rubio highlighted a notoriously rocky relationship between the two countries, calling Iran a ""rogue state."" He went on to criticize the country’s leadership. ""Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes,"" he said. We wanted to see if Rubio’s claim was right and what evidence it was based on. Khamenei’s role We didn’t hear back from Rubio’s office, but we found that Khamenei gave a speech on Nov. 20, prior to the public announcement of the agreement. Khamenei is Iran’s appointed supreme leader and the country’s head of state. He holds more power in Iran than even President Hassan Rouhani, who is widely considered a moderate. Many analysts credit Rouhani’s election with making the recent agreement possible. As we’ll see, Khamenei’s takes a more hard-line approach toward both the United States and Israel than Rouhani. Khamenei is in charge of all of Iran’s foreign policy, including the nuclear agreement. But it’s worth noting that since he’s so high-ranking, he won’t be heavily involved in day-to-day operations -- that’s left to nuclear physicists and other lower-ranking officials. ""Rabid dog"" U.S. and Iranian news outlets reported that Khamenei said something about a ""rabid dog"" in a speech Nov. 20, less than a week before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced a deal with Iran. We saw conflicting reports in the direct translation of the phrase from Farsi to English. It wasn’t immediately clear to us whether Khamenei directed the comment toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, all Israeli people or all Jewish people. PolitiFact asked two Farsi-speaking Iranian political science experts for independent translations of the line in question. We showed the experts the Farsi speech transcript published on Khamenei’s official website. We also consulted an English-language video translation from Press TV, a state-owned news outlet in Iran. We found small discrepancies in the exact translation: ""Israel is the rabid dog of the region,"" was the wording Syracuse University Iranian studies professor Mehrzad Boroujerdi put forward, which closely matches many news reports we’ve seen. ""These Zionist financiers are really like wild beasts,"" was the wording Middle East Institute scholar Alex Vatanka gave us. He told us ""wild beasts"" and ""rabid dogs"" were not so far off from each other in Farsi. ""Zionist financiers,"" he said, is a clear reference to the Israeli government, especially Netanyahu. ""Israeli officials cannot be called humans. They are like animals, some of them."" That’s from the Press TV translator. Exact wording aside, the sentiment is largely the same. Khamenei did in fact call either government officials or the country as a whole the animals of the Middle East. That’s consistent with Khamenei’s overall stance, Vatanka said, adding that the leader previously referred to Israel as a ""cancerous tumor"" on the region. But Khamenei’s comments don’t necessarily reflect the way other Iranian officials or the public feels about Israel, Vatanka added. ""War crimes"" Rubio also said that Khamenei recently accused the United States of carrying out war crimes. When we watched the speech, we found truth to that. ""They committed crimes in Iraq, in Pakistan with drones. Still they are committing crimes with drones,"" he said, according to the Press TV translation. ""In Afghanistan they bombard people and they continue to commit crimes. Anywhere in which they can serve their interests, they will commit crimes including torture, killings, the Guantanamo prison."" That’s not an unusual statement for Khamenei. ""The man’s position on the United States has always been that the United States is unjust in its policies, it’s arrogant in its policies and it’s not trustworthy,"" Vatanka said. But at the same time, Khamenei has always supported reaching out to the United States when he feels the timing is right, Vatanka added. ""(Iranian officials) would not have been sitting in Geneva negotiating with Kerry if they didn’t have the green light from Khamenei."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""Just days ago, Iran's Supreme Leader (Ali) Khamenei, who will oversee implementation of this agreement, was calling Israel a 'rabid dog' and accusing the United States of war crimes."" Based on expert translations, we confirmed that Khamenei referred to either Israel or the Israeli government as the animals of the Middle East. In the same speech, he criticized the United States, saying they ""continue to commit crimes"" in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay.

"['Civil Rights', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Guns', 'Jerry Patterson']","
Texas firearm homicide rate down at least one-third since 1996
","An online campaign video from Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, one of the Republican hopefuls in the 2014 lieutenant governor race, touts his record on defending Second Amendment rights. ""I stood alone in passing the Texas concealed-handgun law over the doomsday predictions of blood in the streets, ‘Wild Wild West’ and shootouts at every four-way stop,"" Patterson says, ""and of course none of that happened. Matter of fact, firearms homicides are down about 40 percent."" As a state senator from Pasadena, Patterson wrote the 1995 legislation that allowed eligible Texans to get licenses to carry concealed handguns, which was approved overwhelmingly after much debate by a Senate vote of 23-7 and a House vote of 101-46. In news stories from the 1995 regular legislative session, Austin Democratic Rep. Sherri Greenberg predicted gunplay in hospital emergency rooms and Dallas lawmakers said frustrated drivers would shoot each other in traffic. A March 16, 1995, Houston Chronicle news story quoted then-Sen. Greg Luna, D-San Antonio, as saying, ""It is going to be a much more dangerous and deadly society we have imposed on ourselves in Texas."" Did firearms murders subsequently decrease by 40 percent? By phone, Patterson told us he used national data on firearms homicides rates per 100,000 people since 1993 because he didn’t have state statistics. Nationwide figures were still relevant, he said, ""because over the last 20 years, dozens of states have added concealed-handgun (licensing) laws that didn’t have them before."" Patterson campaign spokesman Chris Elam emailed us web links to reports published in May 2013 from the Pew Research Center and the U.S. Bureau of Justics Statistics  showing that in recent years, the rate of firearms homicides nationwide had fallen by 49 percent from a historic peak in 1993. But the Texas law took effect in 1996. Wouldn’t that year be the logical starting point for judging changes in deaths by firearms? Defending his claim, Patterson told us by phone that he used 1993 as a starting point because that was the year when lawmakers initially advanced his proposal, which Gov. Ann Richards vetoed. During this fact-check, he said, he ""recognized the flaw in me saying 1993 when it actually didn’t come into effect until 1 January 1996, but I think the message,"" that murders did not spike, ""is still accurate."" Next, we looked for data on Texas gun murders since 1996. From the CDC, we found reports online covering 1996-2010, drawn from death certificate information reported by medical professionals and coroners, and we got 1996-2012 data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, most recently updated Sept. 16, 2013, with information on murders and other crimes known to law enforcement agencies. By the CDC tally, the rate of firearms homicides in Texas 1996-2010 fell 32.2 percent. Calculating with the FBI data for 1996-2012, the rate fell 42 percent. The U.S. and Texas declines in gun homicides are part of a larger trend -- U.S. violent crimes overall began falling significantly in the 1990s. Crime experts have advanced reasons including a decrease in crack cocaine use, economic factors, tougher police strategies and the aging of the baby-boom generation. Patterson said he does not claim that concealed-handgun laws reduce crime -- rather, he said, he is stating such statutes don’t increase crime, ""in spite of the protestations to the contrary."" Our ruling Patterson said firearms homicides decreased 40 percent since Texas passed a law permitting licensed residents to carry concealed guns. That claim was staked to changes nationally and a timeframe unreasonably starting before the law took effect. Still, Patterson’s figure is close to correct. Data for Texas show declines of either 32 percent or 42 percent since the state law took effect. We are not concluding that the measure authored by Patterson explains the decrease, which occurred nationally for multiple reasons. We rate this statement, which needed clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Allen West: More black-on-black murders in six months than by 'KKK' in 86 years
","Some claims just catch the eye and Fox News contributor Allen West delivered one on his personal blog this week. ""Black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years,"" West, a former one-term congressman from Florida, wrote. We decided to see if the numbers back West up. West’s office directed us to an item from Kevin Jackson who blogs at Black Sphere. Jackson wrote about ""Dixiecrats who hated black people, and who were responsible for the 3,446 deaths by the Klan in 86 years."" For the moment, let’s assume that number is correct and compare it to the data on black homicide victims. Here we need to make an estimate so we’ll walk through our process. The Uniform Crime Reports gathered by the FBI show that 2,412 blacks died at the hand of another black person in 2012. That is the total for the year (not six months), but that number omits homicides where the race of the murderer is unknown. That is a huge data gap that somewhat complicates matters. The same FBI data, however, shows that most deaths occur within the same racial group. According to 2012 data, 91 percent of black deaths were caused by black criminals and 84 percent of white homicides were committed by whites. The total number of black homicides in 2012 was 6,454, according to the FBI. If the percentages hold, that would mean 5,874 homicides were committed by black criminals in all of 2012, or roughly 2,936 in a six-month span. Race of victim Total homicides Total-Race known White offender Black offender White 5,855 3,128 2,614 431 Black 6,454 2,648 193 2,412 Source: Uniform Crime Reports 2012 On its face, West’s claim is wrong but not by a huge amount, and in previous years, he would have been closer. The number of black homicides has fallen steadily over the past seven years. If we had run the numbers in 2006, he would have been about 100 deaths short of being correct. As it is, he is off by about 15 percent. But West’s claim has another error. The source West cites, Kevin Jackson, blames the Klan, but when Jackson emailed us with his source, an article on the conservative website Townhall.com, we found something a bit different. The article said ""According to a Tuskegee Institute study, between the years 1882 and 1968, 3,446 blacks were lynched at the hands of whites."" It did not name the Ku Klux Klan and talked only of lynching, not all homicides. The Tuskegee Institute -- now Tuskegee University -- started documenting lynching cases in the 1890s, according to Richard Sutch, an editor of the Historical Statistics of the United States. The work is generally considered accurate, as Sutch told NPR. ""Many historians approached that data very skeptically,"" Sutch said. So scholars ""went back and they literally read every newspaper in a chosen southern state, and said we're going to record every instance of lynchings that are reported in these newspapers, and then they marched state by state by state. ""And what they found was not that the Tuskegee figures were wrong, but that the Tuskegee figures were essentially correct, and this amazed some people because the Tuskegee figures were showing that there were as many as 120, 150 lynchings per year in the southern United States. That's a lynching every week, more than once a week. It's just a steady drumbeat of violent oppression."" We found copies of the Tuskegee work that confirms between 3,445 and 3,446 black documented lynchings (and another 1,300 lynchings of whites.) The archive, however, does not track KKK involvement. There is no question that blacks were at least twice as likely as whites to be the victims of lynchings, nor is there any doubt that the southern states accounted for most of these deaths. One study put the southern share at 90 percent. That doesn’t mean the Klan was behind them. On that point, the historical record is unclear. For starters, historian Michael Pfeifer at the City University of New York says the Klan had three phases. Pfeifer wrote a book on mob violence, Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1847-1947. ""We simply don’t have good statistics on how many African Americans the Ku Klux Klan murdered in the 1860s and 1870s when the 'first' Klan was active,"" Pfeifer told PunditFact. ""Evidence suggests, though, that the Reconstruction Klan murdered hundreds and perhaps several thousand blacks."" That would seem to push the Klan death toll even higher, but Pfeifer says there’s reason to question the Klan’s role in the decades that followed. ""The Klan was not active during most of the years of the ‘lynching frenzy’ of the late 19th and early 20th century South,"" Pfeifer said. ""White lynchers in the Jim Crow-era from the 1890s through the 1910s carried on many of the same white supremacist values as the Ku Klux Klan had in the 1860s and 1870s, but it is not accurate to say that the Klan was involved in lynching in the 1890s and early 1900s."" The Ku Klux Klan is a potent symbol of racism but the deadly violence against blacks, and, we should note, against more than 1,000 Jews, Catholics and other whites, came from a much wider group of Southern society in that period. Our ruling West said black people kill more blacks in six months than the KKK did in 86 years. Based on the evidence West provided, the claim essentially boils down to a comparison between the number of black-on-black homicides and the number of lynchings from 1882-1968. Using 2012 FBI data and information from the Tuskegee Institute -- neither of which is perfect -- West is somewhat off in his numbers. There were approximately 2,936 black-on-black homicides in six months of 2012 and 3,446 black lynchings from 1882-1896. But West also is wrong to ascribe the historical killing of blacks to the Ku Klux Klan, experts told us. There is no clear tally of Klan murders. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097075540>],/factchecks/2013/nov/27/allen-west/allen-west-more-black-black-murders-six-months-86-/
"['Gambling', 'Wisconsin', 'Julaine Appling']","
Wisconsin Family Action leader says more than 300,000 Wisconsinites have “some kind of addictive gambling problem.”
","Arguing against approval of a massive tribal casino in Kenosha, the leader of a conservative social issues group recently warned of a rise in both crime and the number of gambling addicts. ""When you put a new gambling establishment closer to people, you invite more people to engage in that, and it becomes addictive,"" Wisconsin Family Action president Julaine Appling said on Wisconsin Public Radio on Nov. 13, 2013. ""As a result of that, we have more problem gamblers and more pathological gamblers."" How big is the problem? ""By Wisconsin Council on Problem Gambling numbers,"" Appling continued, ""we are running over 300,000 people in this state with some kind of addictive gambling problem, whether it’s pathological or what we’d categorize as a problem gambler."" Wisconsin Family Action fights expanded gambling, gay marriage and abortion, while backing school choice and teaching of alternatives to evolution theory. If Appling is correct, that would mean 5 percent of state residents would fit into that category. Is she right? Definitions first: Pathological gambling, sometimes known as compulsive gambling, can involve a need to bet more money more frequently, restlessness or irritability when attempting to stop and ""chasing"" losses, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. ""Problem gambling"" is a broader category that includes pathological gambling but also less-serious cases that involve disruptions in any major area of life: psychological, physical, social or vocational. To back up her claim, Appling pointed us to the website of the Wisconsin affiliate of the National Council on Problem Gambling, as well as a think-tank study mentioning the council’s research. The Wisconsin Council on Problem Gambling, funded by state government and donations from Indian tribes and others, runs a 24-hour helpline and educates people about gambling’s impact. According to the council’s latest fact sheet, ""approximately 333,000 Wisconsin residents have a gambling problem."" Time to fold ‘em on this item? Nope. Time to hold ‘em. The number on the Council’s website doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Rose Gruber, executive director of the council, said the 333,000 figure was based on nationwide findings in the National Gambling Impact Study Commission Report requested by Congress and released in 1999. There is no Wisconsin-specific data in that study or any other we located. Gruber said the 1999 study showed that nationally, 5 percent to 7 percent of the  total population had either a pathological gambling issue or are ""problem"" gamblers, a category that is considered less serious. In Wisconsin, that range would yield a number in the 333,000 range that Gruber’s organization cites. But there are several big problems. First, Gruber’s estimate came from the total state population, while the Impact Study Commission report she cites actually focuses strictly on the adult population. That mismatch significantly raises the Wisconsin estimate she uses. Second, we couldn’t find the 5 percent to 7 percent range in the 1999 study, nor could she point us to it. Third, the study is almost 15 years old. The Wisconsin council’s national umbrella organization, the National Council on Problem Gambling, says more recent research shows that 1 percent of U.S. adults are estimated to meet criteria for pathological gambling in a given year. An additional 2 percent to 3 percent would be considered problem gamblers. The combination (3 to 4 percent) is a significantly lower than 5 percent to 7 percent range. The national group also uses the adult population -- not total population -- when talking about the prevalence of problem gambling, based on figures cited by the national group’s veteran executive director, Keith Whyte. Applying Whyte’s figures to Wisconsin’s adult population would mean that up to 173,000 adults are problem gamblers. Outside experts To help sort this out, we turned to two of the country’s leading experts on gambling addiction: Howard Shaffer, a Harvard professor of psychiatry and past editor of The Journal of Gambling Studies, and Ken Winters, a University of Minnesota psychiatry professor. They said it was scientifically problematic to estimate Wisconsin’s problem from a national figure, but not a major shortcoming because gambling is so widespread now. Shaffer said the 3 percent to 4 percent figure was on target for adult problem gamblers. The prevalence has come down since the 1999 study, he said. Winters said the range in recent studies has been 3 percent to 6 percent. The national range cited by the pair, applied to Wisconsin, would mean that 130,000 to 260,000 Wisconsin adults are problem gamblers. Appling’s statement was broad and would include adolescent gamblers, who studies have shown more easily fall into gambling addiction. That would boost the number of problem gamblers past the adult figures we’ve discussed. Our experts said, though, that it’s hard to quantify how much because of problems inherent in studying juvenile gambling. And casinos don’t allow gamblers under 21. There’s a shortcoming in Appling’s claim that makes that something of a moot point: her use of the term ""addictive."" That applies to the small subset of pathological gamblers, but not to the broader group of problem gamblers who have not been diagnosed with a gambling disorder, the experts said. The ""addictive"" group is limited to the pathological ""gambling disorder"" group, and it’s 1 percent or less of adults, the two researchers said. In Wisconsin, that would be 43,400 adults or fewer, a far cry from more than 300,000. The number would still be under 100,000 if you added in adolescents at the rates we saw in various studies, 6 percent. So Appling relied on a number that turns out to be way too high, and compounded the problem with her description. Our rating Appling said more than 300,000 Wisconsinites have ""some kind of addictive gambling problem, whether it’s pathological or what we’d categorize as a problem gambler."" She relied on a published figure from a legitimate organization, but even in the squishy world of problem gambling research, there is little if any hard evidence that backs up this estimate extrapolated from an outdated national study. The best evidence is it’s much lower, especially when describing ""addictive"" gambling problems. Perhaps fewer than 45,000 Wisconsin adults fit that description, plus an unknown number of adolescents. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BBE200>],/factchecks/2013/nov/27/julaine-appling/wisconsin-family-action-leader-says-more-300000-wi/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Lynn Westmoreland']","
Congressman seeks clean bill of health on 'Obamacare' coverage claims
","For a specific segment of Georgians, the recent rollout of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces has been fraught with confusion, headaches and more confusion. We told you so, say some critics of the act, which many call Obamacare. One of those critics, U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., offered some specific numbers to outline the problems, courtesy of his Twitter account. ""Only 536 Georgians are signed up for Obamacare while 400,000 in the state lost their health insurance,"" said a tweet posted from his account. The tweet ended with the hashtag: ""trainwreck."" Some of us wondered about the accuracy of the tweet, particularly how many Georgians have lost their health insurance. Regarding the first part of the tweet, the White House announced on Nov. 13 that about 106,000 Americans had selected a health care plan through the federal government’s marketplace accounts. The number was far below federal projections. In Georgia, 1,390 people had selected a marketplace plan, but only 536 actually completed enrollment, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Westmoreland’s tweet was sent the morning after the White House announced the enrollment numbers. President Barack Obama sold the health care act to Americans, in part, on the pledge that individuals who like their insurance could keep their plans. However, many Americans learned their plans did not meet the requirements of the health care law when the marketplaces premiered on October 1. Some told harrowing stories that their plans were being cancelled. Obama held a news conference on Nov. 14 in which he offered to let insurance companies sell existing plans for at least one more year, even if they do not meet the standards of the health care law. Problem solved? Not exactly. Some states said it was too late to make such an allowance and they would not let insurance companies extend their policies. Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens said the day after the president’s announcement that he lacks the authority to enforce the stop-gap measure. According to some news accounts, an estimated 11 million Americans buy their own health insurance. In Georgia, 404,669 people have health insurance through individual accounts, according to Hudgens’ office. Most of these Georgians are self-employed, work at companies that don’t provide insurance or are early retirees. Individual plans represent about 6 percent of the total insurance market in Georgia, the AJC has reported. The Associated Press recently reported that 400,000 Georgians had received health insurance policy cancellation notices. Westmoreland’s office cited that report as the basis for the congressman’s claim. Westmoreland’s spokeswoman, Leslie Shedd, said she wrote the tweet and sent it from the congressman’s Twitter account. So have all of these Georgians lost their health insurance? Not exactly, some say. Glenn Allen, a spokesman for Hudgens, said because the health insurance policies of those 400,000 or so Georgians does not comply with federal law, their policies could be cancelled, thus the notices to those folks in the mail. Some of those customers will still have healthcare coverage through their insurance company. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia sent letters to individual policyholders stating that their plans can no longer be offered through the health care law. The letters offer help with finding plans compliant with the law. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia has about 150,000 people who receive insurance through the individual plans, more than any healthcare provider in the state. The AJC and other news outlets -- including the Associated Press -- have reported that although a policy doesn't comply with the law doesn't mean consumers will get cancellation letters. One AP article noted that it is unclear how many individual plans are being canceled. Shedd said she probably should had mentioned ""cancellations"" in the tweet, as opposed to writing that 400,000 Georgians have lost their health insurance. The consequences of packaging a message into 140 characters, she said. Shedd made the argument that those customers still face the prospect of either changing their policies or losing their insurance. ""I think if you are talking to people who’ve received notices, they look at it as ‘I’ve lost my health insurance,’ "" she said. To sum up, Westmoreland’s tweet said ""only 536 Georgians are signed up for Obamacare while 400,000 in the state lost their health insurance."" The number of Georgians signed up was correct. The number of Georgians who have lost their insurance needs some clarity. About 400,000 Georgians have received notices warning their policies could be cancelled because they are not compliant with the federal law. Not all of them will go without insurance, officials explained. Westmoreland’s claim, like many concerning the health care law, is complicated. There’s some context that’s necessary to fully understand the situation some Georgians face as a result of the controversial law.

"['Federal Budget', 'Voting Record', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says he never supported the sequester
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., once compared watching our national debt to waiting for the killer to appear during a horror movie. ""You know those movies where the people in the audience are screaming, ‘Don’t go in that door!’ because you know the killer is there? Well, it is the same thing with this debt,"" Rubio said during a Jacksonville radio station interview in 2012. ""We know how this ends."" Scary stuff indeed. Rubio returned to talk about our killer debt during a speech at the conservative American Enterprise Institute Nov. 20. ""To lift the sequester we must find a real, lasting solution to the true cause of our growing national debt: the unsustainable path of important programs like Medicare and Social Security,"" he said. During the question and answer session, Rubio mentioned the sequester again: ""This notion that the sequester is just going to vanish and people are going to wake up, unfortunately, is unrealistic. I did not support the sequester. I do not believe that’s the right way to balance a budget. I just think it's better than tax increases, as bad as the sequester may be."" We decided to turn the clock back and review Rubio’s actions and words that related to the sequester. The path to the sequester Rubio, a former state legislator, propelled himself into the national spotlight running for U.S. Senate in 2010. During the campaign, he raised alarms about federal spending and ""mountains of debt for our children."" He continued that theme once elected to office. (We have fact-checked multiple claims by Rubio about the debt or sequester.) In March 2011, he made a flurry of national media appearances and penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal to announce he would vote against raising the debt limit ""unless it is the last one we ever authorize and is accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid."" Rubio gave props to a plan by Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., to lower and simplify tax rates, close loopholes, and make permanent low rates on capital gains and dividends. He also gave a shout out to House Republicans for their budget plan, which he said would lower discretionary spending by $862 billion over 10 years. In an interview with Florida reporters, Rubio said lawmakers should consider raising the retirement age for Social Security, but not for people currently near retirement. Rubio has also called for reducing ""non-defense, non-veterans"" spending to 2008 levels. But Rubio, a freshman Republican in the minority in the Senate, didn’t have much sway. In the summer of 2011, President Barack Obama and Congress entered a high-stakes stand-off over the debt limit. House Republicans insisted on spending cuts before increasing the debt limit. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner tried unsuccessfully to reach a ""grand bargain,"" a specific plan to put the federal budget on more stable footing. When that failed, they arrived at the less ambitious Budget Control Act of 2011. The House passed the bill 269-161. In the Senate, it passed 74-26 with Rubio voting ‘’no’’ on Aug. 2, 2011. The law included about $1.2 trillion in future budget cuts, but it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion via a bipartisan ""supercommittee."" As further incentive, the law had a threat: If a supercommittee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted down the supercommittee proposal, a sequester would automatically go into effect, putting in place nearly across-the-board budget cuts, with half coming from defense. Rubio released a statement about his vote against the measure: ""I cannot support this plan because it fails to actually solve our debt problem, fails to diminish the risk of a credit rating downgrade and is not a long-term solution to avert a debt crisis."" Rubio wrote that the plan failed to immediately downsize government and ignored ""the biggest driver of our debt, health care spending."" Rubio also wrote that he feared the vote would lead to consideration of big tax hikes. ""And if Congress rejects new taxes, then up to $850 billion of devastating automatic defense spending cuts would be triggered at a time when the world is as dangerous as it’s ever been,"" he wrote. Both Obama and Boehner supported the plan, and despite Rubio’s no vote, it passed Congress with bipartisan majorities. The supercommittee deadlocked, though, so it never proposed new cuts. That’s what led to the sequester. After it was clear the supercommittee couldn’t reach agreement, Rubio was among a group of Republican senators who tried to prevent defense from being subject to the sequester. ""Defense funding should be driven by our national security needs, not by arbitrary fiscal arithmetic,"" said the senators in a December 2011 statement. The sequester officially started in March 2013 and led to multiple claims about the impact on Head Start, airports and wacky spending. Lawmakers found plenty of fodder to criticize about the sequester and Rubio was no exception. In July 2013, Rubio wrote an op-ed criticizing the fact that the sequester grounded the Navy’s Blue Angels from an event in Pensacola. ""The Blues were grounded this weekend all because of a feckless decision made two years ago more than 900 miles away in Washington, D.C."" Rubio wrote. Rubio repeated that he opposed the sequester and wanted limited to spending in a floor speech in July. ""I do not dispute that it (the sequester) will have an impact. In fact, I voted against the deal that actually gave us the sequester, and I voted against it because, while I believe deeply we need to constrain spending because we are spending a lot more money than we are taking in, about $1 trillion a year more than we are taking in, borrowing about 40 cents of every dollar we spend in the federal government -- for the folks visiting here in the gallery, you may be shocked to hear that. Every dollar the federal government spends, 40 cents of it is borrowed. In September 2013, Florida federal courts officials held a video conference with aides to Rubio and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., to talk about the impact of the sequester on the courts. Brooke Sammon, Rubio's deputy press secretary, said then that Rubio ""has always said that the sequester was a bad idea, in part because it does not prioritize core public safety functions. The only way to solve our long-term deficit problems is to grow our economy, which will require entitlement reform and pro-growth tax reform, not tax hikes."" Our ruling Rubio said ""I did not support the sequester."" Rubio voted ""no"" on the Budget Control Act in 2011 that paved the path toward the sequester in March 2013. He said at the time that he voted ""no"" because the law ""fails to actually solve our debt problem, fails to diminish the risk of a credit rating downgrade and is not a long-term solution to avert a debt crisis.""

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Ron Johnson']","
Republicans have proposed many solutions to control health care costs and improve quality, Ron Johnson says
","As Republicans continue to score points bashing the early struggles of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, the common refrain from Democrats is to claim their GOP counterparts lack an alternative. It has fit neatly into their characterization of Republicans as the party of ""no."" For their part, Republicans have consistently said that’s not the case. ""Throughout the health care debate, Republicans have proposed dozens of solutions designed to help control costs and improve quality — without surrendering control of your personal health care decisions to nameless bureaucrats in Washington,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., during the Republican national address Nov. 17. The question of how Republicans would replace Obamacare has come up before, and it will remain a major part of the argument over the law’s future throughout the 2014 midterms. There’s a big difference between no solutions, as Democrats surmise, and dozens, as Johnson claims. So who is right? We decided to investigate. How we got here We asked Johnson’s office to provide evidence of the ""dozens of solutions"" Republicans have put forth. His staff sent us a list of 24 Republican proposals released over the years, starting with President George W. Bush’s call for health reforms in 2007. At this point, let’s pause for some important political and parliamentary realities. In 2009 and 2010 when the health care law worked its way through Congress and onto Obama's desk, Republicans were in the minority in both the Senate and House. During the initial debate, Republicans circulated many ideas and put forth many bills. None of them gained enough support within the GOP to become a clear conservative alternative to Obamacare, and even if they had, it was unlikely Democrats would go along. Republicans had even less interest in capitulating with Democrats and working with them on the Affordable Care Act. Not a single Republican voted for the final version Obama signed into law. We reviewed the list of legislation Johnson’s office sent us. With a handful of exceptions, the bills are partial or full retreads of each other and share similar ideas. Some actually include provisions of Obamacare, such as allowing young people to stay on their parents’ plans or making it harder for insurance companies to drop people with pre-existing conditions. Johnson’s camp said the Republican senator doesn’t necessarily support all the proposals, but they show that Republicans have been active players in the debate. We reviewed Johnson’s list of 24 proposals. We found the ideas in them tend to fall along the following six lines: Tax incentives A bevy of proposals provide tax breaks or credits to incentivize the uninsured to purchase coverage on the individual market and make it cheaper for those already with coverage. One put up by the Republican Study Committee with more than 100 cosponsors would give a $7,500 deduction to individuals and $20,000 to families. To pay for the deductions, that bill would also eliminate a long-standing tax break on employer-provided insurance. So while some new faces would get insurance on the individual market, the out-of-pocket expenses would likely go up for many Americans, especially those who get good coverage through work.  Another bill from Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., gives a tax credit of $5,000 to families at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, about $47,000. Both proposals aim to improve the affordability of insurance for low-income individuals, and while it could shift the cost curve down for some people, it would not dramatically transform the cost of care.  Allow insurance companies to sell policies across state lines Right now, insurance companies may not sell a policy in multiple states. Republicans want to open up the borders, saying it would increase competition and allow market forces to push down prices. Opponents caution that insurance companies will flock to states with the loosest regulations and sell policies from there. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted savings of about $12 billion from 2007-15, but most experts did not believe it would dramatically impact the cost of insurance or entice more people to sign up. The CBO predicts it would mean cheaper premiums for healthier individuals and more costly insurance for those who have health issues and are already paying a lot. That’s the opposite goal of health care reform. Tort reform Tort reform would change statutes regarding medical malpractice lawsuits, which Republicans say lead to frivolous claims and legal costs. It saves money, but it’s nothing to write home about. In 2010, the CBO said modest reforms, such as capping noneconomic damages at $250,000 and punitive damages at $500,000, would save $54 billion in federal spending over the next 10 years. Such a move would also reduce medical liability insurance and eliminate some threat of lawsuits that push doctors to prescribe unnecessary medical tests, decreasing overall health care costs by 0.5 percent. Health savings accounts Health savings accounts allow individuals to set aside money from each paycheck, before taxes, for future medical care. Republicans hope health savings accounts encourage individuals to be frugal and conscientious spenders on their health care, which would drive down the overall costs. But an expansion would cost the federal government $4.7 billion in lost revenue. Creation of high-risk pools Republican plans have called for about $25 billion to support states that create high-risk pools for sicker patients who have a hard time getting coverage on the individual markets. We’ve talked to experts in the past who have said that’s probably not enough to make it a viable option for the states or the consumers, since the insurance would have to be heavily subsidized to make it cost-effective. Allow trade associations and small business to purchase insurance as a group Since at least 2000, Republicans have pushed for something called Association Health Plans, which allow some small businesses to pool together and buy insurance as a group. However, this would impact a small portion of the population and just 600,000 of the 47 million uninsured people would gain coverage, according to the CBO. A larger pool would lower rates for small business employees already purchasing coverage and healthy individuals. But it would also mean higher premiums for most other insured individuals ""because a disproportionate share of enrollees with lower-than-expected health care costs would leave the regulated market to obtain insurance through an AHP, thereby increasing the average expected health care costs of those remaining in the regulated market,"" the CBO said. About quality While some of these proposals could shift the cost curve down, nothing we came across would directly impact quality of care, as Johnson claimed. We ran the list by a panel of experts as well, and many of them agreed. ""Johnson may be exaggerating a bit numerically, but the more important point is that the Republican plans would do next to nothing to improve quality, extend coverage, or control spending growth,"" said Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute. William Dow, a professor of health care economics and head of the University of California Berkeley Division of Health Policy and Management, largely agreed. ""There is little here that would improve quality,"" he said. ""Some could have minor effects on controlling costs."" Our ruling Johnson said, ""Republicans have proposed dozens of solutions designed to help control costs and improve quality"" of health care in the United States. Republicans have circulated quite a few bills and ideas over the years, but there is almost nothing in most of the GOP proposals that directly addresses quality of care. As far as costs, most of the proposals have winners and losers. Some of the bills would make health care more affordable for certain individuals, and tort reform and the expansion of health savings accounts could bend the cost curve down slightly. Elements of Johnson’s claim are at least partially accurate, but in the aggregate, the plans are far from substantial. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1C3180>],/factchecks/2013/nov/26/ron-johnson/johnson-said-republicans-have-proposed-dozens-solu/

Donna Brazile says GOP lacks plan to help working poor get health insurance
","Republicans have been pointing out the failures of the Obamacare rollout, telling voters, ""We told you so."" But the health care law’s problems aren’t a complete boon for the GOP. More and more, they’re getting questions about what their big ideas for health care are. Democratic pundit and sometimes political adviser Donna Brazile made that point during an installment of CNN’s Situation Room. ""They have a blank slate,"" Brazile said. ""They're not offering an alternative. They're not giving people who are desperately seeking health care an option to even enroll in something that they can afford."" We asked Brazile if she was referring to the approximately 47 million uninsured people in the country and she told us ""Yes. I was referring to those who would qualify for Medicaid, etc."" We wanted to know what the Republican ideas would do to make insurance affordable for people of modest means. So we looked at some of the bills they’ve introduced this session to fact-check Brazile’s statement. Ideas on the Republican menu Not all but most of the nine bills on our list use the tax code to put more money in citizens’ pockets on the condition that the money will be spent on health care. We found three basic approaches that potentially address insurance affordability. Overhauling health care tax deductions The most generous  proposal comes from the conservative Republican Study Committee, which put forward a bill with 100 cosponsors.  H.R. 3121 would give a $7,500 deduction to individuals and a $20,000 deduction to families. We saw two big catches here. You would need to have insurance in the first place. Plus, the bill would eliminate the biggest tax break households enjoy today, the portion of their premiums paid by their employer. Getting rid of that  $170 billion tax benefit would be a tough sell and a dramatic change to employer-provided insurance. Refundable tax credits These are like tax deductions, with the big difference that you can claim the credit even if you don’t have taxable income. H.R. 2300 from Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., offers a maximum tax credit of $5,000 for families making up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $47,000 a year. The bill covers the cost of the tax credits with a blend of savings from medical malpractice reform, reducing waste, fraud and abuse, and cuts in discretionary spending. Health Savings Accounts These are accounts that enjoy a trifecta of tax breaks. Money goes in tax-free, the returns on investment accumulates tax-free and some withdrawals are tax-free. Several bills loosen the rules on health savings accounts to allow more people to put more money into them. Other ideas Additional GOP ideas include medical malpractice reform, allowing small business to form their own insurance buying pools, letting insurers sell policies across state lines and subsidizing state high-risk pools for people who can’t insurance anyplace else. These changes would be significant but would have only an indirect impact on families seeking affordable insurance. Assessing the Republican options None of the Republican proposals have undergone an intensive independent analysis of how they would help the needy. Based on interviews with experts and our research, the two possibilities that would most directly provide affordable insurance are tax deductions and refundable tax credits. A tax deduction that would offset payroll taxes could touch many families of limited means. About 50 million taxpayers making less than $40,000 a year pay such taxes. But there’s a chicken-and-egg issue here. Until you have insurance, you can’t get the tax break and the bill doesn’t provide a way to help workers get over that hurdle. Plus, the bill relies on the elimination of the tax break on employer-sponsored health insurance. This would represent a radical shift in federal tax policy. In terms of feasibility, the majority of analysts we talked to give the edge to the refundable tax credit approach. That does not mean there is a resounding consensus on how much it would achieve. The proposal from Price would make credits payable in advance. In other words, you could use the federal credit even if you didn’t have the money up front to pay for insurance. While the details are different, this resembles the program put forward by President George W. Bush. A 2005 study of the Bush plan by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, found that ""lower-income individuals experience the largest declines in uninsurance rates"" under the Bush proposal. However, of the 45 million people uninsured then, Bush’s $3,000 tax credit plan would have helped only about 2 million people who made less than 200 percent of federal poverty and just a bit over 3 million overall. Thomas Buchmueller, a health economist at the University of Michigan, said it is a major undertaking to provide insurance to those who lack the money to pay for it. ""Tinkering with tax deductions and making health savings accounts more attractive is not going to change that basic fact,"" Buchmueller said. ""Roughly half of the Affordable Care Act coverage gains come from expanding Medicaid. I don't see anything in these proposals that would do much for the people who will gain Medicaid under the ACA."" Conservative analysts see more promise in the use of refundable tax credits. Nina Owcharenko with the Heritage Foundation, a group that has supported tax credits for many years, wrote in 2005 that this approach could go far to level the playing field, ""especially lower-income individuals who do not fit into today's patchwork health care system."" One of the widest gaps between Democrats and Republicans is the basic understanding of what it means to offer a plan to people of limited means. For Democrats, a plan is an identified insurance policy, whether public, as in expanded Medicaid, or private, as in buying subsidized private insurance through a web-based, highly regulated marketplace. For Republicans, a plan is anything that makes buying insurance more affordable, however the person finds the policy. Our ruling Brazile said Republicans offer no option for those who are desperate for coverage the chance to enroll in something they can afford. Within a more Democratic definition of a plan, that claim is accurate. However, using a broader definition, the Republican plan to use refundable tax credits would likely have some impact on Americans of very limited means. Opinions vary widely on how many Americans this would help, but a program of this sort would do something for a portion of the people Brazile had in mind. While the Republican option is full of uncertainty and results might be limited, they are more than nothing. Still, supporters of the GOP reforms were unable to point to independent studies to show how much their ideas for tax deductions and tax credits would accomplish, and previous independent analysis suggests they would have a modest impact on reducing uninsurance rates. We rate Brazile's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809695E980>],/factchecks/2013/nov/26/donna-brazile/brazile-says-gop-lacks-plan-help-working-poor-get-/
"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Kurt Schrader']","
Did Rep. Kurt Schrader flip flop on whether folks could keep their insurance under Obamacare?
","The latest controversy to wash over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act revolves around President Barack Obama’s much-repeated promise that folks who liked their insurance could keep it. As it turns out, hundreds of thousands of people -- more than 140,000 in Oregon alone -- are receiving cancellation notices from their insurers. Folks are being forced into new plans that better meet the requirements established by the law. Now, it’s no surprise that Republicans have seized on this -- but they’re not alone. Some Democrats, including Oregon’s Rep. Kurt Schrader,  have also taken to criticizing the president’s simplistic language on the subject. During a TV appearance in early November, Schrader called the president’s words ""grossly misleading."" The fuller comment: ""I think the president was grossly misleading to the American public. I knew right away as a veterinarian -- I had my own business -- that my policies got canceled even before the ACA. I know that I would change policies on a regular basis. … ""Not being honest that a lot of these policies were going to get canceled was grossly misleading."" When the interviewer pointed out that Schrader’s own website had a similar pledge, he asserted that he’d offered folks more context in person while selling the law’s other benefits. This, of course, opened him up to an attack from the National Republican Congressional Committee. An NRCC spokeswoman released a comment alleging that ""after being a loyal ObamaCare foot soldier for years, Kurt Schrader is blatantly misleading voters in the face of changing political winds and the law’s botched rollout. Maybe next time Schrader will read his own website before such an obvious attempt to deceive voters."" All of this left our heads spinning. We wondered if Schrader really had flip-flopped on the issue of whether the ACA allowed folks to keep their insurance. We called Schrader to see if he could explain why the content on his website was any different than what the president had been saying. His defense, essentially, came down to frequency. For the president, it was a common claim. Schrader, however, maintained that he emphasized other parts of the reform -- affordability and access, for example -- and was honest about the possibility of folks losing their current plan. As proof, he sent us the full transcript of what his website had said on the issue along with a summary of the law his office had issued after its passage. We’ll walk you through the most relevant parts. First, the Q&A on his website included this bit: ""I’m insured – what happens to me? If you are insured and are happy with your current coverage, nothing changes."" It explores that issue again in the next question: ""Will I be forced to give up my current coverage and use coverage that is forced on me? No, but if your insurer changes your plan, the new plan must conform with ACA requirements like Basic Benefits Coverage while prohibiting the following: denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions, limits on annual and lifetime coverage, co-pays for preventive care, etc."" Taken together, especially for somebody who doesn’t understand the law well, the answers hammer home the point that nobody will be forced to change their plan -- even if their insurance company might choose to do so. The NRCC also cited a summary of the health care law that Schrader released after the law passed. The summary said: ""If individuals like their current plan, they may keep that plan for as long as they would like under the final proposal. These grandfathered plans will have most of the same consumer protections added as in the newer qualified plans."" Again, that’s all accurate information. The only problem is that to have a grandfathered plan, you had to have been enrolled in it before the reforms became law back in March 2010. Now, that does give Schrader some cover. When his summary came out, many readers probably had insurance predating the law -- meaning their coverage would have been grandfathered. That’s different from when President Obama made the familiar pledge after, say, the Supreme Court upheld the law in June 2012. By then, folks might have changed plans -- when they changed jobs, for example -- without knowing that meant their health plan would no longer be grandfathered in. Schrader’s spokesman, Cody Tucker, argued in an email that the promise was essentially truer in the early days than it is now -- even though the law itself has not changed. ""The difference is that though that was your understanding from the beginning, because you are engaged, the truth is most Americans and Oregonians did not understand the caveat of ‘unless it changed.’ ""Therefore, to keep reiterating to the public that they can keep their health insurance plan is misleading, albeit accurate."" (Accurate in that some folks are still covered by the grandfather provision.) To be sure, a look around the Internet did not reveal any high-profile examples of Schrader making this promise several times -- though neither did it reveal examples of him explaining the complicated nuances around this promise. What matters is Schrader is clearly on the record suggesting people could keep their plans if they wanted to. The qualifiers mentioned in the documents on his website would be unlikely to disabuse a casual reader of this notion. To now call that statement -- when the president says it -- ""grossly misleading"" is clearly a partial change in position. We rate this a Half-Flip.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F07F00>],/factchecks/2013/nov/26/kurt-schrader/did-rep-kurt-schrader-flip-flop-whether-folks-coul/
"['Bipartisanship', 'Elections', 'Redistricting', 'Texas', 'Lloyd  Doggett']","
Republicans won more House seats than more popular Democrats, though not entirely because of how districts were drawn
","The Democratic member of Congress from Austin, otherwise represented in Washington, D.C. by Republicans, says Democrats nationally got more votes in 2012 yet Republicans ended up with their House majority. ""During the last election, Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans,"" Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a Nov. 4, 2013, talk at the University of Texas at San Antonio. ""But because of the way"" House ""districts are designed, the Republicans got 33 more members of the House of Representatives than the Democrats did."" The first part of his claim sounded familiar, but is it right that this outcome arose from the way House districts were designed? In every state, districts must be redrawn every 10 years to adjust for population changes as measured by the decennial U.S. census. Each state has its own method for drawing districts. And Texas, like most states, entrusts most of the line-drawing to state legislators. Over the past dozen years or so, Doggett pointed out in his talk, he has represented a variety of communities--at one time holding a district that stretched from the Texas-Mexico border north into Austin--largely due to how districts were drawn by the state’s dominant Republicans. Nationally, he said, the redistricting process ""has had a significant impact on more than me and indeed on the whole framing of the national debate that is going on right now."" His lecture later touched on the influence of money in politics. Doggett, who currently represents a district snaking south from Travis County into its base in San Antonio, told the university audience that Republican domination of redistricting in statehouses effectively helped the GOP maintain its House majority. To our inquiry, Doggett said by email: ""I spoke about a number of factors that explain the composition and conduct of the current Congress. Redistricting looms large among them as a very significant factor. Gerrymandering,"" district-drawing to partisan advantage, ""has only reinforced obstructionists."" Doggett’s spokeswoman, Kelsey Crow, sent an email pointing out an Oct. 14, 2013, NBC News report stating: ""When Republicans won the majority of statehouses in 2010, it ensured they would be redrawing the maps in those states. And lo and behold, it paid off in 2012. Nationwide, Democrats running for Congress got 1.1 million more votes, but Republicans sent 33 more members to the House."" It’s helpful to remember that the Republican margin of 33 seats means Democrats fell 17 victories short of capturing the House majority. Doggett’s raw numbers were accurate. Democrats outpolled Republicans in the 2012 House races, but Republicans ended up with a 33-seat House majority. A December 2012 analysis by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan D.C. publication, said House Democrats out-drew their Republican counterparts by more than 1 million votes--1.37 million votes to be precise, Cook’s House editor, David Wasserman, later calculated. Between the two parties, Democrats won 50.59 percent of the vote while winning 46 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201. The Republican advantage was a decrease from the party’s 49-seat majority in 2011-12; Democrats held House majorities from 2007 through 2010. But political scientists quibble over whether how districts were redrawn entirely explains the GOP majority. (This is a good time to take a gulp of water/beverage of your preference). Writing in December 2012, Wasserman pointed to two ""unprecedented"" factors that explained the GOP’s House grip: the thick concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas and the GOP’s wide control of drawing congressional districts. Other analyses similarly support redistricting as a reason, but some political scientists suggest other factors were more significant such as the advantages enjoyed by Republicans seeking re-election as incumbents. Even before the 2012 elections, Republican influence over redistricting looked likely to be significant. A George Mason University political scientist, Michael McDonald, who later worked as an expert in a Texas Democratic Party challenge to how Republicans drew districts in Texas, noted in a April 2011 article published by the American Political Science Association that thanks to election results in 2010 and earlier, Republicans would dominate redistricting in more states than Democrats. Among the 43 states with more than one congressional district, he wrote, six would rely on bipartisan commissions to draw new districts, 16 would have Republicans in control, six would have Democrats in charge and 15 would act as a divided government. But different sometimes complex methods of analyzing the 2012 results generate different conclusions about the effects of the line-drawing, though all point to Republicans benefiting most: --On Nov. 8, 2012, Dylan Matthews of the Washington Post’s Wonkblog compared how well Democratic President Barack Obama fared in 2012 in most of the states where Republicans controlled redistricting leading up to the election year compared with how Democrats running for House seats came out. In Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Pennsylvania, Matthews wrote, Democrats won clutches of seats as Obama prevailed statewide: ""In Virginia, for instance, 27 percent of seats went to Democrats, while Obama got 52 percent of the vote. In Pennsylvania, 28 percent of seats went to Democrats, and Obama won 53 percent."" There was balance in two states, Matthews wrote: ""Utah gave a quarter of its vote to Obama and a quarter of its House seats to Democrats and New Hampshire sent two Democrats to the House despite Obama's only having a six-point margin there."" --Just before the 2012 elections, an Oct. 25, 2012, preliminary study by the Brennan Center for Justice, part of the New York University School of Law, concluded that the way districts were drawn would give Republican hopefuls six seats more than they would have won if the election was carried out under the previous district lines. After the elections, a center analyst, Sundeep Iyer, wrote that the prediction mostly held up because five seats flipped from a Democrat to a Republican due to redistricting, he wrote, while six Republican-held seats were saved by redistricting. ""In states where Republicans controlled redistricting,"" Iyer said, ""Republican candidates for the House won roughly 53 percent of the vote and 72 percent of the seats."" Then again, Iyer wrote, ""even under the old district lines, that disparity would have persisted, as Republicans still would have likely won about 65 percent of the seats."" Still, Iyer said, where Democrats held redistricting sway, Democrats won three more seats than they would have under the old district lines, while Republicans lost five additional seats. --Another proponent of the ""redistricting matters"" school, Princeton University neuroscientist and election forecaster Sam Wang, described how partisans can make the line-drawing work to their partisan advantage in a Feb. 2, 2013, opinion column in the New York Times. ""Gerrymandering is not hard,"" Wang wrote. ""The core technique is to jam voters likely to favor your opponents into a few throwaway districts where the other side will win lopsided victories, a strategy known as ‘packing.’ Arrange other boundaries to win close victories, ‘cracking’ opposition groups into many districts."" By his own methodology, Wang estimated that redistricting cost Democrats 15 House seats in the 2012 elections. --Earlier, Washington University post-doctoral student Nicholas Goedert, said in a Nov. 15, 2012, post on the Monkey Cage blog, founded in 2007 to publicize research by political scientists, that redistricting most likely cost Democrats seven races nationally. Likewise, political scientists John Sides and Eric McGhee said redistricting cost Democrats seven seats, writing that they reached their figure by looking at what would have happened if the election took place in the pre-2012 House districts. ""This"" seven ""is not nothing, but it’s far less than what the Democrats needed to take back the House,"" the two wrote in a Feb. 17, 2013, commentary on the Wonkblog. Sides and McGhee concluded that once they considered the effect of incumbency on the 2012 results, the seeming pro-Republican impact of gerrymandering vanished. ""That is, the ability of Republicans to retain the House majority may have been due to incumbency advantage, not new and more favorable districts,"" they wrote. Conversely, they wrote, removing the percentage point gains attributable to incumbency generated results indicating that Democrats would have won 219 seats, ""virtually eliminating"" any GOP advantage traced to redistricting. By telephone, McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, said Republicans nationally pulled off ""spectacular gerrymanders"" before the 2012 elections. ""But there’s no clear evidence that there’s  been this systematic ability of Republicans to draw better districts going way back on a national scale,"" McGhee said. With help from Keesha Gaskins of the Brennan Center, we queried others who have weighed in on redistricting and the 2012 results, among them University of Chicago law professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, who said by email that he thinks Doggett got it right, but reaching that conclusion depends on whether one interprets his statement as speaking to redistricting over more than the past couple years. ""It's clear that the party preferred by a minority of voters won a majority of seats in 2012,"" Stephanapoulos said. ""Whether this is because of redistricting depends entirely on what your benchmark is. If your benchmark is proportional representation for each party, then it's clear that redistricting (together with single-member districts) is to blame. If your benchmark is the districts that were in place before the latest round of redistricting, then redistricting may only have won the Republicans 11 seats….But the districts in place before 2012 themselves were drawn by legislatures, and most observers thought the pre-2012 districts already favored Republicans in several states."" Next, we ran the range of these analyses past Austin lawyer Steve Bickerstaff, who has advised legislative leaders about redistricting issues since the 1970s. Bickerstaff said by phone that the Republicans’ majority isn’t due solely to how districts were designed. ""It’s more complicated,"" Bickerstaff said. Our ruling Doggett said Democrats won over a million votes more than Republicans in 2012 but because of the way districts are designed, Republicans got 33 more House seats. Democratic House nominees drew nearly 1.4 million more votes than Republicans and the GOP landed a 33-seat House majority.  Redistricting was a major factor in that result, but experts also diverge over whether how districts were designed was the key driver. Incumbency and the concentration of Democrats in congested cities also have been aired as significant. We rate Doggett’s statement, which lacks this clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
