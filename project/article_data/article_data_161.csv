Mansion move sparked by church growth?
","Atlanta Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory has promised to find a new place to live since getting an earful from some Catholics -- and unwelcome national attention -- about his new 6,186-square-foot, $2.2 million residence on Habersham Road in Buckhead. In a statement he issued March 31, the archbishop said he had no desire to move to the Tudor-style mansion in the first place. ""However, the Cathedral parish has a problem, albeit a happy one,"" he said. ""The Cathedral of Christ the King is one of our largest, most vibrant and fastest-growing parishes — but it is landlocked."" PolitiFact deemed the archbishop’s statement worthy of a fact check, given all the hoopla. A review of some numbers, as well as some number crunching, should settle the questions: Is it one of the largest of the 99 Catholic churches that are part of the Archdiocese of Atlanta? And is it one of the fastest-growing? We requested membership data for at least five years. But the bulk of what we received was from 2012 and 2013. And looking at that data and limited information that was provided from 1997, the answer to each question is yes. According to the Official Catholic Directory, the Cathedral of Christ the King was the second-largest church in the archdiocese in 1997, based on the number of families, or households. It had 3,505 at the time. Fast-forward to 2013, and the cathedral on Peachtree Road in Buckhead was the archdiocese’s third-largest parish, with 4,842 families. Only St. Michael’s in Gainesville and St. Thomas the Apostle in Smyrna were larger, with 7,054 and 6,844 families, respectively. The cathedral’s congregation grew 9.6 percent between summer 2012 and summer 2013, adding 426 families, according to the archdiocese’s data. By our calculations, that made it the archdiocese’s 15th-fastest-growing of all the churches that year and, among the bigger churches, the second-fastest-growing. St. Joseph’s in Dalton grew the most, 23.2 percent or 509 families, while more than 30 parishes in the archdiocese had virtually no growth or lost families in that same time, the data show. The cathedral was built in French Gothic architectural style and named ""the most beautiful building in Atlanta"" by Architectural Record in 1939, two years after its completion. Some would say it remains a contender today. Members of the parish come from more than 150 ZIP codes in metro Atlanta. Priests at the cathedral presided over more than 1,200 daily Masses, 624 weekend Masses, more than 500 Baptisms, 128 weddings and 49 funerals in 2013. Seven adult choirs and four children’s choirs chimed in at many of these events. The cathedral became part of the recent controversy after Joseph Mitchell, a parishioner at Christ the King and the nephew of ""Gone With the Wind"" author Margaret Mitchell, left $15 million and his home on tony Habersham Road to the archdiocese. Mitchell requested that the archdiocese use the inheritance for ""general religious and charitable purposes."" He also asked that Christ the King get primary consideration. The cathedral was given $7.5 million for its building program and spent $1.9 million of that to buy the archbishop’s longtime residence nearby on West Wesley Road. The goal was to convert the archbishop’s old home into a rectory, or residence, for the cathedral’s six priests. That would allow the rectory that’s on the cathedral’s campus to eventually be replaced with worship and meeting space. (The cathedral is effectively landlocked. It’s surrounded by streets on three sides, and it is restricted from developing on its east side for 20 years. That was part of a deal negotiated with the neighborhood that allowed the church to develop a youth recreation area.) Meanwhile, Mitchell’s home on Habersham Road was torn down. In its place and with part of the proceeds from the sale of the West Wesley residence, the archbishop’s new $2.2 million mansion was built, equipped with two dining rooms, an elevator and a second-floor safe, or panic room. Gregory, long-rumored to be a candidate on the short list to succeed soon-to-be-retiring Chicago Bishop Francis George, moved to the new residence on Habersham in January. He initially defended the move, which critics said went against Pope Francis’ call for modest living. He later apologized. ""I am disappointed that, while my advisers and I were able to justify this project fiscally, logistically and practically, I personally failed to project the cost in terms of my own integrity and pastoral credibility with the people of God of north and central Georgia,"" Gregory wrote. The archbishop promised to sell the house and move elsewhere. We’re told that’s still the plan today. In summary: We decided to fact-check the archbishop’s statement largely on two points: Is the Cathedral of Christ the King one of the archdiocese’s largest churches? And is it one of the diocese’s fastest-growing churches. The data we were provided say yes. But they allowed only a limited comparison, and the information could not be independently verified.

Sarah Palin: Eric Holder wants gun owners to wear ID bracelets
","""Waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists"" was not the only questionable thing Sarah Palin said during her recent speech to National Rifle Association enthusiasts. In stirring up concerns about gun rights, the former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee turned conservative rabble-rouser misrepresented comments from Attorney General Eric Holder about investments in smart-gun technology. ""Every day we are seeing more and more efforts to strip away our Second Amendment rights,"" Palin told the crowd. ""They are trying,"" she said, before leading into her claim about Holder. ""Recently, he reveals this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner,"" Palin said. ""Well, hey, Holder, you don't want to go there, buddy."" There is more to the story than Holder wanting gun owners to wear identifying bracelets. Holder’s comments on gun bracelets Holder uttered the words ""guns"" and ""bracelet"" before a House appropriations subcommittee on April 4, 2014, as he testified about his agency’s 2015 budget request. U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., asked Holder about requested grants to ""encourage development of innovative gun safety technology."" Holder explained the grant request stems from a White House-driven meeting amid talk of gun regulation reforms. ""We talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear, how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession of the weapon. ""It’s those kinds of things that I think we want to try to explore so that we can make sure that people have the ability to enjoy their Second Amendment rights, while at the same time decreasing the misuse of weapons that lead to the kinds of things that we see on a daily basis, you know, where people, kids especially, are struck down by ..."" Harris cut him off, saying ""sure, no one wants that to occur,"" and moved on. Holder’s comment about new gun technology was picked up a few days later in an April 7 Washington Free Beacon story under the headline, ""Holder: We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets."" From there, it was picked up by Fox News, InfoWars, Townhall.com and the National Rifle Association, among others. In each case, the coverage focused on the idea of ""gun tracking bracelets."" But the technology doesn’t track gun owners, and it doesn’t always require a bracelet. Smart guns and the Department of Justice Holder had smart guns on his mind because of President Barack Obama and reforms he sought after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. Obama directed Holder, via one of 23 executive orders, to release a report on gun safety technology ""and challenge the private sector to develop innovative technologies."" As he mentioned in his testimony, the department’s National Institute of Justice released a report in June 2013 assessing the marketplace, and Holder chaired a meeting with industry leaders and experts at the White House. Smart guns are also called ""owner-authorized guns,"" ""childproof guns"" and ""personalized guns."" Basically, these are firearms made with electronic chips and sensors that can discern an authorized user from an unauthorized user. The gun will fire if it recognizes the owner and won’t if the owner is not recognized. Some high-tech models include a fingerprint reader that works kind of like the one in new iPhones (or James Bond’s personalized gun in Skyfall). Other models include the capability to read a radio signal from a transmitter embedded into a bracelet, ring, watch or pin worn by the gun owner, or even a chip implanted in the hand. ""If that is within a certain programmed distance to the gun, the gun mechanically makes itself operable,"" said Stephen Teret, a smart-gun proponent, professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Law and the Public’s Health. ""If it’s not within a certain distance, the gun won't work."" So the short signals emitted in smart-gun technology do not function like GPS on mobile phones and other devices. The lack of GPS technology would prevent the government from identifying and tracking gun owners, should the government try, said Mike Bazinet, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm and ammunition trade group. Bazinet noted that doesn't mean the group isn't concerned about that prospect. The technology could require a bracelet. It could also require a watch, a ring, a pin, or even just a fingerprint, experts say. The point is there is no plan to identify gun owners with a ""scarlet letter"" bracelet. Origins and controversies Teret says the earliest smart gun was developed by Smith & Wesson in the 1880s. The manufacturer added a metal lever to the back of its handguns, requiring a person to press the the lever and the trigger at the same time to fire the weapon. A child’s hand would be too small to do that, thus preventing accidental injuries and deaths. Manufacturers started thinking about incorporating electronics into guns in the early 1990s to make them safer. The concept had support from the Bill Clinton administration, lost steam during the George W. Bush years, and then re-emerged after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings under Obama, Teret said. International companies, such as Armatix in Germany and TriggerSmart in Ireland, are ahead of the curve, thanks in part to less political resistance, Teret said. But there is technology emerging in the United States. Utah-based Kodiak Industries is offering the Intelligun, a fingerprint-locking system installed onto a 1911-style, .45 caliber pistol, for $399. This year, a California gun retailer told the Washington Post he planned to sell the Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol, an $1,800 product that works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun when worn by the right user. It was supposed to be the first smart gun sold in the United States, but the owner and Armatix representative received backlash from gun rights activists, and the plans were scrapped. Here’s what the iP1 looks like:  It’s not the development of smart guns that concerns the firearms industry, Bazinet said. It’s government’s embrace of them. A New Jersey law, the only one of its kind, requires after three years from the first smart gun being sold in the United States that all new guns sold in the state be built with this technology. To Bazinet, smart guns won’t be ready for mass use until police forces are using them. His group has warned about defective guns and dead batteries while saying consumers should be able to buy them if they want. Of course, none of this information changes the veracity of Palin’s comments about ID bracelets for gun owners. It just shows how wrong she was. Emails to Palin’s political action committee were not returned. Our ruling According to Palin, Holder recently revealed ""this idea to have government have gun owners wear bracelets, special bracelets, that would identify you as a gun owner."" That’s far from the truth. Holder said he wants the federal government to explore gun safety measures, including smart-gun technology that would prevent weapons from being fired by anyone except their rightful owner. The comment in question came as he explained why his agency is seeking federal money for grants to spur research into safer guns. He listed fingerprint identification and the gun talking ""to a bracelet or something that you might wear"" as tools that could prevent a gun owner’s firearm from being used by someone else. Some smart guns are powered by bracelets with embedded radio signal transmitters, but that’s just one way this could work. The purpose of accessories worn in order to fire a smart gun is not to help the government track owners or identify them (again, Holder is pursuing no such policy). The goal of the emerging technology is to minimize shootings caused by suicides, children or stolen guns. We rate Palin’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809704B400>],/factchecks/2014/may/01/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-eric-holder-wants-gun-owners-wear-id-b/
"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'Americans for Prosperity']","
AFP says health care premiums up 90 percent in New Hampshire
","A new ad by the free-market group Americans For Prosperity takes a swipe at Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for her support of President Barack Obama’s health care law. The ad, released in April, proclaims, ""Health care premiums up 90 percent in New Hampshire.""   New Hampshire residents may have heard this claim before. Earlier this month, the New Hampshire GOP said in a press release that ""health care premiums are ‘skyrocketing’ and have increased 90 percent in New Hampshire because of ObamaCare."" The release went on to say that ""ObamaCare is an unmitigated disaster that is raising the cost of health care for the middle class."" Nearly identical claims were tweeted by GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn and by former Sen. Scott Brown, who is running against Shaheen. A 90 percent increase seemed like a lot, so we decided to check the numbers. The claim stems from a blog post at Forbes.com, which was based on a study by the investment firm Morgan Stanley. The Morgan Stanley study takes a look at ""individual and small-group rate increases."" Respectively, those categories of health insurance refer to plans purchased by individuals on their own, and by smaller companies. A third category of private insurance -- large-group plans -- were not included in the study, even though those typically represent the most commonly held form of insurance. So, the first thing to note is that while the study only looked at a subset of all health care premiums, the ad’s claim doesn’t make that distinction. Another issue: Individual plans, and to a lesser extent small-group plans, have long been expected to produce larger premium increases than large-group plans. This is because existing individual- and small-group policies were less likely to include all of the requirements enacted under Obama’s law, such as free preventive care. To make up for those shortfalls in benefits, these plans were expected to raise premiums. In fact, while the Morgan Stanley study pegged individual plan increases at 90 percent in New Hampshire, it said that small group plans increased by 15 percent. In other words, the ad cherry-picked the bigger increase statistic and ignored the other. Then there’s the methodology of the study itself. Morgan Stanley surveyed 148 insurance brokers nationally, with only one being from New Hampshire, as reported by Factcheck.org. That’s too small a sample to produce a reliable statistic, experts say. Using just one respondent is like ""calling one person up on the phone and asking their opinion,"" Robert Santos, chief methodologist at the Urban Institute told FactCheck.org. The survey also reported a 100 percent increase in Delaware’s health care premiums, where only one broker was surveyed. In fact, the statistic caught the eye of officials at the New Hampshire Department of Insurance, who asked to see the Morgan Stanley survey. They were told ""it was proprietary and confidential,"" according to department spokeswoman Danielle Barrick. ""We don’t understand how Morgan Stanley is able to generalize what’s going on in the New Hampshire market based on talking to 158 brokers nationally,"" Barrick said. We reached out to Americans for Prosperity New Hampshire, who stood by the claim. ""Forbes has not updated, corrected or retracted its original story,"" AFP-NH state director Greg Moore said. "" Accordingly, one must assume that the news outlet is standing by its work."" Unfortunately, hard data on any premium increases since people were allowed to sign up for the Affordable Care Act does not exist, the insurance department said. However, the Morgan Stanley study, if it were reliable, would suggest premium increases far beyond projections in an earlier study by the state insurance department. That study said the Affordable Care Act would increase premiums on the individual market by about 30 percent. And costs would actually fall, not rise, once federal subsidies are taken into consideration. Income-based subsidies are available to consumers who purchased health care through the marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act. After subsidies, the study projected, individual premiums would decrease by 9 percent. Premiums, however, were projected to go up by a ""significant"" amount for people without subsidies. By the end of February, 22,000 Granite Staters had purchased a plan through the marketplace. The department said that 83 percent of consumers with marketplace plans have been eligible for financial assistance. As for ""small group"" plans, their increases were expected to range between 1 percent and 3 percent. Finally, we asked the Department of Insurance whether they thought it was possible for an individual in New Hampshire to experience a 90 percent rise in their own premiums. Barrick said it’s hard to know for sure, since premiums vary based on age, tobacco use and the number of people covered under a certain policy. The department said it’s possible for a resident -- especially someone older, who smokes and earns too much to get a federal subsidy -- to move from an employer-sponsored policy with a low employee-contribution rate to a policy in the individual market and find themselves ""paying much more."" ""However,"" Barrick added, ""the fact that the person is paying more does not mean premiums went up in the aggregate"" for all New Hampshire residents, as the ad says. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said that health care premiums are ""up 90 percent in New Hampshire."" The claim cited a Morgan Stanley report that based its New Hampshire numbers on data from just one insurance broker in the state. Experts say that’s far too small a sample to say anything definitive about what’s happening to premiums in the state. It’s possible for some individuals, given the wrong combination of income and health factors, could see premium increases of 90 percent. But that’s a far cry from saying that such increases are typical in the state. This statement is not accurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097725B40>],/factchecks/2014/may/01/americans-prosperity/afp-says-health-care-premiums-90-percent-new-hamps/

'In states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher,' Sen. Kelli Stargel says
","State Sen. Kelli Stargel thinks Florida’s beer regulations are too lax, and that means trouble’s brewing. Florida craft beer makers are hopping mad about SB 1714, a bill that would require craft brewers at a certain sales level to use distributors to sell their wares, changing the current rules where they can sell directly to consumers. Lakeland Republican Stargel attempted to quench the mounting criticism by writing an editorial April 28 in the Tallahassee Democrat, lamenting that ""a small but vocal faction of the beer industry that has clouded this issue by promulgating misinformation."" Measures like her bill are necessary, she argued, because unfettered beer production is a looming evil. ""In states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher,"" she wrote. ""Higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand. As a social conservative, this is why I believe we need to keep regulations on alcoholic beverages in place and not have unregulated beer widely available in the marketplace. Social issues greatly impact economic issues, and we must seek a balance on both."" We’ll deal with whether higher beer production increases consumption in another factcheck, but first we wanted to see if a lack of state regulations leads to higher beer production. We’re going to tap the industry experts on this one. The three tiers The version of SB 1714 that passed Tuesday requires microbreweries selling more than 2,000 kegs that exceed 20 percent of their sales in take-home consumption to sell their product to distributors. (An amendment added on April 28 allows larger craft brewers to self-distribute up to 20 percent of their product through bottles and cans.) Brewers would then have to buy it back at the distributors’ marked-up prices. Stargel argues that this practice is simply following the rules of the three-tier system that brewers have used since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. This system, which is regulated to varying degrees by the states, breaks up the alcohol-making business (beer, wine and liquor) into three categories:   The supplier: The brewer who makes the beer; The wholesaler: The distributor who sells the beer to a bar, restaurant or other business; The retailer: The business that buys the beer from the wholesaler. Craft brewers in Florida complain the system will force them to cut jobs to account for the added cost. Some have even implied they may have to close up forever. Joey Redner, founder of Tampa’s Cigar City Brewing, has said he may move his 100,000 keg per year business out of state if the measure becomes law. Critics also complain the bill is the result of ""crony capitalism,"" with many legislators who support the bill getting campaign contributions from distributors. The Tampa Bay Times reported Stargel collected at least $6,000 from beer distributors since late 2013 for her 2016 Senate re-election race -- about 12 percent of her total. They gave her $500 in 2012, when she wasn’t sponsoring a bill regulating alcohol distribution. Regulation vs. production Stargel’s office said her comments came from Redner’s take on the bill. Redner wrote that an analysis by the Brewers Association, a trade group comprised of mostly small brewers and associated workers, including wholesalers, ""shows a very strong link between less regulation of access to market for breweries and the total number of breweries and barrels of beer produced by those breweries."" Bart Watson, the staff economist with the group that wrote the analysis, says there’s no such thing as a state where beer is unregulated. He suggested Stargel may have meant states where regulations are more favorable for large or small brewers. Even then, beer is highly regulated. Watson said it appeared states with favorable regulation of small breweries did lead to more production from those breweries. But the opposite could be true, as well -- higher brewery production could just as easily drive favorable regulation, he said. Either way, craft brewing (especially in Florida) doesn’t have a big enough impact to really affect total production. Another way to consider the issue is whether states with high levels of production from large brewery plants are hampered by strict regulations. He singled out Georgia and Florida as examples of highly regulated states, but still being among the top beer producers thanks to large brewing operations. Florida was third in total beer shipments in 2012; Georgia was 10th. ""General business environment and location relative to the U.S. population are probably better indicators of overall production levels in a state than regulations on small breweries,"" Watson said. State laws allow all manner of exceptions to the three-tier system; ,ost states let small breweries self-distribute in some capacity. The Beer Industry of Florida, a trade association ""dedicated to promoting the responsible consumption of alcohol and the preservation of the three-tier system of alcohol distribution and regulation,"" did not offer any comment on Stargel’s view. The group did send out a press release on April 25 saying they didn’t support the proposed legislation because it hadn’t allowed for 64-ounce growlers (essentially large bottles favored by consumers), a provision Stargel added three days later. The bill is currently awaiting discussion in the House. Our ruling Stargell said in her editorial that ""in states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher."" Her office credited Redner, an opponent of the bill, as the source of the line. Redner was referring to an analysis by an economist for a brewers trade group who said favorable regulation led to higher production from craft breweries. The statement is inaccurate in that beer is regulated in every state, although to varying degrees. It also doesn’t specify craft brewing. In fact, the analysis found there didn’t seem to be much of a link between state regulation and total production from both large and small breweries. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1DD2C0>],/factchecks/2014/may/01/kelli-stargel/states-where-beer-unregulated-capita-production-si/

Sen. Kelli Stargel claims 'higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand'
","Though state Sen. Kelli Stargel has watered down her bill regulating craft breweries to allow 64-ounce growlers, she’s made it very clear she still thinks the content is strong. Stargel, R-Lakeland, on April 28 wrote an editorial in the Tallahassee Democrat defending her position on SB 1714, which would allow sales of 64-ounce growlers but require microbreweries to sell through distributors if its sales are high enough. She introduced an amendment to allow breweries to sell up to 20 percent of their product in house. Her editorial pointed out the apparent dangers of allowing brewers to sell their product. ""In states where beer is unregulated, the per capita production is significantly higher,"" she wrote. ""Higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand. As a social conservative, this is why I believe we need to keep regulations on alcoholic beverages in place and not have unregulated beer widely available in the marketplace. Social issues greatly impact economic issues, and we must seek a balance on both."" We looked at the regulation claim in a separate item, but we also were curious whether higher beer production led to higher consumption. Time for PolitiFact Florida to buy another round. Small batches, big problems? Microbreweries and craft brewing have been growing in popularity in Florida, but still account for about 8 percent of total beer production in the entire country. Read more about the trend here. The biggest criticism of SB 1714 is that it punishes craft breweries by making them adhere to the same rules of distribution large breweries have, specifically limiting how much they can sell directly to consumers. (We discuss the three-tier system of suppliers/wholesalers/retailers in the other check.) The bill passed the Senate, 30-10, on April 28 and was sent to the House, where it was expected to be voted down. Microbrewers argue that the bill will force them to pay costs they can’t afford because they don’t sell enough product. Meanwhile, they counter, large brewing operations sell enough volume to deal with the expense. But the question here is whether making more beer makes people drink more. We first turned to the Brewers Association, a trade group comprised mostly of small brewers and associated workers, including wholesalers, to see whether Stargel’s claim held water. Their economist Bart Watson pointed out 2012 data from the Beer Institute that showed the opposite. The Beer Institute is a D.C.-based lobbying group representing brewers, wholesalers and retailers. California, the highest-producing state by beer shipments, ranked a lowly 44th in per capita consumption (as measured in gallons per resident older than 21). In an ironic flipping of the numbers, North Dakota ranked 44th in total shipments, but was the highest per capita beer consumer. Florida ranked third in total shipments, but ranked only 34th in per capita consumption.   Watson said the evidence supporting a link between production and consumption is weak at best, since the correlations the Beer Institute data makes for both craft beer and large-scale brewers are statistically small. But for Stargel to use it as the basis of her argument is suspect, because overall alcohol consumption should be the focus of her line of thinking, not just beer. ""As the alcoholic beverage of moderation, increased beer consumption at the expense of higher ABV (alcohol by volume) choices, such as spirits, might be a beneficial if the goal were limiting excessive consumption, as the article suggests,"" Watson said. PolitiFact Florida asked Stargel’s office to back up her information. Spokesperson Rachel Barnes told us, ""Keeping in mind the focus of the bill, Sen. Stargel was using the rule of supply and demand regarding deregulated beer. We know that higher beer production means lower beer prices. Lower beer prices mean higher beer consumption."" The Beer Industry of Florida, a distributor lobbying group, cited a 1988 piece in the Journal of Public Health Policy called ""Public Action and Awareness to Reduce Alcohol-Related Problems: A Plan of Action"" by James Mosher and David Jernigan. The paper proposed alcoholism treatment plans based on a ""new theoretical approach … supported by recent research, which has demonstrated a connection between alcohol availability (e.g. price, minimum drinking age, etc.), per capita consumption, and in turn, alcohol-related problems."" That definition of availability doesn’t seem like the same thing as production, though. We searched and searched for more thorough evidence and came up empty. Our ruling Stargel said ""higher beer production and higher consumption go hand-in-hand."" An economist with a trade group pointed to stats that said it may actually be the opposite. In terms of craft brewing, there may be a very weak link that is statistically insignificant. In terms of total production, the numbers suggest that the more beer a state produces, the less it drinks in terms of gallons per person over drinking age. We rate her statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C39E40>],/factchecks/2014/may/01/kelli-stargel/sen-kelli-stargel-claims-higher-beer-production-an/

Fox's Dana Perino blames environmentalists for mega-wildfires
","America gets a lot of wildfires. Some of them hit grassy rangelands, some hit forests, most are small but some are huge. The 2011 Wallow forest fire in Arizona destroyed over half a million acres. Since 2000, the country has averaged nearly 75,000 fires a year with over 80 million acres lost. There are many causes but Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, focused on just one. Last week on Fox News’ The Five, the conversation turned to climate change and in the middle of making the case that economic growth had to be part of any solution, Perino made a passing reference to fires. ""A lot of the problems with forest fires, the major raging ones that happen in the West,"" Perino said, ""Is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists and not clear out the forests."" We tried to reach Perino to ask her what she meant by ""a lot"" and what policies she had in mind. We did not hear from her. In this fact-check, we dig into the rich debate over the role of environmentalists and wildfires. In particular, we aim to see if fire damage would have been substantially less if environmental  policies were different. This question is as vast as the nearly 200 million acres managed by U.S. Forest Service, but we found that extensive drought and vast amounts of combustible material played a key role. And what about governments failing to proactively clear out forests? The consensus suggests a mix of factors that include fire policies dating back to the early 1900s and limited budgets to reduce fire hazards. What’s less clear is the role of environmental activists and environmental policies. It is true that environmental regulations and legal challenges by environmental activists frequently delay the work of the Forest Service.  It is difficult to say if these delays played a major role in the large fires the country has experienced. Let’s take a look at the big picture, starting with the role of environmentalists. The environmental factor To John Barnwell, director of policy for the Society of American Foresters, a professional education group, the lack of money to prevent fires is primary. But environmentalists and their actions play a role. Barnwell chafes at the long environmental review process and frequent litigation over Environmental Impact Statements that beset the Forest Service. A 2010 analysis from Western Michigan University found that no other agency tops the Forest Service for the number of suits under the National Environmental Policy Act. It averaged about 100 legal challenges each year. In some well-known cases (think of the Spotted Owl in the Pacific Northwest), logging ground to a halt entirely due to environmental protection rules under the Endangered Species Act. Timber harvests on federal land are a fraction of what they were in late 1970s. Ann Camp, a forestry scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says national environmental groups seem to be intractable to compromise. ""I can tell you from experience that local environmentalists and local chapters of national environmental organizations have been on board for some activities,"" Camp said. ""But the national chapters nixed their involvement and had already decided to contest the outcome -- whatever it was if it included any level of harvesting."" We found the case of a New Mexico fire where a Forest Service thinning project that might have reduced the damage was delayed by appeals from two environmental groups.  On the other hand, we also found examples where environmental groups worked hand in hand with loggers and state and national officials to move many projects forward. And Camp noted that some large fires took place in remote areas where no logging of any sort had ever been planned. Plus, fires have struck in forests where extensive harvests took place. There is no question that environmental rules and lawsuits delay and sometimes block activities on federal lands, but it is difficult to prove that absent those moves that the western states would have avoided their mega fires. And there are several other factors that play a more prominent role, experts say. The paradox of too little fire When Congress wants an impartial analysis, it turns to its in-house think tank, the Congressional Research Service. In 2012, the CRS looked at the causes of wildfire damage. That report said the roots of recent mega fires are ""excess biomass in the forests, due to past logging and grazing and a century of fire suppression, combined with an expanding wildland-urban interface — more people and houses in and near the forests — and climate change, exacerbating drought and insect and disease problems.""  A huge part of the reason we see huge fires today, the CRS report and experts say, is that we were too quick to put out fires. Around 1910 a series of massive fires wiped out entire towns. In two days, Washington, Montana, and Idaho lost 3 million acres of woodland. The fires led to a cry for the federal government to beef up its efforts to put fires out as quickly as possible. ""Our forestry tradition comes from central Europe, which has always had a paradigm that fire was bad for forests,"" Camp said. Historically, periodic fires cleared out the undergrowth while allowing mature, healthy trees to survive. But with the focus on keeping fires small (the mantra was to put out every fire by 10 a.m. the day after it was reported), the amount of combustible material grew. The growth of grazing livestock also reduced naturally occurring fires by creating gaps in the terrain that stopped a fire from spreading. The result: In the 1800s, a natural stand of Ponderosa Pine, a common species in the West, might have a few dozen trees per acre. Today, hundreds of smaller trees might be squeezed into the same area. When fire hits, it burns hotter and moves faster. Instead of running along the ground, it jumps into the crown of the trees where the winds drive it even more. Many millions of acres of forest face this risk. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Forest Service policy began to shift in earnest toward viewing fire as a potential ally in managing the forests. But today, the Forest Service describes this legacy as the equivalent of a toxic dump. A hazard that built up over decades remains in place and is potentially lethal. Too little water The new millennium opened with an extended drought that left much of the western United States primed for fire. Peter Brown, a researcher at Colorado State University, has studied the fingerprints of fires over the centuries in the growth rings of trees. ""Fire is driven by climate,"" Brown said. ""The first thing you need, besides something like a lightning strike for ignition, is dry conditions."" The years from 2000 to 2004 were spectacularly dry. Colorado State researchers said the drought was the strongest in 800 years. It killed trees, made the ones that lived more vulnerable to insects and turned the ground cover into tinder. The 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona came after a winter with little precipitation. The combination of dry ground, dry wood and grasses and strong winds produced a fire that in five weeks burned as many acres as had burned in the previous 25 years. Too little money, too much land The federal government has tried to come to terms with the legacy of a management policy that left too much fuel in the forests. Just as the nation was entering one its worst periods of fire, the Forest Service laid out an ambitious plan to clear away that excess scrub, brush and small trees. Called the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, it aimed to use controlled burns and physical removal to treat 6.9 million acres per year. An assessment by Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute highlighted the gap between that goal and the reality. In 2011, the agency planned to reduce the risk of fire in an additional 960,000 acres. ""Th­e number of acres treated in Fiscal Year 2011 is not even close to number of acres proposed per year in the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, or that are needed to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire at the landscape scale,"" the assessment said. At the heart of this problem is money. Barnwell said the Forest Service has been so busy fighting fires, it has needed to use the money that had been budgeted to prevent them. ""Over the past 10 years, they borrowed $3.4 billion from other activities to pay for fire suppression,"" Barnwell said. ""Congress will put some of that back, but they’ve missed a season to do really important work. They can never get ahead."" We found wide agreement that these fire prevention projects need to take place on a very large scale if they are to tamp down on the mega fires. The Congressional Research Service advised that the odds make it unlikely that the land you clear will be the one where a fire will take hold -- there are just too many acres to cover. By the CRS’ count, the odds that any given acre will catch fire are no more than 1 out of 100. Thus, you have to treat a lot of acres and that has not happened. Lastly, Perino broadly faulted policies ""put in place by environmentalists."" But both the National Environmental Policy Act (1969) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) passed either unanimously or with overwhelming bipartisan support. President Ronald Reagan signed significant revisions into law. Perino’s characterization seems like an oversimplification. Our ruling Perino said, ""A lot of the problems with forest fires is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists."" The crux of this fact-check really comes down to how you define ""a lot."" While the record shows that the need for environmental impact statements and legal challenges have a significant impact on Forest Service projects on federal lands, the connection to the extreme fires of the past 15 years is less certain. Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame. Perino’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False. Update: The Forest Service drew funds from other programs over a 10-year period to pay for fire suppression. A previous version of this fact-check was unclear on this point..",[<zip object at 0x0000028097087700>],/factchecks/2014/may/01/dana-perino/perino-faults-enviros-mega-fires/

Senate Majority PAC says Scott Brown got $400K in 'big oil' contributions
","The Senate Majority PAC is going all out fighting attacks on Democratic candidates by libertarian businessmen Charles and David Koch. The group’s latest target is former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who is now trying to unseat Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. ""Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage,"" the narrator says in an April 27 TV ad. ""In Massachusetts, he voted to give oil companies big tax breaks. They make record profits. He collects over $400,000 in campaign contributions."" We already fact-checked Brown’s ""big oil"" votes. Here we’ll take a closer look at the breakdown of contributions to his campaign. The Senate Majority PAC pointed us to OpenSecrets.org, a website run by the independent Center for Responsive Politics that tracks money in politics. The site tracks donations of at least $200 to show how money impacts congressional elections. OpenSecrets logs $455,760 in campaign contributions from oil and gas industry donors for Brown over the course of his career, according to the most recent data available. That’s the 15th most popular area Brown receives donations from. The biggest sectors Brown receives money from are retired individuals, securities and investment, lawyers and law firms, and real estate, each of which account for at least $1 million. OpenSecrets defines oil and gas companies as ""multinational and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline service stations and fuel oil dealers."" That categorization includes what some people would consider ""big oil"": the political action committees and top executives of companies like Exxon and BP. But it also includes smaller, independent companies, and low-level individuals who happen to work for an oil company. In fact, by the center’s definition, global ""big oil"" companies only accounted for $52,550 of the $455,760 total. That’s just 11.5 percent. In addition, the ad makes it sound like the companies themselves are donating. Overall, $168,000 came from PACs -- which pool the money of employees and donate it in the employer’s name -- but the rest comes from individuals associated with oil and gas companies. The reasons for an individual’s donation may have everything or nothing to do with the industry’s policy agenda. Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC ad said that ""Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage"" because he ""collected over $400,000 in campaign contributions."" Independently collected data shows that Brown received at least $455,760 in donations from donors associated with the oil and gas industry. However, the ad’s wording is somewhat misleading, since just 11.5 percent of that total came from PACs and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what viewers would reasonably consider ""big oil.""

Were the founding fathers active cockfighters?
","Were the founding fathers cockfighters? It’s not a question we expected to ask this campaign season. But we’re going to ask it because a Kentucky Senate candidate recently claimed that ""many"" of the men who founded our nation also took an interest in the blood sport. Tea party-backed candidate Matt Bevin, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in a primary, drew criticism earlier this month after speaking at a cockfighters’ rally in Corbin, Ky. Cockfighting is illegal in Kentucky -- as it is in every state, 40 of which make it a felony -- but aficionados want to reverse such laws on a state-by-state basis. Bevin defended his presence at the rally on Louisville radio host Terry Meiners’ show in part by saying many of the founding fathers were participants. ""But it's interesting, when you look at cockfighting and dogfighting as well, this isn't something new, it wasn't invented in Kentucky for example,"" Bevin said. ""I mean, the founding fathers were all -- many of them -- very actively involved in this and always had been."" We’ve checked some claims about historic politicians in the past, so we’ll try again with a look at cockfighting more than two centuries ago. Past claims Bevin’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this story, so we don’t know what he’s basing that claim on. However, these claims typically have concerned a handful of prominent founders, notably George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. Some other sources also mention Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Jackson, but Bevin’s claim specifically mentioned ""founding fathers,"" so we didn't address them.  Our research initially led us to the Humane Society of the United States, which has spearheaded a long fight to make cockfighting illegal and is one of cockfighting’s fiercest critics. In the early 1990s, the society contacted historians and experts about some of the founding fathers to see if there was any truth to the claims. According to the documents the society collected, the founders’ connections to cockfighting seem somewhat tenuous, though we acknowledge some limitations about this type of research -- namely that their surviving personal writings and other documentary evidence is limited. George Washington  There is one reference in George Washington’s diaries that confirms that as a 19-year-old, the nation’s future first president attended a cockfight.  ""A Great Main of (co)cks fought… (be)tween Glouster and york for 5 pistoles each battle and 100 ye odd I left it with Colo. (John) Lewis before it was decided…,"" he wrote, according to information uncovered by the Humane Society. However, it’s unclear how excited the young Washington was, since the entry says he left before the fight ended, said Mary V. Thompson, a research historian at the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington. Another historian -- John P. Riley, formerly of Mount Vernon, Washington’s estate --  told the Humane Society that there is a vague reference to a cockfight elsewhere in Washington’s writings, but that Washington referenced other activities he enjoyed far more than he referenced cockfighting. ""By the numerous references in his diaries and letters to foxhunting, card playing and attending the theater, we know that these were some of Washington’s favorite amusements,"" Riley wrote in 1993. ""The two references to cockfighting in his voluminous writings and the absence of documentation or physical evidence of any cockpit at Mount Vernon leads me to believe that it was not an entertainment in which he participated in any great way."" Thomas Jefferson The evidence on Thomas Jefferson is similar. ""Although it is always much harder to disprove something than to prove it, I am confident that if Jefferson had any interest in cockfighting, I would come across some reference to it in my twenty-five years of working with his documentary archive,"" Lucia C. Stanton, the former director of research at Monticello wrote to the Humane Society in 1993. Stanton told PolitiFact that while it is impossible to tell what activities Jefferson took part in before he started prolifically documenting his life, it would be surprising if he had been actively involved in cockfighting as a young man yet made no mention of these activities in his later writings. Meanwhile, a transcribed memoir from the 1840s of a former slave of Jefferson’s seems to say pretty clearly that Jefferson did not participate in cockfighting. ""Mr. Jefferson never had nothing to do with horse-racing or cock-fighting,"" former slave Isaac Granger Jefferson dictated to Charles Campbell in Memoirs of a Monticello Slave.  In addition, Jefferson did raise fowl at Monticello, but it is a leap to say that he raised birds for sport. Finally, Jefferson helped write a 1799 law that was meant to deter gambling on activities like cockfighting. Adams, Franklin and other founders The evidence about the other founders is no more convincing. John Adams, who would become the new nation’s second president, has only one known reference to cockfighting -- his lament that young men waste time of the activity, said Amanda Mathews, assistant editor of the Adams papers with the Massachusetts Historical Society. ""While they all probably attended one at some point or another, I don’t think any of the Adamses were ‘involved’ in any way,"" Mathews said in an email, referring to John Adams and his second cousin Samuel Adams. As for Franklin, some claims about his fondness for cockfighting involve his proposal to make the national bird a turkey instead of the familiar bald eagle. Some have taken this as a symbol of his association with cockfighting, but this seems too vague to serve as solid evidence. As for other founders, we will note that in October 1774, the Continental Congress, which would become the United States’ first governing body during the Revolutionary War, signed a resolution that, among other things, discouraged cockfighting. Fifty-seven members of the Congress signed the resolution, including such well-known founders like Jefferson, John Jay and Samuel and John Adams. Our ruling Bevin said that ""many"" of the founding fathers were ""very actively involved"" in cockfighting. In looking at the most prominent founders, we found no indications that any of the founders were avid and frequent participants. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1D140>],/factchecks/2014/may/01/matt-bevin/were-founding-fathers-active-cockfighters/
"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Brian Wilson']","
Was Jules Bailey instrumental in creating Oregon's Business Energy Tax Credit program?
","One tool government has for steering policy is making tax credits and other incentives available to private companies. You want new development in a tired part of the city? Limit property taxes for qualified investors. Want to cap the burning of fossil fuels? Offer tax credits for new solar and wind projects. Such tax breaks remain politically contentious, however, with critics questioning the use of tax dollars to benefit for-profit corporations. The claim: In Portland, Brian Wilson faces Jules Bailey, currently a legislator, in the May 20 primary election for the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners seat vacated by Deborah Kafoury, who is running for board chair.   Wilson, in an April 28, 2014, email to supporters, dinged Bailey for his involvement with the controversial Business Energy Tax Credit, a program that drew withering criticism in recent years for its ballooning costs. The email describes Bailey’s supporters as including ""corporate lobbyists and out-of-state special interest groups."" It adds, ""He was instrumental in creating the Business Energy Tax Credit that let companies like Wal-Mart profit by $11 million while costing the Oregon general fund $33 million."" Really? We decided to check. The analysis:    First, we checked the numbers. Those are accurate, as reported in a story by Harry Esteve, a politics reporter for The Oregonian, in 2009. On the central issue -- Bailey’s role -- we contacted Bailey, who sent an email saying Wilson is in error. ""I think he must have me confused with some other legislator,"" Bailey wrote. ""Since the day I was elected, I have spent every term reining in the abuses of the BETC."" He suggested we call several other sources, including the state Legislature’s Revenue Office, to verify his assertion. Chris Allanach, a senior economist in the Revenue Office, said, yes, the BETC program had been clouded with controversy and that Bailey had played a pivotal role -- not in championing the program, as Wilson claimed, but in reining it in. Bailey sponsored a bill in the 2009 legislative session that affixed sunset dates to all of the program’s tax credits, Allanach said. Bailey also carried the bill, which ultimately passed, on the House floor. Then, during the 2011 session, Bailey co-chaired the Joint Committee on Tax Credits, which carried on the work of the earlier bill, Allanach said. One result of that work means the state now can sell only $3 million in renewable-energy tax credits in any two-year period. Before the new limits, upward of $300 million in credits were being sold per two-year budget cycle. Wanting more information on the history of the program, we called the Oregon Department of Energy. Diana Enright, a department spokeswoman, emailed a chronology showing that the 1979 Legislature created the tax credit incentives that later became the Business Energy Tax Credit program. A sizable expansion of the program occurred in 2007, when the BETC increased from 35 percent to 50 percent for renewable energy projects. From checking Bailey’s legislative website, we know he was first elected in 2008. His first session was 2009. That meant he showed up in Salem 30 years after the program was born and two years after the expansion that triggered most of the controversy. Both of those dates contradict Wilson’s claim that Bailey was ""instrumental in creating"" the program. We called Wilson for his reaction. ""Our using the word ‘created’ probably was an inaccurate choice of words,"" he said. ""But he was very much involved with it once he got to the Legislature. He’s been vociferous in his defense of it."" When asked what constituted Bailey’s ""vociferous"" defense of the BETC, Wilson hedged. ""I was really referring to his umbrella statement that he’s spent his time in Salem closing all sorts of corporate loopholes,"" Wilson said. ""It was more about that than the BETC in particular."" In a follow-up call, PolitiFact Oregon told Wilson of Allanach’s view of Bailey’s work. ""That’s better information than we had,"" Wilson said. Various sources that have been helping his campaign, he added, told him that Bailey was ""vulnerable"" on the BETC issue. ""I never want to put out something that isn’t true,"" he said. ""We will definitely make sure that we correct our information."" The ruling: Brian Wilson, in taking on Jules Bailey in the May 20 Democratic primary, claimed Bailey was ""instrumental"" in creating controversial business tax credits. The program was created long before Bailey was elected, and its expansion to include credits for renewable energy projects occurred two years before Bailey was sworn in. A senior state economist who worked extensively on the program characterized Bailey’s work as ""clamping down"" on the amount of breaks given away. Further, a bill Bailey helped sponsor in his first session, along with a committee he co-chaired in 2011, effectively led to the program’s demise. Wilson, when told that a senior legislative economist backed the notion that Bailey worked to rein in the BETC, said he would amend his claim. Even a modicum of research, however, would have turned up evidence that Bailey had nothing to do with creating the program and that he did, in fact, work over several years to limit it.

Dan Patrick incorrectly says Pants on Fire slapped on entire David Dewhurst ad
","In TV spots and a voter mailer, state Sen. Dan Patrick declares the Texas Truth-O-Meter found his opponent’s latest TV ad, hammering Patrick’s past financial troubles, to be a lie. That’s curious because we haven’t rated a full ad from anyone lately, including the anti-Patrick ad launched in April 2014 by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst after Patrick led Dewhurst in the March primary for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination; the two face a May 27 runoff. For this fact check, we’re reviewing a statement in a Patrick campaign mailer brought to our attention by a reader as well as Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma. The front side of the mailer shows Dewhurst with his hand half-raised, like a stop sign, and these words in red: ""Bankruptcy, unpaid taxes, tax liens, unpaid debts, lawsuits."" The other side shows a frowning Dewhurst with the word ""lie"" stamped on his forehead next to a depiction of the Politifact Truth-O-Meter, its arrow pointed at our most severe rating, Pants on Fire; flames dance around it. ""David Dewhurst’s latest personal attack is a lie,"" the mailer’s text says. ""Desperate and lagging in the polls, David Dewhurst has resorted to outright lies in an attempt to malign his opponent. He has spent over $1 million on airing a TV ad he knows is a lie. PolitiFact Texas gave the (Dewhurst) television ad a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie,"" the mailer says. This entire statement is attributed to PolitiFact Texas and it’s dated April 17, 2014. Dewhurst’s ad showed a woman sitting in an armchair suggesting Patrick’s personal bankruptcy, which was filed in the 1980s and resolved in 1992, raises doubts about his being able to run the state honestly.  Key elements included a reporter asking Patrick in a debate about his walking away from over $800,000 in debts in the bankruptcy. The ad also referenced a Sept. 19, 2013, news story in the Dallas Morning News stating Patrick had numerous tax liens filed against him. On April 17, we rated as Pants on Fire another claim in Dewhurst’s ad--that Patrick changed his name to hide his debts. Patrick, who grew up as Dan Goeb, had gone by the name Dan Patrick as a broadcaster since the late 1970s but legally changed his name in 2003 in anticipation of running for public office--more than a decade after his personal bankruptcy case ended. Based on that time gap and an absence of other factual back-up, we found Dewhurst’s name-change statement incorrect and ridiculous. Dewhurst’s ad also said Patrick was caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. On April 28, we rated this claim Half True. Government agencies had filed liens against Patrick for unpaid taxes in the 1980s. But we saw no proof Patrick pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. Logan Spence, Patrick’s campaign manager, stood by Patrick saying we found the entire Dewhurt ad a Pants on Fire lie. PolitiFact Texas ""judged one attack as a pants-on-fire lie and the other attack as only half true,"" Spence said by email. ""On the whole, it is completely accurate to say that the ad is a lie because it intentionally distorts the truth."" Our ruling Patrick said ""PolitiFact Texas gave"" the Dewhurst TV ad ""a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie."" We didn’t rate the overall ad emphasizing Patrick’s past financial difficulties. Rather, we rated one of its claims Pants on Fire and another claim Half True.

Greg Abbott plan doesn't mandate standardized testing of 4-year-olds, but school districts could take that tack
","Texas children take mandated state tests from elementary through high school. Wendy Davis says Greg Abbott seeks to impose tests even earlier. An illustration posted online by Davis, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, starts by stating Texas pupils currently take the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, or STAAR. Davis then says that under Abbott, the Republican candidate for governor, ""Texas four-year-olds would be forced to undergo standardized tests as well.""  A reader emailed us, asking: ""What’s the truth to that?"" Existing pre-k serves select students Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, and Abbott, the state’s attorney general, have clashed over their competing proposals for pre-kindergarten education at a time that some communities, including San Antonio, have moved to expand pre-K. Not all children attend public pre-kindergarten, but Texas school districts have been required to offer pre-K to certain students since 1985, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research. Factors affecting eligibility include qualifying for a free- or reduced-price lunch, homelessness or the inability to speak or comprehend English. Texas was home to more than 750,000 3- and 4-year-olds in 2010, according to a Texas Education Agency web page. In 2012-13, about 227,000 3- and 4-year-olds were enrolled in public school pre-k, the agency said. Davis supports a broad expansion of full-day pre-K to all youngsters, costing the state about $750 million a year. In contrast, Abbott proposes spending an additional $1,500 per student in school districts that agree to implement a ""gold standard"" program consisting of a rigorous curriculum and staff requirements plus assessments to measure effectiveness of the pre-K programs. Those assessments are what led to the Davis’ campaign’s charge that Abbott wants to test 4-year-olds. For instance, Davis said April 15, 2014, that ""assessments"" in Abbott's plan is code for testing, according to a Dallas Morning News account posted online that day. Davis cites Abbott proposal By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out Abbott’s education proposal discusses pre-K students being given standardized tests. From Abbott’s plan: In order to equip the Commissioner of Education with the data necessary to properly evaluate prekindergarten programs, lawmakers should amend the Education Code to require school districts with prekindergarten programs to administer assessments at the beginning and end of the school year. There are at least three methods of assessing students at the prekindergarten level: ● Direct Assessments, norm-referenced standardized tests: A typical question on a direct assessment might ask the child to identify the letter and provide three options. The child receives credit for correctly identifying the letter. Direct assessments are in some views deficient because they do not capture the full spectrum of the students skill set and cannot truly be used to determine quality of the program. ● Observation Checklists and Scales: Assessment under this method requires that teachers informally watch students within the daily routine and observe their mastery.  This option does provide a more complete capture of the student’s progress but is contingent on teachers being well-trained in the method. Such assessments are also labor intensive. ● Child’s Work (Portfolio): Assessing children’s work acts as a complement to a teacher’s observed progress. This method does not capture the entire picture of a student’s progress and tends to be labor intensive for teachers. Abbott’s proposal says next: ""Most states employ one or both of the first two assessment methods. Texas is one of only four states not to require any assessment."" Also, the proposal says that in order to preserve local control and give schools flexibility, the ""state should avoid granting any one testing organization a monopoly over prekindergarten evaluations. Instead,"" Abbott proposes, the state education agency ""should publish a list of approved assessments that districts may use. Districts will report the results to the agency."" A footnote leads to a 2012 report by the New Jersey-based Educational Testing Service identifying the other states that don’t assess the quality of pre-k classes as Maryland, Tennessee and Wisconsin. The ETS report also says that each of the three assessment methods has tradeoffs while it separately warns against counting on standardized tests to gauge a preschooler. ""Older students typically are tested through the use of norm- or criterion-referenced assessments,"" the report says. ""Students are expected to independently read and respond to assessment items by filling in a bubble or circling or checking an answer (known as a selected response), or writing an essay or performing mathematical calculations… ""These traditional approaches,"" the report continues, ""are unlikely to produce useful data about what a 4-year-old knows or can do, and, in turn, how effective the pre-K program is in improving children’s development and/or kindergarten readiness."" It’s unrealistic to expect such children to read independently and respond to traditional test queries, the report says, in part because you can’t count on them to remember test directions. Also, the report says, such children develop at different rates and, naturally, are adjusting to school coming from distinct home lives. A chart in the report indicates that Alabama, Alaska, Nevada and Virginia rely solely on ""direct assessment"" of preschool students with 19 states mixing preschooler assessment methods. Campaigns' analyses Petkanas, asked about Abbott’s plan not saying standardized tests would be required of 4-year-olds, said the plan ""mandates assessments and ties funding to their outcomes -- and then points to norm referenced standardized tests as the first way to do that."" We asked Abbott’s campaign about this. Spokesman Matt Hirsch stressed by email that Abbott’s plan gives districts with state-supported pre-k classes the flexibility to choose an assessment method. Our ruling Davis said Abbott would force 4-year-olds to take standardized tests. Not quite. Abbott wants assessments of the subset of Texas students who are enrolled in public pre-k at the start and end of each school year and he says a way of doing so would entail standardized tests. However, his proposal also lists alternate assessment methods and says districts who volunteer for his pre-k program should be left to pick an assessment approach from various options fashioned by the state.

Senate Majority PAC says Scott Brown voted to give oil companies tax breaks
","The Senate Majority PAC, which employs several former aides to Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has again struck former Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who’s now running in New Hampshire to oust Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. The April 27, 2014, ad, titled ""Baggage,"" focuses on Brown’s connection to ""big oil."" ""Scott Brown’s carrying some big oil baggage,"" the narrator says. ""In Massachusetts, he voted to give oil companies big tax breaks. They make record profits. He collects over $400,000 in campaign contributions."" In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Brown’s votes. We’ll tackle his campaign contributions separately. The Senate Majority PAC cited Brown’s votes in 2010, 2011 and 2012 against measures that would have kept the ""big five"" oil companies (Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips) from taking advantage of existing tax breaks. Sponsors of the measures sought to apply the roughly $24 billion in additional tax revenue toward energy efficiency and conservation. Specifically, the measures would have prevented those five oil companies from using these existing tax breaks: • Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments • Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs • Deductions for intangible drilling costs • Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells • Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses Three of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the ""big five"" oil firms. In each of these three years, the measures failed -- by margins of 35-61 in 2010, 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. Majorities weren’t enough in the final two years, since those measures required 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, was the only Republican to vote in favor of the 2012 bill. In 2011, she voted the same way, along with fellow Maine Republican Susan Collins. In 2010, no Republican supported the measure. Brown joined most Republicans and a few Democrats from oil states in voting against the measure each time it hit the floor. Ironically, the Senate Majority PAC supports this year’s re-election bids of two other Democratic senators who voted the same way on these measures as Brown did -- Mark Begich of Alaska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. The bill’s opponents sometimes cited a March 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded that withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump. In general, then, the ad is correct that Brown sided with the position of ""big oil"" on these votes. However, the ad’s claim is phrased slightly misleadingly. Rather than voting ""to give oil companies big tax breaks,"" Brown voted not to take away the tax breaks that oil companies were already using. Also, it’s worth noting that two out of the five tax breaks in question were not targeted only at oil companies but were tax breaks that non-oil companies could benefit from, as well. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC ad said Brown ""voted to give oil companies big tax breaks."" For three years in a row, Brown did indeed vote against measures that would’ve barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed. That’s slightly different than what the ad says -- rather than voting to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Brown voted to support the status quo. Still, the ad is correct to suggest that Brown was voting in concert with the biggest oil companies on that legislation. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097128400>],/factchecks/2014/apr/30/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-says-scott-brown-voted-give-oi/

Greenlight Pinellas supporters say the plan 'won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles'
","Details of Pinellas County’s mass transit initiative, Greenlight Pinellas, already have opponents in overdrive. Some critics seem to be especially unhappy after receiving an informational email from Friends of Greenlight, a pro-transit political action committee. The email says the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority would implement bus rapid transit countywide without altering the current traffic flow. ""Bus Rapid Transit will help the Pinellas bus system move faster, but it won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles,"" the email reads. The email is paired with an artist’s rendering of the 1100 block of 4th Street N in St. Petersburg. The street has been altered to include a bus stop and a new bus lane in front of the block’s businesses. The image, however, shows one other thing -- that the center turn lane 4th Street N has been removed. So how is it that supporters promise the transit overhaul will not result in fewer traffic lanes, while an image shows the opposite? And, more broadly, will Greenlight Pinellas ""take existing lanes from other vehicles?"" PolitiFact Florida wanted to learn more. What is bus rapid transit? Understanding the concept of bus rapid transit is key to predicting whether Greenlight Pinellas radically alters existing traffic capacity. That’s not as easy as it sounds, because the term bus rapid transit (known as BRT) is a catch-all term that can mean many different things. Annie Weinstock, a director at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, helped us with nailing down the details. She said the Institute generally considers the criteria of a BRT system as having: Dedicated bus lanes (ideally in street medians); Intersections that prevent turns across bus lanes; Transit signal priority that detects the presence of buses and changes lights accordingly; Offboard fare collection to reduce wait times as passengers pay at the fare box, the single biggest bottleneck in bus service; Platform-level boarding to help move passengers -- especially handicapped and elderly passengers -- onto the bus as quickly as possible. BRT can have any of these elements in any proportion, as long as the focus is on moving the buses as quickly and as directly as possible. Greenlight Pinellas incorporates many of these changes, but it’s difficult to say which ones, or where they’re going to be. Why? Because of a Catch-22 in the plan. An outline, not a blueprint The current plan is a broad overview of the potential transit expansion, proposing a 1-cent sales tax increase countywide to pay for the light rail line between St. Pete and Clearwater, increasing bus hours, adding routes and building in improvements to allow for BRT. Voters must approve the initiative on Nov. 4. (We checked a previous claim about the sales tax, which you can read here.) Greenlight Pinellas does call for improvements at intersections and bus stops that will allow bus travel to be faster. Some of those changes may include dedicated bus lanes at intersections or bus stops that allow the buses to get ahead or stay out of the traffic. Some routes may simply run at more frequent intervals. PSTA external affairs officer Bob Lasher said the project may also use a method known as ""queue jumping,"" in which buses use separate lights to start travel before regular traffic does. Bus lanes would be built from existing medians and shoulders on most major roads except St. Petersburg’s 1st Avenue N and 1st Avenue S. Those one-way streets, running in opposite directions, are lightly traveled enough to give up an entire lane for bus service without causing traffic problems, PSTA says. Using those two lanes is enough to foster arguments over whether Friends of Greenlight can make such an absolute statement about the plan. What makes it tougher is that so many cooks will be in the kitchen if the proposal is approved. Lasher said PSTA would work with the Florida Department of Transportation, the county and local municipalities to see if other lanes or rights of way could be used for buses. But the details of what those changes would look like isn’t done yet, because the initiative hasn’t been approved by voters. ""The actual stop-by-stop, turn-by-turn details won’t be known until after the engineering and environmental studies are done, which would be only if the measure passes due to expense,"" Lasher said. ""If we were to put out that kind of money before hand, and it failed, that would be a big loss and irresponsible of us."" Ironically, without those details, opponents continue to pick apart the plan, saying Greenlight Pinellas won’t work because there’s no way to tell how it will be organized. If it’s altering 4th Street in such a misguided way, what else will it do? The problem is, Greenlight Pinellas doesn’t aim to remove the turn lane from 4th Street N. ""That photo – which is a mock up – was to demonstrate what a BRT station would look like,"" Lasher said, pointing out the payment kiosk on the sidewalk at the bus stop. ""I use it for that and when I explain off-board fare payment.  It was never meant to imply that we would be taking a lane along 4th Street. Our graphics artists used the backdrop, because they liked the background."" Friends of Greenlight spokesman Kyle Parks said they would strive to make sure people understood the image was a rendering designed to show what a bus stop would look like and nothing more. So is it possible traffic lanes may be sacrificed, even the turn lane along Fourth Street? Could capital improvements to major roadways really be made without affecting other drivers? Can Greenlight Pinellas really do what it claims it’s going to do? The answer is, sadly, that we can’t say definitively until after the engineers get down to the nitty-gritty details. And that can only happen if the 1-cent tax passes Nov. 4. Our ruling Friends of Greenlight says in its promotional email that implementing bus rapid transit  ""won’t take existing lanes from other vehicles."" Already the statement needs to be qualified, because two thoroughfares in St. Petersburg will be losing lanes if a 1-cent tax increase passes. And while PSTA and Greenlight advocates say bus lanes would be taken from shoulders and medians, there’s really no way to know how roads will be altered. Pinellas residents will have to vote for the proposal in November before a study can be done to work out those details. We can say that there are no plans currently to remove the center turning lane from 4th Street North, and an artist's rendering showing that outcome was actually intended to show what a new bus stop might look like. So there’s no intention to take away traffic lanes beyond the two Greenlight Pinellas mentions, but there’s also no possible way to guarantee it won’t happen. The plan will be implemented with the input of many local municipalities and the state, which means any number of outcomes are possible. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A4398C0>],/factchecks/2014/apr/30/friends-greenlight/greenlight-pinellas-supporters-say-plan-wont-take-/

Lankford overstates slow growth in past 100 years
","The Republican message on tax reform is that it holds the key to kicking the economy into high gear. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has talked of steady yearly growth of 3 percent or more each year with passage of the package. Many economists, regardless of their economic leanings, say that prediction is unlikely to play out, but Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said it makes sense to him. ""If the economy is stuck in the same track over and over again, somehow, you have got to be able to bump that to get it going,"" Lankford said on CBS News’ Face the Nation on Oct. 22. ""For the last 10 years, our economy has grown at less than 2 percent on average every single year for 10 years. We have not had a decade like that in a century in America."" The government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis tracks economic growth, and that’s where we turned to check Lankford’s statement about America’s lackluster performance compared to the last 100 years. His office told us he was looking at average growth from 2007 to 2016. According to the government statistics, real gross domestic product, or GDP, rose an average of 1.37 percent during that time. The yearly rates ranged from a drop of -2.8 percent at the low point of the Great Recession in 2009 to a high of 2.9 percent in 2015. So yes, the average is less than 2 percent, as he said. Lankford then counted each 10-year period working backward from 2007. His office sent us these numbers, using BEA data: 1967-76 3 1977-86 3.4 1987-96 3 1997-2006 3.3 2007-16 1.4 This raises a couple of questions about his specific words. First, Lankford said growth hadn’t been so low in a century. The bureau’s data only goes back to 1930, which is less than 100 years ago. Lankford would need more than another dozen years of data. His data source can’t prove his point. Second, the exact nature of Lankford’s decades was unique to his claim. Counting backwards by tens from 2016 isn’t necessarily the only way to define a decade. Yes, a decade means 10 years. But often, when talking about history, it means a 10-year period beginning in years that end in zero. The History Channel, for example, has its sections on the 1960s, the 1970s and so on. Based on that understanding, the numbers would tell a different story. In the first decade of this century, 2000 to 2009, the average annual rate of growth was 1.82 percent. That would undercut his argument that growth has not been under 2 percent for each decade going back a century. Then again, looking back at the decades between 1930 and 1999, average annual growth in each period has been over 2 percent. Lankford said that average yearly growth in the past 10 years has been under 2 percent and that ""we have not had a decade like that in a century in America."" Lankford is correct that growth since 2007 has averaged under 2 percent. The data don’t carry his argument over a full century because the government numbers only go back to 1930, not 1917 as would be necessary. He also has cherry-picked his definition of a decade. His numbers are correct by the yardstick he chose, but by another common interpretation of decade, average growth in the first 10 years of this century fell below 2 percent. That runs counter to the heart of his assertion. At the same time, using that definition, it is fair to say that growth since 2000 has been lower than in the decades before that.

Greitens Mostly False about MU having biggest enrollment drop of major universities
","November marks the two-year anniversary of the height of protests that took place on the University of Missouri’s campus. Protests over multiple racial issues culminated with a boycott by football players, a six-day hunger strike and, on Nov. 9, the resignations of the university system president and the MU chancellor. The University of Missouri has since experienced a noticeable dip in enrollment. Gov. Eric Greitens even went as far as to say in a Facebook Live video on Aug. 23, 2017, ""I believe that this is the biggest drop in enrollment of any major university in the country."" Big decline, yes. But is it the worst drop in enrollment in the country? In his video, Greitens goes on to state that freshman enrollment has dipped by 33 percent since protests in 2015 brought national media attention to the SEC school. The governor’s office didn’t respond to our request for clarifications. Because Greitens referred to major universities, we decided to take a look at four-year public universities containing 20,000 or more students. We chose these universities because the Department of Education lists MU in this group. According to the Department of Education data, MU was not the only university to experience a drop in enrollment. Departmental data show that MU's total enrollment declined from 35,424 in 2015 to 33,239 in 2016, or 6.17 percent. That puts the university in fourth place for enrollment decline. The top three: --Florida State University at Jacksonville, which is predominantly a two-year college, came in third with a 7.97 percent decrease in enrollment.
 --The University of Akron main campus fell 8.66 percent.
 --The largest decline was at Miami-Dade College, also predominantly a two-year college, which saw enrollment drop 11.43 percent.
 Greitens spoke before this year’s official enrollment figures were out, but the decline has continued. The Department of Education hasn’t finished gathering numbers for 2017 enrollment. On Sep. 20, MU announced an enrollment of 30,870, according to the MU News Bureau. That’s a drop of 12.9 percent from 2015. Freshmen enrollment is down even more. Since the protests on campus, MU experienced a 36.5 percent drop in freshman enrollment, more than the 33 percent decline Greitens mentions. According to the Department of Education, first-year student numbers for 2016-2017 are still not yet available for all universities, so there is no way to tell if MU experienced the largest drop in freshman enrollment. Greitens said, ""I believe that this is the biggest drop in enrollment of any major university in the country.""   MU has undoubtedly experienced a drop in overall enrollment since protests that took place two years ago. However, MU’s overall enrollment decline did not top other universities like Miami-Dade College or the four-year University of Akron. As far as freshman enrollment, numbers for 2016-17 have not yet been made available, so there is no way to tell if MU experienced the biggest drop in enrollment. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Sanders' claim on economic disparity accurate, but with a caveat
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., spoke Sept. 21 at Westminster College in Fulton, where he laid out his vision for foreign policy. Like many of his other speeches, he touched on economic disparity and said, ""There is no moral or economic justification for the six wealthiest people in the world having as much wealth as the bottom half of the world’s population, 3.7 billion people."" We wanted to know if it is possible that the collective wealth of the six richest people could equal more than that of half the world’s entire population. Sanders’ source is a 2017 Oxfam report that is put together using numbers from Forbes and Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Databook, according to Joshua Miller-Lewis, Sanders’ press secretary. The Oxfam report states that the eight richest men in the world had as much wealth as 3.6 billion people in the world, or half that population. But since that report, the numbers have changed: The rich have gotten richer while overall global wealth has decreased, according to the underlying data used by Oxfam. Oxfam’s calculations come from wealth estimates by Credit Suisse, a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, said Laura Rusu, policy and campaigns media manager for Oxfam America. Based on the latest data from Credit Suisse, the wealth of the bottom 50 percent of the global population is $409 billion. The six wealthiest people in the world add up to about $416.2 billion, according to Forbes. ""The 1 percent now controls more wealth than the 99 percent of the rest of us combined, and it’s only getting worse,"" said Rusu. The six richest people, according to Forbes billionaire list, are Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Amancio Ortega, Mark Zuckerberg and Carlos Slim Helú . While Sanders’ claim is accurate, there are some notes of caution. ""I think this statement is correct but it is not very meaningful because the bottom 50 percent has essentially no wealth,"" said economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley. While many of the economists we spoke to agreed that the statement is technically correct, the issue lies with wealth measures. Most of the wealth of the rich is from fungible private wealth, which is an asset’s interchangeability with assets of the same type. ""It is probably the case that one-half the world’s population has almost no fungible private wealth. So by that measure, Bernie Sanders may be right,"" said Richard Burkhauser, professor emeritus of policy analysis at Cornell University College of Human Ecology. Rusu further explained that the Oxfam reports have seen a drop in private wealth, compared to the world’s collective wealth, but this has to do with an improved data collection method and not necessarily a change in people’s wealth. ""The dramatic drop isn’t due purely to a sharp increase in inequality, but rather the availability of better data,"" Rusu told PolitiFact Missouri. While giving a speech in Fulton, Missouri, Bernie Sanders stated that the six richest people in the world had as much wealth as the bottom half of the world’s 3.7 billion people. According to global wealth disparity research, it is factually accurate to say that six men are, collectively, richer than the bottom 50 percent of the world. However, an expert cautioned about reading too much into this specific statistic because of the way wealth is measured and improvements in data collection. Sanders’ statement is accurate but needs clarification.

Trump wrongly says Manafort crimes came years before he joined the campaign
","President Donald Trump reacted via his favorite platform -- Twitter -- to indictments against his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, a business associate of Manafort’s, and a guilty plea from a former campaign policy adviser. ""Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus,"" Trump tweeted. Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus????? The Justice Department indicted Manafort on 12 counts, primarily money laundering and false statements, none of which involved his work for Trump. The oldest of the allegations date back to activities that began in 2006, but three occurred in 2016 and 2017. Manafort’s more recent actions undercut Trump’s statement. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In March 2016, then-candidate Trump tapped Manafort to manage the Republican National Convention. In a press release announcing the hiring, Trump praised Manafort as ""a great asset and an important addition"" in consolidating the support Trump won during the primary season. On May 19, Trump promoted Manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist. On Aug. 19, as Trump’s poll numbers tumbled, Manafort resigned. His time with the Trump campaign had lasted six months. From 2006 to 2014, according to the indictment, Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates made tens of millions of dollars lobbying on behalf of a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine and the man who led it into power, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The work continued briefly after Yanukovych was forced from office. The grand jury indictment alleges that in order to hide the money from the U.S. government, Manafort and Gates ""laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and back accounts."" Manafort used ""his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States."" He bought ""multi-million dollar properties"" and then ""borrowed millions of dollars in loans using these properties as collateral, thereby obtaining cash in the United States without reporting and paying taxes on the income."" The money-laundering conspiracy is the second count in the indictment. The government documented a large number of transactions between 2008 and 2014. But they continued into March 2016, the very beginning of Manafort’s work with the Trump campaign. In 2012, Manafort used an offshore account to buy a $2.8 million condominium in New York City, which he rented out using, among other services, Airbnb. In late 2015, he applied to get a mortgage on the property. To get a lower interest rate, he and Gates invented documents to say it was a second-home for his daughter and son-in-law. Based on that assurance, in March 2016, government prosecutors said, a bank gave Manafort a $1.185 million loan on the property. Also in early 2016, Manafort misled another bank to secure a loan on a second New York property. In addition, the indictment said for many years Manafort had hidden his control over multiple foreign accounts in places such as Cyprus and the United Kingdom. That deception continued as late as October 2016. There are two other charges that occurred in 2016 and 2017, and both involve making false statements. The government said that in November 2016 and February 2017 Manafort and Gates failed to make a full disclosure of their overseas work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They denied that their work for Ukrainian parties included meetings or outreach within the United States. The government also said they tried to bury the paper trail that would reveal their full activities. Manafort's attorney Kevin Downing said in a statement that the Special Counsel was using a ""very novel theory"" of the foreign agents registration law, and that since 1966, the government has won just one conviction for failure to file under it. Trump said the allegations against Manafort involved crimes committed years ago. Most of the counts in the indictment detail Manafort’s money laundering efforts dating back to 2006. But that deception involving foreign bank accounts and misleading lenders, prosecutors said, extended until as late as October 2016. By March of that year, Trump had named Manafort to oversee the Republican National Convention. The charges that Manafort made false statements took place after Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign, but they did take place within the past year. Trump’s claim puts more of a cushion between him and Manafort than was actually the case.

Guy who ran for Congress in NJ as pro-choice and just took $100k in pill money —> https://t.co/AasTJGOkP9 Both candidates have received endorsements from anti-abortion groups in recent years, and Morrisey received the endorsement from West Virginians for Life this year. So is it accurate that Morrisey advocated for abortion rights in a race to represent New Jersey’s 7th District? Not exactly. Morrisey clearly opposes abortion. Jenkins’ claim essentially boils down to Morrisey not having opposed it enough in 2000. When we asked Jenkins’ campaign for evidence, they directed us to the following line in a May 15, 2000, AP story about the GOP primary race between Mike Ferguson and Morrisey: ""Ferguson has the support of state and national anti-abortion organizations and says he would support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. The other abortion opponent in the field, Morrisey, says he would not support such an amendment,"" the story said. ""While Ferguson and Morrisey are against abortion, and (Tom) Kean favors abortion rights, (Joel) Weingarten says only that lawmakers should respect ‘current constitutional strictures’ by not trying to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized abortion,"" the story went on to say. So the same article that Jenkins says shows Morrisey supported abortion rights also referred to him twice as an abortion opponent. The only other evidence the Jenkins campaign provided for his claim was an April 2000 news article in which Morrisey and Weingarten accused Ferguson of conducting a push poll in which Morrisey was portrayed as an abortion rights advocate. ""(Morrisey) also said he is ProLife and not ProChoice on the abortion issue as he said was indicated in the Ferguson campaign poll,"" the story said. The Westfield Leader wrote of Morrisey’s abortion stance two months later: ""The candidate said he is pro-life on the abortion issue, with exceptions for rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is in danger. He opposes partial birth abortion."" Wanda Franz, the president of West Virginians for Life, which endorsed Morrisey for Senate, called Jenkins’ accusation inaccurate. Franz emphasized that Morrisey had been fighting against abortion since the 1990s as a lawyer on Capitol Hill. (Morrisey served as Counsel to the House Commerce Committee under Republican leadership.) ""Both of the pro-life candidates were pro-life, that’s what it said in the article,"" Franz said. ""Simply the difference had to do with the Human Life Amendment as a constitutional effort."" The human life amendment is a pretty broad term encompassing not one but several proposals to amend the Constitution to effectively overturn Roe vs. Wade. Most of the proposed amendments define personhood as starting at fertilization or conception, which poses a problem to some who believe abortion should be permitted in certain cases. ""A Constitutional Human Life Amendment is the only practical action we can take to broadly prohibit abortion and permanently protect unborn human life,"" said Andy Sere, Jenkins’ spokesman. ""If a candidate for Congress says he would not support the only way to do that, then that is a pro-choice position — no matter if that politician would like to be labeled pro-choice or not."" Just to be clear, Morrisey sent a letter to the West Virginia GOP that said he would ""strongly support"" a constitutional amendment in the U.S. Senate to overturn Roe vs. Wade. ""For my entire career, I have been opposed to that horrific decision,"" Morrisey wrote. So what about his stance in 2000? Morrisey’s campaign did not recall the reason for Morrisey’s opposition to a constitutional amendment in 2000. We were unable to gather the specifics of the amendment Morrisey opposed. ""Mike Ferguson was pro-life, no exceptions, and all the articles about Morrisey had some exceptions in the case of rape or incest,"" said Nachama Soloveichik, Morrisey’s spokeswoman. ""It’s possible they were talking about some specific amendment that didn’t have exceptions."" Charles Camosy, author of Beyond the Abortion Wars and theology professor at Fordham University, explained this was a common reason for opposition to the amendment. Larry Arnold, the author of the AP article in question, said Morrisey’s position on the amendment likely came from Morrisey’s campaign website, which the Wayback Machine showed included a link to a position paper on partial birth abortion. (We were unable to track down the paper.) There’s also the chance Morrisey opposed the amendment for other reasons, like believing it was not the most effective way to push the anti-abortion agenda or that it was a decision that should be left to the states. Franz said that either way, opposition to the amendment by itself wouldn’t have meant he supported access to abortion in most cases, as the practicality of a constitutional amendment has long been contested even among people pushing for abortion restrictions. ""We have not thought of the human life amendment as a viable option for decades,"" Franz said. ""We don’t have it on our candidate questionnaires. It isn’t an issue for us anymore because we have other strategies."" The Susan B. Anthony List, a prominent anti-abortion group, is not focused on pushing the amendment, Camosy explained, whereas other groups such as the American Life League and the Human Life Action Center still consider it a long-term goal of the anti-abortion movement. The National Pro-Life Alliance includes the issue on their candidate questionnaire. ""There are various paths to providing legal protection for unborn children,"" said Carol Tobias, a spokeswoman for National Right to Life. ""A constitutional amendment is one. Another would be for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, followed by action at the state level to enact pro-life measures."" In other words, the importance of the amendment is contested among anti-abortion groups, but Carmosy agreed that equating opposition to an amendment — no matter the reason — to supporting abortion rights was unfair. He proposed the example of the LGBT rights movement in the 1990s. ""Was someone who, back then, was arguing only for civil unions and not a constitutional amendment about marriage not a genuine LGBT ally?"" Camosy said. ""That's ridiculous. It was a difference in political strategy."" Jenkins said Morrisey ""ran for Congress in NJ as pro-choice."" We found no evidence Morrisey supported abortion rights during a New Jersey congressional race in 2000. Morrisey opposed abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when the woman’s life is in danger. The Jenkins campaign cited a 2000 AP story that said Morrisey was opposed to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, one of the more extreme tactics among those who oppose abortion. However, experts and anti-abortion groups told us that opposition to the amendment would not have made Morrisey an abortion rights advocate. We rate this statement False. Correction: This report initially said that both candidates had received endorsements from an anti-abortion group this year. We have corrected it to note that both candidates have received endorsements in recent years. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E33980>],/factchecks/2017/oct/30/evan-jenkins/did-patrick-morrisey-once-support-abortion-rights/

Do millennials have ‘only a 50-50 chance’ of doing better financially than their parents?
","Candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin says she wants to create ""an economy that works for everyone."" But with the state’s affordable housing crisis and deep poverty, Eastin believes that’s not happening now, especially for young people.   ""People become cynical,"" she wrote in an Oct. 11, 2017 op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle ""because the path to a brighter future is becoming more remote."" Eastin continued:   ""Ninety percent of people born in the 1940s ended up doing better financially than their parents. But those born in the 1980s, the much-maligned Millennials, have only a 50-50 chance of doing better (financially) than their parents, despite being the best-educated generation in our history."" Millennials are typically considered the children of the Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers. They were born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. We wanted to know whether Eastin was right about this dramatic decline in children doing better than their parents. We set out on a fact check. Eastin’s background Eastin is one of several Democrats vying to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018. She served in the State Assembly from 1986 to 1994 and then as State Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1995 to 2003. She was the first, and remains, the only woman to hold that position. In addition to her desire to create a more equitable economy, Eastin has advocated for greater investment in education, the adoption of universal health care and continued work on climate change during her run for governor. Our research We asked Eastin’s campaign for evidence supporting her claim about millennials and their financial prospects. Jon Murchinson, her campaign spokesman, told us the statement is based on conclusions in a December 2016 study by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. The study is called ""The Fading American Dream: Trends in Absolute Income Mobility since 1940."" Its findings, indeed, show that the fraction of children earning more than their parents has plummeted -- from 90 percent for children born in the 1940s to 50 percent for those born in the 1980s. The study accounted for inflation, taxes and other changes between the generations. ""It’s basically a coin flip as to whether you’ll do better than your parents,"" Stanford economist Raj Chetty, one of the study’s authors, said in a news release announcing the study’s publication in December 2016. SOURCE: The Equality of Opportunity Project Reached by email this week, Chetty told us Eastin’s characterization of this trend ""appears accurate."" David Grusky, the study’s co-author and director of Stanford’s Center on Poverty and Inequality, added that Eastin’s statement is ""a fair summary of our headline conclusion."" The Stanford study doesn’t examine whether millennials are the ""best-educated generation in our history."" That part of Eastin’s statement, however, was substantiated in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. It found 27 percent of millennial women and 21 percent of millennial men had completed at least a bachelor’s degree by age 33. That was slightly higher than the percentages for men and women at the same age from Baby Boomer to Generation X populations. Inside the study While Eastin appears to have correctly represented the report’s findings, we wanted to know how the Stanford researchers came to their conclusions and whether other researchers agreed with them. Grusky told us the report used millions of Internal Revenue Service records and Census data to compare income between parents and children. The report specifically looked at people born between 1940 and 1984 and measured household income for parents and children when both were 30 years old. Even after accounting for changes between the generations, such as millennials entering the workforce at an older age than their parents, Grusky said the findings on upward mobility did not change significantly. Only slightly more than 50 percent of children at age 40 had higher income compared with their parents’ income when their parents were 30 years old. Unequal growth The Stanford study also accounted for the rapid economic growth experienced during the Baby Boomer generation, when the nation’s post-World War II economy created a surge of new jobs and industries. Assuming both generations had experienced the same economic growth rates, Grusky said only 62 percent of millennials would do better than their parents. The key factor holding back broader financial success of this younger generation, the report concluded, was today’s inequality of growth. Financial success, Grusky said, has become concentrated among a smaller share of families compared with the recent past. Ensuring that financial success is distributed more widely would ""make a lot of headway"" toward millennials doing better than their parents in future years, the researcher added. The report found declines in upward mobility for millennials across all 50 states. The biggest drops took place in Rust Belt states such as Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, Grusky said. Millennials in states such as California, New York and Massachusetts saw, on average, less substantial declines.  SOURCE: The Equality of Opportunity Project For this study, Grusky said, researchers were not able to factor in student debt or address how people of different races and ethnicities are affected by the mobility trends.  ‘Behind the starting line’ Tom Allison, deputy policy and research director at Young Invincibles, said the Stanford research ""is right in line"" with the conclusions reached by his Washington D.C.-based group. Young Invincibles advocates for expanding economic opportunities for young adults and encouraging them to get involved in the political process. Allison said the Stanford study is both transparent and relies on credible public data. Factors from the Great Recession to student debt to globalization have all put millennials ""behind the starting line"" compared with their parents, he said. ""That is a cornerstone of the American Dream,"" Allison continued, ""that if you work hard and play by the rules, then you can exceed the living standards of your parents. And we’ve seen a precipitous decline in that."" Our ruling Delaine Eastin recently claimed millennials ""have only a 50-50 chance"" of doing better financially than their parents, while those born in the 1940s had a 90 percent chance of doing better than their parents. Her claim is supported by a 2016 Stanford study, ""The Fading American Dream: Trends in Absolute Income Mobility since 1940."" Stanford researchers found stronger economic growth combined with a broader distribution of that growth during the Baby Boomer generation drove greater upward mobility for people born in the 1940s. They said financial success has become more concentrated in recent decades, leaving millennials with much lower odds of doing better than their parents. Even after accounting for changes, such as inflation and millennials starting work at older ages, they found today’s younger generation faces comparatively smaller odds of earning more than their parents. Other research, notably by the advocacy group Young Invincibles, agreed with the Stanford findings. We rate her claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['National', 'Drugs', 'Economy', 'Labor', 'Joe Manchin']","
Opioid epidemic likely hurting West Virginia’s workforce
","The Democratic senator from West Virginia — where the opioid overdose death rate ranked highest in the nation in 2015 — connected the state’s opioid use with its battered workforce. Sen. Joe Manchin told MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt that the opioid crisis is destroying families and wrecking the state’s economic future. ""I've got the greatest workers in the world,"" Manchin said on Oct. 22. ""But I'm down to around 50 percent of the adult workers who are actually working now because of addiction or conviction."" We wondered to what extent opioids are to blame for low employment in West Virginia. Manchin’s office told us he learned about the effect opioid abuse has on the state’s employment through ""hundreds of meetings with business executives, state workforce and labor experts, at his job fairs and with community leaders across the state."" The office also clarified Manchin’s comment, saying people who struggle with addiction or have been convicted in crimes related to opioid use in the past often have trouble getting jobs. Experts agreed that the opioid crisis affects employment rates in West Virginia, but they don’t know how much. Manchin is about on the mark when he says about half of West Virginia’s adults are employed. What’s less certain is the role opioid abuse plays. To measure this, the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at two key figures: the  employment-population ratio (the percentage of people over the age of 16 who are employed) and the labor force participation rate (the percentage of people over the age of 16 who are either employed or actively looking for a job). The latest estimates place West Virginia at a 50.4 percent employment-population ratio and a 53.1 percent labor force participation rate in September. By comparison, the United States’ employment-participation ratio in September was at 60.4 percent and the labor force participation rate was 63.1 percent. (Because the labor force doesn’t typically include students and retirees, college towns or populations with more elderly individuals might sometimes appear to have lower workforce participation.) West Virginia has historically had one of the lowest labor participation rates in the United States. Since the late 1970s, as far back as the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ data on labor participation rates goes, the state’s rate has remained below 58 percent. Similarly, the employment-population ratio has not exceeded 55 percent. A 2015 study of West Virginia’s labor participation rate conducted by the West Virginia Center on Budget & Policy found that the state’s higher-than-average elderly population, percentage of people on work disability and poor overall health were major factors in the participation rate. In addition, lower rates of educational attainment beyond a high school degree had prevented young workers from obtaining jobs that require more education. Where does that leave opioid addiction? Experts say that’s an unanswered question. ""While I'm sure addiction and the opioid crisis have played a role in hurting West Virginia's workforce, I'm not sure you can attribute much of the state's decline to it,"" said Sean O’Leary, a senior policy analyst with the center. He also noted that the state’s recent decline coincides with the national recession. At the national level, a September 2017 paper out of Princeton University suggested opioid use could account for 20 percent of the drop in men’s labor force participation from 1999 to 2015 and 25 percent of the decline in women’s participation. And the problem has drawn the attention of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who testified to the epidemic’s effects on national labor during a July 13 Senate Banking Committee meeting. ""I do think it is related to declining labor force participation among prime-age workers,"" Yellen said. ""I don’t know if it’s causal or if it’s a symptom of long-running economic maladies that have affected these communities and particularly affected workers who have seen their job opportunities decline."" But there is no specific research related to West Virginia. Anecdotal evidence suggests employers nationwide have struggled in the past several years to find potential workers who are drug-free and healthy enough to perform required job tasks. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland also cited the problem in a September 2016 report on West Virginia, which said local employers contacted by the reserve bank indicated ""educational attainment and social factors such as frequent opioid and heroin use"" limited the employers from finding the workers they need. Still, the exact statistical impact for the state remains unclear. Jessica Ice, an assistant professor at West Virginia University’s Institute for Labor Studies and Research, said she would be hesitant to attribute the entire decline in employment to opioids. ""I think we are still learning about the extent of the problem here as the epidemic continues to wreak havoc on the state of West Virginia,"" Ice said. ""While surely there is an impact I cannot even say what came first, disability and then prescription drug abuse? Hopelessness over the state of the economy and resorting to drugs to cope?"" Manchin said the reason for the decline of working adults in West Virginia to ""around 50 percent"" of adults is due to the state’s opioid epidemic. His estimate of workforce participation is correct, and recent research at the national level suggests opioids have hurt workers and employers looking for healthy employees. Experts on West Virginia’s economy think the health crisis has affected participation in the workforce; they just don’t yet know to what extent. In any event, a number of other factors are likely driving the decline. Manchin’s claim is partially accurate, but lacks context that might give a different understanding of the data.

Rauner's ""blind trust procedures"" don't excuse lawsuit secrecy
","A lawsuit filed Oct. 5 against Gov. Bruce Rauner by a former business associate has piqued the interest of those who follow Illinois politics. But the substance of the suit remains unknown because, in a highly unusual move, the complaint and three exhibits in the case filed in Cook County Circuit Court are sealed. The plaintiff’s attorney says he wants the records made public and says they’re under wraps at Rauner’s request. When asked about the lawsuit after a public appearance on Oct. 20, Rauner said he knew nothing about it. ""To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I don’t control. I did that when I became governor,"" Rauner said. ""I can’t comment on any business disputes. That gets settled in its own process."" This lawsuit is likely to draw more interest as it plays out, which makes this a good time to look into Rauner’s claim that he has no control over the business interests that predate his term as governor. Rauner’s vast wealth had been a point of contention in his 2014 campaign against incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn, who consistently tried to portray Rauner as economically out of touch with the vast majority of voters. After winning the election, Rauner sought to allay concerns that his extensive business portfolio -- which would generate $279 million in income in his first two years in office -- would make him vulnerable to conflicts of interest as governor. So shortly before his inauguration on Jan. 12, 2015, Rauner announced he was turning over control of his financial affairs to New York-based Roundtable Investment Partners and released a document detailing the ""blind trust commitments"" by which he would abide. ""To avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest, I am designating an investment adviser under a power of attorney and establishing specific blind trust procedures during my service as governor to eliminate my day-to-day involvement in any company or issuer in which I hold any security interest or investment,"" Rauner said in the document. ""At all times during my service as governor, any information regarding the business and affairs of the issuer, including information on the financial performance of the issuer, or otherwise related to my status as a security holder in the Issuer, will go to the investment adviser and not to me."" But while Rauner invoked ""blind trust procedures"" in his explanation, the business arrangement he entered into was a power of attorney, not a blind trust. The Chicago Tribune explained the difference in an article that appeared shortly before Rauner’s inauguration: What Rauner did instead (of creating a blind trust) was create a different, less rigorous structure known as a power of attorney that granted management authority over much of his wealth to a New York investment adviser…. If Rauner had set up an actual blind trust, he would have had to transfer to it ownership of most of his wealth. Rauner would still have been the beneficiary of the trust, but he would have relinquished control over his assets to an independent trustee pledged to keep the governor in the dark about transactions. Rauner’s press secretary, Patty Schuh, said Rauner was speaking colloquially when he spoke of a ""trust"" rather than a ""power of attorney"" in his statement about the lawsuit. Even if Rauner had wanted to created a blind trust, however, a quirk in Illinois ethics law would have prevented it. Under Illinois law, state officeholders are required to file annual statements of economic interest in which they must list all their business interests in the state. In a blind trust like those used by federal officials, an officeholder turns over ownership of financial interests to a trustee who is prohibited from communicating with the official on investment matters. Such a setup would prevent Rauner from fulfilling the state economic disclosure requirements. Rauner’s then-press secretary Lance Trover explained the compromise arrangement to the Tribune: ""This is the strongest possible structure that both established blind trust procedures and allows the Rauners to fully comply with the state's economic disclosure laws moving forward,"" said Trover, who noted that blind trusts can be used to shield a politician's assets from public view. ""Doing this ensures to the people of Illinois that Gov. Rauner will not try to hide his financial assets behind a blind trust."" The reporting aspect of Rauner’s setup is a key distinction between it and a blind trust. Because Illinois requires that he submit an annual summary of his economic interests, Rauner can’t legally blind himself to knowledge of his investments as would be required in a blind trust. ""If you still have to report it, it does defeat the purpose of a blind trust,"" said Larry Noble, senior director and general counsel of The Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C., campaign ethics watchdog group. Noble believes voters would be better served if Illinois law didn’t favor mandatory disclosure over true blind trusts. ""If you know what assets are in there, even though you’re not calling the shots you still have a conflict,"" Noble said. There are two other significant differences between Rauner’s arrangement and a blind trust as defined by federal law. In a blind trust, there can be no relationship between the officeholder and the trustee. Rauner is an investor in Roundtable and its CEO, Geoffrey Boisi, donated $50,300 to Rauner’s 2014 campaign. Even though Rauner has pledged to leave all business activities to Roundtable, his pledge is not legally binding. There is no legal prohibition on his communicating with or receiving reports from Roundtable, and he retains the right to make investment decisions if he so chooses. That could be significant in relation to the current court case, Noble said, because it gives Rauner a convenient way to quickly dispel any controversy that develops over the alleged secrecy. ""He could say, ‘In the interest of disclosure I authorize my trustee to make it public,’ "" Noble said. Rauner said, ""To be clear, all my investments are in a trust that I don’t control."" He was not being clear when he said his investments were held in trust. A quirk in Illinois ethics law means candidates can’t establish blind trusts like those used by federal officials, so Rauner’s investments are handled through a power of attorney granted to Roundtable Investment Partners. It’s not technically a ""trust,"" as Rauner called it, but if he is following his ""blind trust commitments"" pledge, the power of attorney arrangement appears to come as close as Illinois law permits. The power of attorney system he established doesn’t legally prohibit him from contact with Roundtable, however, so he’ll have a hard time hiding behind it if pressure mounts to make the substance of this month’s lawsuit public. Rauner’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out some important details. We find it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C44C880>],/factchecks/2017/oct/27/bruce-rauner/rauners-blind-trust-procedures-dont-excuse-lawsuit/

'Death tax' that Republicans want to repeal is paid by only 2 of 1,000 people who die?
","Ripping the sweeping tax reforms pushed by President Donald Trump and other leading Republicans, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, singled out the provision to eliminate the ""death tax."" In an Oct. 18, 2017, appearance on a talk show on Janesville’s WCLO radio, Pocan said: They (Republicans) go about getting rid of the estate tax -- which, to me, is the one that I wish more people would really understand. They’ve done a good of marketing it as a ""death tax"" -- you die and you get taxed. But the reality is, it’s a tax on the ultra-wealthy that the vast majority of people will never, ever, ever see in their life. Last year, two out of every 1,000 people paid an estate tax. So it’s not like a common tax that’s out there. With the overall reform gaining momentum from a Senate vote the day after Pocan’s claim, and a House vote a week later, let’s see if his statistic is correct. Aimed at the rich? There is debate about how the rich are treated by the reform proposal, which at this stage is considered only a framework, since it lacks details. We’ve rated as Mostly False a claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Janesville Republican who represents the congressional district that borders Pocan’s. Ryan said the framework, which he supports, is focused on tax breaks for the middle class ""and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break."" The framework does offer some benefits for the middle class, but what’s more clear is there are specific provisions benefiting the wealthy. As for what is conventionally known as the estate tax, the Trump administration uses the term ""death tax"" (as do Ryan and other Republicans) in promoting how the framework would repeal the tax. Trump himself claimed ending the tax would ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer."" But PolitiFact National’s rating was Pants on Fire: Only 5,460 estates even pay the tax each year, with only 80 being small businesses or farms. Pocan’s figure The Internal Revenue Service tells us the estate tax ""is a tax on your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death"" -- including cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, business interests and other assets. In 2016, the year cited in Pocan’s claim, an unmarried individual’s estate was potentially taxable only if the estate’s value exceeded $5.45 million. (The value had to exceed $10.9 million to be taxable, if there was a surviving spouse.) After deductions, such estates generally are taxed at 40 percent. IRS figures show there were 12,411 estate tax returns filed in 2016 -- but a tax was owed on only 5,219 of them. That smaller figure aligns with what PolitiFact National found. And the non-profit Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center makes a similar estimate for 2017: 5,460 estates owing a tax.) In 2016, those 5,219 estates paid a total estate tax of $18.3 billion. Since annual estate tax filings include deaths that occur in previous years, the Tax Policy Center says that each year, there are roughly 5,000 estates that pay the federal estate tax out of roughly 2.6 million deaths each year. That comes to 2 of every 1,000. Point of view on the tax While he doesn’t dispute the statistics, Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, told us there are other points to consider regarding the estate tax, saying: The estate tax affects far more people than the relatively small number who pay. Many people who own businesses and/or investments have to spend a lot of time and money on lawyers/accountants planning to avoid it. A substantial portion of the life insurance industry exists only to avoid the estate tax. And, indeed, that is an important criticism: it is one of the most inefficient taxes in the sense that the ratio of paperwork/avoidance to tax collections is very high …. The estate tax is anti-saving and anti-investment. It encourages wealthy folks to consume their wealth before death because, if the rate is high, they don’t want the government to grab it. For the rest of us, it would be better if wealthy people kept their money invested in the economy,  because that spurs growth. It’s better for us if the wealthy hold large pools of savings rather than going out and buying expensive cars and yachts.

Charlie Geren says less than half of young Texans are registered to vote
","After a study found Texas high schools neglecting their legal duty to help eligible students register to vote, state Rep. Charlie Geren took to Twitter to inform his followers about Texas’ lousy youth voter registration rate. Geren tweeted on Sept. 18, 2017: ""Did you know less than half of Texans ages 18-24 are registered to vote?"" We wondered about that. Asked about Geren’s basis for the claim, Payton Spreen in Geren’s office said the Fort Worth Republican relied on a Sept. 15, 2017, Texas Tribune news story. That story says many high schools have apparently failed to help students register, ""and election turnout among young voters has remained chronically low — less than half of Texans age 18 through 24 are registered to vote""; the story otherwise referenced U.S. Census Bureau research reflecting on voter registration and turnout in 2016. The story highlighted a September 2017 report by the Texas Civil Rights Project and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, advocacy groups that address voter rights with a focus on racial and ethnic minorities. The groups found that despite a Texas law requiring high school officials to circulate voter registration forms to students, in 2016, just 198 of 1,428 Texas public high schools, or 14 percent, and no private schools had requested registration applications from the Texas secretary of state’s office, which supervises elections. According to the report, the groups calculated those compliance rates after the 2016 elections by requesting copies of all voter registration request forms submitted to the secretary of state’s office by high school principals. We’ve noted before that a Texas law--approved in 1983, a dozen years after the 26th Amendment reduced the U.S. voting age to 18 from 21--says that at least twice yearly, high school administrators must distribute voter registration applications to students who are or will be 18 years old or older that year. Schools aren’t required to collect filled-out forms though completed forms that get turned in must be forwarded to hasten registrations. Youth voting trended down--until 2016 Nationally, the registration and turnout of young voters has bounced around, according to post-election surveys taken by the Census Bureau in even-numbered years. Texas registration rates declined every four years from 2000 through 2012, bureau results indicate, but the 2016 rate proved an improvement:
               According to bureau data, young adults have consistently voted and registered at lower rates than others. We asked William Galston of the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies program why that’s been the case. By phone, Galston said older Americans are more likely to register to vote and cast ballots because they essentially see the stakes as higher for themselves. ""As you get older and get married and rooted in the community, as that process goes along, people tend to get more connected to politics,"" Galston said. Galston pointed us to a 2003 study by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University and the Carnegie Corporation of New York that says young adults vote less frequently in part because high schools teach fewer civics classes than they used to. We also spotted a 2013 CIRCLE study that found, based on its national survey of nearly 4,500 18- to 24-year-olds, that respondents ""who recalled high-quality civic education experiences in high school were more likely to vote."" Galston said of young voters: ""It’s not as if you have to move a mountain to get them involved. But you have to get them over a psychological hump."" So, was Geren right about less than half of young Texans registering to vote? To analyze his claim, we reviewed the Census Bureau’s 2016 post-election survey results before seeking the latest registration data from a state agency. The sources, it turned out, supported conflicting conclusions. Census Bureau's 2016 survey The bureau gauges registration and turnout rates by supplementing its Current Population Survey (CPS), which surveys a probability selected sample of roughly 60,000 households. Since 1994, the survey also has inquired into citizenship data broken down since 2000 by age and state; a 2014 bureau study says citizen data ""provides a more accurate reflection of the population eligible to vote."" Then again, Geren’s tweet didn’t specify that he was focused on citizens. So we sought both estimates of young registered residents, regardless of eligibility, and registered citizens. In the main, the bureau’s 2016 survey results support Geren’s claim. That year, according to the results, an estimated 1.04 million Texas 18- to 24-year-olds registered to vote, making up 40.8 percent of all Texans in the age group, plus or minus a 3.2 percentage point margin of error. If you focus on U.S. and Texas citizens in the age group, the results indicate that 47.6 percent reported registering to vote--again, less than half. But this specific result’s margin of error of 3.6 percentage points makes it possible to speculate that up to 51.2 percent of Texas citizens in the age group registered to vote. Nationally, the survey results indicate, 50.8 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 55.4 percent of citizens in the age group registered to vote before the 2016 elections. A 2017 count of registered voters Asked about more recent registration data, a bureau spokeswoman, Julie Iriondo, told us by email the agency had nothing past those 2016 survey results. Closer to home, the Texas secretary of state’s office, which oversees state elections, replied by providing the number of Texas 18- to 24-year-olds registered to vote as of the date that Geren tweeted. Spokesman Sam Taylor advised by email that 1.68 million Texas residents in the age group as of Sept. 18, 2017, had registered to vote in advance of the Nov. 7, 2017 elections. That number seemed high in that it’s 62 percent greater than the comparable 1.04 million Texans estimated by the bureau after the 2016 elections. Similarly, we noticed, the state says that as of November 2016, 15.1 million residents were registered to vote, a figure 29 percent greater than the 11.7 million registered Texans then estimated by the bureau. Despite appeals to experts, we fell short of reconciling these contrasts though Taylor provided figures arguably accounting for some of the difference in young voter counts. In 2017, Taylor said, 341,635 18- to 24-year-olds registered to vote through the October registration deadline. He described another 137,641 tallied registered voters in the age bracket as on the state’s ""suspense list."" According to the secretary of state’s website, individuals on the list are still registered voters, though Taylor said in a phone interview that some may no longer live in Texas. Perhaps such voters weren’t picked up by the 2016 bureau survey. Estimating a 2017 registration rate Taylor told us the agency has no information on the share of young Texans registered to vote heading into the 2017 elections. We then made our own run by comparing the state’s tally of registered voters as of mid-September 2017 to several estimates for 2017 of the total number of residents aged 18-24--one by the bureau and two by the San Antonio-based Texas Demographic Center. The center’s Lila Valencia provided us with its 2017 population projections, each calculated in 2014: one assumes net migration into Texas at half the rate from 2000 to 2010 and the other assumes migration continuing at the 2000-2010 rate. The former estimate may be more precise, the center says, because Texas experienced unusually rapid growth from 2000 to 2010. The conservative migration projection suggests that 2.77 million 18- to 24-year-olds were living in Texas in 2017 while the less conservative estimate indicates 2.94 million Texans fell into that age group. In contrast, the bureau in 2016 estimated the state was home to 2.54 million residents in the age bracket. Upshot: Regardless of which of the three population estimates you consider, the state’s September 2017 count of 1.68 million registered voters aged 18-24 breaks out to more than half of 18- through 24-year-olds being registered to vote at that time. We’d caution, though. Because we mixed precise statistics and projected data to estimate youth voter registration rates, our results shouldn’t be considered exact. That said, if you use the center’s 2.77 million population estimate, it looks like 61 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds were registered to vote as of late September 2017. Comparing the state’s count of 1.68 million registered voters aged 18-24 to the bureau’s 2016 estimate of 2.18 million Texas U.S. citizens in the age group suggests that an even greater share of citizens were registered to vote about the time that Geren tweeted--far more than half. Our ruling Geren said less than half of Texans aged 18 through 24 are registered to vote. There’s a solid basis for this claim — a federal post-election survey in which 47.6 percent of 18- to 24-year-old Texans reported registering to vote. But we found more recent data and ways to crunch figures that suggest the described registration rate might exceed 50 percent. We rate Geren’s statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Donald Trump takes credit for gains against ISIS but there's more to the story
","President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to hit the Islamic State hard, and the armed fundamentalist group has suffered major losses on his watch. In July, coalition forces broke ISIS' hold on Mosul, the largest Iraqi city under their control. In October, they were forced out of Raqqa, the Syrian city the Islamic State claimed as the capital of their would-be caliphate. During a news conference, Trump drew a sharp contrast with his predecessor in the White House. ""We have done more in eight months than the previous administration has done in many years,"" Trump said Oct. 25. Based on numbers from the battlefield and the assessment of terrorism analysts, Trump can rightly claim that he built on the work done under President Barack Obama, but he can’t take full ownership of the gains that followed. Numbers tell only part of the story, but Pentagon figures on the missions flown and the explosives rained down on ISIS put the first months of the Trump administration into context. The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy nearly 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and September 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.) Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three-fourths of the action took place during the Obama years. The Air Force reports over 102,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. Over two-thirds of that came before Trump took office. By late August 2014, the Islamic State controlled about 35,000 square miles. The defense data firm IHS Markit mapped the terrorist group’s declining influence between 2015 and 2017. The ISIS zones are in gray.  The maps show that most of the territorial collapse of ISIS took place during the Trump administration. But defense experts say that what the maps don’t show are the offensive operations that began under Obama. The battle for Mosul, for example, began in October 2016, about four months before Trump took office. The collapse was a continuation of what had begun earlier. Between the start of 2015 and February 2016, IHS reported that ISIS had lost 22 percent of the territory it once controlled. Some defense analysts criticize Obama for not moving quickly enough to confront the Islamic State. Anthony Cordesman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the Obama administration was ""grindingly slow"" to get air power and equipment into the region. But that changed rapidly through 2015. ""Virtually all were in place before the Trump administration came to office, along with virtually all of the key arms transfers and other assistance that went to Iraqi forces and the Syrian forces supported by the U.S,"" Cordesman said. Under Trump, the tempo of airstrikes increased, and military commanders were given greater leeway to order attacks. But Cordesman said that represented no great shift in overall strategy. ""Trump deserves credit for fully implementing the plan and some limited improvements, but it is nonsense for him to take credit for a program his predecessor had largely put in place,"" he said. The Islamic State faced battles everywhere. It was under attack by the Iraqi and Syrian militaries. Kurdish and Syrian forces backed by the United States wore down ISIS fighters at strategically key locations. American and Russian airstrikes targeted both ISIS military centers and the oil fields that helped fund the fundamentalist fighters. William Braniff, executive director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland, said the Islamic State was an ""impossibly poor nation-state fighting a multifront war while savaging its own economic base."" It was, in Braniff’s view, unsustainable. ""This beleaguered proto-state was then starved of external sources of money and fighters by an international effort, that included many initiatives led by the United States under the Obama administration, and that were continued into the Trump administration,"" Braniff said. We reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back. Trump said his administration had done more against ISIS in the last eight months than the Obama administration had done in many years. Trump is correct in the sense that the Islamic State has suffered its largest territorial losses since he took office, but that confuses the timing with the cause. Between two-thirds and three-fourths of the firepower unleashed against ISIS hit before Trump became president. The terrorist group’s hold on territory had started to crumble a year before he took command. While Trump ordered some changes in the military operation, the experts we reached said those didn’t transform the strategy so much as continue the one he inherited from Obama. Trump can take credit for keeping the fight going, but he has to share the glory for the results. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A94C0>],/factchecks/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-takes-full-credit-gains-against-isis/

Does Roy Moore want to end Medicaid and Medicare, as his Democratic opponent claims?
","In the race for Alabama’s Senate seat, Democratic candidate Doug Jones is warning that Republican nominee Roy Moore’s small government conservatism could imperil federal programs that provide health care to millions of Americans. ""My opponent in this race has advocated getting the federal government out of health care altogether, which means doing away with Medicaid, which means doing away with Medicare,"" Jones said in a Sept. 27 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press Daily. With the Dec. 12 general election drawing near, we wondered whether Jones had accurately stated Moore’s small government approach to health care reform. Jones put words in Moore's mouth. Jones' campaign pointed to this statement from Moore’s spokesman: ""Roy Moore wants to make sure that the federal government is getting out of the health care business entirely,"" Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said in a Sept. 23 press release, which highlighted differences between Moore and his former Republican rival Sen. Luther Strange on the issue of Obamacare repeal. There is a subtle but crucial difference between Armistead’s and Jones’ statements. Jones said Moore wants the federal government out of health care — Moore’s spokesman said he wants the federal government out of the health care business. The space between those statements is the crux of this fact-check. For more than 50 years, the federal government has played a role in giving health insurance to the poor and elderly through Medicaid and Medicare. These public insurance programs are distinct from the kind of private insurance customers can buy from companies like Unitedhealth and Aetna. While Moore clearly supports shrinking the federal government, the key question is whether Moore wants the federal government out of private insurance only, or if he also wants the federal government to end its role in public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, as Jones said. Moore’s campaign declined to say if he wants to do away with Medicaid or Medicare. A description of his policy positions on his campaign website is silent as to these specific programs, and we were unable to find a single instance where Moore explicitly called to end the government’s role in public insurance. What we did find were numerous examples of Moore calling for the repeal of Obamacare. ""We do not need socialized medicine which will ultimately lead to loss of quality and affordability of heath care, as well as a loss of access to the latest medical technology. Obamacare should be completely repealed as soon as possible,"" Moore’s campaign website states. It’s unclear exactly what Moore would like to see Obamacare replaced with. But the record seems to suggest he’s amenable to the federal government playing some role in Medicaid and Medicare into the future. One clue is Moore’s support for the House-passed American Health Care Act. That bill would have curtailed, but not abolished, Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It would not have eliminated Medicare either. ""Obamacare has not been fully repealed, although steps have been made in the right direction, and I support the bill that has passed Congress,"" Moore said in a Sept. 21 Republican primary debate against Strange. An interview Moore gave to the Montgomery Advertiser suggests he recognized the federal government’s fundamental role in public insurance as a given even before Obamacare took effect. ""It’s not the role of the government to be involved in health insurance,"" Moore told the Montgomery Advertiser June 27. ""Before Obama came in, the federal government wasn’t involved, except for Medicaid and Medicare, with health insurance."" A Moore profile in the July 24 Montgomery Advertiser described him as ""noncommittal on cuts to Medicaid."" With respect to Republican replacement efforts at the time, Moore said he ""would have to see what cuts they’re talking about"" for Medicaid before he took a position. That’s a far cry from calling to abolish the program. It’s possible Moore may take a harder line on public insurance programs in the future. But for now, we’ve found no evidence he wants to abolish Medicaid or Medicare. Jones said Moore wants to end the federal government’s role in Medicaid and Medicare. The record clearly demonstrates Moore wants to repeal Obamacare. He may not have articulated what he wants the health insurance system to look like, but we found no evidence to suggest he wants to end the federal government’s role in Medicaid and Medicare. We rate Jones’ statement False. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973AA300>],/factchecks/2017/oct/26/doug-jones/does-roy-moore-want-end-medicaid-and-medicare-his-/

Donald Trump wrong that his tax plan is biggest cut ever
","Over and over again, President Donald Trump has touted his tax proposal as the biggest ever. On Oct. 25, he tweeted, ""Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class, business & JOBS."" Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class, business & JOBS   That same day, he told Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network, ""We’re bringing the corporate rate down to 20 percent from 35 percent. ... This will be the biggest tax cut in history. In the history of our country.""   But is it? Tax experts say no. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry.) The current tax proposal is still a work in progress, but the Senate budget resolution allows it to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that, when all is said and done, the reduction in tax revenues will increase to $2.2 trillion over 10 years. So based on what we know now, the tax proposal will probably amount to between $150 billion and $220 billion per year. That doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever. The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product — two metrics that experts say give a sense of scale. Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, at least one tax bill on the Treasury list, and possibly others, were larger. Here’s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars: Tax bill Inflation-adjusted dollars  American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) $321 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 $210 billion Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 $208 billion Current tax proposal $150 billion - $220 billion Revenue Act of 1964 $64 billion Revenue Act of 1945 $60 billion Revenue Act of 1978 $55 billion Revenue Act of 1948 $38 billion   At least the 2013 bill -- and possibly the 2010 and 1981 bills -- exceeded the current bill in inflation-adjusted tax cuts, depending on what figure you project for the current bill. And here are the tax laws ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP: Tax bill Percentage of GDP Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 2.89 percent Revenue Act of 1945 2.67 percent Revenue Act of 1948 1.87 percent American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (enacted in 2013) 1.78 percent Revenue Act of 1964 1.6 percent Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 1.31 percent Current tax proposal 0.8 percent-1.2 percent Revenue Act of 1978 0.8 percent    By this measurement, at least six bills cut taxes by more than the current proposal. A seventh, the Revenue Act of 1978, is essentially tied with the current proposal as a percentage of GDP. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut, from 1921, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP. The group added in a blog post that ""if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years."" No formulation of the current proposal is close to that. ""Unless lawmakers scrap their current plans for tax reform and start over from scratch, it’s simply implausible to claim that this legislation will provide the largest tax cut in U.S. history,"" said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at the group Tax Analysts. Trump said the GOP tax plan he is supporting is ""the biggest tax cut in U.S. history."" Even the most expansive estimate for the current proposal’s tax cut is exceeded by the 1981 tax cut in inflation-adjusted dollars. And as a percentage of GDP, a half-dozen or more previous tax cuts were larger.

Did Austria's Sebastian Kurz ban George Soros' organization? That's fake news
","A popular article on Facebook claims that Austria's incoming chancellor Sebastian Kurz has banned George Soros’ Open Society Foundations from the country. This is a fabricated tale made by a notorious fake news website. With the headline, ""Youngest world leader bans George Soros’s Foundations from Austria,"" the YourNewsWire.com post said that the made-up ban was in response to Soros’ $18 billion donation to the organization, making it the second-biggest philanthropic organization in the United States. The article said that Kurz gave the organization 28 days to ""cease and desist operations in Austria."" The story falsely said the incoming chancellor called Soros ""the greatest challenge humanity is facing in the world in 2017."" The fake story goes on to quote Kurz describing Soros as ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming his blood funnel into anything that smells like money"" — language identical to a 2010 Rolling Stone piece about Goldman Sachs by Matt Taibbi. Besides Soros’ massive donation and Kurz’s young leader status (he’s 31), this story is complete bogus. Open Society Foundations, an organization with efforts in different countries all over the world, has no offices in Austria — and therefore nothing to ""cease and desist."" We couldn’t find any record of Kurz describing Soros in that light or commenting on OSF. Soros was implicated during Kurz’s campaign when a Facebook page called ""The Truth About Sebastian Kurz"" accused the future chancellor, who supports low levels of immigration, of conspiring with Soros to let in a new wave of refugees. The Facebook page was later found to be set up by a consultant working for Kurz’s opponent, Christian Kern.
