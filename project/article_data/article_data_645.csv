Martin O'Malley: Net migration from Mexico was 0 in 2014
","At the Democratic debate in Des Moines, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley shared a statistic that he said you would never hear out of one of the leading Republican presidential candidates. ""Let’s say it in our debate because you’ll never hear this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump: The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me. Go ahead, check it out,"" O’Malley said. Challenge accepted. We actually wrote about this back in June when former President Bill Clinton said something similar. When we did that fact-check, we didn’t have the 2014 data yet. So let’s revisit what we found with the addition of the most recent data, which is the crux of O’Malley’s claim. One way to measure net migration -- the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave -- is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place. (For the 2014 data, a three-year estimate is not currently available.) Year Born in Mexico   3-year average estimate (1,000s) 1-year estimate (1,000s) 2014 n/a 11,714 2013 11,604 11,585 2012 11,650 11,563 2011 11,700 11,673 2010 11,642 11,711 According to Census Bureau data, the number of U.S. residents born in Mexico dropped each year from 2010-13. It bounced back up in 2014, but it remains lower than the peak in 2007, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""That is not a small statistical difference, but it's small compared to the days of rapid Mexican immigration from 1994 to 2007,"" Nowrasteh said. ""O'Malley was mostly correct. The population increased but it was small. Mexican immigration certainly isn't surging anymore."" The margin of error is large enough that the actual number of Mexican-born people living in America in 2014 could be lower than it was in 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us back when we looked into Clinton’s claim that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend. While there’s a little variation, both estimates show fewer people from 2010 to 2013. ""This strongly implies zero net (migration),"" Camarota said. Four reasons for the decline Why is migration from Mexico to the United States slowing down? Demographics is possibly the biggest driver. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. Rosenblum told us that apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000. More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling O’Malley said, ""Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me."" Census data from 2010 up to 2013 support O’Malley’s point, as the population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. Experts said this is a strong indication of a prevailing trend. That figure actually rose slightly in 2014 -- though remaining significantly lower than the peak number of Mexican-born Americans in 2007. And the 2014 number had a large enough margin of error that it’s possible there was an actual drop from 2013. Other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that O’Malley’s point is correct. With a caveat that the measurements aren’t perfect, we rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/15/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-net-migration-mexico-was-0-2014/

Sanders says 500,000 troops came back with PTSD, TBI
","During a discussion of American foreign policy and military involvement in the Middle East at the Democratic debate in Iowa, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders turned the discussion to the care provided to American veterans with a startling statistic: 500,000 returned service members have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries. ""When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war,"" Sanders said. ""The 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury. And I would hope that in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us."" Sanders has been making this claim for more than a year, including on Twitter in 2014, in a 2014 CNN interview and at a Minnesota campaign event last summer. But is it true? Have 500,000 American veterans really returned home from recent conflicts with PTSD and brain injuries? Sanders’ claim is at the higher end of the range of estimates available. The U.S Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) have PTSD in a given year. As of late 2014, about 2.7 million troops had served in Iraq or Afghanistan. That’s a wide range: 11 percent of 2.7 million is 297,000; 20 percent is 540,000. Additionally, a U.S. Senate resolution identifies ""more than 390,000"" cases of PTSD among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn in Afghanistan, citing the secretary of Veterans Affairs as its source. Those figures only account for PTSD, not traumatic brain injury, or TBI, which Sanders also referenced. A 2013 Congressional Research Service paper on traumatic brain injury found that almost 57,000 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans were evaluated or treated for ""a condition possibly related to TBI"" by the VA. That number is slippery though. It’s not clear that all of those nearly 57,000 actually received a TBI diagnosis, and it doesn’t account for the potentially thousands more veterans who experienced a traumatic brain injury but did not receive care through the VA. The VA also estimates that brain injuries account for 22 percent of all combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department, meanwhile, identifies 333,169 instances of traumatic brain injury among service members between 2000 and 2015. That’s a big number, but there are some caveats that come with it: It includes all U.S. forces, not just those deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and is overwhelmingly comprised of concussions and ""mild TBI"" that by definition lasts less than 24 hours. Also worth noting: that same U.S. Senate resolution noting 390,000 PTSD cases also references ""more than 615,000"" veterans of recent conflicts who have been diagnosed with ""at least 1 mental health disorder."" Our ruling Sanders said 500,000 U.S. troops came home from Iraq and Afghanistan ""with PTSD and traumatic brain injury."" No firm numbers exist for the number of veterans who have returned from America’s most recent conflicts with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries, but Sanders’ claim of 500,000 does fall within the range of estimates provided by the VA and other sources. Sanders’ statement needs that caveat. As such, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-500000-troops-came-back-ptsd-tbi/

Hillary Clinton says wages haven't risen since turn of the century
","Much of the first part of the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines addressed foreign policy, but soon the conversation turned to economic issues. At one point, Hillary Clinton was asked about how she would pay for such proposals as paid family leave. Clinton said she would not raise taxes on the middle class. ""I have made very clear that hard-working, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase,"" she said, adding that ""wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century."" To check her assertion about stagnant wages, we turned to figures collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To take advantage of the most recent available data, we looked at figures for the third quarter of 2015. And to design the fairest comparison, we looked at third-quarter data for two different years -- 1999 and 2000 -- that could be used to describe the baseline ""since the turn of the last century."" To adhere to Clinton’s parameters, the figures below are all inflation-adjusted. Here’s what we found: Period Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, inflation-adjusted Third quarter, 1999 $315 Third quarter, 2000 $321 Third quarter, 2015 $340 This shows that wages didn’t rise very much above inflation over that period, though they did rise. Specifically, they rose about 8 percent between 1999 and 2015, and about 6 percent between 2000 and 2015. This is not very much of a rise over a 15-to 16-year period, as Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out when PolitiFact contacted the campaign. Still, it does undercut Clinton’s wording in the debate. We should note that this pattern didn’t simply start in 2000 -- it goes back to the 1970s and even the 1960s. As the Pew Research Center noted, using similar BLS data, ""For most U.S. workers, real wages — that is, after inflation is taken into account — have been flat or even falling for decades, regardless of whether the economy has been adding or subtracting jobs."" Specifically, Pew wrote, ""in seasonally adjusted current dollars, median usual weekly earnings rose from $232 in the first quarter of 1979 (when the series began) to $782 in the second quarter of (2014, the most recent data available). But in (inflation-adjusted) terms, the median has barely budged over that period."" The paper added that what gains have been made over that period have accrued to the upper-income brackets. ""Since 2000, usual weekly wages have fallen 3.7 percent (in real terms) among workers in the lowest tenth of the earnings distribution, and 3 percent among the lowest quarter,"" Pew wrote. ""But among people near the top of the distribution, real wages have risen 9.7 percent."" Our ruling Clinton said that ""wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century."" They didn’t rise by much -- roughly half a percentage point per year above inflation over the past decade and a half -- but they did rise. We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-wages-havent-risen-turn-centu/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Ben Carson']","
Ben Carson says China is involved in the Syrian conflict
","Ben Carson suggested during the Fox Business News debate in Milwaukee that China is involved in the Syrian conflict. When asked if he supports President Barack Obama’s decision to put 50 special operations troops in Syria, Carson said any presence is better than no presence, especially given the forces at play. Here’s what he said in context: Moderator Maria Bartiromo: ""Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president’s decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?"" Carson: ""Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they — that’s why they’re called special ops, they’re actually able to guide some of the other things that we’re doing there. ""And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way. ""We also must recognize that it’s a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there."" We were curious about Carson’s assertion that the ""Chinese are there"" in Syria. According to the White House, China and experts, they are not. But before we dive into that issue, let’s sort out some semantics. What Carson meant   Multiple media outlets, including our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker, took Carson’s remarks to mean that Chinese troops are in Syria. But the Carson camp forwarded us a statement refuting that interpretation. Rather, his actual point was that China is providing ""various military weapons and equipment that Syria is using in the current conflict,"" according to the statement which also included several links to articles on that point. ""Dr. Carson does not believe that China is currently fighting in or deploying troops to Syria, and contrary to press reports, he has never made that assertion,"" the statement reads. ""Regardless, Dr. Carson's claim that China is exerting its influence and has in the ongoing Syrian conflict is well-supported by evidence, even if it is not evidence commonly available to or easily accessible by journalists without the requisite language skills or knowledge about Chinese."" However, Carson seems to be backtracking. On Nov. 11, the day after the debate, a top Carson adviser spoke specifically about ""Chinese military advisers"" in Syria when defending Carson’s remarks. ""During Dr. Carson’s conversations with military operatives and people in Iraq, in that part of the world, (they) discussed with him multiple reports that Chinese military advisers are on the ground in Syria operating with Russia (sic) special-operations personnel,"" the adviser told Business Insider. A Carson spokesperson also referred the Washington Post’s Fact Checker to a few blog posts speculating explicitly about Chinese military personnel in Syra. We also ran Carson’s statement by an expert on political campaign rhetoric. ""Saying ‘the Chinese are there’ means the Chinese are there, not just that their weapons are there,"" said Kathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland. ""He is making a clear, firm assertion. Had he made a more nuanced statement, such as ‘there is a Chinese influence there,’ there would be some room for debate on his meaning."" No Chinese in Syria What’s the source of the idea that China is in Syria? The posts Carson’s spokesperson sent to the Washington Post all link back to a Sept. 27 report from the Lebanon-based news site Al-Masdar Al-’Arabi. According to the news site, a senior officer in the Syrian Arab Army said Chinese military personnel would join Russian marines in the Syria in the next six weeks. The story then got picked up by Russian state media, and the overseas media attention led China's Foreign Ministry to officially deny China’s presence in Syria in mid October, while its state-run media characterized the reports as ""speculative nonsense,"" according to Reuters. Carson’s statement also prompted responses from the White House. Press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""speechless"" over Carson’s claim that he has better intelligence than the administration. ""I really can’t speak to what he was referring to, but unless you’re talking about having a diplomatic presence, I’m not sure what he was referencing,"" National Security Adviser Susan Rice said at a press conference. ""I have not seen evidence of Chinese military involvement in Syria."" Experts told us it would be very uncharacteristic for China — a country with a longstanding, though gradually changing policy of nonintervention — to send troops abroad, especially to the Middle East. ""The Chinese have been very, very clear from day one that Syria is not something they want to take responsibility for,"" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a global consulting firm.  ""It would go against absolutely everything we know about China. And Syria is the world's worst morass. ... The Chinese want no part of this."" ""There is no possibility that China is planning on sending troops into Syria,"" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""China doesn't send troops abroad except for peacekeeping purposes. China isn't interested in taking on the role of global policeman."" Both Bremmer and Glaser noted that official Chinese statements on Syria are vague comments promoting peace and self-rule. ""China opposes easy interference in other countries' domestic affairs. China supports Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as its approach to find its own path of development that is consistent with its national circumstances,"" China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a visiting Syrian official in mid October. The same sentiment is expressed in a five-point proposal for the Syrian conflict put forward by China during the United Nations’ Geneva II peace conference in 2014, as well as the four-step initiative it offered at the Syria peace talks in Vienna at the end of October 2015. That came as news to Bremmer, who noted he’s not surprised that the neurosurgeon flubbed a statement about foreign policy. Is it possible that some Chinese officials are in Syria discreetly? ""There are 1.3 billion Chinese, they're in a lot of places. China’s got an economic interest in Syria obviously, so would I be stunned that there were a couple of Chinese intelligence guys on the ground? No, but they're not playing a military role,"" Bremmer said. Our ruling Carson said the Chinese have a presence in Syria. In context, Carson’s comments suggested a military presence. That claim appears to be lifted from unconfirmed blog posts and a news report by a Lebanese news site. China and the White House have denied that Chinese troops are in Syria, and experts told us there’s no evidence to the contrary. Even if Carson meant something less than a military presence, China seems to be taking a hands-off approach to the conflict in Syria. We rate Carson’s claim False.

"['National', 'Financial Regulation', 'Carly Fiorina']","
Carly Fiorina says Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has 'no congressional oversight'
","During the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorina brought up an issue that delves deep into the weeds of the federal regulatory system. She took aim at the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by President Barack Obama that placed significant new regulations on the financial services sector. Fiorina called Dodd-Frank ""the classic of crony capitalism. The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we've created something called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud. This is how socialism starts, ladies and gentlemen. We must take our government back."" We wondered: Was Fiorina right that, unlike other federal regulatory agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has ""no congressional oversight""? We took a closer look. An unusual structure First, some background on the bureau. Its mission is to ""protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws."" This includes enforcing consumer financial protection laws, following up on consumer complaints, promoting financial education, conducting research on consumer behavior, and monitoring financial markets for risks. New agencies that seek to police well-established industries are often controversial, and the bureau is no different. Its champion was Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon who was considered the likely first head of the bureau until her appointment was effectively blocked by Republicans in Congress. Obama’s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a controversial recess appointment. Cordray was ultimately confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (The bureau declined to comment for this story. We did not hear back from Fiorina’s campaign.) Fiorina has a point that by Washington standards, the bureau is unusually unfettered by oversight, congressional and otherwise -- something specifically designed to limit any influence by the financial sector it oversees. Perhaps the clearest example of this long leash is that, unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. That means that Congress doesn’t approve the bureau’s budget every year. Instead, the bureau’s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve, currently capped at 12 percent of the Fed’s total operating expenses. This works out to about $600 million a year today. Those who are skeptical of the bureau say that seriously hampers Congress’ oversight ability. ""Oversight without any budget leverage has turned out to be completely hollow,"" said Todd J. Zywicki, executive director of the George Mason Law and Economics Center at George Mason University and a frequent commentator on the issue. Brenden D. Soucy, a Miami-based lawyer, wrote an article critical of the the bureau’s degree of congressional oversight in the Florida State University Law Review in 2013. He called the bureau ""the most independent agency in United States history."" ""The CFPB’s extreme independence is touted as one of its greatest virtues, but history has shown that while independence from political pressure can be a virtue, near total isolation is not,"" Soucy wrote. Congress does have some levers of influence So it’s clear that Congress lacks an important -- and perhaps the most important -- lever for allowing lawmakers to oversee and guide the agency. But does that really equal ""no congressional oversight""? Not really. Here are a number of ways in which Congress can oversee the bureau: • Congress can use legislation to change (or even abolish) the bureau. Indeed, there’s currently legislation in both chambers to enshrine a variety of transparency standards, some of which passed the House Financial Services Committee with bipartisan backing. • The Senate must confirm the head of the bureau. • The board’s director must testify at least twice a year before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; the House Financial Services Committee; and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bureau must also submit semi-annual budget justifications. • The bureau is subject to an annual financial audit by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional agency. Combined with other checks and balances by other parts of the executive branch and the judicial branch, this is a list of oversight mechanisms ""that will measure up against any regulatory agency in Washington,"" Warren, the bureau’s patron saint, wrote in an October 2015 op-ed. Other experts in government regulation and oversight don’t go this far -- but they add that Fiorina’s characterization is an exaggeration. ‘The CFPB has a lot longer leash that almost any other federal agency,"" said Donald F. Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But, he added, ""Congress did it on purpose. Congress can change it."" And Soucy, the lawyer who wrote critically of the lack of congressional oversight, agreed that Fiorina went too far with this statement. ""While the CFPB is nearly completely free of congressional oversight, it is not true to say that it has ‘no’ congressional oversight,"" he said. Our ruling Fiorina said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has ""no congressional oversight."" She has a point that where the bureau is concerned, lawmakers lack one of their strongest levers of influence -- the power of the purse. This makes it reasonable to say that the bureau has an unusually low amount of congressional oversight. However, ""low"" does not equal ""none."" Lawmakers are already flexing their muscles by advancing laws that would stiffen the bureau’s transparency rules, and the bureau’s Senate-confirmed director must testify and provide financial documentation at least twice a year to three separate congressional committees. The bureau must also be audited annually by an arm of Congress, the Government Accountability Office. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

Rubio claims North Korea has more than two dozen nuclear warheads
","Editor's note: An earlier version of this fact-check quoted Rubio as saying North Korea had ""over 2,000 nuclear warheads."" Rubio's campaign did not challenge that quote during the reporting of this fact-check. Shortly after the fact-check published, a Rubio spokesman said Rubio said North Korea possessed ""over two-dozen nuclear warheads."" As such, we have updated this fact-check and changed the rating to Half True. In a ""happy hour"" meet-and-greet at Bev’s on the River in Sioux City, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio rattled off a litany of international threats facing the United States. Topping that list was North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpile and the reclusive communist country’s potential for launching a nuclear missile at the United States. ""And then you look abroad, and you see a world that’s increasingly dangerous. You have a lunatic in North Korea,"" Rubio said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. ""A lunatic. Except he has over two-dozen nuclear warheads. And a long-range missile that can already reach the United States with that warhead on it."" So, the statement to be evaluated is: Does North Korea really have more than two-dozen nuclear weapons? The short answer is no, not quite. Numerous credible arms and security organizations estimate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal at six to 16 nuclear weapons. Even at the high side of those estimates, Rubio is overestimating the North Korean nuclear threat by about 50 percent. When asked for sources supporting Rubio's claim, his campaign provided a link to a story echoing that 16-warhead estimate but also noting a Chinese estimate of up to 20.  A wide consensus exists that North Korea has the capability to construct up to eight plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons. This view is shared by think tanks including the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Arms Control Association and the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute. Similarly, a 2013 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated that North Korea has enough plutonium for ""at least a half dozen"" weapons and the capability to produce another single ""bomb’s worth of plutonium per year."" Additionally, a report from the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies agrees with the estimate of eight plutonium bombs and adds that North Korea may also have enough uranium for four to eight more nuclear bombs. The Johns Hopkins paper goes on to project the potential growth of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. In its most aggressive prediction, the paper suggests the country could have 100 weapons by 2020. Rubio also claimed that North Korea has long-range missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to American shores. He's on firm ground there. Admiral Bill Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command told a Washington think tank last month that North Korea has the ability to miniaturize its nuclear weapons and place them on a missile that could reach the United States. That view is also reflected in the Johns Hopkins report and elsewhere. There are some caveats, though. According to another Johns Hopkins report, one intercontinental ballistic missile in North Korea’s arsenal, the Taepodong-2, is a ""militarized version"" of a rocket designed to launch satellites into space. It is believed to have a range that would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the continental United States. Three of the Taepodong-2’s four known test launches ended in failure. The re-entry vehicle necessary for deploying a nuclear weapon from the missile, moreover, is crude, inaccurate and has never been tested, according to the Johns Hopkins report.  Gortney, the NORAD commander, referred to another missile, the KN-08, which is believed to be capable of reaching targets on the West Coast of the United States. But it hasn't been flight tested and, like the Taepodong-2, is probably not accurate enough to reliably hit a target. Our ruling Rubio claimed that North Korea ""has over two-dozen nuclear warheads."" That overstates North Korea’s estimated nuclear arsenal by about 50 percent, but isn’t egregious given the relatively small numbers involved. (The U.S., by contrast, has more than 7,000 nukes.)  We rate Rubio’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/14/marco-rubio/rubio-north-korea-has-over-two-dozen-nukes/

Fox's Kelly miscasts Mizzou upheaval as work of a 'small group of angry black students'
","A heated debate over race has erupted on several college campuses. This prompted Fox News host Megyn Kelly to lead off her show Wednesday this way: ""What started as a campus protest in Missouri might be spreading to more colleges and universities as small groups of students use complaints about race and diversity in a big play to rewrite the rules for everyone,"" Kelly said on the Nov. 11, 2015, edition of The Kelly File. ""In a period of roughly 72 hours, a small group of angry black students managed to force the resignation of the two highest-ranking officials at that school, complaining they did not show enough concern about racial issues at the school."" There have been conflicting reports over what led Missouri University president Tim Wolfe and chancellor R. Bowen Loftin to step down Nov. 9. We thought it would help to examine Kelly’s summary that a small group of black students forced that much change in basically three days. The Fox News press office added some nuance to the short timeline Kelly cited. A spokesperson told us while tensions formed weeks ago, things came to a head in the three days before the resignations. Events did pile up quickly in the days before Nov. 9 but evidence coming out of Missouri paints a much more complicated picture than the one Kelly offered her viewers. Most importantly, Wolfe and Loftin fell for different reasons. Race relations were the dominant factor in Wolfe’s demise, but Loftin’s problems stemmed from a revolt among the university’s deans that peaked a month earlier.  It also seems that opposition to both men was broader than, as Kelly said, ""a small group of angry black students."" The standard (simple) storyline Fox News told us that a Google search pulled up more than 8,000 news articles about the role of the students in the resignations. The stories we read generally noted the same series of events leading up to the administrative shake-up at Mizzou. In mid September this year, the president of the Missouri Student Association wrote on Facebook that riders in a pick-up truck had repeatedly used a racial slur toward him. In early October, as a black student group rehearsed outdoors for a homecoming performance, a passing white student began using a racial slur. A few days later on Oct. 10, about a dozen black students surrounded the Missouri president’s vehicle demanding that he address racial tensions on campus. Roughly two weeks after that, feces smeared in the shape of a swastika appeared on a college dorm. No suspect was found. On Nov. 2, a black student started a hunger strike. On Nov. 7, a group of black players on Missouri’s football team announced they would neither practice nor play until Wolfe, the president, resigned. Missouri football coach Gary Pinkel tweeted his support for the players’ strike Nov. 8. On Nov. 9, both Wolfe and Loftin resigned. (Loftin said he would remain with the university in a different role.) It’s easy to understand why the downfall of the two men would merge in the public mind, but that doesn’t make it accurate. Loftin’s long decline It’s important to note that Loftin answered to Wolfe. As university president, Wolfe oversaw the entire university system. Loftin ran all of the academic divisions of the university, from the medical school, to the law school, to the college of arts and sciences, and more. You don’t have to look far to discover that Loftin’s relationship with large swaths of the university community was on the rocks for reasons having nothing to do with the bubbling racial tensions. In fact, nine of the university’s deans in charge of academic divisions asked for Loftin’s removal a month before he stepped down.(Interim and acting deans did not participate.) ""We said to the president on Oct. 9 that Loftin should go,"" Dave Kurpius, dean of the Journalism School told PunditFact. Kurpius said the deans repeated that demand to Wolfe at three meetings in early October. The morning Wolfe resigned in November, they had just sent a letter to Wolfe’s boss, the board of curators, calling for Loftin’s removal. That letter blamed Loftin for creating a ""toxic environment through threat, fear and intimidation."" Their specific issues involved his botched effort to eliminate graduate assistant health insurance and a total disregard for their roles as managers of their academic centers. Graduate students also had been opposing Loftin. Sarah Senff is co-chair of the Action Committee on the Forum on Graduate Rights. The group was formed in August after Loftin gave them less than a day’s notice that they would lose their health insurance assistance. After an outcry, Loftin reversed himself. ""I would vociferously deny that this happened in 72 hours or that this was just black students, "" Senff said. ""Particularly for Chancellor Loftin, there were numerous issues relating to his competence to lead the university."" Senff and other graduate student leaders we contacted cited a bevy of problems including cutbacks in aid for housing, childcare, and tuition waivers. They also rejected Loftin’s decision in September to sever ties with a Planned Parenthood clinic where medical and nursing students had been going to fulfill hands-on experience requirements. Senff said ""it has been a semester that has seen protest after protest from various groups."" The graduate students’ woes spilled over to the academic departments. William Kerwin is director of graduate studies at Missouri’s English department. On Nov. 3, the faculty voted to declare ""No confidence"" in Loftin. Their complaints mirrored those of the deans and graduate students. ""A whole host of issues were in play regarding Chancellor Loftin,"" Kerwin said, ""Yet the national narrative now sees his departure as driven by the same forces as ended President Wolfe’s tenure here."" It is not as though this story was unknown outside of Missouri. The day before Kelly’s show, the Wall Street Journal published an article with the headline Race Wasn’t the Only Issue at University of Missouri. Wolfe’s sudden demise University of Missouri insiders we contacted uniformly told us that race relations were the driving factor in Wolfe’s resignation. Several highlighted his refusal to engage with black students after the incidents in September and October. That precipitated the moment when a dozen activists surrounded his car at the October homecoming. When Wolfe told a group of black students on Nov. 7 that ""systematic oppression is because you don’t believe that you have the equal opportunity for success,"" the uproar only intensified. Eric Scott, a graduate student leader, said it’s accurate to say a core group of black students organized protests. But Smith, who is white, said that hardly captures the extent of the popular rejection of Wolfe. ""If we count all the people who have participated in their marches and demonstrations, there were hundreds of members,"" Smith said. ""Hardly a ‘small group of angry black students.’ "" Samuel Cohen is an associate English professor. He said Kelly had it right regarding the general role of the students and racial tensions. What she missed, he said, was the two or three months of growing frustration and the upswell of support for his ouster. The tipping point, Cohen said, was the football players ""who put their scholarships and careers on the line."" ""It is technically correct to say it was a small group of students, but if they had been protesting the campus smoking ban or the chancellor's twitter handle, it wouldn't have led anywhere."" he said. ""It had to be something important that many others saw as worth fighting against."" The others who joined in, Cohen said, included students, faculty and staff of many ethnicities. Our ruling Kelly said in a span of about three days, a small group of black students forced the resignations of two top administrators at the University of Missouri. Multiple press reports and interviews with members of the Mizzou community tell us Kelly’s shorthand falls short on several key points. Deans, graduate students, and faculty had been pressing for the ouster of Loftin for at least a month prior to his departure. It is no small matter for deans to make such a demand and they did so three times in early October. Loftin’s problems with the university community go back well into the beginning of the semester. There’s more support for the role of black students in the removal of Wolfe. The evidence tells us that pressure from black students was the driving force and the momentum shifted rapidly against him when a student went on a hunger strike on Nov. 2. However, anger had been growing since mid October and a much larger number of people from across the university community joined the call for Wolfe to step down. Kelly’s statement is only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/13/megyn-kelly/foxs-kelly-miscasts-mizzou-upheaval-work-small-gro/

Pro-Ted Cruz PAC says Cruz 'stopped' Obama push for gun control after Sandy Hook killings
","A group supporting Ted Cruz for president took a jab at another big-state Cuban American hopeful in a video ad that debuted before the Nov. 10, 2015, Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee. The 60-second spot from the Courageous Conservatives PAC suggests that unlike Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida doesn’t have a record to celebrate. The group is a super PAC, meaning it may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money from sources including corporations and unions to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. We noticed this pro-Cruz claim in its ad: ""After Sandy Hook, Ted Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws."" The ad’s reference to the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings at a Connecticut school drew a rebuke from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who said the ad made him want to throw up, according to a news story in the Hartford Courant. Murphy said: ""If Ted Cruz wants to brandish his pro-gun credentials to Republican primary voters, that's his right. But it's sick that he thinks he'll win votes by specifically pointing out that in the wake of 20 dead first-graders, he was the face of the fight to ensure no action was taken."" To be fair, Cruz doesn’t control the Courageous Conservatives PAC; that would be a legal no-no. Still, did Cruz stop Obama’s gun-control plans, as the group says? That seemed unlikely in that the Texan was only elected to the Senate a few weeks before a man entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 20 children and six adults, prompting calls for stiffer gun laws from President Barack Obama and others. We asked a PAC contact for its backup information. In a Facebook message, consultant Rick Shaftan said the ad was based on Cruz's comments in an Oct. 29, 2015, interview with Bret Baier, chief political anchor for Fox News. Cruz told Baier: ""Over two years ago, following the tragic shootings in Newtown, Conn., the Democrats came out with a massive raft of new gun control proposals. I led the opposition against it. … We defeated every one of those proposals on the floor of the Senate, defending the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."" Cruz opposed gun-control proposals To get a fix on Cruz’s role in the 2013 debate, we checked news accounts and the Congressional Record, which recaps each speech and floor vote. On Jan. 3, 2013, the day he was sworn in, Cruz hammered his opposition to gun-control proposals, saying the tragic school shootings didn’t justify efforts to curb Second Amendment rights. ""I think every parent who saw what happened in Newtown was understandably horrified,"" Cruz told reporters, but ""I also think, predictably and sadly, within minutes of that horrific crime we saw politicians out trying to exploit that tragedy and to push their gun control agenda."" About a week later, Cruz responded to Vice President Joe Biden’s vow that Obama would use executive action where he could to help stop gun violence. Cruz said on Facebook: ""Let us hope that this is just another one of the vice president's infamous gaffes and not another end-run of Congress and the constitutional balance of powers through unilateral action by the president. I stand ready to defend the Second Amendment and efforts to undermine our God-given rights."" Cruz subsequently stuck to his guns. At a Jan. 30, 2013, hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for instance, the former solicitor general of Texas urged members to ""be vigorous and unrelenting in working to prevent, to deter and to punish violent criminals. I have spent a substantial portion of my professional life working in law enforcement. And the tragedies that are inflicted on innocent Americans every day by criminals are heartbreaking, and we need to do more to prevent them. ""At the same time,"" Cruz said, ""I think we should remain vigilant in protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. And I think far too often, the approaches that have been suggested by this Congress to the issue of gun violence restricts the liberties of law-abiding citizens rather than targeting the violent criminals that we should be targeting."" On April 11, 2013, Cruz was on the losing end of a 68-31 Senate vote to let the body — which then had a Democratic majority — move toward considering a proposal to ""ensure that all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the national  instant criminal background check system and require a background check for every firearm sale."" Some 16 Republicans joined Democrats in agreeing to proceed. Six days later, though, the Senate blocked or defeated every major gun-control proposal championed by Obama, The Washington Post reported. A CNN news report said ""fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association led a backlash by conservative Republicans and a few Democrats from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package, even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents."" The failed proposals included attempts to ban certain military-style assault rifles and limit the size of ammunition magazines, the Post story said. ""But the biggest setback for the White House was the defeat of a measure to expand background checks to most gun sales,"" designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, the story said. The described proposal, presented by Sens. Joe  Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Penn., would have expanded criminal background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but did not require them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. It was seen as a compromise, replacing stricter language from Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Senators voted 54-46 to proceed, but that margin still left supporters short of the 60 votes needed to ward off a filibuster. It wasn’t an entirely partisan split; several Republicans voted to proceed, several Democrats voted ""no."" In other votes that day, the Post said, 40 senators supported a renewal of a federal assault-weapons ban and 46 supported limiting the size of ammunition magazines. In addition, an NRA-backed measure that clarified gun-trafficking laws fell short, with just 58 votes, stunning Democrats, the newspaper said. Afterward, Obama blamed the NRA for stoking unreasonable fears. He also laid the blame on Republicans, the Post reported. ""Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea, but it’s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans just voted against it,"" Obama said. Opponents maintained the Manchin-Toomey background check proposal eventually would have led to a national gun registry, though the proposal outlawed a federal registry. The opponents also said it would do little to prevent mass shootings while creating an imposition for law-abiding citizens, especially those in rural areas. The Post story quoted Cruz telling colleagues: ""My biggest concern with the legislation, the Democrat legislation on the floor, is it doesn’t address the problem. It doesn’t target violent criminals. Instead, what it does is, it targets law-abiding citizens."" An alternate approach Cruz was among the critical 46 ""no"" votes. He also separately joined Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in authoring a substitute proposal, reportedly supported by the NRA. At the substitute’s unveiling, according to a news story in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, Cruz said that while the Obama administration was continuing to ""politicize a terrible tragedy to push its anti-gun agenda, I am proud to stand beside my fellow senators to present common-sense measures."" The Grassley-Cruz alternative did not impose background checks on transactions at gun shows or on sales over the Internet. But it would have provided incentives for states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required federal courts to do so. It also would have allocated money for prosecuting violations of the background check requirement. In the Senate, the Grassley-Cruz proposal was favored 52-46, hence stalling out due to the 60-vote hurdle. Our ruling The pro-Cruz PAC said that after the Sandy Hook shootings, ""Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws."" Actually, Cruz had company in stopping the Obama-supported push for new restrictions. Crucially, most Senate Republicans and a few Democrats kept the expansion of background checks favored by Obama from winning further consideration. Still, we see an element of truth here. Despite just joining the Senate, Cruz frequently spoke out on the issue and shared authorship of an unsuccessful alternative to the failed background-check plan. We rate the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Clinton says most minimum-wage workers are women
","Hillary Clinton has been campaigning hard to win the votes of women nationwide. Recently, she made a bold statement on women in the working world.  In a Sept. 18 speech at a roundtable on women's economic security in Washington, she said women make up two-thirds of minimum wage workers. The former secretary of state went on to claim those women are left ""at the mercy of employers.""  ""Without equal pay, without flexibility or predictability at work, without access to quality, affordable childcare, without (the) ability to take a day off if your child or aging parent is sick, without paid family or medical leave,"" Clinton said. ""This woman is really on the brink.""  We wondered if her figures were right. Could women really make up that large a share of minimum wage workers?  A look at the numbers  We contacted the Clinton campaign, and it pointed to a report published by the National Women's Law Center in May 2015 for a bulk of its evidence. The report presents highlights and statistical tables describing minimum wage workers in 2014.  The report found that women represent close to but not quite two-thirds of minimum wage workers across the country, and at least half of minimum wage workers in every state. The center looked at unpublished U.S. Labor Department data for all wage and salary workers for 2014.  Estimates from the study put 1.9 million women workers at or below minimum wage out of 2.9 million total – about 62.7 percent – age 16 and older.  This represents an increase of 0.4 percent from 62.3 in 2013, the report said. When we went to the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics to verify the figures for ourselves, we found out that only 59 percent of workers actually making the federal minimum wage are women. That’s because some workers, like those who earn tips, can legally be paid a lower wage.  Clinton has stressed her proposals would also result in a raise for those tipped workers – such as restaurant servers and bartenders.  ""Women hold nearly three-quarters of the jobs that are reliant on tips,"" she said.  In addition, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour would leave a single mother below the poverty line. While 29 states and the District of Columbia currently have higher minimum wages, the center found that in every one of those states, the minimum wage leaves a full-time worker with two children near or below the poverty level.  But what does it mean?  Economists say the claim raises another question: Who will benefit if the minimum wage is increased?  Data from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, show that 55.9 percent of those who would receive a raise under Clinton’s proposal are women. That’s a solid majority, but well below two-thirds. Chris Tilly, director of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, said that makes Clinton’s statement misleading. University of Iowa Associate Professor of Political Science Timothy Hagle said that Clinton’s claim may fall under campaign hyperbole. He said the data used by the Clinton campaign is filled with qualifiers, such as ""about"" and ""nearly,"" that make it difficult to check concrete calculations. ""(The law center report) gives Clinton a bit of an out in that she can inflate her comment based on this data,"" Hagle said. ""Rather than that of some other entity."" Our ruling  Clinton said, ""Women hold two-thirds of minimum wage jobs.""  Her campaign referred us to a credible May 2015 study that supports her claim. According to the study, 62.7 percent of minimum wage workers age 16 and older are women.  That’s almost, but not quite, two thirds. In addition, that study ignored complexities like minimum wage workers in places that have a higher wage already and who would benefit from changes relating to tips. Clinton is largely on point with her numbers. We rate her claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2015/nov/13/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-most-minimum-wage-workers-are-women/

PAC supporting Ted Cruz says when Marco Rubio tried to 'push amnesty,' Cruz stopped him
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s leadership role on a 2013 bill to change immigration laws continues to draw fire for him in the GOP presidential primary. The Courageous Conservatives PAC, which supports U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, has attacked Rubio’s position in a radio ad in Iowa: ""We all loved how Marco Rubio took apart Jeb Bush in the debate. Wasn’t it great? But what’s Rubio ever done? Anything? Other than his Gang of Eight Amnesty bill, can anyone think of anything Marco Rubio’s ever done? Anything at all besides amnesty?"" says the narrator who then switches to praise Cruz. ""When Chuck Schumer and Marco Rubio tried to push amnesty, it was Ted Cruz who stopped them."" We decided to research Cruz’s role in the death of Rubio’s bill, and we’ll explain the problems with labeling it as ""amnesty."" Both Rubio, of Florida, and Cruz, of Texas, are freshmen senators with Cuban roots who represent states with large Hispanic populations. (Rubio was elected in 2010, while Cruz was elected in 2012.) But the two disagreed over the 2013 immigration bill, and now both are running for president. We found that while Cruz was a vocal opponent of the bill, he can’t take credit for its death in the House. Immigration bills and amnesty So was the 2013 bill amnesty? As we have noted before, ""amnesty"" is tricky to define. When Rubio characterized the bill as ""not amnesty"" in 2013, we rated that claim Half True. One standard for defining amnesty in recent decades has been the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 signed by President Ronald Reagan. That law said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by 1982, and met other minimal requirements such as paying a $185 fine and back taxes and demonstrating ""good moral character."" The law was widely described as amnesty, both at the time and later. But the 2013 bill had far tougher requirements than the 1986 bill, which is why it’s not a convincing case that it is amnesty, although it has elements of it. In 2013, Rubio and seven other senators dubbed the Gang of Eight crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The bill required more border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status -- and that path had significant hurdles, including paying fines, undergoing background checks and waiting periods. If they met that criteria, they could seek ""registered provisional immigrant status,"" and after 10 years, they could seek a green card. House leadership refused to bring the bill to a vote, and it died. (Rubio still supports changing immigration laws but now calls for a piecemeal approach.) What was Cruz’s role in the immigration bill? We reached out to the pro-Cruz PAC to ask for the back-up to their ad. The super PAC was formed in September and over two weeks that month raised $5,000 from a single donor -- Christopher Ekstrom, a self-employed investor in Dallas. The PAC has now raised a total of around $30,000, said Rick Shaftan, a consultant to the PAC told PolitiFact. (He also bashed another pro-Cruz super PAC for ads he described as ""boring crap."") In a Facebook message Shaftan said the ad was based on Cruz's comments in an Oct. 29, 2015, interview with Bret Baier, chief political anchor for Fox News. ""I led the fight against Obama’s amnesty, against the Gang of Eight bill, which was championed by Barack Obama, by Chuck Schumer, and Marco Rubio,"" Cruz said, referring to the New York Democratic Senator who was part of the Gang of Eight along with Rubio. ""And I led the fight, standing side by side with (Alabama Sen.) Jeff Sessions, and we defeated it in Congress. Amnesty did not pass."" (Obama’s amnesty refers to the plan Obama unveiled at the end of 2014 to prevent deportations for millions of people.) We also reached out to spokespersons for Cruz’s Senate office and presidential campaign office, as well as for Rubio’s campaign, and did not get a response. We found that Cruz spoke out against the bill often in press releases, on the Senate floor, before the Senate judiciary committee on which he serves and in media interviews. He proposed amendments to triple border security, among other changes. The bill passed the Senate 68-32 on June 27, 2013, with 52 Democratic votes, 14 Republican votes and two independents. Cruz voted against it. Cruz continued to criticize the bill after the Senate vote -- but so did other lawmakers, including Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. In November 2013, Speaker of the House John Boehner said that the House would not hold talks with the Senate on the bill and preferred a piecemeal approach signaling the death of the bill for the year -- and as it turned out, beyond that, too. In 2014, Politico wrote a post-mortem explaining why immigration reform died, noting that House and Senate staffers for lawmakers opposed to the bill met together to strategize. ""Sessions and Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) were the most active senators, while Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) played supporting roles,"" the article stated. But even without the Senate agitators, there were conservatives in the House who were also vocal about opposing the bill. Because of that opposition, the bill never came up for a vote. Our ruling A super PAC supporting Cruz said in a radio ad, ""When Chuck Schumer and Marco Rubio tried to push amnesty, it was Ted Cruz who stopped them."" Whether you consider the bill ""amnesty"" or not -- and there are arguments that it is not -- Cruz was one of 32 senators who voted against the bill. The bill actually passed in the Senate. Cruz did speak against the bill leading up to the Senate vote and after, but we found no evidence that he should get credit for stopping the bill from reaching a vote in the House. During the summer of 2013, Cruz was one of many voices in the Senate opposed to the bill. It was House Republicans who blocked the bill, and they were already calling for its defeat. So Cruz was one voice against the bill out of many, and it's not at all clear that his voice was a decisive one.

Is Georgia tax-friendly state for retirees?
","State tax breaks on retirement income from pensions and investments are saving older Georgians about $864 million this year. They also may be adding to the Peach State’s appeal. ""Georgia is one of the 10 most tax-friendly states for retirees,"" Kiplinger.com, publishers of personal finance advice and business forecasts, said in a press release on Monday, October 26th. We know how the state loves a rosy ranking. Remember Gov. Nathan Deal appearing gleeful when, running for re-election campaign, he could point to Georgia’s naming by Site Selection magazine as the nation’s No. 1 state for business climate? Seeing the Kiplinger rankings we wondered: Is the Peach State really giving money-conscious retirees a reason to feel all warm and fuzzy? We decided to check. Kiplinger.com actually says Georgia ranks as the fifth most-friendly tax state behind Alaska, Wyoming, Nevada and Mississippi and immediately ahead of Delaware, Arizona, Louisiana, South Dakota and Florida. Several state tax policies factored into that ranking, including Georgia’s exemptions from estate, inheritance and Social Security taxes, as well as its 4 percent statewide sales tax. Also cited was the state income tax break we mentioned earlier. This exclusion allows a retiree who is 65 year or older to shield from state income taxes up to $65,000 in pension or investment income a year if single, $130,00 a year if married. It helps younger retirees -- ages 62 to 64 -- too. They are exempt from state income tax on as much as $35,000 of most types of retirement income, $4,000 in wages Retirement income includes interest, dividends, net income from rental property, capital gains, royalties, pensions, annuities and the first $4,000 of earned income, such as wages. By comparison, Kiplinger picked Alaska as true tax haven for retirees. Alaskans pay no state income or state sales taxes. Each permanent Alaska resident receives an annual dividend check from the state’s oil wealth savings account. In 2014, the dividend check was $1,884. Real estate is taxed in Alaska, but homeowners 65 and older, or surviving spouses 60 and older, are exempt from municipal taxes on the first $150,000 of the assessed Georgia’s been helping seniors for years In his eight years in office, Gov. Sonny Perdue persuaded lawmakers to cut and eventually eliminate the state income tax on retirement income. Perdue and supporters hoped the move would attract well-to-do retirees to Georgia and away from states, such as Florida, where there is no state income tax. Having 750,000 retirees on his side -- always a powerful voting block -- didn’t hurt. But in 2012, lawmakers decided it would be too costly to go through with Perdue’s plan to wipe out state income taxes for retirees, arguably one of his greatest legacies They settled on the current cap and pushed it through as part of the Georgia Jobs and Family Tax Reform Plan of 2012. Even reduced, it ""is one of Georgia’s largest tax exemptions,"" Wesley Tharpe, senior policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute said.""It is a very expensive proposition for the state."" Seniors definitely get a good deal in Georgia, especially wealthy retirees with pensions and IRAs, Tharpe said. The exclusion is structured so the benefits ""disproportionately go to wealthy retirees,"" he said. The higher income earners, he said, can draw $60,000 from an IRA in a year and not face any state income tax on that money. But a person trying to supplement his or her Social Security by taking a $10,000-a-year job is only sheltered from state income taxes on the first $4,000 of earnings and has to pay on the other $6,000 in wages, Tharpe said. But does Georgia really have the nation's fifth friendliest tax policy for retirees? On the rankings Norton Francis, a senior research associate with the Urban Institute’s State and Local Finance Initiative, said the ranking is likely ""pretty much true,"" largely because of Georgia's generous pension exemption. But both he and Carl Davis, research director with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said they questioned whether the Kiplinger rankings took into account that local governments in Georgia can levy up to a 4 percent sales tax, including on groceries. Davis said those taxes on groceries could be more significant to seniors than the state's estate tax exemption. He also expressed concern that the most-to-least rankings ignore the diverse nature of retirees. "" A low-income senior living on Social Security is impacted by state and local taxes in a very different way than a middle-income person collecting a pension or a very high-income person living off their investments,"" Davis said. Kiplinger, he said, appeared to have used a subjective process to evaluate the states, something Sandra Block, senior associate editor at Kiplinger’s Personal Finance acknowledged. ""The fact that they did not assign formal weights to different tax parameters is problematic and makes a full review of their rankings impossible,"" Davis said. Block said it’s ""precisely because retirees are a very diverse group that we’re reluctant to assign weights to different types of taxes. "" Instead, we try to provide as much information as we can on the taxes most seniors pay so that individuals can draw their own conclusions,"" Block said. Francis and Davis said state tax policies aren’t likely to be a retiree’s primary consideration in deciding where to live. ""Other things are going to matter more -- chiefly housing and energy costs,"" Davis said, adding that those are likely a retirees’ two biggest expenses. Several studies have examined whether these tax breaks motivate senior citizens to relocate. One study, in 2012 by University of New Hampshire economist Karen Smith Conway, found  ""no credible effect of state income tax breaks on elderly migration."" Conway said the research ""should give pause to those who justify offering state tax breaks to the elderly as an effective way to attract and retain the elderly."" Our ruling: Kiplinger.com, publishers of personal finance advice and business forecasts, said Georgia is one of the 10 most tax-friendly states for retirees. Georgia actually placed 5th on its list, although the ranking doesn’t appear to take into account local sales taxes. Georgia’s tax breaks also do more for higher income retirees than for those in the middle and lower ranks. That’s  important context the reader needs.

Trump says China gets an advantage from the Trans-Pacific Partnership
","Donald Trump likes to talk about how China takes advantage of the United States economy, so it wasn’t surprising to see him bring up the People’s Republic at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee. When asked a question about the recently released Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, Trump took to bashing China. ""The TPP is horrible deal,"" Trump said. ""It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone."" ""If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States -- China in particular, because they're so good. It's the No. 1 abuser of this country,"" Trump said. ""And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement."" There’s just one problem with Trump’s rant on China, as Sen. Rand Paul emphatically pointed out at the debate: China isn’t actually a part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. To give Trump the benefit of the doubt, we asked some experts if there is any way China could benefit ""through the back door"" from the TPP. The short answer: no. An overview of the TPP While you could read the entire trade deal in full, as Trump correctly points out, it’s more than 6,000 pages long. Here’s a quick summary, and you can check out a more detailed guide on Vox: The TPP involves 12 countries: the United States, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam. The deal is meant to reduce trade barriers between these countries by lowering tariffs on goods, coordinating regulations and more. The deal could also ""provide stronger legal protections to drug companies, lengthen the term of copyright protection, give foreign investors a new way to challenge countries' laws and regulations, and much more,"" according to Vox. In June, Congress authorized ""fast-track"" authority for President Obama, meaning Congress will promptly approve or disapprove the agreement Obama has negotiated -- there will be no amendments or filibusters. A vote is expected in 2016. The deal was negotiated in secret before being released to the public. Again, we should make it clear: China was in no way involved in TPP negotiations. Can China somehow benefit? We asked experts if there was any way China could possibly take advantage of the TPP. The experts all agreed: The trade deal will most likely negatively impact China. Joel P. Trachtman, an international law professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said the deal ""would mean there would be zero tariffs on goods coming to the United States from places that compete with China.""

""It certainly wouldn’t be expected to help China,"" he said. The only way China might benefit, Trachtman said, is if it has investments in any of the countries involved in the deal. For example, if China has invested in plants in Vietnam, they might become more valuable to China; however, the benefits of those investments would be ""small and rather insignificant."" Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow in trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, said Trump’s assertion that China continuously manipulates its currency is completely off-base. ""Some people are all wrapped up in this issue of currency manipulation. I don’t think that’s applicable to the Chinese,"" Pearson said. ""It was never clear to me that China artificially lowered the value of its currency to gain an export advantage (in the past)."" We should also note that the TPP actually does mention currency manipulation. A side agreement in the trade deal -- separate from the 6,000 page main text -- says the 12 countries involved agree not to artificially deflate the value of their currencies. However, there is no enforceability provision -- meaning the clause is more of an honor code than a strict regulation. ""There aren't many economists who would be comfortable with an enforceable currency manipulation clause,"" says Emily J. Blanchard, an associate professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. ""A binding currency provision would tie policy makers' hands at precisely the wrong time: when a central bank-- like the U.S. Federal Reserve--  needs to respond to a downturn in the local economy."" The only way China could benefit from the TPP, Pearson said, is if it experiences the ""spillover benefits"" of increased trading between the 12 countries involved in the TPP. ""There is some possibility that there will be trade diversion away from China and more trade between other TPP member countries,"" Pearson said. ""That’s a potential negative. However, that may be entirely offset by the greater level of economic activity that we should expect to see in the TPP member countries."" Blanchard said she finds it ""highly implausible"" that China would benefit from the TPP. If it does, as Pearson suggests, so would the rest of the countries involved in the agreement. ""TPP is going to encourage greater trade integration among its signatories in Southeast Asia and beyond,"" she said. ""That will inevitably suck some of the oxygen out of China’s local economy, as supply chains reorient toward other TPP countries, including the U.S."" To Trump’s assertion that the trade deal was designed for China’s benefit, experts say it’s actually the opposite. While Blanchard said experts are reluctant to suggest the agreement is a way of taking a shot at China, the TPP does allow the United States to shape trade practices in the Pacific before China can. ""If TPP passes, its enforceable labor and environmental provisions, curbs on state-owned enterprises, strong (intellectual property) laws, and transparency requirements will redefine the rules of the road in global trade agreements,"" she said. ""This is definitely not the same rulebook that China would have written."" All three experts agreed that China could try and join the TPP in the future, but it first has to meet the requirements laid out in the agreement -- something we shouldn’t expect to happen any time soon. China joining the TPP ""would require further evolution of the Chinese economy to be more open and transparent,"" Pearson said. ""It would definitely be good for the Chinese once they are able to join, but frankly, that would also be good for the United States."" In the days after the debate, Trump was asked if he knew that China was not part of the trade deal. Trump said he did and repeated his claim that China could benefit. But he still didn’t explain how that would actually work. ""Well, I know that China is not in the deal,"" Trump said. ""And if they look at speeches they will see I talk about it all the time, this deal is going to be a great deal for China. It is going to be unbelievable because China is going to come in through the backdoor, and that is what I said. They are going to come in later through the backdoor and they will take advantage of what all of these other people were negotiating, and the Wall Street Journal does a big editorial that I didn't know about China."" Our ruling  Trump said the Trans Pacific Partnership ""was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone."" Not only is China not a part of the TPP, but the experts we talked to all agreed: The TPP isn’t exciting news for China. There’s a chance that China could join the TPP down the line, but not without robust changes to its economy. Until then, China doesn’t stand to gain much from having trade diverted to other countries. Trump can’t blame everything on China.

Marco Rubio proposes $1 trillion boosts in welfare and defense, GOP White House rival Rand Paul says
","The word conservative was uttered 18 times during the Fox Business News Republican presidential debate on Nov. 10, 2015. The first 17 references made in the Milwaukee Theatre were done with particular emphasis by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. (Ohio Gov. John Kasich used the word once.) Paul called himself the only fiscal conservative among the eight candidates on stage -- and made a point to contrast himself with U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, in one of the more contentious exchanges of the night. Rubio had just defended his proposal to increase a child tax credit when Paul interjected. ""We have to decide what is conservative and what isn't conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We're not talking about giving people back their tax money. He's talking about giving people money they didn't pay. It's a welfare transfer payment,"" Paul said of Rubio’s tax credit plan. ""So, here's what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments -- a new welfare program that's a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco's plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative."" Defending the tax credit and his defense spending proposals, Rubio said ""the family is the most important institution in society and ""the world is a stronger and a better place when the United States is the strongest military power in the world."" But is Rubio proposing a new $1 trillion ""welfare program"" and ""$1 trillion in new military spending""? And $1 trillion over what period of time? Tax credit Rubio’s tax plan includes creating a new, partially refundable child tax credit of up to $2,500 per child. It is meant to offset income and payroll taxes and is considerably larger than the $1,000 credit that is currently available. Refundable tax credits help people at the lower end of the income scale, in that people who are too poor to pay any income tax can get money back from the government. Paul’s campaign referred us to a March 2015 analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation of a tax plan proposed in the Senate by Rubio and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. That analysis estimated the credit would result in a loss of tax revenue of about $170 billion per year. That’s the equivalent of $1.7 trillion over 10 years -- 10 years being a common time frame for federal budget planning. But it’s worth noting that Paul didn’t say 10 years in making his claim. We’ll note that, unlike the original Rubio-Lee plan, Rubio as a candidate is proposing that the credit would be phased out at higher income levels --  beginning at $150,000 for an individual and $300,000 for a family. That would mean the lost revenue would be something less than $1.7 trillion over 10 years, but still well above $1 trillion, said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a free market-oriented think tank. That’s because relatively few people at the higher incomes have children and would be eligible for the tax credits, he told us. In other words, the tax credit is expensive, Pomerlau said, because ""it’s large and nearly universal for families."" The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, also did an estimate of the original tax credit proposal and came up with a figure similar to that of the Tax Foundation -- an estimated loss of nearly $1.58 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years. Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us the center hasn't analyzed Rubio's current proposal. But he said a loss of $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years is a fair estimate. Paul’s characterization of Rubio’s tax credit as welfare is a stretch, however. Eleanor May, Paul’s campaign spokeswoman, said ""giving people a refundable credit -- meaning, giving them more than they paid"" is a ""welfare transfer payment from one group of people to another.""   But as our colleagues at PunditFact noted, even the most expansive definition of welfare --  including the cash program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (formerly known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children), traditional food stamps, Medicaid and the food program called Women, Infants and Children -- doesn’t include tax credits. Rubio, whose campaign did not respond to our requests for this article, noted in the debate that everyone who works pays the payroll tax. Defense spending Rubio has backed more defense spending since at least March 2015, when he and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced a budget amendment to increase the Pentagon’s budget. At the time, Rubio argued that adjusted for inflation, defense spending had declined by 21 percent since 2010 -- a claim PolitiFact National rated Mostly True. Rubio’s amendment proposed restoring defense spending levels to what had been proposed in the spring of 2011, for fiscal 2012 going forward, by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Gates’ proposal was prior to spending limits that were imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which became law in the summer of 2011. Returning to the so-called 2012 proposed spending levels would add $1 trillion in defense spending over 10 years, Benjamin Friedman, a defense research fellow at the liberatrian Cato Institute, told us. That is also the estimate made in a July 2015 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The morning after the Milwaukee debate, Rubio was asked in a Fox News interview: ""So, where are you going to get the trillion dollars from that Rand Paul says we shouldn’t be spending?"" Rubio didn’t address the figure, saying: ""First of all, before we fund anything, the federal government should be fully funding national security."" But he has made references to the $1 trillion cost in the past. In a September 2014 speech, Rubio said he agreed with a recommendation by the bipartisan National Defense Panel to return to the 2012-level spending, ""which we are on track to be around $1 trillion short of through fiscal year 2022."" And on his campaign website, Rubio says he would restore defense spending to the 2012 level, ""and begin to undo the damage caused by $1 trillion in indiscriminate defense cuts."" Our rating Paul said Rubio is proposing a new $1 trillion ""welfare program"" and ""$1 trillion in new military spending."" It’s estimated that over 10 years, a common time frame for federal budget planning, Rubio’s child tax credit would result in the loss of $1 trillion in tax revenue; and his plan to reverse declines in Pentagon spending would cost $1 trillion. But it’s a stretch to call the tax credit welfare and in making his claim, Paul didn’t state that the $1 trillion costs would be over 10 years. We rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.

There is ample evidence that the coronavirus is real and infecting hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Scientists have traced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 to Hubei Province, China, in November. Several news outlets covered the subsequent outbreak in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. From there, the coronavirus spread to more than 100 countries around the world. As of March 19, more than 191,000 people had been infected and 7,807 had been killed by the virus, according to the World Health Organization.

Stock market record point rise followed record point drop
","President Donald Trump bragged that his March 13, 2020, statements about coronavirus had record-breaking influence on the stock market. Wearing a baseball hat with ""USA"" emblazoned on the front, Trump told reporters gathered at the White House a day later on March 14, 2020: ""I was honored to see that the stock market — you were mostly there with us — set a record in a short period of time, over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden. That was a record; all-time record. I think we should do one of them every day, perhaps. How about five times a day? We’ll do one five times a day. But that was something to watch and — I had no idea. We walked back, I said, ‘So, how did that work out?’ They said, ‘Sir, you just set a new record in the history of the stock market.’ So, that was pretty good."" The market did make a record surge on March 13, 2020, and the surge accelerated during Trump’s news conference that afternoon.  But that record came a day after the steepest decline ever. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most popular measure of the stock market, gained 1,985 points on Friday, March 13. That was its biggest point gain ever, with the ""late-day surge"" coming ""while Trump was speaking,"" the Associated Press reported. The business and financial news network CNBC and other news organizations reported the same. In his remarks, Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, announced greater availability of testing in the coming days and announced the purchase of oil for the strategic petroleum reserve — steps that may have helped lift the Dow. His Rose Garden news conference started at 3:30 p.m. EDT and lasted an hour and 11 minutes, including remarks given by members of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force. At the start of the speech, the Dow was at 21,747.52. By the market’s close at 4 p.m., while Trump’s news conference was continuing, it was at 23,175.92, for a gain of 1,428 points over the course of the speech. That gain itself was larger than the previous record for the largest point gain in a day — 1,293.96 points on March 2, 2020. ""Stocks rallied, shooting sharply upward in the last half-hour of trading as investors appeared to gain confidence that the Trump administration has a plan to combat the outbreak from both a health care and economic perspective,"" AP reported. But that upward acceleration followed a record decline, as news organizations also reported. As Barron’s put it: ""The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 10% on Thursday, marking its biggest one-day percentage (and point) drop since the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987."" The rally ""only recovered most of the losses suffered a day earlier,"" MarketWatch reported, adding that the Dow is ""in a bear market."" It’s also worth noting that those gains were fleeting. The increases of March 13 were wiped out by the next trading day, Monday, March 16, when the Dow dropped like a rock and opened 2,240 points down at 20,935.70 and then fell another 248 points by the market’s close. Such sharp rises and declines are common during times of stress in the economy. ""One good day was really more of a dead-cat bounce, as the market fell still further after that,"" Tulane University business professor Peter Ricchiuti told PolitiFact. ""Also, the stock market is not the economy. It’s a measure of projected corporate profits. Very different things."" Kathleen Day, lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School and author of a book on financial crises, said in an interview: ""The big picture here is the stock market is gyrating. It’s unstable because of the virus itself and because of the lack of leadership (from Trump). The market wouldn’t have gone up so much if it hadn’t gone down so much."" The White House didn’t respond to our requests for information. Trump didn’t specify what type of record was set, but a point gain is one  legitimate measure. At the same time, large point gains and declines are natural when the Dow is at a high number. The index was marching toward 30,000 just a few weeks earlier. Stock watchers pay more attention to percentage changes on a given day or over time as a sign of the market’s strength. On that score, the gain for the day of Trump’s news conference was the largest percentage increase since October 2008. Trump said that ""over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference"" on the coronavirus on March 13, 2020, the stock market set ""an all-time record."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its largest-ever point gain on March 13, with gains accelerating during Trump’s news conference.

Former Sheriff David Clarke rants coronavirus is just “the damn flu” (it's not)
","David A. Clarke, the outspoken former sheriff of Milwaukee County, says he is leaving Twitter. If that’s true, he sure went out with a bang. Clarke put the nation’s coronavirus response on blast with a barrage of tweets on March 15, 2020, some of which were later removed by Twitter. Among them: He urged people to ""go out into the streets"" and demand that schools reopen and government stop exerting such ""control over our lives."" He said the coronavirus is ""an orchestrated attempt to destroy capitalism."" He insisted — without any evidence — that George Soros, a prominent backer of liberal causes, is ""somewhere involved in this."" Whew. There’s plenty of potential Pants on Fire ratings to be had from the Stetson-wearing controversy-magnet, but we’re going to focus on a fourth, since-deleted tweet.  Here’s the full text (minus a few choice words): ""I am tired of all this, ‘We have to err on the side of caution’ (expletive). We have to get back to reasonableness dammit. It’s the damn flu. Stop being afraid and start being sensible. Wash your (expletive) hands! Stop buying toilet paper. Do you (expletive) hear me????"" Clarke stepped down as sheriff in 2017 after 15 years as the county’s top cop, saying he was leaving to take a high-ranking post in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — a job that never materialized. In the time since, Clarke has also lost posts at a pro-President Trump super PAC and as a regular contributor on Fox News. Now he’s using his free time to make the case everyone is being unreasonable because this is just ""the damn flu."" Let’s break it down. Coronavirus and the flu are both viruses, and experts say they have some shared characteristics: Risk factors — The groups of people at highest risk are similar, including the elderly. Spread — Both diseases spread from person to person through respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes (though it’s possible coronavirus lingers in the air longer after the sick person has left). Prevention — The expert advice is similar: wash your hands, don’t touch your face, stay away from people who are sick and stay home if you are sick. Symptoms — Both cause fever, cough, body aches and fatigue, though coronavirus is more likely to cause shortness of breath. Treatment —  Neither virus is treatable with antibiotics (those only work on bacterial infections). The diseases have some critical differences, most importantly the death rate and lack of a vaccine. Based on the current numbers, someone with COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus — is 23 to 68 times more likely to die than someone who contracts the flu, based on the latest data from the World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccine — A flu vaccine is available and effective to prevent the flu, or at least reduce its severity. A coronavirus vaccine is not yet available, and likely won’t be for at least a year. Treatment — There are antiviral medications that address flu symptoms and can even shorten the duration of the illness, but such medications are still being tested for coronavirus. Death rate — The fatality rate for this year’s flu is estimated by the CDC  at between 0.05% and 0.1% in the United States. The coronavirus fatality rate was estimated at 2.3% of those infected by China’s CDC and 3.4% by the World Health Organization (though many expect that to fall to the 1-2% range once we know more about how many people have been infected). Infections — Coronavirus has, so far, infected far fewer people. There were about 3,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. when Clarke tweeted, compared to an estimated 36 million to 51 million flu illnesses this season. Knowledge and research — Scientists know much more about the flu, such as details on how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms and treatment. Such details on coronavirus remain a point of debate. All this to say, the CDC and other health officials have made it clear coronavirus presents a litany of risks the standard flu does not. The overwhelmed health care systems in first China, then Italy reinforced the severity of the disease and the breadth of its potential impact here. And the reaction of government alone — closing schools, bars, restaurants and more — makes it clear there is a stark difference between the two. Ranting against those who would ""err on the side of caution,"" Clarke claimed coronavirus is just the ""damn flu."" There is indeed overlap in some basic areas — what symptoms it causes, how it is spread, who is most at risk, etc. But those pale in light of the stark differences. There is no vaccine for coronavirus. Treatment approaches are not as well established. And most critically, someone who contracts COVID-19 is at least 20 times more likely to die of the disease than someone with the flu, based on the best available data. The overall theme from Clarke’s tweetstorm was that the coronavirus is no big deal — that the disease is just the same old flu virus with a heaping spoonful of government overreach. That flies in the face of lots of established science, as well as what nations like China and Italy have already experienced.

Was the novel coronavirus really sneaky in its spread to the U.S.? Experts say no
","Unveiling a series of policies meant to mitigate the threat of COVID-19, President Donald Trump also sought to respond to criticisms that his administration has been slow to deal with what is now a worldwide pandemic. In particular, the president defended his administration on the issue of insufficient testing resources and what experts say is a looming shortage of medical equipment and personnel. His argument? No one saw this coming. ""It snuck up on us,"" Trump said at a March 18 media briefing. Later, he added that the virus is ""a very unforeseen thing."" Trump has repeated that idea a lot lately. But the claim doesn’t square with the evidence. Public health researchers have been warning for years about the threat of a pandemic. And members of his administration have been sounding the alarm for months now – even while, just earlier this month, Trump was still comparing the virus’ severity to the flu, and arguing that it ""will go away"" if people ""stay calm."" We contacted the White House, which declined to comment on the record. Meanwhile, independent experts told us this claim is deeply misleading. Both in Washington and internationally, health officials had been warning about the dangers posed by COVID-19 since at least January, with some early signals going back as far as December when the illness emerged in the Wuhan province of China. Those warnings continued into February, well before the White House began taking serious steps to increase testing and treatment efforts – a delay that experts said has significantly undermined the national response. Indeed, by mid January, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told the president that the virus – which had already spread through China – could pose a threat domestically, too, according to reporting by The New York Times, Washington Post and Politico. Then, by the end of the month, Azar had declared it a ""public health emergency"" in the United States. According to the Times report, Dr. Robert Redfield, who heads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had also by that point realized ""that it had a great ability to go global."" ""The alarm was sounded in January,"" said Jennifer Kates, a global health expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""This wasn’t a surprise."" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) At that point, researchers told us, decisive and widespread federal action could have made a big difference. But publicly, Trump was still comparing the virus to the flu, downplaying the risk on Twitter and television, and declaring repeatedly that the virus was under control. Warnings from others continued. On Feb. 25, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who runs CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, also highlighted the risk the virus would pose. And of course, the coronavirus warnings didn’t just come from Washington. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared the virus a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"" citing its rapid spread since December, when it first emerged in China. In doing so, ""we were alerting all countries of very real threat of international spread,"" said Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson. By Feb. 24, WHO had told reporters that the virus had a real risk of becoming a global pandemic, and warned that all countries should be prepared. The weeks-long gaps between those warnings and federal efforts to actually test for coronavirus, and to treat it, matter greatly, Kates said. ""It was very visible what was happening and what measures we should be taking,"" she told us. Had the White House acted earlier, in particular by stepping up efforts to test for the virus and isolate cases immediately, the virus may not have spread as quickly, global health experts said. The ongoing efforts to ""socially distance"" even people without symptoms – which have large economic and health downsides, are less effective and less enforceable, researchers told us – wouldn’t be as necessary as they are now. ""Delays of days here matter. When we start throwing away weeks, we really change what’s possible,"" said Christopher Mores, a global health professor at George Washington University. ""If we had done a little more of anything, we would find ourselves in a better situation than where we are right now."" Meanwhile, people in public health and national security had been warning for years about a looming pandemic – and noting that the United States wasn’t adequately prepared for the devastation it could wreak on both citizens’ health and the economy. The only details missing were what pandemic and when precisely it would strike. ""Public health experts have been shouting that a major pandemic is likely and, in fact, is the greatest security threat we face,"" said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University who studies public health law. As for claims that something like COVID-19 ""snuck up on us"" or was ""very unforeseen""? ""It is simply astonishing and simply untrue,"" he said. Researchers pointed us to countless reports – including some by government officials – that highlighted the threat of a pandemic. In May 2018, researchers at Johns Hopkins University put out a paper warning that respiratory viruses posed a ""global catastrophic biological risk."" In particular, the researchers warned about RNA viruses -- viruses made up of the traditionally single-stranded ribonucleic acid, and also cause illnesses such as the common cold, influenza, hepatitis C and polio. Their warning wasn’t off: COVID-19 is indeed a respiratory illness caused by an RNA virus, from the same specific viral family -- that is, the coronavirus family -- as SARS and MERS. Then, in October 2019, the World Economic Forum, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted an event to discuss how public and private interests would have to respond in the event of a pandemic. That was only one of many such ""simulations"" run by health experts concerned about how the U.S. would respond to a looming pandemic threat. ""Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global—a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,"" read the event description. And months later, in Jan. 2019 – more than a year before the president’s advisers sounded the coronavirus alarm – the topic of a global pandemic emerged again, in a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. ""We assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support,"" reads the report. In fact, the report suggested animal-to-human transmission as a source for the next major pandemic – which, experts say, is in fact how COVID-19 emerged. And, finally, reporting from Politico shows that, when Trump entered office, members of the Obama administration warned about the threat of a looming viral pandemic – and noted that, if it occurred, the nation didn’t have the medical resources to handle it. ""Many people saw this coming, although, of course, it was not known exactly when,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Put another way: Experts have been talking about the need for pandemic preparedness, Mores recalled, for at least as long as he has been studying global health. He’s been in the field for 25 years. President Donald Trump said COVID-19 ""snuck up on us,"" and was ""a very unforeseen thing."" In fact, the president heard warnings about this specific virus from his advisers and the global health community for months. And public health and national security experts had been highlighting the risks for even longer about the threat of some kind of pandemic – even if the details weren’t yet known. Indeed, it is because of Trump’s slow response to the pandemic that ""social distancing"" is now required at such a large-scale level. Earlier, more focused testing and sequestering of people with the virus could have mitigated some of the response now required, experts told us. Trump’s claim is incorrect, and in fact flies in the face of years’ worth of evidence.

Conspiracy theory falsely connects George Soros to COVID-19
","George Soros has been accused of many outrageous things. Now, misinformation on Facebook is blaming the billionaire philanthropist for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic.  ""George Soros owns the WuXi PHARMA LAB located in Wuhan, China where COVID-19 was developed and conveniently Broke Out,"" reads a March 15 text post.

Like other conspiracy theories about Soros, this Facebook post is bogus. In January, the conspiracy theory was shared in a Reddit thread that cited a now-defunct fake news website. The WuXi AppTec Group is a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company based in China. It works primarily on manufacturing and developing medical devices.  The seed of the Facebook conspiracy is the fact that the company has a location in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. And documents from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission show that Soros was a WuXi shareholder in May 2011. (Subsequent SEC filings do not list the company among Soros’ investments, perhaps because he changed the legal status of his hedge fund that summer to avoid more government regulation.) But none of that amounts to what the Facebook posts claims: that Soros ""owns"" the company and its Wuhan location. WuXi’s CEO and chairman is Ge Li, according to its website.  And scientists have found that COVID-19’s origin is likely natural — not man-made, as the Facebook post and several other conspiracy theories allege.

Trump says he always felt coronavirus was a pandemic. He didn’t talk that way
","In the early days of the coronavirus crisis, President Donald Trump aimed to reassure the public. Now, he has called for a 15-day push to shut down transmission. ""By making shared sacrifices and temporary changes, we can protect the health of our people and we can protect our economy,"" Trump said in a March 17 press conference. When a reporter asked if there had been a shift in tone, Trump shot back. ""I've always known this is a real, this is a pandemic,"" Trump said. ""I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."" Trump re-emphasized that point in a tweet the next morning. ""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the ‘borders’ from China,"" Trump tweeted March 18. I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false! Trump and his administration acted to keep the virus out of the United States, but his words in public downplayed the threat for many weeks. On Jan. 20, about three weeks after China first reported the new virus, the World Health Organization reported cases in China, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention activated its emergency response center on Jan. 21. On Jan. 29, the White House formed the Coronavirus Task Force, headed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and coordinated by the National Security Council. On Jan. 30, Trump effectively banned all non-Americans from entering the country if they had been in China in the previous two weeks. Americans could come back, but they would be quarantined. Azar declared a public health emergency. The same day, WHO declared a global health emergency. It was the fifth time WHO issued such a warning since 2005. Fears of a pandemic were in the air by mid January. The federal response came as Trump painted a more comforting picture. On Jan. 22, in an interview with CNBC, Trump was asked, ""Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?"" ""No,"" Trump replied. ""Not at all. We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine."" Two days later, he gave the sense that the virus would be kept in China. ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 24. ""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well."" China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! Trump maintained that upbeat tone at a Jan. 30 rally in Iowa.  ""We think we have it very well under control,"" he said. ""We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. And those people are all recuperating successfully."" In a Feb. 2 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump repeated the idea that transmission was unlikely. ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,"" he said. ""We’re going to see what happens, but we did shut it down."" Trump also suggested that warmer weather in April would beat back the virus. As late as Feb. 24 and Feb. 25, Trump continued to paint a picture of a virus corralled. He tweeted that the virus was ""very much under control in the USA,"" and added ""Stock Market starting to look very good to me!"" In India, he said ""we have very few people with it,"" and they were getting better. This was at a time when WHO had reported 76,000 cases worldwide. A pandemic is when a new disease spreads worldwide. On March 11, WHO formally declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic. Trump said that he’s ""always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""  Until late February, Trump spoke as though the U.S. problem was limited and well under control. That description is at odds with the nature of a pandemic. We can’t know what was in Trump’s mind when he aimed to reassure the public, but his words did not fit with the threat of a pandemic.

Numbers on COVID-19 and H1N1 don't prove current outbreak response is 'hysteria'
","A viral image comparing Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama argues that the coronavirus has infected far fewer Americans than did the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu — but that, due to media coverage, reaction to the coronavirus has been overblown. Here is the full claim:  ""President Trump, COVID-19 coronavirus:  U.S. cases: 1,329 U.S. deaths: 38 panic level: mass hysteria. ""President Obama, H1N1 virus: U.S. cases: 60.8 million U.S. deaths: 12,469 panic level: totally chill.  ""Do you all see how the media can manipulate your life?""  The post, shared on Facebook on March 13, 2020, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The numbers — for the coronavirus, as of March 12, 2020; and for the swine flu, from April 2009 to April 2010 — are essentially accurate, based on federal government counts.  The numbers in the post actually show a death rate for COVID-19 at more than 100 times that of H1N1. In any case, it is misleading to compare the two outbreaks at this point in the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 has been in the United States for only about two months; the swine flu figures are for one year, from April 2009 to 2010. As we’ve reported, it’s difficult this early in an outbreak for public health experts to estimate death rates for the coronavirus; early estimates often undercount mild cases and fail to take into account the fact that some recently infected patients are going to die in the future. When we published this fact-check, the latest figures from the World Health Organization, for March 17, 2020, showed a surge in COVID-19 cases in the days since the post — 3,503 cases of COVID-19 in the United States, including 58 deaths. Indeed, it’s too soon to know precisely how deadly COVID-19 is, several experts said. ""The COVID numbers in no way define the problem. We will know the problem after we do many, many tests,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology, and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina and director of its Institute for Global Health & Infectious Diseases. ""Comparing flu"" generally and COVID-19 ""is simply not a good idea,"" he said.  ""For flu, the world has vast experience and vaccines. And treatments. And a well-defined mortality rate far lower than COVID. So, as the world faces a new, very contagious fatal infection, it is not surprising that we all feel anxious."" Said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine and physiology and biophysics at the University of Southern California: ""The raw numbers make H1N1 look worse, but in reality the risk of death is much higher for COVID-19."" As for the post’s claim of mass hysteria over coronavirus versus a totally chill response to H1N1, it’s worth noting President Barack Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency when the United States had only 20 confirmed cases of H1N1 and no deaths. Moreover, as FactCheck.org reported, while the H1N1 death toll may sound high, it was far lower than initially expected. It also turned out to have a case fatality rate of just 0.02% — well below even many typical seasonal influenzas.  So, given that indications are the coronavirus death rate is much higher — and given that experts warn the nation’s hospitals are under-prepared to treat the numbers of patients predicted to need care — it makes sense that state and local governments are taking significant action to limit its spread. The impact in the United States of swine flu might appear much worse than COVID-19, but it lasted for a year, whereas the coronavirus has been here only about two months. And while it’s too soon to calculate how deadly COVID-19 will be, two experts told us it is clearly more deadly than H1N1. This statement contains an element of truth in that the figures quoted were accurate at the time they were posted, but the post ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Italy’s overwhelmed hospitals are treating elderly COVID-19 patients as a lower priority
","In Italy, beset by more cases of COVID-19 than any country but China, hospitals have been forced to make tough triage decisions and ration treatment. But that doesn’t mean the country decided to stop treating elderly coronavirus patients.  A post on Facebook made that claim on March 14, 2020. ""Italy has decided not to treat their elderly for this virus. That, my friends, is socialized healthcare,"" the post claimed. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On the day of the post, Italy had recorded 17,660 cases of coronavirus and 1,268 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The number of deaths represented 58% of the 2,199 coronavirus deaths outside China, including 41 deaths in the United States. By that point, Italy’s hospitals were faced with choosing which of the sickest patients should be treated, and priorities tended to exclude the elderly, who experts say are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Triage is a common tool used in health care systems. For example, the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality promotes an algorithm for emergency department triage that divides patients into five groups — most urgent to least urgent, ""on the basis of acuity and resource needs."" But with the exceptional situation presented by the coronavirus in Italy, special guidelines were developed for Italian health care professionals dealing with COVID-19. By mid March, news organizations had already reported on how Italian doctors were being forced to choose which patients to treat — with the elderly getting a lower priority. ""There are now simply too many patients for each one of them to receive adequate care,"" The Atlantic reported. ""Doctors and nurses are unable to tend to everybody. They lack machines to ventilate all those gasping for air."" The Atlantic also reported that COVID-19 guidelines that had been established by medical doctors from the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care: ""Informed by the principle of maximizing benefits for the largest number,"" the guidelines suggest that ""the allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care. ... It may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care."" The New York Times, reporting from Rome, quoted Dr. Flavia Petrini, president of the college, as saying: ""No one is getting kicked out, but we’re offering criteria of priority. These choices are made in normal times, but what’s not normal is when you have to assist 600 people all at once."" The Times also reported that Giorgo Gori, mayor of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Italy’s worst affected region, said that in some cases, the gap between resources and the enormous influx of patients ""forced the doctors to decide not to intubate some very old patients,"" essentially leaving them to die.  ""Were there more intensive care units,"" he added, ""it would have been possible to save more lives.""  As of March 17, 2020, the latest World Health Organization update showed Italy with 27,980 cases and 2,503 deaths. That was second to China, which had 81,116 and 3,231. The United States had 3,503 and 58. A Facebook post claiming Italy had decided to stop treating elderly COVID-19 patients goes too far.

Ron Paul wrong to say no basis for coronavirus death rate
","For decades, Anthony Fauci has been held up as one of the federal government’s foremost public health experts. Even at age 79, he is one of the top advisers to President Donald Trump on the coronavirus crisis. Yet Ron Paul, a sometimes conspiracy-minded Texas doctor, former GOP congressman and former presidential candidate, seemed to raise a fair question about a coronavirus statement made by Fauci. Calling Fauci ""the chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration,"" Paul wrote in a column on his website that Fauci ""testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is 10 times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis."" We wondered about the scientific basis attack. In some contexts, public health experts have said it’s too early in the coronavirus outbreak to know exactly what it’s death rate is. Paul’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""I can’t think of a more universally trusted person among virologists than"" Fauci, who has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, said Emily Bruce, an immunobiology faculty scientist at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont. Fauci is taking the seasonal influenza death rate to be approximately 0.1% and the coronavirus to be about 1%, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security.  ""While it is early in the outbreak, there is enough data to say that 1% is likely a fairly reasonable approximation with some scientific basis in data."" While the numbers aren’t all precise, there is a basis for what Fauci said. As we’ve reported: Based solely on the numbers, you’re more likely to die if you get the 2019 coronavirus than if you get the flu. (Several factors apply, such as age and health.) A study of 44,672 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China diagnosed as of Feb. 11, 2020, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found a fatality rate of 2.3%. A March 3, 2020, estimate from the World Health Organization put the figure at 3.4%, although that figure is likely inflated given how many cases are mild and not treated in hospitals. Some people who die never report having had coronavirus. The latest daily report on COVID-19 from the World Health Organization, issued March 16, 2020, said there have been 167,515 confirmed cases and 6,606 deaths. That’s a death rate of 3.9%. The flu death rate is much lower. In its latest weekly report on the 2019-20 flu, for the week ending March 7, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there have been 36 million flu illnesses and 22,000 deaths. That’s a rate of 0.06%. The case fatality ratio — dividing reported deaths by reported cases — is only a snapshot and the rate can vary considerably during an outbreak, the World Health Organization told us. ""We will not have a clear CFR until the outbreak is over,"" WHO said in a statement, adding that the CFR can change if it is discovered that there are many more milder cases than originally thought, and can vary by country based demographic factors, such as age.  We didn’t hear back from our requests for information from Paul.  Paul said that Anthony Fauci’s statement that the coronavirus death rate is 10 times that of the seasonal flu is ""a claim without any scientific basis."" We won’t know for some time what the actual death rate is for people who contract the current coronavirus, COVID-19. But based on figures that are available, it’s indicated to be at least 10 times higher than the death rate from the flu. We rate Paul’s statement False.

""COVID-19 would not exist if the world was vegan,"" reads the image. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It had more than 27,000 likes as of March 18. (Screenshot from Instagram) Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, which had infected more than 179,000 people worldwide as of March 17, we saw a lot of baseless claims pinning the disease on the consumption of bats in China. Cowspiracy’s Instagram post piggybacks on that misinformation. As evidence, it refers to the Instagram account for Ed Winters, a vegan activist based in the United Kingdom. His March 14 post cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to back up his claim about meat consumption causing the COVID-19 outbreak. On its website, the CDC says that ""3 out of every 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals."" And the WHO has said that eating ""raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat"" carries a potential risk for infection from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), another human coronavirus. But neither statement supports the link that the activist draws between COVID-19 and meat-eating. Scientists are still trying to figure out the source of COVID-19, but there is no evidence that the outbreak began because of meat consumption. According to the CDC, COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus similar to MERS and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). All three originate in bats, and the recent COVID-19 outbreak suggests a ""likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir."" Early in the outbreak, many patients in the virus epicenter of Wuhan, China, had connections to a large seafood and live-animal market, which suggested animal-to-person spread. But later cases had no connection to the market, suggesting person-to-person spread. Scientists recently traced the first known case of COVID-19 to November 2019, in a patient with no connection to the market. RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic There’s plenty of scientific literature linking human coronaviruses to bats and other wild animals, particularly horseshoe bats in China. However, those studies stipulate that ""intermediate hosts"" are needed between bats and humans for the disease to spread — and meat isn’t necessarily part of the equation. For example, scientists first thought the Ebola outbreak started with the consumption of bat meat in Guinea. But Time reported that patient zero was likely infected by bat droppings that contaminated something she put in her mouth. MERS was also primarily spread through contact with live camels as opposed to camel meat. One of the first studies published about COVID-19 by Chinese researchers found that the virus could come from the same bats that were the source of the 2003 SARS outbreak. But the researchers cautioned that it’s ""likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans."" More recent studies of COVID-19 suggest that pangolins, scaly anteaters, could be that intermediate host. The animals are sought-after in China for their meat and scales, despite a worldwide ban. However, scientists have yet to find conclusive proof that pangolins are to blame for the coronavirus. And as of now, there is no evidence that eating meat is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.
