Allegations of fraud and misconduct at Nevada Democratic convention unfounded
","Supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are furious over the results of Nevada’s state Democratic Party convention in Las Vegas. Sanders supporters loudly protested both during and after the convention, which saw Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton officially claim 20 pledged delegates to Sanders' 15.  Nevada’s delegate allocation process is complex, but Sanders supporters have accused the state Democratic Party of various crimes including ignoring attempts to change the rules, rigging the process in favor of Clinton and disqualifying several dozen delegates that supported Sanders. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver reiterated those concerns during a May 18 interview on CNN with John Vause. ""There was a horrendous breakdown, where the leadership there in Nevada hijacked the process on the floor, created a tremendous amount of angst among people who were there attending the convention, who were supporters of Sen. Sanders, by ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do,"" he said. There’s little disagreement that the convention was chaotic. PolitiFact Nevada was at the convention and saw it firsthand. But does the Sanders campaign’s complaints have merit? What was at stake Nevada’s presidential caucuses were held back in February, which saw Clinton defeat Sanders by a roughly 5 percent margin among the roughly 80,000 voters who participated. But Nevada’s process of allocating delegates isn’t so cut and dried, as PolitiFact has previously explained. Only 23 of the state’s 43 delegates are officially locked in as a result of the February caucuses. Clinton won 13 of that pool, while Sanders won 10. Another group of eight are so-called ""superdelegates,"" who aren’t bound to any candidate and independently decide who to support. (Five currently support Clinton and one backs Sanders in Nevada.) That leaves 12 delegates technically up for grabs at the state convention in May. That number is made up of five pledged ""party leader and elected official"" delegates and seven ""at-large"" delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has the majority at the state convention ""wins"" the odd-numbered delegate from those two groups. Barring a total collapse from either campaign, this means that one candidate was to get seven delegates at the state convention and the other was to get five. As PolitiFact wrote in April, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll — smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus. But that model was essentially broken during the April county conventions, where less than half of Clinton’s allocated county delegates showed up, leading Sanders to declare a surprise victory and allocated delegate advantage over Clinton (2,124 to 1,792) heading into the state convention. Convention confusion Tensions were already mounting in the weeks before the convention, with a small group of Sanders supporters filing a lawsuit against the state party (which was dismissed by a Las Vegas judge) and creating a petition demanding the convention rules be changed. The fight over rules had been going on since April, according to an email chain posted by Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston, between Sanders superdelegate Erin Bilbray and party chairwoman Roberta Lange. Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which have been largely the same since 2008, gave an unfair amount of power to Lange, the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates. The rules, which can be read here,  also state that any amendment attempts must be approved by two-thirds of the convention delegates — which would be difficult given the nearly even number of Clinton and Sanders backers present. Sanders backers say the continuing nature of the presidential primary necessitated more rule changes. The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In a previous statement, the campaign detailed several allegations of misconduct from the state party, which we considered as part of this fact-check. ""At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place,"" the campaign said in that statement. However, there were no last minute rule changes sprung on convention-goers — the rules had been publicly available weeks in advance, largely unchanged for three presidential cycles, and given to both campaigns. The first major fight happened in the morning, with the convention being gaveled in nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled 9 a.m. start time. In a voice vote, Lange approved adoption of a preliminary credentials report showing more Clinton than Sanders delegates. Immediate howls of protests from the Sanders contingent emerged, many of whom rushed the dais and started screaming insults and obscenities directly at Lange. Although several videos from the event appear to have louder ""nays"" than ""yeas,"" both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room. And trying to determine the outcome of a voice vote from a video of around 3,000 delegates is somewhat arbitrary to begin with. The only person with authority to call for a different voting mechanism is the convention chair: Lange. Regardless, upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, hurling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party’s executive board and booing over remarks from California Sen. Barbara Boxer delivered on behalf of the Clinton campaign. The Sanders campaign later alleged that Lange refused to accept petitions to change the rules, which is inaccurate. In an interview, Lange said the board received a handful of petitions to change the convention rules but not all of them met the requirement to have signatures by 20 percent of convention goers. Lange said the proper procedure for an amendment to the rules would have been during a short period for public comment before the temporary rules were adopted as permanent. None of the three Sanders supporters who spoke, including Nevada superdelegate Erin Bilbray, made any motion to amend the rules during that time, so they were approved as written. Volunteers circulating the petitions changing the rules abandoned their efforts after the permanent rules were adopted, saying they missed their chance to introduce them. Either way, any rule change would require a two-thirds majority vote which would be highly unlikely given the Clinton campaign's public opposition to any rules changes. More controversies erupted after the party’s credentials committee, which consisted of five Clinton and five Sanders backers, released their report showing that Clinton delegates narrowly outnumbered those of Sanders 1,695 to 1,662 — a 33-delegate margin. Again, Nevada’s delegate allocation rules meant that whichever campaign had the majority of delegates at the state convention would win two delegates to the national convention. Minority Report A constant complaint is that the party’s credentials committee unfairly disqualified 64 Sanders delegates — detailed in a ""minority report"" and read to delegates by a pro-Sanders credentials committee member. Sanders supporters were upset because that number of delegates would have tipped the balance and presumably swung the two national delegates back to Sanders. But there are a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings associated with the report, which was written and circulated by Sanders campaign staffers. Annette Magnus, an activist and credentials committee member, said the 64-delegate figure stems from a list of delegates submitted by the Clinton campaign of Sanders delegates who weren’t registered as Democrats by May 1, which is required under the rules. Magnus said the committee spent much of Saturday investigating the delegates called into question, and eventually seated six of them. The remaining 58 delegates were rejected because they were either not Democrats by May 1 or the party could not confirm their name or address. ""There was not a vetting process at county convention like the state level convention,"" Magnus said. Importantly, the state party reported only eight of the rejected delegates even showed up to the convention, so even if they had been seated it would not have flipped the majority. ""It didn't affect the outcome in any way,"" Magnus said. Regardless, the switch in two delegates matters little in the contours of the national delegate race. Including superdelegates, Clinton has a commanding 763 delegate lead over Sanders after the May 17 primaries, according to the Associated Press. Clinton currently leads the delegate count in Nevada 25-16, with two superdelegates still undecided. Security concerns With so many questions about the Nevada convention, we wanted to address two other points. Images and videos circulated after the convention was called to a quick close alleging that Lange ""illegally"" ended the convention despite motions for a recount.  Lange — who said she was forced to take a security detail to even go to the bathroom during the convention — said police and Caesars Entertainment hotel officials told her that the convention had to be immediately adjourned due to ongoing security details. Casino spokeswoman Jennifer Forkis said the event ran over its allotted time by about four hours, meaning security hired for the event would soon leave their shifts. ""Without adequate security personnel, and in consultation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and event organizers, a decision was made that it was in the best interest of everyone in attendance to end the event,"" Forkis said in a statement. Secondly, an ongoing debate has emerged post-convention over questions of violence and allegations of chair-throwing from Sanders supporters. There’s no clear evidence of a chair being thrown, but the post-adjournment attitude was tense with Sanders delegates screaming obscenities and pushing back barriers between the crowd and the main stage. Our ruling Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Nevada Democratic Party leaders ""hijacked the process on the floor"" of the state convention ""ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do."" Caucuses and delegate math can be incredibly confusing, and the arcane party structures don’t reflect how most people assume presidential selection works. But the howls of unfairness and corruption by the Sanders campaign during Nevada’s state Democratic Convention can’t change the simple fact that Clinton’s supporters simply turned out in larger numbers and helped her solidify her delegate lead in Nevada. There’s no clear evidence the state party ""hijacked"" the process or ignored ""regular procedure.""

Priorities USA ad rips Trump's 'f--- themselves' quote way out of context
","Donald Trump's attitude toward women has been a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign since Megyn Kelly grilled him about some of his negative comments at the GOP’s first presidential debate. With Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, Priorities USA, a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC, has released a commercial called ""Speak"" showing people — all but one of them a woman — wearing T-shirts with Trump images mouthing some of the comments the billionaire has used when referring to women. The quotes: ""You know you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.""  ""Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely."" ""You like girls that are 5-foot-1? They come up to you-know-where."" ""If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her."" (with an image a father and daughter) ""And you can tell them to go f--- themselves."" In the last quote, the expletive is bleeped out, but it’s clear what word the woman in the ad is mouthing. The ad then asks, ""Does Donald Trump really speak for you?"" Apparently, the ""f--- themselves"" portion of the ad doesn't speak for Trump either, at least when it comes to referring to women. Our partners at the Political TV Ad Archive helped us identify that Trump's voice in that quote was taken from an Feb. 4, 2016, speech he made in New Hampshire. His comment dealt with businesses leaving the United States, not women. ""We're going to bring businesses back. We're going to have businesses that are now in Mexico come back to New Hampshire and you can tell them to go f--- themselves,"" Trump said. ""Because they let you down, and they left."" Trump clearly mouths the expletive, but he says the word very softly, if at all. Watch for yourself.  When we contacted Priorities USA, spokesman Justin Barasky said, ""we never claimed it was a reference to women at all."" That ad ""wasn't just about Donald Trump's overt sexism. It was actually about how divisive he is and how his character is that of someone who should never be president of the United States,"" he said. ""In no way do we ever claim he was saying that to women. There is no fast one trying to be pulled."" However, at the very end, when the announcer asks, ""Does Donald Trump really speak for you?"" the images of seven women — and no men — flash across the screen. The super PAC said it plans to spend $6 million airing that ad and a companion Trump attack ad in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada over a three-week period. The second ad focuses exclusively on women's issues. In a news release announcing the ad buy, Priorities USA, said, ""Our paid media campaign starts by highlighting (Trump's) divisive views on women."" Trump, in a tweet about the ad, complained that he wasn't talking about women in the clip, although he mistakenly said he was referring to China. Actually, that was a mistake, too. The clear context was about businesses that left for places like Mexico. Our ruling Priorities USA, in an anti-Trump ad, quotes the candidate as saying, ""And you can tell them to go (bleep) themselves."" It comes after multiple comments critical of women. The super PAC says the sound clip wasn't meant to be taken as a reference to women. That, as Trump might say, is a huuuuuuuge stretch. The ad is all about women. It features seven women and two men, only one of whom has a speaking role. All of the mouthed phrases — except the one in question — clearly attack, criticize or make disturbing references to women. The ad offers no indication that the ""f--- themselves"" line refers to anything but women. In fact, it refers to businesses that left the United States. The statement in the ad represents a ridiculous misrepresentation of what Trump said. We rate it Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/600ae970-2bd5-47aa-b74b-c9270aa48e6f",/factchecks/2016/may/18/priorities-usa-action/priorities-usa-donald-trump-women-ad/

Is Rep. Mike Coffman with Trump? Coffman says not yet
","It’s the Democrats’ favorite game this election season: Pin the Trump on the down-ballot Republican candidate. One of the bigger targets is Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, a four-term Republican incumbent in the 6th Congressional District, a crescent-shaped swath of Denver suburbs considered one of the country’s most competitive swing districts. Coffman is in a fierce contest with Democratic state Sen. Morgan Carroll. Since last year, Democratic groups and Carroll have been working hard to shackle Coffman to the now-presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his controversial comments about immigrants, minorities and women. The latest broadside came from Colorado’s Voice -- the state chapter of America’s Voice, an immigration reform group. It issued an email news release headlined, ""Mike Coffman Is With Trump."" So is he? February statement, subsequent remarks Colorado's Voice is using a statement Coffman’s spokeswoman gave to the Colorado Statesman as evidence he’s ""with Trump."" But the statement, from Kristin Strohm, also clearly said Coffman supported Marco Rubio. Here it is. ""Will Mike Coffman support the Republican nominee over Bernie or Hillary?"" Strohm said in a story published Feb. 2. ""The answer is obviously yes. And he believes strongly it is going to be Marco Rubio."" At the time, Trump was one of 11 Republicans still in the race. However, Coffman political director JD Key suggested to PolitiFact that Coffman might be having second thoughts about automatically supporting the GOP nominee. ""Rep. Coffman has not endorsed or voiced support for Donald Trump,"" Key said. In fact, Coffman has issued blistering criticisms of his party’s de facto presidential nominee. When Trump blasted the Colorado GOP’s caucus system as ""rigged,"" Coffman, a Marine Corps combat veteran, fired back with this April 18 Facebook post: ""If there is anyone who knows what a rigged system looks like it’s Donald Trump who was able to evade the draft during the height of the Vietnam War when the U.S. was losing, on average, 1,000 troops every month. That system was clearly rigged in favor of young men from politically influential families but Donald Trump never complained about that."" And on May 4, Coffman said in a statement that Trump has yet to earn Coffman’s support. ""Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have tapped into a legitimate anger about the failures of Washington but instead of running a campaign built on a positive vision for overcoming these failures, Donald Trump has conducted a polarizing and divisive campaign,"" Coffman said. ""Hillary Clinton is a non-starter and lacks the integrity to lead this nation but Trump has a long way to go to earn the support of many – me included."" Coffman isn't alone in walking back previous comments. House Speaker Paul Ryan had said he would back whoever won the Republican nomination, only to hold back on endorsing Trump. And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush broke a pledge to support the GOP nominee no matter who it was. A May 6 Politico story headlined, ""Which Republicans have endorsed Donald Trump?"" listed both Coffman and Ryan under ""Not there yet."" Lining up on positions So Coffman certainly is hedging on his campaign’s previous statement that he would support the GOP nominee, who is now almost certainly Trump. But do the two candidates line up issue-wise? The Colorado’s Voice news release pointed to Coffman’s position on immigration legislation. ""Colorado already knows Coffman supports the Trump agenda on immigration. He voted … multiple times to deport DREAMers by ending the DACA program. He opposes DAPA, the policy that offers a modest but critical step forward for the parents of U.S. citizens."" DACA is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Barack Obama created by executive order in 2012. It allows undocumented immigrants brought to the country unlawfully as children a two-year reprieve from deportation along with the opportunity to receive a renewable work permit and a driver's license. DAPA is short for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents. Obama used a 2014 executive order to create the program that would shield parents of children who are citizens or are living in the country legally from deportation and make them eligible to work in the United States. The fate of DAPA and an expanded DACA is being deliberated on by the U.S. Supreme Court after Texas and 25 other states led by Republicans sued over the programs, saying the Obama administration had usurped power that belongs to Congress. Here, too, Coffman’s position isn’t cut and dried. Coffman voted against the DREAM Act in 2010, a bipartisan bill to allow children brought into the country unlawfully a path to citizenship if they attended college or served in the military. (DACA was in many ways Obama’s response.) ""The Dream Act will be a nightmare for the American people,"" Coffman said at the time. ""No doubt, we need immigration reform but the Dream Act is written far too broadly and it will only encourage more illegal immigration, promote chain migration, and will be a magnet for fraud."" But Coffman's immigration positions softened in 2011, when his district was redrawn and its population became 20 percent Hispanic. He began taking Spanish lessons to better communicate with his constituents, and in January 2013, he introduced the Military Enlistment Opportunity Act, which sought to provide immigrant children an opportunity to serve in the U.S. military and gain a path to citizenship. During the 2014 election, Coffman and his Democratic opponent, former state House speaker, Andrew Romanoff, debated in Spanish. ""There’s a narrative out there about Republicans being not just anti-illegal immigrant, but anti-immigrant,"" Coffman told the Wall Street Journal in January. ""It was very important to me to break the narrative."" Colorado’s Voice director Alvina Vasquez said while Coffman ""makes sweeping and broad statements about immigration reform, his actions show his true beliefs."" Critics cite Coffman’s June 2013 vote to defund DACA and his March 17 vote supporting the House filing an amicus brief with the Supreme Court ""opposing the Obama administration's executive overreach"" on immigration reform programs. Yet, in 2014, Coffman broke with the GOP to vote against efforts to end the DACA program for young ""Dreamers."" Our ruling Colorado’s Voice says ""Mike Coffman is with Trump."" That’s hardly clear. In February, Coffman’s spokeswoman said he would ""support the Republican nominee,"" while hoping that person would be Marco Rubio. Since then, Coffman has criticized Trump’s ""divisive campaign"" and said the billionaire has a long way to go to earn his support. The group also says Coffman ""supports the Trump agenda on immigration"" as evidence. Yet the congressman’s views have moderated, and Coffman has at times broken with hardline GOP positions on immigration. Claims that Coffman is in lockstep with Trump go too far. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2f833b02-1b7c-4634-bd9e-09f51d5f7dc1",/factchecks/2016/may/18/colorados-voice/group-says-mike-coffman-trump-he-says-billionaire-/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Penny Pritzker']","
Are after-tax incomes up 14% since 2009?
","President Barack Obama has touted his administration’s record of overseeing economic growth since the Great Recession. But is it correct -- as Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker wrote recently in Medium -- that since 2009, ""after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent""? To check Pritzker’s statement, we looked at two economic statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which, as it happens, is part of the department Pritzker oversees. One is real disposable personal income -- that is, the accumulation of all personal incomes in the United States, minus taxes and adjusted for inflation. That statistic rose from $10.9 trillion in 2009 to $12.2 trillion in 2015, the last full year available. That works out to an increase of 11.9 percent. Here’s a summary graph:  That’s lower than the 14 percent figure Pritzker cited, but it’s still a double-digit increase over six years, so it’s in the ballpark. We didn’t hear back from Pritzker’s office, but Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said he suspects she arrived at her number through a different but reasonable calculation. He said she was probably referring to a comparison of an average of the 12 monthly figures from 2009 and the three monthly figures (so far) for 2016. We double-checked Burtless’ math and found that it works out to be a 13.7 percent increase -- on target with what Pritzker said. But while Pritzker is either correct or reasonably close when looking at the overall personal income numbers, it’s worth remembering that this number can be affected by population growth, even over a period as short as seven years. Consider an alternative measure -- real disposable personal income per capita, which is the previous statistic, but adjusted for the size of the U.S. population. That measurement has gone up from $35,616 in 2009 to $38,046 in 2015 -- an increase of 6.8 percent. That’s only half as fast as Pritzker said -- and it’s worth remembering that this was a cumulative rise over six years. As a result, disposable personal income rose by only about 1 percent a year above inflation during that period. That doesn’t sound quite as exciting.  Why doesn’t this feel right to most Americans? So if Pritzker’s claim about after-tax income growth is reasonably accurate, how does that jibe with equally accurate claims noting that ""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years""? For starters, as we’ve noted, there are various ways to measure income growth, each of them legitimate but some of them show different results. ""I agree that we want to think about some sort of per-person measure, but is the right measure per capita or per employed or per labor force participant?"" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. In addition, even if real disposable personal income is going up over time, that doesn’t mean it’s rising as fast as it once was. To measure this, we looked at the average annual increase in real disposable personal income during three recent periods. From 1992 to 2000, real disposable personal income rose an average of 3.7 percent per year. From 2001 to 2008, it rose an average of 2.7 percent per year. And from 2009 to 2015, it rose by 1.6 percent per year. That’s a clear pattern of diminishing growth, even if it’s still growth. Burtless noted that the lack of attention given to the role that rising population has warped perceptions of economic output and income growth. Specifically, he said, the slowdown in population growth since the 1970s, especially in the age groups likeliest to be working, has made it harder for the United States to reach the once-common historical level of 3 percent annual economic growth. Our rating Pritzker said that since 2009, ""after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent."" Using the most basic, aggregate measure, Pritzker is either on target or reasonably close. However, it’s worth noting that this accomplishment is not quite as impressive once you strip out population growth or look at growth levels historically. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/18/penny-pritzker/commerce-secretary-penny-pritzker-says-2009/

Alan Grayson lacks evidence for accusation about Patrick Murphy's father and All Aboard Florida
","U.S. Senate candidate Alan Grayson dismissed a New York Times story about his hedge fund as ""full of s---"" in a sit-down with CBS4’s Jim Defede, a reaction so wrong his own campaign corrected him on the facts. But that wasn’t the only attack in the interview that ran off the rails. Grayson called rival Patrick Murphy a ""walking, talking crook"" and zeroed in on Murphy’s wealthy businessman father, another focal point in the race between the two Democratic congressmen running for Sen. Marco Rubio’s seat. Grayson accused Murphy of flip-flopping on the passenger rail project when it snubbed a bid from builder Thomas P. Murphy Jr., owner of Coastal Construction Group.  Murphy ""switched his vote on All Aboard Florida and tried to destroy the program -- the only Democrat in the entire country who voted to destroy the All Aboard Florida program -- because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful,"" Grayson said May 15. ""So he went from being in favor of the program to being against the program. That’s certainly using your congressional influence. He tried to kill the entire program -- the only Democrat to do so -- because his father didn't get a contract out of it."" Did Murphy really flip-flop on votes for All Aboard Florida after his father’s company lost its bid? There is no dispute that Murphy initially supported the rail project and later opposed it. There is dispute, however, over why he did it. Murphy’s campaign argues that he came out against the project as he learned more about it and heard community opposition. Grayson, who supports All Aboard Florida, points to more nefarious reasons, but he doesn’t prove his charge that it was connected to Murphy’s dad’s business. There’s also an issue with Grayson’s wording about flip-flopped ""votes."" There were two votes in Congress related to the financing, but Murphy consistently voted no on those votes. The Grayson campaign acknowledged to PolitiFact Florida that Murphy changed his ""support"" for the project, but not his votes. Coastal Construction’s role All Aboard Florida is a $3 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2017, with plans to extend it to Orlando. The owners applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan to supplement private financing but later put that request on hold. All Aboard Florida’s federal application for $1.75 billion in tax-exempt bonding authority was approved. (The state is also kicking in some money connected to the project.) An All Aboard Florida spokeswoman declined to comment about Coastal Construction’s interest. Coastal Construction along with a joint venture partner, Tishman Construction, had preliminary conversations with All Aboard Florida from October 2012 until the fall of 2013 but never submitted a bid, said Dan Whiteman, Coastal Construction vice chairman. ""In early December of 2013, it was decided to no longer pursue the project,"" Whiteman wrote. ""All Aboard Florida was advised in mid-December 2013 that we were not going to proceed any further in discussions, and we never submitted a response to their request for proposals to build the project."" Asked why Coastal declined to bid on the project, Whiteman said: ""Other projects came available and were starting more quickly."" Whiteman said that Coastal Construction had no conversations with Rep. Murphy about the project. A spokesman for Murphy's campaign, Joshua Karp, agreed with that point. Murphy changed his stance Murphy supported All Aboard Florida in the fall of 2013 when it benefited from a $13.75 million federal grant. The state applied for the grant to improve connectivity between multiple rail operators including All Aboard Florida. In October 2013, Murphy was one of 16 Florida members to sign a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx praising the project. They wrote it had ""potential to modernize and upgrade a busy transportation corridor"" and provide an economic boost. But by the spring of 2014, local opposition had grown due to fears about noise and other impacts. Resolutions from local governments and groups, such as Indian River County, the city of Port St. Lucie and the village of Tequesta, started to pile up. Ultimately, 60,000 people signed a petition against it. Murphy, who faced re-election, hopped on board the opposition train. He won his race. In March 2014, Murphy sought a meeting with Foxx to discuss constituent concerns. By April, he was an adamant opponent. In a letter to Foxx, Murphy wrote that the rail line would likely ""delay emergency vehicles, create traffic jams, raise noise pollution and block waterways."" Over the next several months, Murphy contacted federal and state officials, sought public hearings as well as a federal study in an effort to quash the rail line. Murphy’s changed stance drew media attention. Murphy’s chief of staff, Eric Johnson, told the TC Palm that initially the project drew local support because of the economic benefits. ""But since then,"" Johnson is quoted as saying, ""with everything (Murphy) learns, the more information he gets, the less he likes it. The more he learns, he sours on this project more."" (Murphy campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen provided a similar explanation for this fact-check.) K.C. Ingram Traylor, leader of the opposition group Florida Not All Aboard, told PolitiFact Florida, ""As the facts about All Aboard Florida came to light, Rep. Murphy intelligently took another look at the project and strongly opposed it."" Murphy’s votes A spokesman for Grayson, David Damron, initially argued that Grayson had specified Murphy switched his ""support"" and not his vote. But after PolitiFact Florida sent Damron the transcript and CBS4 video, Damron acknowledged that Grayson errantly mentioned votes. Congress didn’t get an up-or-down vote on the project. However, there were two votes on amendments offered by U.S. Rep. Bill Posey, R-Rockledge, to an appropriations bill about financing. Murphy was the lone Democrat to vote in favor of the two amendments to ban funds for the project. One amendment banned funds in general, and the other banned tax-exempt bonds. Both amendments failed by wide margins on June 9, 2015. Our ruling Grayson says Murphy ""switched his vote on All Aboard Florida ... because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful."" There is one kernel of truth here: Murphy did switch his position on the rail project. But he did not switch his votes, which were consistently against funding for it. Murphy said he switched his vote because of community blowback to the rail project, and not as a result of his father’s business dealings. The onus is on Grayson to prove that Murphy flip-flopped because his father didn’t get a contract out of it, and he did not prove his case. The entities involved are private, which makes primary documents hard to obtain. Coastal Construction’s vice chairman said the company had preliminary talks with the private rail project but did not file a bid. We rate this claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2016/may/18/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-lacks-evidence-accusation-about-patri/

Koster might oversimplify, but size of gender wage gap is real
","As the Missouri legislative session winds down, Attorney General and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Chris Koster isn’t shying away from criticizing the Republican-controlled legislature. Koster tweeted, ""The #WageGap isn’t about isn’t about a few cents — it can mean EVERYTHING to a working woman trying to provide for her family."" His tweet contained a photo with a captain that stated, ""Closing our state’s wage gap would make a $9 billion difference to Missouri women."" We decided to look into the claim. Koster’s tweet cited the National Partnership for Women and Families as a source. His campaign also referred us to a St. Louis Business Journal article and a National Women’s Law Center report. National Partnership for Women and Families report The National Partnership for Women and Families said in a September 2015 report that Missouri women who work full time make on average $10,300 less than Missouri men. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 926,000 women working full time and year-round in Missouri. Multiply that by $10,300 and you get more than $9.5 billion. The challenge of comparing incomes Some researchers believe that simply comparing median earnings of male and female workers doesn’t provide a complete picture. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows some of the wage gap comes down to women and men doing different work and having different career paths. Nevertheless, even after considering these factors, a gap still exists. ""Economic research shows that, even after controlling for work experience, family division of labor and compensating wage differentials for dangerous jobs, there is still an unexplained gender wage gap,"" said George-Levi Gayle, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. A study from the Institute for the Study of Labor, an economic research institute based in Bonn, Germany, shows the unexplained wage gap in the United States falls somewhere between 8 percent and 18 percent of the total earnings difference, if the figures are adjusted for additional factors. Using the high-end estimate, the $9.5 billion figure falls to about $1.7 billion. Gayle said gender stereotypes and bias can explain the remaining disparities. According to Gayle, this inequality may exist even when people are rational and non-prejudiced. Our Ruling Koster said closing Missouri’s wage gap could make a $9 billion difference to Missouri women. There is a wage gap. The latest government numbers show that for men and women working full time year-round in Missouri, the gap is more than $9.5 billion. Some, but far from all, of the gap is due to bias and discrimination. Economic studies show the wage gap shrinks when you control for factors such as differences in the jobs men and women do and length of time in the workforce. The bias related portion of the gap could be as much as $1.7 billion. That’s a lot of money, but it isn’t the $9 billion Koster claimed. When we’ve rated such claims before, statements that speak broadly about a wage gap, regardless of the underlying factors, get some benefit of the doubt. Koster’s claim greatly oversimplifies a very complex situation, but the size of the gap is real.

Most GOP nominees since 1970s have released their tax returns, Fox's Chris Wallace says
","It seems every political reporter is asking: Where are Donald Trump’s tax returns? The presumptive Republican nominee for president has refused to release his tax returns thus far, citing an IRS audit. Presidential candidates are not required to release tax returns, but the information helps the public vet a candidate’s finances, revealing information such as charitable giving, investments and the tax rate he pays. The IRS has said recently that an audit does not bar a person from releasing their own tax information. On the Democratic side of the race, Sen. Bernie Sanders has released his 2014 returns, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has released annual returns going back to 2000. In a May 15 interview with Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace noted that it’s become customary over the past several decades for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. ""He says that he's not going to release them until an IRS audit is complete,"" Wallace said, speaking of Trump. ""He was asked this week what his effective tax rate is, he said it's none of your business. Look, you know, you talk about this, but every Republican nominee since Richard Nixon, who at one time was under an audit, has released their tax returns."" Noting that it was ""not good"" that Mitt Romney stalled on releasing his tax returns in the 2012 race, Priebus said, ""I'm not sure whether Americans actually care or not whether Donald Trump releases his taxes or not."" We’ve looked into the history of candidate tax returns before. But we haven’t dug into the story of former President Richard Nixon’s audit, so we thought we should put Wallace’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. Every Republican nominee since Nixon The Tax History Project has compiled the tax returns of many current and former candidates and presidents, all the way back to Franklin Roosevelt’s 1913 returns. Each Republican nominee in the past nine presidential elections has released his tax returns: Ronald Reagan (1980, 1984), George H. W. Bush (1988, 1992), Bob Dole (1996), George W. Bush (2000, 2004), John McCain (2008) and Mitt Romney (2012). That leaves one nominee since Nixon, Nixon’s vice president, Gerald Ford. Ford assumed the role of president after Nixon resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. Ford ran for re-election as the Republican nominee in 1976, ultimately losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Ford never released his full tax returns. He released summary data about his returns from 1966 through 1974. The summary data includes his total income and the total tax he paid but not an itemized breakdown. ‘Well, I am not a crook’ Back to Nixon. Nixon did not release his tax returns in 1968 or 1972. The IRS audited Nixon in 1973, when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system, according to a paper prepared for the United States Capitol Historical Society. (This happened around the same time as the Watergate investigation but was a separate issue.) Nixon said one of his most well-known lines amid this scandal: ""People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook."" Nixon eventually released a slew of financial information to the public in December 1973, including the previous four years of tax returns, to try to quell the criticism. He asked a congressional committee to examine them, too. However, the congressional investigation ultimately found that Nixon owed $476,431 (approximately $2.3 million in today’s dollars) in unpaid taxes and accrued interest. Oops. We asked Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, if the IRS has audited any presidents or presidential candidates since Nixon. He said he doesn’t know — and it would be impossible to know unless the auditee volunteered that information because the IRS can’t confirm or deny anything about a particular taxpayer. Thorndike added, though, that he thinks it’s likely the IRS has audited candidates and presidents in recent years. ""Our lack of knowledge about presidential and candidate audits is one reason why it’s important for public officials to release their tax returns publicly,"" he said. ""Disclosure is the only way voters can be sure that these returns are getting adequate scrutiny."" Our ruling Wallace said, ""Every Republican nominee since Richard Nixon, who at one time was under an audit, has released their tax returns."" The IRS did audit Nixon, and he did release his tax returns. But he released them after he won re-election. His successor, Ford, released a tax summary spanning several years but never his full returns.   That being said, every Republican nominee since then — six nominees over nine elections — has disclosed their tax returns. Wallace’s telling of history is a little off, though the force of his point is correct: The Republican has released his tax returns in the last nine presidential cycles.

Tallies are too sketchy to say anti-abortion centers outnumber abortion providers 2 to 1
","Georgia is in the news after joining other states in passing legislation to fund crisis pregnancy centers as an alternative to Planned Parenthood. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee on TBS explored these centers, which may offer some pregnancy services but not abortion, in its May 9 edition. The segment argued that the centers, run by groups opposed to abortion, often try to set up shop near existing abortion clinics and promise to give clients information about their pregnancy and help dealing with it. Some offer to give women information on abortion, leading pregnant women to believe that the center offers the procedure. Once inside, the Full Frontal segment said, women who ask about abortion are falsely told that if they have one, they won't be able to have more children, they will suffer from psychological problems and they will face a higher risk of breast cancer. Some offer ultrasound, not necessarily as a diagnostic tool, but as a way to discourage abortion. ""They create the illusion that they're an abortion clinic by adapting names that are similar to abortion clinics, adapting the same logos and fonts,"" said Vicki Saporta, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, in the segment. At the end of the segment, Saporta threw out an interesting statistic: ""There are more than twice as many fake clinics as there are legitimate abortion providers in the United States."" We wondered if Saporta's ratio was correct and whether pregnant women seeking an abortion were really twice as likely to come across one of these centers than a clinic that offers abortion. Saporta uses ""fake clinics"" to describe crisis pregnancy centers. Any count of these centers is complicated by the fact that most of them don't explicitly say they offer abortions when they try to get clients. Some may promise information about abortion, even if their goal is to discourage them. Others may not mention abortion at all until someone comes through the door or the pregnant woman brings it up. Saporta's sources We contacted the federation to ask for its sources. For the tally of abortion providers, spokeswoman Alissa Manzoeillo offered data from the Guttmacher Institute, which studies sexual and reproductive health, and supports abortion rights. Its latest survey, done in 2011, found 1,720 abortion providers in the United States, including 839 that do more than 400 abortions per year. The 1,720 total includes those clinics, doctor's offices where abortions are performed, and hospitals, which usually perform abortions for serious cases and only provide about 4 percent of all such procedures. As far as the ""fake clinics,"" Manzoeillo sent us media reports with a variety of estimates including 2,500 to 4,000 (from a 2003 Mother Jones article) and ""at least 3,000"" (a 2015 Cosmopolitan article). The federation also cited a Salon article reporting that the crisis pregnancy centers now outnumber abortion clinics ""by an estimated 3 to 1."" Some of those permutations support Saporta's claim. Some don't. And there are some flaws in both counts. Reliable estimates are tough to come by Getting a reliable count of crisis pregnancy centers ""is really hard because they are not licensed. They are not in anybody's database,"" said Elizabeth Nash, a senior state issues associate at Guttmacher. She said she's seen estimates of 3,000 to 8,000. The lists of the three major chains ""do not include the more local chains or the individual centers that might be run out of a church basement or something like that."" We contacted some of the chains affiliated with the centers and asked them for their best count. One of them, Heartbeat International, said it counts 2,573 total pregnancy center locations, including 1,145 that offer medical services such as ultrasounds and testing and/or treatment for sexually transmitted infections. Heartbeat spokesman Jay Hobbs cautioned, however, that ""organizations need not affiliate with a national organization such as Heartbeat International or Care Net (another group) to open their doors to clients."" ""Much like local churches, pregnancy-help organizations are stand-alone non-profit entities overseen at the local level by a board of directors,"" Hobbs said. Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, which opposes abortion, said his organization counts 2,643 centers nationwide, 1,231 of which have medical personnel and services on the site. The others may offer just information and counseling. That's a conservative figure, he said, because adoption service agencies, hotlines, social service agencies with anti-abortion views, and maternity homes could also be included, Donovan said. ""Over the last 10 years, I’ve seen numbers ranging from 1,800 to 4,000, however, these numbers were typically offered in both mainstream and Christian media without any indication of how the author arrived at a particular number,"" said Kimberly Kelly, a sociologist at Mississippi State University, who studies religion and reproductive politics. ""There are no definitive data sources,"" but most centers are affiliated with Care Net or Heartbeat International, she said. There's a lingering question over how effective these centers are at ultimately discouraging abortion. Earlier this month, the online news website Rewire, which covers sexual and reproductive health issues, reported that data from an anti-abortion Texas software company used by 1,200 crisis pregnancy centers to track clients, found that fewer than 4 percent of women are dissuaded from having an abortion. Most come in for the free services, never having planned to seek an abortion in the first place. Abortion provider figure may also be lower It's worth noting that the 2011 Guttmacher  count totaling 1,720 abortion providers is likely a bit out of date. Today the number of clinics is probably lower because states such as Texas and Ohio have aggressively tried to shut down clinics that provide abortion while diverting money to crisis pregnancy centers. On March 25, Florida Gov. Rick Scott cut off all state funding for preventive health service clinics that provide abortion. Our ruling Saporta said, ""There are more than twice as many fake clinics as there are legitimate abortion providers in the United States."" The last count of the number of abortion providers, around 1,720, is probably a bit high.  Meanwhile, the number of crisis pregnancy centers run the gamut from 1,800 to 8,000. There's no widely recognized tally. Saporta's claim only holds up if you accept the higher estimates. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fc41f0fb-3df9-47ed-9140-0dba8ab8e198",/factchecks/2016/may/17/vicki-saporta/tallies-are-too-sketchy-say-anti-abortion-centers-/

Newt Gingrich says China stole $360 billion in intellectual property from U.S.
","Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has spoken favorably of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump, including expressing openness to being tapped as his vice president. And on Fox News Sunday, Gingrich joined Trump in hammering away at China. Gingrich said on May 15 that while he had played a major role as a congressional leader in passing one of Trump’s most heavily criticized trade deals, the North American Free Trade Agreement, it’s not a bad idea to be tougher now. ""When you hear, for example, that the Chinese last year probably stole $360 billion in intellectual property from the United States, I think being tough about that's a good thing,"" Gingrich said. ""I think conservatives can be for very tough-minded trade."" The $360 billion figure is based on a federal estimate, though experts caution that the true number is impossible to know. It could actually be higher. Where the number comes from Intellectual property refers to creative concepts such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names and images used in commerce, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. Its creators and owners are protected legally through patents, copyrights and trademarks, but cross-border theft of intellectual property is hard to police. Over the years, United States officials have said that China is one of the worst offenders. This has been driven in large part by an aggressive technology quest by China’s central government. We tracked down Gingrich’s $360 billion figure to comments by William Evanina, director of the Counterintelligence and Security Center under Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Evanina told reporters in November 2015 that, based on reports by nearly 140 companies, espionage via computer hacking costs the U.S. economy $400 billion a year, and that the Chinese government is believed to be behind 90 percent of those attacks. That works out to $360 billion. Gingrich spokesman Ross Worthington subsequently confirmed that Evanina’s comments were the source of Gingrich’s number on Fox News Sunday. The first thing we should note, however, is that the $360 billion figure is only for losses from cyber-hacking — a limitation that Gingrich didn’t specify. Of course, adding in non-cyber losses would only increase that figure beyond $360 billion. And Worthington said that this all may be an under-estimate because ""corporations do not usually reveal the fact or allow (law enforcement) to go public or estimate losses because that would in effect expose their consumers, clients and stockholders to more losses, indirect and direct."" How solid is the $360 billion number? Still, experts agreed that there’s lots of uncertainty in determining the scale of intellectual property losses. Another estimate for intellectual property theft from China, by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, a blue-ribbon panel, pegged annual U.S. losses from intellectual property at approximately $300 billion, of which China accounted for ""between 50 percent and 80 percent of the problem."" That would produce a figure between $150 billion and $240 billion, lower than what Gingrich said, though the commission acknowledged that such studies may be undercounting the scale of losses. ""The exact figure is unknowable,"" the commission cautioned. Independent experts strongly agreed. ""Estimating losses from intellectual property theft is like trying to predict next month's weather with 1960s technology,"" said Justin Hughes, a Loyola Law School professor who specializes in intellectual property. ""Estimates are by nature guesstimates, and rough ones at that. I would not be comfortable with anything more specific than ‘hundreds of billions of dollars.’ ""   Hughes added that measurements of intellectual property theft don’t necessarily include U.S. losses from counterfeit goods, another area of concern. Even basic definitions offer room for disagreement, said Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Should we use what it’s worth to the owner or the thief? If intellectual property hasn’t fully been brought to market — and that turns out in many cases to be the most valuable intellectual property — its value to anyone can only be very roughly estimated,"" he said. James A. Lewis, senior vice president and program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also noted technical problems in calculating a dollar value. ""If I steal intellectual property that you value at $100 and I can’t use it, the actual loss is zero,"" Lewis said. Our ruling Gingrich said, ""The Chinese last year probably stole $360 billion intellectual property from the United States."" The $360 billion figure comes from a senior government official, and there are indications that it could, if anything, understate the scale of the problem. However, it’s worth remembering that all estimates in this field are subject to guesstimation. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/17/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-china-stole-360-billion-intelle/

Is an elephant killed in the time it takes you to down that cup of coffee?
","By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks, according to an image shared by actress Minka Kelly. Kelly (Friday Night Lights) posted the statistic by the International Fund for Animal Welfare on her Instagram, along with a note urging her followers to sign IFAW’s petition asking wildlife authorities to list African elephants as endangered and give the species more protections. ""#Elephants are being killed at an alarming rate, both by #ivory poachers and by wealthy American trophy #hunters,"" Kelly wrote May 10. ""It's estimated that on average, an #elephant is killed every 15 minutes for its ivory. That's 96 animals a day!"" Is it true that elephants are killed at the rate it takes to down a cup of joe? The estimate is derived from a reputable academic study, but IFAW is oversimplifying the complexities of that research to score a good soundbite. Every 15 minutes Beth Allgood, IFAW’s director for U.S. campaigns, told us the 96 elephants figure comes from a 2014 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study that provided the first reliable continent-wide estimate of illegal kills. The researchers used data at carcass-monitoring field sites maintained by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) to model the Africa-wide number of illegal elephant deaths. The study determined the percentage of elephants estimated to be killed by poaching. It then took that percentage and applied it to current estimates of the total number of African elephant species total. The study used two different approaches to calculate the total number of African elephants killed over three years — reaching 99,997 in one version and 101,784 in the other. (For context, the entire species had an estimated population size of 420,000 to 650,000 in 2012.) Averaged over three years, that’s an annual rate of 33,630 elephants, researchers said. That's a daily rate of 92 elephants (not 96) or the equivalent of one elephant illegally poached every 15 to 16 minutes. We spoke to the lead author of the study, George Wittemyer of Colorado State University, about his findings and the IFAW claim. Wittemyer said the IFAW calculation was ""plausible,"" but he also said that ""confidence intervals around the numbers are a bit wide."" In other words, IFAW is taking a fairly shaky estimate and describing it as a certainty. The better take-away from the paper is the order of magnitude (tens of thousands of elephants killed per year), rather than exact figures, said Julian Blanc, the data analyst for CITES’ elephant monitoring program. ""I therefore cannot vouch for the ‘96 elephants a day’ figure,"" Blanc told us. About that coffee comparison Whether that translates to one elephant ""by the time you drink your coffee"" depends on if you sip or chug. Yes, we understand the line is a rhetorical flourish, but hey, we’re fact-checkers so we conducted an unscientific Twitter poll to gauge caffeination speeds.  Out of nearly 2,200 respondents, a third said it takes them 15 minutes to finish their java. For these coffee drinkers, that does correspond to one elephant poached by the time they’re done. But for a third of respondents who drink faster, the claim doesn’t hold up.  And for the other third who were more indolent, the claim actually lowballs the amount of elephant deaths. Ivory and elephants Various wildlife groups list demand for ivory as one of, if not the, main reason for the decimation of African elephants. But recent reports suggest poaching may be on the decline, which may push this coffee factoid further from reality. When Europeans began colonizing Africa in the 1800s, there were an estimated 26 million elephants before the world gained an appetite for their tusks. Americans consumed 200 tons of ivory — used to make combs, art, pool balls and piano keys — per year in the early part of the 20th century and the elephant population had declined to an estimated 10 million. According to the first comprehensive survey of the species conducted by zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the population had dwindled to 1.3 million in 1979 and fell to 600,000 within a decade. This poaching crisis, said Allgood of the IFAW, led CITES to ban the international ivory trade in 1989. Then the overall elephant population rebounded from just 286,000 in 1995 to 472,000 in 2007 before a resurgence of the crisis.  According to a CITES report, illegal ivory trade activity and the weight of the ivory more than doubled since 2007 as a result of rising demand from growing Asian economies. The area hardest hit has been Central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon, where illegal sales help fund war and terrorism. Today, the outlook looks slightly brighter for elephants as killings have declined since the peak in 2011, CITES reports. That’s important to note for two reasons. First, the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences study cited by IFAW includes the peak year of 2011. Second, a decline in more recent years would knock down the total number of elephants poached. Furthermore, China, the world’s biggest ivory consumer, and the United States agreed to enact a complete ban on ivory in the fall of 2015. Our ruling Kelly said, ""By the time you drink your coffee, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks."" The group behind this claim, the International Fund for Animal Welfare, is trying to draw attention to a real problem by boiling down complex research into a simple-to-use factoid. But they are testing limits of the research they’re citing. The study measured three years and estimated that about 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers in that time period. Experts caution against taking those figures -- which rely on estimates -- and boiling them down in the way IFAW did. And since that study concluded, other research suggests that poaching has declined. And, it should be obvious, but this only really matters if you take 15 minutes to drink a cup of coffee.

Treasury Secretary Lew says about 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year
","Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew is urging Congress to pass legislation to deal with Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, saying that without action the economy and welfare of the U.S. territory will continue to deteriorate. During an interview on the Bloomberg network, Lew said that Puerto Rican hospitals are ill-equipped to deal with the spread of the Zika virus, that schools are closing and that the failing economy is driving people out. ""You have broad economic stress causing people to leave the island,"" Lew said May 3, 2016. ""Almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year."" For an island with a total population around 3.5 million, that’s a serious exodus. We decided to see if Lew was right. Looking at the data Census data shows a small, but steady increase in the number of people leaving Puerto Rico for the mainland. More than 360,000 people went from Puerto Rico to the United States btween 2010 and 2014. However, the Census data isn’t out for 2015, which is the year Lew was talking about. So where did Lew get that figure? The estimate comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which tracks passengers departing from and arriving to the island. The Treasury Department has relied on this data before, according to department spokesperson Daniel Watson.  The data show about 90,000 more people left Puerto Rico for the United States than came in.    *The American Community Survey showing total out-migration of Puerto Rico to the US mainland **T-100 Domestic Market Data (US Carriers)      None of this data includes people leaving Puerto Rico for somewhere other than the United States. Islanders mostly tend to head to the mainland, however, countries in Latin America, the Dominican Republic and Spain have been attracting Puerto Ricans as well. So the total number of migrants leaving the island is actually larger. Recent qualitative interviews by researchers from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies found that the people leaving Puerto Rico in the greatest numbers are nurses, paramedics, police officers, teachers, college professors and lawyers. They are often recruited and going to states with growing Hispanic populations in need of bilingual professionals. The surge in departures has led to the social media tag #yonomequito (""I am not going anywhere""). On Facebook this movement has been liked by 70,000 people. Our ruling  Lew said that ""almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year."" That appears to be close. Airline data suggests about 89,000 more people departed Puerto Rico for the United States then entered it in 2015. While that’s not a perfect estimate to measure out-migration, all the population trends suggest Puerto Rico is experiencing a surge in out-migration, as residents leave for better jobs and prospects in the United States.

Pat Buchanan’s Mostly False Claim About The Language Californians Speak At Home
"," Pat Buchanan, a conservative commentator and backer of Republican Donald Trump for president, believes America is losing its ethnic identity. He says that identity is tied to the English language. In a recent interview on NPR about America’s changing ethnic and linguistic makeup, Buchanan spoke about the large share of Californians who speak a foreign language at home. ""We created a really united country where 97 percent of us spoke English in 1960,"" Buchanan said in the interview on May 5, 2016. ""Now in half the homes in California, people speak a language other than English in their own homes."" We checked the second part of Buchanan’s statement, about the percentage of Californians who speak a foreign language at home. It’s a claim that was close to correct on the numbers, but wrongly implies that half the state does not speak English. Close by the numbers Nearly 44 percent of Californians age 5 or older spoke a language other than English at home as of 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That doesn’t mean they speak a foreign language exclusively at home. Data on the percentage of ""homes"" where a foreign language is spoken is harder to find. But after crunching some 2014 census figures, Steven Camarota, director of research for the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told us that 48.3 percent of households in California ""have at least one person who speaks a language other than English at home."" ""I would call it half,"" Camarota said in an email. He added that foreign language households are often undercounted during census surveys. More to the story Buchanan’s statement is not far from the truth, when examining the numbers alone. But he ignores figures about how many Californians speak English proficiently. Nineteen percent in the state report having limited English language skills, the highest share of any state in the nation, followed by 14 percent in Texas and 13 percent in New York, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That means, however, that more than 80 percent of Californians report having a stronger set of English language skills, or speaking the language ""very well."" Proficiency levels offer a more accurate look at how California and its many immigrants are adopting the country’s primary language, said Laura Hill, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, who studies immigrant populations. Buchanan’s claim about foreign language speakers includes many who Hill said ""could be completely fluent in Spanish and English or English and Vietnamese. They could have really high levels of English fluency."" Hill added that ""If you’re trying to make a point about immigrant integration, you’re going to be more interested in understanding not how many people speak a different language, but how many don’t speak English very well."" When we asked Buchanan to explain his statement, his representative sent us links to news articles that say more than half of Los Angeles, but not California as a whole, speaks a foreign language at home. Buchanan made two runs for the Republican presidential nomination, coming up short in 1992 and 1996. He also ran a failed bid for president in 2000 as a Reform Party candidate. Our ruling  During a conversation on NPR, Pat Buchanan said ""In half the homes in California, people speak a language other than English in their own homes."" Looking at the numbers alone, he’s close to correct. But he fails to note that many of those who speak a foreign language at home also are fluent in English. He also omits the fact that only 19 percent of Californians, not half, are considered limited English speakers. Buchanan’s statement contains some element of truth, but in the context of his conversation, it wrongly implies that half the state does not speak English.

Nickie Antonio says restrictive abortion laws actually drive up abortions and fatalities

While GOP lawmakers focused their energy last year on abortion legislation, some have fought those laws with similar conviction.

Antonio recently attempted to contrast the GOP’s agenda with a resolution to designate a week in January as ""Reproductive Rights Awareness Week."" The aim of the resolution is to promote public awareness and support ""reproductive rights and justice."" During a Jan. 24 news conference to announce the resolution, Antonio talked about the dangers associated with restrictive abortion laws.

""Statistics bear out that any time a country, a state, makes more restrictive abortion laws — restricts women’s access to comprehensive reproductive health care — fatalities go up and abortions actually increase,"" Antonio said.

Abortion is an emotional issue that has been a persistent topic of discussion as Ohio lawmakers have considered several abortion-related bills for the last year-plus.

Antonio’s statement raised PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity because she was suggesting that the anti-abortion bills Ohio Republicans have supported would actually cause an increase in abortions.

Since the beginning of last year, Republican lawmakers who control the Senate and the House of Representatives have approved a late-term abortion ban and legislation that makes it more difficult for minors to obtain abortions without their parents’ permission. The late-term ban prohibits abortions when a pregnancy is 20 weeks along unless a doctor determines a fetus cannot live outside the womb — a condition known as viability.

The House of Representatives also has approved a controversial ""heartbeat bill"" which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Senate has not yet voted on the measure.

PolitiFact Ohio contacted Antonio’s office for evidence to back up her claim. Her staff cited a recent study published Jan. 19 in The Lancet, a British medical journal published since 1823. The study, ""Induced abortion: incidence and trends worldwide from 1995 to 2008,"" examined abortion rates and the corresponding abortion laws on a country-by-country basis.

The study, authored by Gilda Sedgh of the Guttmacher Institute in New York, addressed international abortion laws and, to an extent, fatalities related to abortion.  

It concluded that restrictive abortion laws did not coincide with lower abortion rates; that rates were higher in regions of the world where abortion is illegal. The study’s findings do not connect restrictive abortion laws to fewer abortions. But neither does the study show that these laws lead to more abortions, as Antonio claimed.

Sedgh said in an e-mail that the Lancet study did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between restrictive abortion laws and abortions. She said lower abortion rates in countries with liberal abortion laws could be attributed to easier access to affordable contraception.

""In other words, the abortion laws don’t cause the abortion rates,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""The abortion laws appear to be irrelevant when it comes to what women do in the face of an unintended pregnancy.""

Regarding fatalities, the study said nations with more liberal abortion laws tend to see fewer health consequences from unsafe abortion. It cited a drop in abortion mortality in South Africa when its law was liberalized, and in Nepal after the country made abortion legal on broad grounds.

The Lancet study did not examine abortion laws of individual states. In fact, one of the study’s authors said Ohio would still be considered to have ""liberal"" abortion laws if it passed the controversial heartbeat bill.

""So, even if that legislation were passed, Ohio would be classified as having a liberal abortion law. The gestational limit would however, be somewhat severe compared to those in other countries with liberal laws,"" Sedgh wrote in an e-mail.

PolitiFact Ohio checked further with advocates on both sides of the abortion issue for guidance about the impact of states’ abortion laws.

Michael Gonidakis, executive director of Ohio Right to Life, said Antonio’s claim is baseless because Ohio’s abortion rate has been declining for the last 10 years. The Ohio Department of Health’s most recent annual report on abortions confirms the number of abortions has declined each year from 2001 (37,464) to 2010 (28,123).

Gonidakis’ point, however, does not directly address Antonio’s claim because the statistics he cited predate the anti-abortion laws, passed last year, that have driven the current abortion debate in Columbus.

Jaime Miracle, the policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said she knows of no studies that examined states’ abortion laws and their corresponding abortion rates. ""The problem is there really isn’t domestic research on that,"" she said.

Miracle, who attended the Jan. 24 news conference with Antonio, said The Lancet study and others support Antonio’s general claim – that restricting access to abortion and reproductive health care does not reduce incidents of abortion.

But that does not mean those restrictive laws increase abortion rates, and we did not find research that reached such a conclusion.

Miracle provided us with a copy of a study by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good. The 2008 study looked at the effect of socioeconomic factors on abortion.

""There is little evidence that state policies restricting access to abortion (such as enforced informed and parental consent laws and partial birth abortion legislation affect the abortion rate,"" the study said.

So where does that leave Antonio’s claim that when abortion restrictions are enacted, fatalities go up and abortions actually increase?

Her statement contains an element of truth. The study her staff cited from The Lancet did find that restrictive abortion laws did not coincide with lower abortion rates and that rates tended to be higher in countries where abortion is illegal.

Regarding fatalities, the study noted that abortion mortality in one country, South Africa, dropped as the country’s abortion laws became less restrictive. In Nepal, abortion mortality fell as abortion became legal.

But the study did not specifically say that more restrictive laws drive up abortion rates and fatalities, as Antonio claimed. One of the study’s authors, in fact, specifically said the study did not establish that cause-and-effect relationship and that other factors were in play.

Nor did the study look at abortion rates and fatalities for individual states -- something Antonio mentioned in her statement.

Those are critical facts that would give a different impression.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Antonio’s claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/10/nickie-antonio/nickie-antonio-says-restrictive-abortion-laws-actu/
"['Tennessee', 'Redistricting', 'Ron Ramsey']","
Senate speaker repeatedly claims 2012 redistricting was the most open, interactive and transparent in Tennessee history
","
It was Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey’s mantra – Open! Transparent! – from Jan. 4 when state legislative redistricting plans were first made public through Jan. 13 when they won final legislative approval.

Starting last year, Republican legislative leaders drove home their message that their first time in complete charge of redistricting in Tennessee would result in political boundaries that were ""legal and fair"" and that the process would be ""the most open, interactive and transparent…in Tennessee history."" Ramsey said so in various forms -- in a Jan. 4 press release, again nine days later when it passed and again in an email Jan. 27 announcing that street-level maps for the districts were available.

Mark Norris, the Senate Republican majority leader from Collierville, backed up his speaker on Jan. 10 when he presented details of the redistricting plans to the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first time, ""It’s been an open process.""

Despite the rhetoric, Jan. 27 was the first moment in the five-month process of drawing and approving new districts that Tennesseans could zoom in on their homes on the Internet and -- particularly for those living near district boundaries -- determine precisely which state House, Senate and congressional districts they’ll be voting in for the next 10 years. That was two weeks after the maps were adopted – too late to contact legislators or appear before a committee to try to alter the outcome. Maps posted Jan. 4 and Jan. 6 were broader ""concept"" maps with no street-level views.

To nobody’s surprise, Democrats accustomed to running redistricting the previous four decades were outraged -- none more so than Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen, who said he was blindsided by the Republican decision to partition Memphis. The Democratic-backed Tennessee Citizen Action called the process ""as transparent as a smoke-filled room.""

But nonpartisan groups like the League of Women Voters of Tennessee, an organization that encourages informed participation in government, cried foul on what it called the Republicans’ ""take it or leave it plan."" The League said the process ""certainly lacks transparency and accountability. We do not … necessarily believe this process is worse than previous legislative efforts. We do believe, however, that the secret discussions which lead to this ‘take it or leave it plan’ do not serve the public interest.""

It’s worth noting here that 21 states have created various kinds of independent, bipartisan redistricting commissions the League prefers, but Tennessee has avoided that approach.

Dick Williams, president of the citizens’ action group Common Cause of Tennessee, said the 2011-12 redistricting process ""was a mixed bag. I couldn't say it was the most open but I wouldn't say it was the least open either. They did set up a process where people could comment but did not make anything available until the last minute about their plans. And for the public to submit any significant suggestions, they had to submit maps for the whole state. The public and even Democratic legislators, except for some information about their individual districts, had very little information until the last week or so of voting on the bills.""

Williams a volunteer legislative lobbyist for his organization since the 1970s, said the bottom line is that despite ""some aspects"" being ""a little more open,"" he believes ""it's a stretch to claim that this was the most open process.""

Ramsey’s contention that the current redistricting was the most open in Tennessee history spans 216 years of statehood, but we need focus only on the last 50 years because the legislature ignored constitutional mandates until courts forced it to redistrict every 10 years starting in the 1960s.

We went to hard-copy clip archives of The Commercial Appeal and the Knoxville News Sentinel to review news coverage of the legislature’s redistricting efforts of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. To be sure, the articles underscore that the work of actually drawing the initial maps presented for legislative debate often occurred behind closed doors. But once those first maps were unveiled in each of the previous cycles, there was far more public give and take in the legislative committees and on the House and Senate floors – sometimes drawn out over weeks and months -- than what we saw last month. We found that for each of those decades, there are thick stacks of articles filled with coverage of committee and floor debates and public hearings.

Adam Kleinheider, a spokesman for Ramsey, sent us an email that pointed to an initiative by the House and Senate that gave citizens with online access the basic population data and guidelines citizens needed to draw and submit new maps. ""In previous redistricting cycles, only a handful of Tennesseans had access to redistricting data and software,"" he said.

Kleinheider blamed Democrats for not participating, saying they did not submit ideas until the ""last hour of debate on the floor."" He says ""some of the Democrats’ better ideas"" were incorporated, that it passed on a ""bipartisan vote"" and that even Nashville’s Democratic Congressman, Jim Cooper, offered praise for ""open-mindedness"" on the congressional map.

""This redistricting process gave every Tennessean, and every legislator, the opportunity to be involved -- and let good ideas rise to the top,"" Kleinheider said.

But Kleinheider glosses over requirements for public participation that seem burdensome for even the savviest of citizens; as Common Cause noted, you had to submit technical maps for the entire state -- not just a suggestion that your community be kept intact in the same district.

Some other factors to consider: 
--Ramsey appointed only three Senate Republican leaders to draw the Senate maps, a partisan committee that he chaired. His predecessor, the late Speaker John Wilder, in the two previous cycles appointed bipartisan committees (four Democrats and three Republicans in 1991, three Democrats and two Republicans in 2001), meaning that the minority party had participated and was privy to the details. When the Ramsey-appointed, all-GOP Senate panel made public its 2012 plan on Jan. 4, most Democratic senators and some Republicans had not seen it. 
--The state House and congressional district boundaries were also drawn by small, all-GOP committees. House Democrats were shown only ""concept maps"" of their individual districts, but not statewide plans. 
--Except for the first organizational meetings of the House and Senate redistricting committees, none of the work of the committees occurred in public. The maps unveiled on Jan. 4 and Jan. 6 were the first seen by the public. 
--Lawmakers rushed to passage this year in record time, with little time for public review and input. The legislative maps were unveiled Jan. 4, the congressional maps Jan. 6, and all three were approved Jan. 13. Even Ramsey acknowledged that he did not meet his promise last fall that the new maps would be released by early December.",/factchecks/2012/feb/10/ron-ramsey/senate-speaker-repeatedly-claims-2012-redistrictin/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden claims college tuition rose 300 percent over 20 years
","
Vice President Joe Biden spoke at Florida State University in Tallahassee about a proposal by President Barack Obama to make college tuition more affordable.

Obama proposed giving less federal aid to students who go to colleges that increase costs. But Florida’s public universities already have some of the lowest rates in the nation, even though state legislators may hike tuition, as they have done in the past several years.

College students and administrators fear that Obama’s plan means that Florida schools would be penalized even though they boast low prices -- 45th in the nation.

During his visit on Feb. 6, 2012, Biden acknowledged that the problem in Florida isn’t as critical as it is nationwide.

""Nationwide, tuition at public universities is up almost 300 percent. You are an exception here at Florida State. But it’s up almost 300 percent in the last 20 years,"" Biden said.

Later in response to a question by a student about tuition Biden said:

""We are looking forward to make sure the next 20 years they don’t increase 300 percent again. …FSU has great professors. You started from a very low tuition base, and therefore you have gone up slightly, but that is nowhere compared to other schools that started high and went higher.""

That figure -- a nationwide increase of 300 percent over 20 years -- is massive so we wanted to check if it was right.

Source of 300 percent figure

We turn to the College Board’s Trends in College Pricing 2011 report for an answer. (The College Board is a nonprofit association of universities and colleges; it also owns the famous SAT test.) Their report is based on surveys sent to nearly 4,000 post-secondary institutions across the country and historical data from the U.S. Department of Education and National Center for Education Statistics.

The prices are averages paid by students for one year of full-time enrollment.

For the 1991-92 school year, tuition and fees at a four year public university on average were $2,107. They climbed to $8,244 in 2011-12 -- an increase of about 291 percent.  (Figures are for tuition and fees but not room or board.)

The College Board also provides data in ""constant dollars,"" which are adjusted for inflation. Those numbers showed an increase from $3,495 to $8,244, or about 136 percent.

Biden used the more dramatic figure here -- the nearly 300 percent based on the numbers not adjusted for inflation. (And technically, these figures include 21 years of data, not 20, but we won’t count off for that.)

We asked Jennifer Ma, co-author of the Trends in College Pricing report, to explain the difference between current and constant dollars and if one is a better resource.

""Numbers in current dollars are not adjusted for inflation and numbers in constant dollars are adjusted for inflation,"" Ma wrote in an email. ""We usually use numbers in constant dollars to show the increases beyond the rate of inflation. The constant dollars numbers make it easier to compare prices over time. … However, people sometimes talk about prices in current dollars.""

Florida’s tuition 
Since Biden was discussing national policy while visiting Florida, it’s worth looking at tuition at Florida’s four-year public colleges compared to the rest of the nation.

During 1991-92, the state’s tuition for public four-year colleges was $1,484 -- about seven states had a lower dollar amount. By 2011-12, tuition rose to $5,626, an increase of 279 percent. That was a higher rate of growth than about 24 states. (The U.S. Department of Education sent us a chart based on data from the National Center for Education Statistics and the College Board.) 
We don’t really know yet what the federal plan means for Florida. Biden is right that Florida has lower tuition compared to other states, but even Florida has seen prices go up significantly in recent years.  
Our ruling

Biden said ""Nationwide, tuition at public universities is up almost 300 percent ... in the last 20 years."" The College Board’s data shows that between 1991-92 and 2011-12, it increased by about 291 percent for public four-year universities in current dollars -- one valid way of measuring tuition hikes. Adjusted for inflation, however, tuition hasn’t gone up quite that fast -- it’s up 136 percent.

Sen. George Barker says McDonnell's budget cuts pre-kindergarten program
","
Democrats say Gov. Bob McDonnell wants to slash a state program that helps disadvantaged 4-year olds prepare for kindergarten.

""Particularly short-sighted are cuts to pre-Kindergarten programs that put disadvantaged children on a path to success,"" said Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, in his party’s response to McDonnell’s state of the commonwealth address on Jan. 11.

Barker was referring to proposed changes to the Virginia Preschool Initiative, which teaches social and learning skills to 4-year-olds who will become eligible for free or reduced lunch programs when they enter public schools. The pre-K program is open to at-risk children who live above the poverty line and therefore do not qualify for the federal Head Start program.

Is Barker correct in saying the governor has proposed cutting money from the pre-school program? We took a look.

First, we turned to the budget numbers. The state allocated $65.1 million for the pre-K initiative this school year, although the money may be reduced slightly because of lower-than-anticipated enrollment.  

McDonnell’s 2013 budget proposes $68.2 million or the program, followed by $68.5 million in 2014. So in terms of raw dollars, Barker’s claim doesn’t hold up.

But Barker said we needed to dig deeper. He offered two pieces of evidence to support his claim: 1) McDonnell’s budget would fund the initiative far below the levels urged by the state Board of Education, and 2) The governor has proposed a new method to estimate the number of children eligible for the program that would cut slots in the future.

The Board of Education recommended the state spend $215.7 million for the pre-K initiative during the two-year-budget cycle that starts July 1. The board assumed that every eligible child would enroll.  

But the program is voluntary: divisions can opt in or out and children can show up or not. In recent years, about 70 percent of eligible children have participated. The legislature has funded the programs on anticipated 75 percent participation.

Under McDonnell’s proposal, which assumes partial participation, Virginia would spend about $80 million less for pre-K than the Board of Education urged over the biennium. But the board does not appropriate money, it only makes recommendations to the General Assembly. So it’s a stretch for Barker to say McDonnell cut the program based on the governor’s rejection of a funding recommendation that was far above the legislature’s existing appropriation.

McDonnell, we note again, is asking the legislature to slightly increase spending on the initiative over the next two years.

Now, let’s look at Barker’s second assertion: that McDonnell has proposed a new way of  estimating enrollment that would shortchange the pre-kindergarten program. The state has traditionally relied on a computation of the Virginia Employment Commission’s population estimate of 4-year-olds in each locality factored with economic demographics.

McDonnell wants to base the estimate solely on the number of kindergartners in each public school division that qualify for free and reduced-cost lunch programs at schools.

Barker and other Democrats say McDonnell’s method would result in low estimates of at-risk 4-year-olds, because using a public school kindergarten count excludes children who attend private school or are home schooled.

For the school year starting this fall, the traditional formula would lead to an estimated 28,777 Virginia children eligible for the pre-K initiative. That number includes an estimated 4,334 additional children who will qualify for the service because of new federal standards that expand eligibility for free and reduced school lunches.

McDonnell’s proposed budget assumes 24,483 children will eligible for the pre-K-program next school year. He is proposing funding for 18,256 children in 2013 and 18,391 in 2014.
That would allow for increases from this year’s statewide enrollment of 16,618.

But there’s a catch. Under McDonnell’s formula, 27 localities would lose state money for 1,135 pre-K slots that are now occupied, according to analysis by the Department of Education. The governor has proposed a short-term solution that essentially protects the municipalities from a loss in pre-K funding over the next two school years.

Barker points out that once the guarantee expires in 2015, the 27 localities would lose state funding for those slots. Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications, said McDonnell will consider that issue in two years when he submits a new biennial budget to the legislature.

Our ruling:

Barker, speaking for fellow Democrats in the General Assembly, said the governor’s budget makes ""cuts to pre-Kindergarten programs.""

Bottom-line budget numbers do not support the senator’s claim. McDonnell’s budget would provide more than a $3 million annual increase to pre-K spending.

The governor’s spending plan also contains a new method for the state to estimate the number of four-year-olds who would participate in the pre-K program. McDonnell has ensured that the number of slots available to at-risk preschoolers would increase during the next two budget years. But starting in 2015, as Barker notes, the policy would result in about one-fifth of localities losing state funding for some of the children they serve.

Barker’s statement contains an element of truth in that some cities and counties eventually could suffer under McDonnell’s pre-K proposal. But it ignores the larger fact that the program would expand in most of the state.

Most Hispanics support the DREAM Act, but Marco Rubio does not
","
With speculation that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio may end up in the veep slot on the Republican presidential ticket, a left-leaning political group is taking out ads in Florida to say that the Hispanic vote isn’t automatically his for the taking.

""Marco Rubio just might become the first Latino on the presidential ticket,"" the ad from Presente Action begins. ""With the tea party and others attacking immigrants, does Marco Rubio stand with Latinos?""

The ad goes on to juxtapose polling results against video of Rubio discussing his own political positions.

The ad: ""81 percent of Latinos oppose SB 1070, Arizona’s racial profiling law.""

Rubio: ""Arizona’s going to do what’s in the best interest of the people of Arizona. They have a right to do that, and I respect that.""

The ad: ""88 percent of Latinos support legalization for undocumented immigrants.""

Rubio: ""I am not and I will never support -- never have and never will support -- any effort to grant blanket legalization.""

The ad: ""91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college.""

Rubio: ""People in the United States who are here without documents should not benefit from programs like in-state tuition.""

The ad concludes, ""When it comes to voting for what we care about most, no somos Rubios."" Translation: ""We’re not Rubios,"" which flashes as text in English.

The ad is now running on television in Florida, and Presente Action is fundraising off the ad on its website. Roberto Lovato, the group’s co-founder, told us that the ad may run nationally in the future.

We’re putting one statement on our meter -- that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act and Rubio does not -- but we’ll look at the accuracy of the other claims as well.

A note on methodology: We found many national polls that looked at general public opinion on these issues, and those polls included Hispanic respondents.

But polls on the opinions of Hispanics as a group must have enough Hispanic respondents to be statistically valid, and most general polls do not meet this standard.

However, we were able to find two major polling groups that focused on Hispanics: the Pew Hispanic Center and Latino Decisions. When we asked Presente to back up the ad’s claims, it pointed to various polls from these two groups.

The Arizona law

The ad says that ""81 percent of Latinos oppose SB 1070, Arizona’s racial profiling law."" That’s a somewhat loaded way to describe the 2010 law, which enlists local police authorities in cracking down on illegal immigration. Supporters of the law have said it seeks to avoid racial profiling.

Most of the polls we found about the Arizona law dated back to 2010, the year the law was passed. Courts have blocked some of the law’s provisions from going into effect, and litigation is ongoing.

Presente pointed us to a 2010 poll from Latino Decisions for the National Council of La Raza and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), two groups that opposed the law. That poll was only for Hispanics in Arizona. It found that 70 percent were strongly opposed, and another 11 percent were somewhat opposed, for a total of 81 percent.

Pew Hispanic Center polled Hispanics nationwide on the issue, though, also in 2010. It found an almost identical level of opposition to the law at 79 percent.

In 2011, Latino Decisions asked Hispanics nationwide if they would support state laws that would ""require state and local police to check on immigration status."" The poll found 56 percent strongly disapproved and 12 percent somewhat disapproved, for a total of 68 percent. That’s still strong opposition, but slightly lower than results from 2010.

Legalization for undocumented immigrants

The ad claimed that 88 percent of Latinos ""support legalization for undocumented immigrants.""

The Pew Hispanic Center poll from 2011 asked the question this way: ""What should be the priority for dealing with illegal immigration in the U.S. -- a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants; better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws; or both should be given equal priority?""

Pew found that 46 percent supported both a path to citizenship and better border security; another 42 percent said just a path to citizenship. So a total of 88 percent supported a path to citizenship overall.

Latino Decisions conducted a poll in January 2012 with Univision News and ABC. It asked what government policy should be toward undocumented immigrants. In this poll, 71 percent supported earned citizenship, 14 percent supported a guest worker program and 11 percent said undocumented immigrants should be considered felons. Adding the answers for legalization of some type, the total is 85 percent.

The DREAM Act

The ad said, ""91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college."" The DREAM Act stands for ""Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors.""

The DREAM Act would have provided a path to permanent residency for young adults brought to the United States illegally as children. The young people would have to meet certain requirements, such as going to school or joining the military. In some states, they would qualify for in-state tuition at public universities.

The Pew Hispanic Center’s 2011 poll found that 91 percent of Latinos favored the DREAM Act when it asked the question this way: ""Thinking about immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children … Would you favor or oppose a law that would let these young adults become legal residents if they go to college or serve in the military for two years?""

The Latino Decisions 2012 poll asked this way: ""Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?"" It found that 66 percent strongly supported the law, and another 19 percent somewhat supported the law, for a total of 85 percent.

The margin of error for both polls was about 4 percentage points, which makes the results very close.

Rubio’s views

In recent months, Rubio has urged that Republicans tone down heated rhetoric on immigration policy.

""The Republican Party needs to be the pro-legal immigration party,"" Rubio said in October. ""We need to say, 'We believe in immigration, and we think it's good for America.' But it has to be orderly, a system based on law, a system that works.""

Still, as a U.S. senator he has opposed the federal DREAM Act and policies that could lead to citizenship for illegal immigrants. On the Arizona law, he initially expressed concern, but later said he was comfortable with changes made prior to it becoming law.

We sent the ad to Rubio’s staff for comment, but we didn’t hear back.

One other interesting point: Latino Decisions asked Hispanic voters in January if they would be more or less likely to vote for the Republican ticket for president if Rubio had the vice presidential spot.

Nationally, 25 percent said they would be more likely to vote for the ticket, while 47 percent said it would make no difference. Another 19 percent said less likely.

Florida Latinos, who are more familiar with Rubio, answered that 43 percent would be more likely to vote Republican with Rubio on the ticket, while 31 percent said it would make no difference. Another 20 percent said less likely.

The ad doesn’t seem to be making electoral predictions. Rather, it seems to be making its factual points and asking viewers to draw their own conclusions.

Our ruling

For the Truth-O-Meter, we’re checking the claim that ""91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college,"" while Rubio opposes the program. The Pew Hispanic Center’s polling found that to be the case, and Latino Decisions found a very similar high number of 85 percent. As a U.S. senator, Rubio has opposed the DREAM Act. We rate the ad’s statement True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/09/presente/most-hispanics-support-dream-act-marco-rubio-does-/

Email claim that Obama canceled National Day of Prayer ceremony contains numerous errors
","
The people behind a chain email circulating in New Jersey about President Barack Obama and the National Day of Prayer might want to think about the sin of omission.

That’s omission, as in omitting facts.

The email, received Jan. 30 by PolitiFact New Jersey, claimed in 2010 that Obama canceled a National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House in 2009, but later that year a National Day of Prayer for Muslims was permitted on Capitol Hill, beside the White House.

The email reads, in part:

""This year President Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House under the ruse of ‘not wanting to offend anyone,’"" the email reads. ""BUT … on September 25, 2009 from 4 AM until 7 PM, a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION was HELD on Capitol Hill, Beside the White House.""

Most of the claims in the email don’t have a prayer of being accurate, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

There are several statements to address. Let’s start with the origins of the National Day of Prayer, which is an annual observance for people of all faiths.

President Harry Truman established the day as a national event in 1952. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a resolution designating the first Thursday in May as the National Day of Prayer. Every president since – including Obama – has issued a proclamation to recognize the day.

Obama, however, has not held the National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush had for eight years. Presidents George H.W. Bush held one, in 1989, and Reagan also held one, in 1982. President Bill Clinton had none. So, there have not been 21 annual National Day of Prayer ceremonies, as the email claims.

In fact-checking this email, we found at least 30 published reports in a basic Google search debunking various claims in it. While those reports confirm that Obama decided against the public White House ceremony, none state exactly why. In a May 7, 2009 CNN  video, a representative with the Christian Broadcast Network speculated the cancelation might stem from publicity about controversial comments once made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama’s longtime pastor in Chicago. Other articles imply that a statement in Obama’s inaugural speech about inclusivity of all religions and nonreligions in the United States might have been a factor.

At the time, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said of Obama’s plans on the National Day of Prayer, ""Privately, he’ll pray as he does every day.""

The same is expected this year.

""As he has done each of the last three years, President Obama will continue to recognize the National Day of Prayer,"" White House spokesman Brandon Lepow said in an email.

Next, let’s review the claim about ""a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION"" being held ""on Capitol Hill, Beside the White House.""

The Jummah Prayer on Capitol Hill event was a one-time only activity coordinated by the Dar-ul-Islam mosque in Elizabeth to ""clear up myths about Muslims,"" said Imam Ali Jaaber, who attended the Sept. 25, 2009 event. It was never billed as a National Day Of Prayer.

Hassen Abdellah, board president at Dar-ul-Islam, organized the event in response to positive remarks by Obama in his inaugural speech and during another speech five months later in Egypt about welcoming and acknowledging the presence of Muslims in the United States, Jaaber said.

Also, Capitol Hill is approximately one mile from the White House – not beside it. And, Muslim is not a religion. A person who follows the religion Islam is a Muslim. 
Our ruling

A chain email circulating in New Jersey that Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony in 2009 but a National Day of Prayer for Muslims was held later that year on Capitol Hill is full of inaccuracies. While it’s true that Obama did not hold a public ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush did, it’s untrue that the ceremony would have been the 21st annual event. But wait – there’s more: the email’s author incorrectly located Capitol Hill as ""beside"" the White House and identified Muslim as a religion. Despite the numerous errors in the email, it does contain an element of truth -- and that fits the Truth-O-Meter’s definition for Mostly False.

Could Ohio schools really cut five weeks of classes under a Statehouse proposal?
","
Imagine if Ohio's lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer lasted longer.

Now imagine that a vote of the General Assembly could make it happen.

That, in a sense, is the idea behind House Bill 191 -- at least for Ohio schools.

The legislation would delay the start of the school year until Labor Day and end it before Memorial Day.

It also would change the formula for figuring a minimum school year. Now districts are required to schedule 182 days. The legislation would change that to require schools be in session 910 hours, for kindergarten through grade 6, and 1,001 hours for grades 7 through 12.

Rep. Bill Patmon, a Cleveland Democrat,  co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Bill Hayes, a Republican from Licking County, east of Columbus.

Hayes told The Columbus Dispatch the primary intent of a longer summer break was to help tourism and recreation, the state's third-largest industry -- ""and also generate revenue for the state, part of which gets passed down to the school.""

Representatives of the Ohio School Boards Association, the Ohio Association of School Business Officials and a local school district testified against HB 191 before the House Education Committee on Feb. 1.

Marc Schare of the Worthington Board of Education, which passed a resolution asking the General Assembly and Gov. Kasich to reject the bill, said it would ""cause a significant reduction to the quality of education"" in Ohio.

He said that would allow Worthington schools to reduce the number of days to 151 from the current 178.

""You are essentially allowing us to shave five full weeks off the school year,"" Schare said.

PolitiFact Ohio feared for the integrity of the space-time continuum. We wondered how starting classes after Labor Day would trim the school year more than a month -- especially after Hayes claimed the bill could lengthen the year  in ""many districts.""

We called Schare. He explained his reasoning and pointed us to the more detailed testimony posted on his website.

First, he noted, HB 191 converts the minimum school year from days to hours using a 5.5 hours for a standard secondary-school day, excluding lunch. That works out to a minimum school year of 979 hours, or 178 days. (The minimum year of 182 days -- or 1,001 hours at 5.5 hours per day -- includes days when classes aren't in session because of parent-teacher conferences or professional programs.)

In his district of Worthington, Schare said, the school day at the secondary level is 6.5 hours. A chart from The Columbus Dispatch that he posted online with his testimony shows that most of the districts in Central Ohio have similar school days.

""This means that in a typical year, under this legislation, we would be in school 178 hours above the minimum, which works out to around 27 days,"" he said. ""In other words, this legislation is giving Worthington carte blanche to reduce the number of days in our school district calendar from 178 to 151 days.

""Running the calculation another way for clarity, if we take the minimum number of hours -- 979 -- and divide it by our school day length of 6.5, we get 150 and change.

""You are,"" he concluded, ""essentially permitting us to shave 5 full weeks off the school year.""

Schare said his larger concern is that districts would start dropping days off the school year. ""Virtually every district is at the  minimum days now,"" he told the committee. ""Eventually they would get there (to a new, shorter minimum) through collective bargaining or because of financial constraints.""

He pointed to the experience of Michigan, which in 2003 replaced a 180-day minimum school year with a 1,098-hour requirement. Even though that level is nearly 10 percent higher than the one in HB 191, 98 percent of Michigan's districts shortened the school year within three years.

To stop the erosion, Michigan's legislature last year set a new minimum -- of just 165 days.

We won’t speculate whether that would indeed happen in Ohio. HB 191 has not yet even cleared the Ohio House, let alone win Senate passage and the governor’s signature. And knowing how schools would then react would require the ability to predict the future.

As for Schare's claim about what the bill would allow, his calculations check out. While the numbers he used apply specifically to his Worthington district,  he shows in his posted testimony that most districts in central Ohio would feel similar results.

Regardless, in the statement we're checking, Schare said only that HB 191 would permit the 5-week shorter year, not require it.

Mitt Romney says president told people to skip Vegas conventions
","
Fired up from a victory in Nevada’s caucuses, Mitt Romney used his stump speech in Las Vegas to remind supporters that President Barack Obama has not fixed the state’s economic woes.

""Four years ago, candidate Obama came to Nevada, promising to help. But after he was elected, his help was telling people to skip coming here for conventions and meetings,"" Romney told the crowd at the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa on Feb. 4, 2012.

Did we hear that right? Was the president urging a business boycott of Sin City?

Time for a fact-check.

Obama’s remarks on Vegas

Asked for the source of Romney's remark, his campaign pointed us to this story, which covers the president's prickly history with Las Vegas. 
Romney was right, at least, in saying that Obama has spoken unflatteringly of the city in the past.

Twice he has landed in hot water for grasping at a metaphor linking trips to Vegas with extravagance and irresponsibility.

But was Romney right that the president wasn’t just dissing all-American weekend trips of debauchery to Vegas -- he was hating on business meetings?

On Feb. 11, 2009, Obama spoke about excess on Wall Street to a crowd in Elkhart, Ind.
""You are not going to be able to give out these big bonuses until you pay taxpayers back,"" Obama said. ""You can't get corporate jets. You can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayers' dime. There's got to be some accountability and some responsibility.""

Okay, so CEOs shouldn’t blow federal bailout money at the $10,000 minimum blackjack tables. We get it. But we didn’t hear anything about blowing off conventions.

What else?

A year later, in February 2010, Obama infuriated the oddsmakers again by drawing an analogy between the federal government’s fiscal practices and those of an average family.

""Responsible families don't do their budgets the way the federal government does. Right? When times are tough, you tighten your belts,"" Obama said at a town hall-style meeting in Nashua N.H. ""You don't go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage. You don't blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you're trying to save for college. You prioritize. You make tough choices. It's time your government did the same.""

Please, Mom and Dad, don’t raid our college fund for a night in the Rain Man suite!

Again, the comparison is clear; the reference to conventions and meetings is nonexistent.

The backlash

Obama’s words landed with a loud thud.

The mayor of Las Vegas demanded an apology. Several major companies canceled meetings worth hundreds of thousands of dollars ""not because of costs but because of appearances,"" according to Newsday.

""The president needs to lay off Las Vegas and stop making it the poster child for where people shouldn't be spending their money,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is normally an ally of the president.

""Las Vegas is suffering through one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, and we cannot afford for the president to bring us down any further,"" added Republican Sen. John Ensign.

Obama had to clarify his love of The Strip, telling the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce in February 2010, ""Let me set the record straight: I love Vegas...There you go. Always have. I love Vegas.""

Our ruling

Romney said that Obama told people ""to skip coming here (Las Vegas) for conventions and meetings.""

Obama said heads of corporations shouldn’t use taxpayer money for Vegas jaunts (or corporate jets or Super Bowl excursions or any other flight of luxury paid for by the rest of us). And he said parents shouldn’t spend their money on Vegas trips when they need to be saving for kids’ college.

That could certainly be construed as a rap on tourism. But a suggestion to skip meetings and conventions? The president said no such thing. Romney’s claim, like so much about Las Vegas, was over the top. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-president-told-people-skip-vegas-/

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama is ""shrinking our military""
","
Is President Barack Obama weakening America’s military?

As part of our analysis of a typical Mitt Romney presidential campaign speech, we’ll look at a line he has used about spending on the U.S. military.

""President Obama is shrinking our military and hollowing out our national defense,"" Romney said in a speech after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 4, 2012.

First, the president’s official proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 is scheduled to be released later this month. After that happens, Congress will have to pass spending bills and present them to the president for his signature. So there’s a long way to go before the future course of military spending becomes official.

In addition, we’re at an unusual period in federal budgeting. On Aug. 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 became law (P.L. 112-25). That was the bill that was passed to head off a looming crisis over the federal debt ceiling. The bill -- which cleared the House, 269-161, and the Senate, 74-26 -- established limits on discretionary spending between fiscal years 2012 and 2021.

Some of the budgetary caps mandated by the law were to become effective right away. Other reductions were to be worked out later by a handpicked ""supercommittee"" made up of House members and senators from both parties. However, the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement on how to make the additional cuts, meaning that -- barring some intervening development -- the required budget reductions will be automatic, across-the board cuts. Though some items such as Social Security benefits were exempted from the automatic cuts, the military budget is not exempt.

In other words, a reduction in the military budget was all but destined once the Budget Control Act passed and the supercommittee failed to prevent across-the-board cuts.

It’s important to remember that -- despite Romney’s explicit criticism of Obama -- these actions were carried out by both parties. When the House voted on the Budget Control Act, Republicans voted for it by a 174-66 margin, and when it came up in the Senate, Republicans voted for it by a 28-19 margin. And seats on the supercommittee were equally divided between Democrats and Republicans.

""The administration’s hands are essentially tied,"" said Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""Plenty of Republicans voted for this bill, so they are equally culpable.""

Finally, this is a notable moment for the military budget because the Obama Administration has wound down the U.S. combat presence in Iraq and is aiming to do the same in Afghanistan. This means that money required to fund these operations is poised to decline significantly over the next few years. Iraq cost about $600,000 per troop per year, Harrison said, and Afghanistan costs twice that, once you consider factors including fuel, ammunition, food and support services.

Since war funding isn’t subject to Budget Control Act caps, the distinction between war funding and the regular Pentagon budget needs to be noted. Even so, reductions in overseas operations has historically had an impact on the U.S. military budget.

""Throughout American history, defense spending has risen and fallen in irregular cycles driven in part by changes in the security environment,"" Harrison wrote in a new paper. ""Since the end of World War II, the defense budget has experienced three such cycles following the end of the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Cold War."" (We took a closer look at this phenomenon last year, in a fact check here.)

Now let’s look at the numbers.

The Budget Control Act requires $487 billion in defense cuts over 10 years relative to the level of spending the Pentagon was anticipating a year ago. ""This means that the Obama administration must for the first time propose a real decrease in defense spending from the previous year’s enacted budget,"" Harrison wrote. By contrast, he wrote, the administration proposed real increases for defense in each of its previous budgets.

On top of this initial round of cuts come the automatic cuts required because of the supercommittee's failure. These amount to $472 billion in the defense budget, to be evenly spread across nine years, from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2021. (That works out to an additional annual reduction of $52 billion a year.) The cuts are to take effect Jan. 2, 2013.

The administration has not yet developed a blueprint for living under the across-the-board cuts set in motion by the supercommittee’s failure, but it has discussed some details of its proposal for living under the Budget Control Act’s initial round of spending caps.

Here’s a summary table reproduced from Harrison’s report, showing the ""base discretionary Defense Department budget"" in non-inflation-adjusted dollars. (This chart excludes funding for overseas military operations such as Afghanistan.) 
  
So even before factoring in across-the-board cuts, the administration is requesting $46 billion less for fiscal 2013 than it had projected would be needed when it released its 2012 budget proposal and $6 billion less than Congress enacted for fiscal 2012. Factoring in the across-the-board cuts only makes these declines steeper.

The fiscal 2013 request for overseas military operations -- which is not included in this chart -- amounts to $88.4 billion, mostly in Afghanistan. That’s down from $115 billion for overseas military operations in 2012.

How do these reductions translate into boots on the ground and planes in the sky? On Jan. 26, 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta unveiled highlights of the administration’s budget proposal.

Harrison summarizes it this way: ""Army and Marine Corps end strength will decline by 72,000 and 20,000 respectively, bringing them back to roughly the level they were in 2005. The Army will lose at least eight brigades, two of which will come from Europe. … The Navy will lose some 17 ships ... and the Air Force will cut 10 percent of its 60 fighter squadrons. Overall, $60 billion of the proposed reductions are projected to come from unspecified ‘efficiencies,’ on top of $178 billion in ‘efficiency’ savings projected in last year’s budget. DOD also announced it will propose another round of base closures. Such a move is likely to cost money in the near term and thus does not help the Department achieve the savings it needs"" in the short term.

It’s worth noting that despite the cuts, the size of the base defense budget -- that is, the budget outside of overseas operational costs -- is poised to increase eventually from its low in 2013, at least in non-inflation-adjusted dollars. Still, if the across-the-board cuts are adhered to, the base defense budget in fiscal 2017 would still be $16 billion lower than it was in fiscal 2012.

Our ruling

Romney is right that the military is ""shrinking,"" partly due to a winding down of overseas wars and partly due to congressionally enacted budget limits. But to say, as Romney did, that this is being done by Obama -- without acknowledging Republican actions -- ignores what really happened. A majority of House and Senate Republicans voted for the initial caps in the Budget Control Act, and the supercommittee was evenly divided between the parties, meaning that its failure was bipartisan. So we rate Romney’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-shrinking-our-milita/

Mitt Romney says president promised peak of 8 percent unemployment
","
The night of his victory in the Nevada caucuses, Mitt Romney used his stump speech to stomp on President Barack Obama’s policies and record.

Romney, who led the Republican field by a sizeable margin in a state hammered by unemployment and foreclosures, used those themes to make his case against Obama.

He also repeated a claim we have heard -- and checked -- numerous times.

""Three years ago, a newly elected President Obama told America that if Congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent,"" Romney said in his speech in Las Vegas on Feb. 4, 2012.

It’s a common claim by critics of the stimulus bill, the two-year spending package Obama championed to get the economy going again.

We heard similar statements from House Republican Whip Eric Cantor in 2009, conservative columnist George Will in 2010, former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann in early 2011 and, most recently, from House Speaker John Boehner at the end of 2011.

Each time, we rated the claim Mostly False.

Projection vs. promise

First, we have never found an instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge to keep unemployment below 8 percent. The source for Romney’s and the others’ statements is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser.
   
Their report projected that the stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.
   
The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers.
   
""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""
   
There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.""

Our ruling

Romney didn't use the word ""promise"" as Boehner, Cantor and others did when we checked the same claim previously, but the meaning is the same, that Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had ""significant margins of error"" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not  a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment.

Once again, we rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-president-promised-peak-8-percent/

Mitt Romney says a broader measure of national unemployment exceeds 15 percent
","
The last time we rated a Mitt Romney claim on unemployment, we dinged him with a Half True for using a big number without describing it accurately. This time, he got it right.

In a speech after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 4, 2012, Romney said, ""If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent.""

That's much more accurate than his statement at the Tampa debate on Jan. 23, when he said that ""we have 25 million Americans out of work."" We rated that Half True, concluding that Romney had used a valid number but had described it incorrectly.

Here’s the background.

Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys a cross-section of Americans to determine, among other things, their employment status. The respondents are characterized as either being in the labor force or out of it.

Those who are out of the labor force are not considered as seeking work at present. Some have no intention of working anytime soon -- they may be full-time students, stay-at-home parents, retired or physically unable to work. But others in this category are considered ""marginally attached"" to the labor force. They want work, are available to work and have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months -- but by the BLS definition, they do not qualify as being in the labor force because they have not actively searched for work in the previous four weeks.

Now let’s look at those considered to be in the labor force. They are categorized as either employed or unemployed. The ""employed"" group also has a sub-category -- part-timers who would rather be working full-time but who aren’t due to economic conditions.

For the best-known unemployment rate figure, the BLS divides the total number of the unemployed (that is, those without jobs who are actively looking for work) by the number of people in the labor force (that is, unemployed workers plus employed workers, both full- and part-time).

However, some critics have argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting. So BLS also offers a broader, alternative measure of ""labor underutilization"" known as ""U-6."" It calculates this by dividing the sum of three groups (unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force and working part time for economic reasons) by the sum of the labor force plus marginally attached workers. 
To make this methodology more concrete, let’s compare how those numbers looked in January 2012, the most recent month available.

The regular unemployment rate was 8.3 percent. However, the U-6 rate was significantly higher -- 15.1 percent. The difference stems from the fact that many workers are employed part-time when they’d rather be full-time or have given up looking work, at least for now. (Here's a comparison of various BLS measures.)

So Romney is right when he says that ""if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent."" This is an improvement from his phrasing in the Tampa debate, when he didn’t preface his statistic by noting that he’s referring to the broader, U-6 methodology.

A final bit of context: While it’s certainly bad news to have 15.1 percent of the workforce either unemployed or under-employed, it’s worth noting that this statistic, like the more commonly used unemployment rate, is heading in a favorable direction. After rising as high as 17.2 percent in October 2009, the U-6 is now as low as it’s been since February 2009, the second month of Barack Obama’s presidency.

That said, this level is still historically high. Since the statistic was first published in 1994, it has only broken into double digits for stretches following two previous recessions -- the recessions that hit in 1990-91 and 2001. And the U-6 peaks for those recessions were 11.8 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively -- well below even today’s improved level. 
Our ruling

While the U-6 measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the United States, it’s a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others. It's true that BLS describes it as a ""labor underutilization"" rate rather than an ""unemployment"" rate, since some of the people it counts are part-time workers who aren't officially ""unemployed."" 
While this distinction is important to PhD economists, we don't think it's a major problem for a speech made to the general public. In other words, for a general audience, we think ""the real unemployment rate"" is acceptable shorthand for ""the labor underutilization rate,"" especially when a brief description of the measure is provided. So we rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-broader-measure-national-unemploy/

Ad claims Chris Christie “inherited the highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region”
","
When Gov. Chris Christie took office, New Jersey distinguished itself in two unflattering ways.

The state had the highest taxes in the nation and the worst unemployment in the region, according to a television ad recently released by the 501(c)(4) advocacy group Committee for Our Children’s Future. Now, the group’s ad claims, Christie is working to cast off those unfavorable rankings.

""They inherited the highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region, but Chris Christie and New Jersey reformers are cleaning up the mess,"" the narrator of the ad posted to YouTube on Jan. 31 says. ""The result: the most job growth in 11 years, millions in new education funding, two budgets balanced. Now, Chris Christie and reformers are fighting to strengthen our economy, improve education and cut income taxes for all New Jersey families. So join our reform movement. Keep New Jersey moving forward.""

PolitiFact New Jersey previously checked two ads released by Committee for Our Children’s Future. In those rulings, we found it’s true New Jersey had the most private-sector job growth in 11 years and the governor increased education funding in his latest budget. It’s also true he’s balanced two budgets, as required by law.

Now, we’re assessing the claim that when Christie took office New Jersey had the ""highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region.""

Highest taxes

New Jersey’s taxes are high, but whether they are the highest in the nation is debatable.

Brian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children’s Future, cited an analysis of state and local tax burdens by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax issues.

New Jersey tops a list compiled by the Washington, D.C.-based group for its state and local tax burden. The Tax Foundation defines tax burden as ""effective tax rates calculated by totaling state-local level taxes paid by taxpayers in each state, then dividing by their income.""

In 2009, the year before Christie took office, New Jersey had a state and local tax burden of 12.2 percent. New York was a close second at 12.1 percent, followed by Connecticut at 12 percent.

So, the group is right, according to the Tax Foundation. But other studies on tax burdens show New Jersey isn’t the highest. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio addressed this issue in a September 2010 ruling. They found that tax experts disagree over how best to define tax burden and  ""rankings can vary wildly depending on which taxes are included, which data sets are employed and which projections are applied.""

In an analysis by the Federation of Tax Administrators, which provides services to state tax authorities and administrators, New Jersey ranks ninth for the percent of personal income spent on state and local taxes. Alaska ranks first.

However, Ronald Alt, senior research associate at the Federation of Tax Administrators, said there are caveats to the rankings. For example, Alaska takes in a large share of its taxes from oil revenues and Alt said, ""most likely their citizens don't pay a large portion of that.""

The Tax Foundation puts Alaska 50th in the nation for its state and local tax burden.

Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation, said his group sometimes calculates total tax collections as a percent of income, but ""we just don't think it is appropriate to call that a ‘tax burden’"" because it doesn’t address issues such as taxes shifting across state lines.

Alt said New Jersey’s taxes are high, but ""it's very difficult to come out and claim that one state has the highest overall just because there are many different ways of looking at it and there many different types of taxes.""

Worst unemployment

The group also claimed New Jersey had the ""worst unemployment in the region"" when Christie took office.

Jones said his group was defining the region as New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- all of which had lower unemployment rates than New Jersey when Christie took office. ""We’re not getting up into New England,"" he said.

In January 2010, New Jersey’s unemployment rate stood at 9.8 percent. The same month New York’s was 8.9 percent, Pennsylvania’s was 8.8 percent and Delaware’s was 8.8 percent.

It’s worth noting that the U.S. Census Bureau classifies New Jersey as part of the northeast region with Connecticut,  Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Rhode Island. The region is split into two divisions. New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania belong to the middle Atlantic division.  
So, New Jersey’s jobless rate was higher than the two other states in its Census division. But among states in the northeast region, Rhode Island had a higher unemployment rate of 11.8 percent than New Jersey in January 2010.  

Our ruling

Committee for Our Children’s Future claims in an ad that the governor ""inherited the highest taxes in America and the worst unemployment in the region.""

A business-backed group ranks New Jersey worst in the nation for its state and local tax burden. The advocacy group is correct by that measure. But there are other measures of tax burden where New Jersey doesn’t rank first and there isn't clear consensus on how best to define tax burden.

New Jersey had the highest unemployment rate among its neighbors when Christie took office, and still does. Among all the states in the northeast, only Rhode Island’s jobless rate tops New Jersey’s.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Obama campaign says officials will now appear at super PAC fundraisers
","
""Neither the president nor his campaign staff or aides will fundraise for super PACs."" 
— President Barack Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt, July 9, 2011 
""Senior campaign officials as well as some White House and Cabinet officials will attend and speak at (super PAC) Priorities USA fundraising events."" 
— President Barack Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, Feb. 6, 2012 

A fundraising decision by President Barack Obama’s campaign in February 2012 prompted news headlines on the ""reversal"" and a Republican Web video on a ""failed promise.""

We figured it was time to crank up the Flip-O-Meter.

Here’s the question: Did the Obama campaign change its stance on fundraising for super PACs?

These new political action committees weren’t an option in 2008. Super PACs grew from a federal court case in 2010, SpeechNow.org vs. Federal Election Commission. The decision allows super PACs to raise unlimited amounts of money to independently advocate for candidates. (Traditional PACs have contribution limits.) Like traditional PACs, they must disclose their donors to the election commission but may not donate directly to candidates and may not coordinate directly with campaigns.

Now there are 313 of them, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, that have raised nearly $99 million. They’ve spent $45 million in the 2012 campaign cycle as of Feb. 7, 2012.

That’s not including cash raised by other kinds of advocacy groups that spend money to affect elections, which include 527s and some 501(c)s. The 527s, for example, may spend unlimited contributions on voter mobilization and issues without filing disclosure reports with the FEC.

The president has railed against such unlimited fundraising and spending, especially by organizations that are not required to disclose their spending or donors. He also specifically opposed a January 2010 Supreme Court decision, Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, that paved the way for super PACs by preventing the government from restricting independent political spending by corporations and unions.

Two notable examples were Obama’s 2010 State of the Union speech and comments at a Democratic rally in Philadelphia before the 2010 midterm elections.

2010 State of the Union:

""With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests — including foreign corporations — to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.""

Moving America Forward rally:

""At the end of the day, Philly, whether the Republicans get the keys back or not is going to depend on you. There is no question — there’s no question the other side sees a chance to get back in the driver’s seat.

""And thanks to a Supreme Court decision called Citizens United, they are being helped along this year by special interest groups that are spending unlimited amounts of money on attack ads ...  just attacking people without ever disclosing who’s behind all these attack ads.  You don’t know.  It could be the oil industry. It could be the insurance industry. It could even be foreign-owned corporations. You don’t know because they don’t have to disclose.

""Now, that’s not just a threat to Democrats — that’s a threat to our democracy.""

Advocacy groups spent furiously against Democrats in the midterm elections, but still the Obama campaign remained resolute, even in November 2011, as groups supporting Republicans vying to unseat him in November raised millions.

The Boston Globe reported this statement from a spokesman in July 2011:

""Neither the president nor his campaign staff or aides will fundraise for super PACs,"" said spokesman Ben LaBolt. ""Our campaign will continue to lead the way when it comes to transparency and reform — refusing contributions from Washington lobbyists and PACs and disclosing the names of donors who are fundraising for the campaign.""

But on Feb. 6, 2012, the president’s re-election campaign, with Obama’s support, decided to lend a hand to a pro-Obama super PAC, Priorities USA Action.

Why?

Obama campaign manager Jim Messina explained the decision in a blog post titled, ""We will not play by two sets of rules."" Super PACs affiliated with Republican presidential candidates, he said, have spent more than $40 million on television and radio over the last few months, almost all of it for negative ads.

(Priorities USA Action, on the other hand, has raised just $4.4 million, spending less than $400,000 so far, according to the Center on Responsive Politics.)

""With so much at stake, we can't allow for two sets of rules in this election whereby the Republican nominee is the beneficiary of unlimited spending and Democrats unilaterally disarm,"" he wrote.

So the campaign will now ""support"" Priorities USA, he said, by sending senior campaign officials, and some White House and Cabinet officials, to speak at super PAC fundraisers.

Messina said Obama still supports a law to force ""full disclosure of all funding intended to influence our elections,"" and favors limits on special interest spending, ""by constitutional amendment, if necessary.""

Messina also drew a distinction between the campaign’s super PAC fundraiser participation and soliciting funds:

""While campaign officials may be appearing at events to amplify our message, these folks won't be soliciting contributions for Priorities USA. I should also note that the president, vice president, and first lady will not be a part of this effort; their political activity will remain focused on the president's campaign.""

While there may be a formal line campaign officials won’t cross, we see a distinction without a difference. Would the average person consider a campaign or White House official speaking at a fundraiser ""fundraising,"" whether or not the speaker directly asked for money? We think so.

Our ruling

We don’t take a position on the merits of a flip. We’re just interested in whether a person’s position has changed. In this case, Obama and his campaign have gone from refusing to fundraise for super PACs to declaring that senior officials will attend and speak at Priorities USA fundraising events. We respect that the president himself won’t participate, and that he still plans to fight the role of special interest money in campaigns, but that’s a major reversal of position, and we rate it a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2012/feb/08/barack-obama/obama-campaign-says-officials-will-now-appear-supe/

Newt Gingrich says EPA plans to boost gas prices 25 cents per gallon
","What better way to scare American voters than tell them the government wants them to pay 25 cents a gallon more for gas?

In an appearance on Meet the Press on Feb. 5, 2012, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued that President Obama’s policies have ""weakened the country.""

Prime example: ""He has an Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. There are very few Americans who want to see the price of gasoline raised by government ... 25 cents a gallon.""

We think Gingrich is probably right about that second part. We decided to look further into the first.

EPA and reducing tailpipe emissions

Gingrich’s campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, directed us to recent news coverage of the EPA’s proposed ""Tier 3"" regulations on fuel emissions.

The regulations are part of Obama’s multi-year plan to reduce tailpipe pollution. Initially, his administration created the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas requirements for trucks. Next the administration set such standards for cars, light trucks, and sport-utility vehicles, called ""light-duty vehicles,"" for model years 2017- 2025, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Now, the EPA is working to create a new set of emissions standards to reduce pollution from these light-duty vehicles. These would update standards that EPA set in 1999.

But the potential costs of the new regulations have some politicians up in arms. Hammond pointed us to a letter signed by six U.S. senators to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson raising concerns about the proposed action.

""With gasoline prices already high, and with so many Americans already struggling to make ends meet, we urge you to recognize that now is not the time for new regulations that will raise the price of fuel even further,"" the letter stated. It went on to cite a study by the consulting firm Baker & O’Brien, which estimated capital and annual costs of complying with the new regulations of $17 billion and $13 billion respectively and predicted oil refinery closures and an increase in gasoline prices of 12 to 25 cents per gallon.

That’s where Gingrich’s 25-cent statement came from. But there are some important things to know about this study.

First, it was conducted for the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group.

""At the very least, industry-sponsored studies (and interest-group sponsored studies, for that matter) should always be taken with a grain of salt,"" said David Jenkins, vice president for government and political affairs for Republicans for Environmental Protection. ""Candidates should not be reciting such studies as gospel, since they know, or should know, that a study can be engineered to produce whatever results the sponsor would like by tweaking the choice of assumptions.""

Second, the Baker & O’Brien study assumes two major changes in the standards: lowering the sulfur content in gasoline and adjusting something called Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), a measure of fuel volatility.

But the study was initiated before the EPA made its intentions known, according to Michelle Robinson with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Now, the EPA has said it is only exploring changes in sulfur levels.

Baker & O’Brien’s conclusions were based on four scenarios, all of which assumed lower RVP requirements.

Robinson wrote in an email that ""while the API study did not distinguish the costs of reducing the RVP from the costs of lowering sulfur content, a review of the report indicates that most of the costs are due to the RVP reduction.""

That means that the biggest chunk of the costs are expected from a change that EPA has said it isn’t seeking.

Said Robinson: ""The oil industry study is dramatically overstating the cleanup costs because it is based on a false premise.""

Other evidence

We found another study examining the impacts of Tier 3, commissioned by the International Council for Clean Transportation, a nonprofit foundation that seeks to improve transportation efficiency in order to reduce climate change. This study specifically included a scenario which allowed the gasoline sulfur improvement to be isolated from the RVP improvement, Robinson told us.

Conducted by the refinery consulting firm MathPro, this study concluded that the price
of reducing the average gasoline sulfur content would be less than one cent per gallon.

EPA did not respond to our inquiry, but in several published reports we found references to remarks by Margo Oge of EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality. She said Jan. 26, 2012, at the Washington Auto Show that the oil industry’s cost projections were based costs of a program that ""EPA is not planning to propose.""

Our ruling

Gingrich warned that under Obama, the EPA plans to raise gasoline prices by 25 cents a gallon.

He drew that information from an industry-funded study considering the cost impacts of the EPA’s proposed Tier 3 fuel standards and went right for the high end of the estimate. ""Surely he knows that API has a vested interest in presenting a high projection,"" said Jenkins, of Republicans for Environmental Protection.

Even more importantly, the study concluded its cost estimates based on fuel-standard changes that EPA is not considering. When looking only at lowering the sulfur content of gasoline, the cost would be far lower -- even less than a penny per gallon, according to a study commissioned by an environmental group. Gingrich’s statement exaggerates and misleads, and we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc4d6c67-20d8-4f5c-b267-c8c971698e88",/factchecks/2012/feb/07/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-epa-plans-boost-gas-prices-25-c/

Do private prisons chase escaped inmates?
","
Prison breaks are the stuff of movies: toothbrushes fashioned into wall-chipping chisels, bed sheets braided into escape ropes, secret routes to the outside via ceilings and pipes.

While the resourcefulness of desperate inmates can be impressive, there's also a scary side.

Opponents of the Florida Legislature's prison privatization plan have tapped into this fear, warning that if the plan is successful, more criminals will end up on the lam.

""Did you know that private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities?"" wrote Christina Bullins, a South Florida correctional probation officer. Bullins wrote an email dated Jan. 30, 2012, that was distributed by the liberal group MoveOn.org. It urged people to sign a petition against the plan.

The claim that private prisons don’t chase inmates seems widely held among state-paid correctional officers and privatization opponents. They warn that public safety is at risk, and the state could see more incidents like in 2010, when three inmates in Arizona escaped a privatized facility with the help of a faulty alarm system, lax guard patrols and a propped-open door. The trio, two of whom were convicted murderers, were connected to the murder of a New Mexico couple following their breakout.

We wondered if private prisons really are more restricted in chasing escapees.

What we thought would be an easy policy check quickly turned into an all-out truth chase. 
If you pose the question to correctional officers and their union reps, you get an unequivocal yes. Ask their private-sector counterparts and you get an unequivocal no. Outside experts are divided, and we ourselves were baffled by ambiguous statutes and redacted security policies.

What the companies say

We asked three companies that run private prisons in Florida -- Corrections Corp. of America, Management & Training Corp., and the GEO Group -- if their policies allow for employees to cross the perimeter in pursuit of an inmate.

CCA spokesman Steve Owen said his company does. That's expected of a facility, per their state contract, he said. But employees are told to notify local sheriff's deputies or police about escapees, he said.

""At some point ... it makes more sense for local authorities to pursue the inmate,"" Owen said.

There's never been an escape at Gadsden Correctional Institution, said Management & Training Corp. spokesman Issa Arnita, but Gadsden correctional officers ""have authority to pursue escaped inmates beyond prison grounds.""

A spokesman for the GEO Group said their private prisons operate similarly to public prisons. But he also said company policy prevents him from sharing specific security policies and procedures.

""Correctional facilities operated by GEO and other firms are contractually required to follow the same operational procedures and policies that are followed by prisons operated by the state,"" said spokesman Pablo Paez. 
What state law says

We then turned to state law, which presented more ambiguity.

The law states ""a private correctional officer may use force only while on the grounds of a facility, while transporting inmates, and while pursuing escapees from a facility."" Private officers are also allowed to use non-deadly force to prevent an inmate from committing a felony or misdemeanor, which includes escape.

Another law requires all prison officers and correctional officers to immediately arrest a convict who escapes. Officers or guards ""may call upon the sheriff or other officer of the state"" or of any county or municipality to search for and arrest convicts.

Several experts told us that it’s not clear from these statutes that private guards have outright authority to chase after inmates beyond the property line. The first rule seems to imply it, but it does not specifically address what happens off prison property.

""In my opinion that’s part of the problem with the privatization of prisons,"" said Michael Hallett, a University of North Florida criminal justice professor who has written extensively on privatization and is opposed to the Senate plan. ""It blurs the line between the state and a private party."" 
What the contracts say

Next, we turned to the contracts between private prisons and the state to see how escapes are handled. PolitiFact Florida reviewed contracts for each of the state's seven currently privatized prisons, and those contracts contain requirements for security and emergency plans.

Those policies are redacted from public review, however, due to security concerns.

Republican Sen. Mike Fasano, who was removed from his longtime post atop the budget subcommittee for criminal justice programs for his adamant opposition, said he’s never heard of a company agreeing to go beyond their property in the pursuit of an inmate. 
Unlike the state, which is protected from lawsuits under ""sovereign immunity,"" private operators would not be protected from lawsuits if something went wrong in a chase.

""If he hurts somebody and gets sued, he's on his own,"" said Ken Kopczynski, director of research at the Police Benevolent Association, the officers' former longtime union.

With that kind of burden, private prison vendors would call local public law enforcement for assistance, Kopczynski said. 
The vendors also have agreements with the Department of Corrections to bring in help in cases of escape, riot and hostage situations. PolitiFact Florida reviewed these agreements and found the state's help includes canine tracking teams, hostage negotiators and other emergency response teams upon the request of the private vendor. 

In Palm Beach County, home to GEO Group-operated South Bay prison, deputies would react to an escape with dog teams, horses, helicopters and patrols, said county sheriff's office spokesman Eric Davis. But they would do that for any escape, private or public alike, he said.

""It’s not like guards are going to leave the facility unmanned (in a pursuit). That’s not how it goes,"" Davis said. 
Prison breakouts by the numbers

State legislators who heard these arguments in debate were concerned enough to add an amendment to the legislation. The most recent version of the bill says contractors must pay the state for costs ""associated with the pursuit or apprehension of an escapee"" for the first 48 hours of the inmate's escape.

Senators wanted to be sure state and local governments would not be on the hook if prisoners slipped through private facilities, which has happened in the past, Hallett said. 
Before we rule, we should note an important caveat to this discussion: Prison breakouts are not very common. 
Opponents’ evidence that privatization will lead to neighborhood chaos is anecdotal. The reason they envision more breakouts is that private prisons offer lower starting salaries and benefits, leading to high turnover and less experience.

There were 167 escapes in Florida from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011, none of which were from inside a private or public correctional facility, according to the most recent state figures available. The majority of escapes are hardly the stuff of The Shawshank Redemption. Most involve inmates simply walking away from road prisons and work release.

The last true prison break was in 2005 when three Dade Correctional Institution inmates built a ladder, tossed a sheet of carpet over the barbed-wire fence and climbed over, according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. They stole a truck at knifepoint and remained free for about an hour -- until their vehicle plunged into a canal during a chase by police.

That was at a public prison, by the way. 
Our ruling

Private prison vendors say they have the authority to chase escaped prisoners beyond their property lines. Without getting into detailed security procedures, they say they have the same authority as public corrections officials. We've seen nothing to contradict those statements, but we’ve also seen nothing that strongly supports them, thanks to public records exemptions on their security plans.

Even if they can pursue past their property lines, does that mean they will? The vendors say part of their escape plan is to immediately notify local authorities. The authorities we consulted said they would definitely take the lead if a prisoner went off campus, but they added that would be the case for a state-run facility, too.

That brings us to the final part of the claim: This chase policy will result in ""more escaped prisoners in our communities."" While there are definitely horror stories resulting from inmate escapes, we don’t see the evidence that there are more escapes from private prisons. We would consider this point speculative.

The email said, ""Private prisons do not chase escaped inmates past the perimeter like the public prisons do, which means more escaped prisoners in our communities.""  We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/07/chain-email/do-private-prisons-chase-escaped-inmates/

Did Newt Gingrich pay a $300,000 ethics fine back in the 1990s?
","
EDITOR’S NOTE: We originally ruled this claim True. A short time later, we were contacted by an attorney who represented Gingrich during the ethics proceeding and who disputed that Gingrich was ""fined"" by the ethics committee. The lawyer said Gingrich had paid a ""cost assessment."" We decided to take a second look at the issue and decided to change the ruling to Mostly True.

***

A pro-Mitt Romney ""Super PAC"" is flexing its muscles in the Republican race for president, telling conservative voters not to fall for Barack Obama’s plan to hand Newt Gingrich the GOP nomination. The group, called Restore our Future, is running television ads in Iowa and Florida.
   
""Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich,"" the ad says. ""Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com.""
   
Super PACs aren’t formally affiliated with campaigns, but they can still spend money to try to influence elections, and they don’t face the same disclosure requirements as official campaigns. In this case, Restore our Future is run by supporters of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
   
The ad makes a lot of claims. Here, we wanted to check whether Gingrich ""was fined $300,000 for ethics violations.""
   
Gingrich’s ethics violations date back to the 1990s, when Gingrich taught a course at Kennesaw State College while serving in Congress.
   
The organizers of the course solicited financial support from ""individuals, corporations and foundations,"" promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status. But an ethics committee investigation concluded that the course was ""actually a coordinated effort"" to ""help in achieving a partisan, political goal"" -- something that would run afoul of its tax-exempt status.
   
A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which ""the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis."" Gingrich ""should have known"" that the information in the letters ""was inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable,"" the investigation found.
   
The allegations were largely adjudicated by January 1997, with Gingrich agreeing to pay a sum of $300,000 and admitting that he had ""engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives."" He became the first speaker to be sanctioned in this fashion by the House. (Here’s a time line of the case.)
   
During this year’s campaign, Gingrich said that the investigation was conducted by ""a very partisan political committee"" in a way that ""related more to the politics of the Democratic Party than to ethics."" We rated that statement Pants on Fire. (Read our fact-check for more details.)
   
As we’ve noted before, Gingrich’s intensely partisan style and his heavy use of the congressional ethics process against others ramped up the level of partisan warfare during his investigation.
   
But, the investigation itself moved forward with bipartisan support. The ethics panel’s case had the consent of Republicans, including the committee’s chairwoman, and it was led by a special counsel who was not a Democratic partisan and who focused on substantive legal matters.
   
Most notably, when it came time to vote, the House -- including nearly 90 percent of voting Republicans -- voted to support the committee’s recommendation.
   
At any rate, the investigating subcommittee released its findings to the full committee on Dec. 21, 1996. It recommended ""a reprimand and the payment of $300,000 toward the cost of the preliminary inquiry.""
   
On Jan. 17, 1997, the full committee held nearly six hours of televised hearings, then voted 7 to 1 to accept the subcommittee’s recommendation. The full House went on to pass the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans voting for it and 26 voting against it.
   
The question of whether the $300,000 payment was a fine attracted some debate at the time, and continues to do so today.

After our initial analysis resulted in a rating of True -- archived here -- J. Randolph Evans of the law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge and one of Gingrich’s lawyers in the ethics case wrote us to question our ruling.

""Based upon the actual language of the House Committee report itself, it is clear that Speaker Gingrich was only asked to reimburse the House $300,000 to offset some costs of the Committee’s investigation. No fine was ever levied against the speaker,"" Evans wrote. He also criticized us for promoting our fact-check via Twitter.

""Any statement in any broadcast communication supporting the notion that Speaker Gingrich paid a congressional fine is wholly inaccurate, and should be characterized that way by PolitiFact. More significantly, in light of controlling authority on this issue, any additional publication by PolitiFact that supports the truth of such a statement will be considered knowingly false,"" he wrote.

Evans has a point that the committee’s official findings do not mention the word ""fine."" Instead, the report recommends that Gingrich receive ""a reprimand and a payment reimbursing the House for some of the costs of the investigation in the amount of $300,000.""

Lawyers with expertise in political law agreed with Evans’ point about the committee’s decision not to label it a ""fine."" But these experts also warned against interpreting the levy as merely a reimbursement, saying it’s hard to view it as anything but a penalty against Gingrich.

""I think it is fair to say that the $300,000 was assessed as a punitive measure, and there would have been no such assessment if the ethics committee thought he was free from wrongdoing,"" Kenneth A. Gross, the head of the political law practice at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. ""It really is matter of characterization and even semantics. It was not a fine in a legal sense but a punitive measure.""

Other experts agreed.

""I suspect that the committee never asks a person to pay $300,000 for its investigation costs if the result of the investigation was to find the person completely blameless,"" said legal commentator Stuart Taylor.

""The payment was meant to penalize Gingrich personally for lying to Committee investigators, so it could fairly be called a ‘penalty’ from a layman’s point of view,"" said Brett Kappel, a counsel with the firm Arent Fox LLP.

It’s also worth noting that the head of the committee that investigated and reprimanded Gingrich said at the time that, although the committee didn’t officially call it a fine, she personally considered it to be a fine.

As the House was preparing to vote on the ethics panel’s findings, the chair of the House ethics committee, Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., had this exchange with Katie Couric of NBC News:

Couric: ""Do you view this $300,000 as a fine or to compensate for the cost of the investigation?""

Johnson: ""Well, it can be seen either way.""

Couric: ""How do you see it?""

Johnson: ""I see it personally as a fine.""

Another view: The Congressional Research Service, in a 2005 report, said the sum paid by Gingrich ""was not characterized by the Committee as a ‘fine,’ "" but CRS did use the term ""penalty"" to describe it.

To cut through the semantic fog, we turned to Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California at Berkeley. He said it’s fair for a media outlet to describe the fee Gingrich paid as a ""fine"" or to write that Gingrich was ""fined.""

""Some people distinguish fines and charges for costs, but the verb 'fine' is also routinely used as including costs,"" he said. He sent us several examples of courts noting that their fines included court costs.

""The implication that since the penalty charged Gingrich was not a ‘fine’ there was no imputation of guilt or violation of ethics rules is simply false: People are not held responsible for costs if the charges are found groundless,"" he said.

A footnote: Gingrich paid off the $300,000 in installments, according to contemporaneous news accounts. At one point he was even going to borrow money from former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. But by the end of 1998 Gingrich had finished paying the fine without Dole’s help.
   
Our ruling

The Super PAC Restore Our Future made a linguistic overstep when it labeled the $300,000 payment a ""fine,"" since the ethics committee never used that precise term. But the underlying point of the pro-Romney Super PAC ad remains valid. Although the payment was not technically a ""fine,"" it was a penalty.

The committee reprimanded Gingrich and assessed him a sum of $300,000. The chair of the committee said on national television that despite the panel’s word choice, she personally considered it to be a fine. It is common in many legal settings for court costs to be included in fines. And an array of legal experts told us that the avoidance of the word ""fine"" in describing the payment does not suggest vindication for Gingrich; rather, they said, the payment was clearly intended to be punitive. On balance we rate this statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/07/restore-our-future/did-newt-gingrich-pay-300000-ethics-fine-back-1990/
