Was West Virginia the eighth fastest-growing state economy last year?
","In a WV Metro News debate before he won another term in Congress, U.S. Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., defended President Donald Trumpâ€™s handling of the economy, saying the state had benefited disproportionately. ""Last year we had the eighth fastest-growing economy in the country in West Virginia,"" he said, responding to Kendra Fershee, his Democratic opponent. Is McKinleyâ€™s statement accurate? Earlier this year, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis -- the federal office that calculates economic growth in the states -- showed that West Virginia ranked 11th in inflation-adjusted growth in gross domestic product between 2016 and 2017, with a 2.6 percent increase. Thatâ€™s not the same as eighth, but itâ€™s close. That data, however, was subsequently updated, and the newer data is less favorable to West Virginia. In the most recent calculations, West Virginia actually ranked 19th out of the 50 states in year-over-year change in GDP, with a 2.2 percent increase. So West Virginia was in the top half of the ratings table, but well below the eighth-place finish that McKinley cited. A more impressive measurement for the state was one that McKinley didnâ€™t mention -- the increase in GDP per capita, a statistic that adjusts the size of growth to account for a stateâ€™s population. Using that statistic, West Virginia actually ranked in a tie for first with Washington state. Both notched a 2.9 percent increase between 2016 and 2017. Analysts say the expansion of West Virginiaâ€™s mining sector accounted for the lionâ€™s share of the stateâ€™s GDP growth. Itâ€™s also worth noting that a reason for West Virginiaâ€™s high rates of per-capita GDP growth is population loss -- not a positive sign for the state. McKinleyâ€™s office did not respond to an inquiry. McKinley said, ""Last year we had the eighth fastest-growing economy in the country in West Virginia."" The final data actually shows that West Virginia ranked quite a bit lower, at 19th. The state fared better using a different statistic that McKinley didnâ€™t mention -- per-capita GDP growth, where it was tied for first. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4044C0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/29/david-mckinley/was-west-virginia-eighth-fastest-growing-economy-l/

No, the photo of the migrant mother running from tear gas with her children was not staged
","One widely published photo of the chaos that broke out between the Border Patrol and members of the migrant caravan is the subject of online conspiracy theories. U.S. Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas near a crossing point in Tijuana, Mexico, against some members of the migrants, which included children. The image, by Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon, captures Honduran migrant Miara Meza clinging to her small children as they run away from a tear gas canister. A migrant family flees after U.S. authorities fire tear gas into Mexico to repel Central American migrants approaching the border: https://t.co/lP4Tt4Jf7B | ðŸ“· Kim Kyung-Hoon pic.twitter.com/iMckHzJPpY It didnâ€™t take long for blogs and conspiracy sites to claim the photo was staged, with most sharing a marked-up version of the picture that highlighted other photographers in the photoâ€™s background. An article from conservative blog DavidHarrisJr.com is one of the sites saying the image was a ""staged hoax."" The story was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Hereâ€™s how we know the image is real. Meza and thousands of other migrants had traveled from Honduras to Mexico to seek asylum in the United States as part of a caravan that formed in mid October. After being blocked at a port of entry at the border, hundreds from the group began a peaceful demonstration Nov. 25 that turned chaotic. Customs and Border Protection agents said that some protesters broke away from the group and tried to cross through an opening and began throwing rocks and bottles, at border agents. In response, agents unleashed tear gas on the crowd. Today, several migrants threw projectiles at the agents in San Diego. Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas to dispel the group because of the risk to agents' safety. Several agents were hit by the projectiles. The situation is evolving and a statement is forthcoming. The photo of Meza and her children quickly spread and was used by news organizations around the world. The mother of five told BuzzFeed News that she didnâ€™t try to cross the border but was standing near the fence with her children when agents fired multiple canisters in their direction. ""I felt sad, I was scared. I wanted to cry. Thatâ€™s when I grabbed my daughters and ran,"" Meza told BuzzFeed. ""I thought my kids were going to die with me because of the gas we inhaled."" So, we know the photo wasnâ€™t staged â€” and that Meza is a real person. Bloggers who promoted the conspiracy theory that it was faked by Democrats put up this marked-up version to make their case. ""Upon further analysis, that â€˜horrificâ€™ picture of the woman with barefoot children in diapers running from the U.S. border wall was Fake News,"" the article declares. The article pointed out other photographers that could be seen in the background of the shot: ""You can see a group of men posing for one cameraman while another young man is running toward a second cameraman. In other spots of the photo, people are just standing around calmly with no sense of urgency whatsoever. The woman with the children was just a photo-op."" First, it is obviously common for multiple photojournalists to cover the same breaking news event. More to the point, the tear gas happened. But donâ€™t just take the photographic evidence and words of journalistic accounts for it; the Border Patrol acknowledged its own response. Customs and Border Protection tweeted that agents deployed tear gas against the migrants. In a later statement, the agency said it ""employed less-lethal devices"" in response to the crowd trying to cross the border and throwing projectiles. Bloggers posted an article that claims a photo of a migrant mother and her children fleeing from tear gas at the U.S.-Mexico border was a staged hoax. It isnâ€™t. Customs and Border Protection confirmed the use of tear gas, which was documented by several news organizations. Â And the Honduran woman featured running in a photo with her kids, Miara Meza, was tracked down and interviewed about what happened.

Donald Trump falsely says family separations were Obama policy
","Despite President Donald Trumpâ€™s repeated claims that the Obama administration separated immigrant children from their parents at the border the same way the Trump administration did, the facts remain unchanged: thatâ€™s not true. Family separations under the Obama administration did happen, but immigration experts say they were relatively rare; under Trumpâ€™s administration they were the systematic result of a policy to prosecute all immigrants who crossed illegally into the United States. Trump on Nov. 25 tweeted: ""[emailÂ protected] did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration. In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during O years. Obama separated.... ....children from parents, as did Bush etc., because that is the policy and law.

Obama separated.... ....children from parents, as did Bush etc., because that is the policy and law. I tried to keep them together but the problem is, when you do that, vast numbers of additional people storm the Border. So with Obama seperation is fine, but with Trump itâ€™s not. Fake 60 Minutes! This summer, a 2014 photo of detained children circulated widely on social media, falsely pegged by some journalists and liberal activists as a detention happening in 2018. The rest of the claims in Trumpâ€™s tweets are inaccurate and donâ€™t tell the whole story. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department in April introduced ""zero-tolerance"" as a new policy under the Trump administration, not as oneÂ carried over from past administrations. The policy called for the prosecution of all adults who were referred by immigration authorities for violating immigration laws. As a consequence of the policy,Â more than 2,300 immigrant children were separated from their parents as they arrived at the border this summer. Children were put into the custody of U.S. Health and Human Services and the parents referred for prosecution. Past administrations also separated children from the adults they arrived with in the United States. But immigration experts said those separations were relatively rare and nowhere near the scale under the Trump administration. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border enforcement, told PolitiFact that Obamaâ€™s administration did not count the number of families separated at the border. The Obama administration began prosecuting border-crossers who had already been deported at least once, but very few of them crossed with children, so it didnâ€™t become as visible an issue, Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told us for a previous fact-check. ""There was some child separation and some pushback by immigrant advocacy groups around that, but the numbers were quite limited,"" Seele said. While Obamaâ€™s administration generally refrained from prosecuting adults who crossed the border with their children, the Trump administration chose to prosecute adults, even when they had kids with them, said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, in June. ""That's a choice â€” one fundamentally different from the choice made by both Obama and previous presidents of both parties,"" Margulies said. The George W. Bush administration had a program, Operation Streamline, that referred immigrants who crossed into the country illegally for prosecution, but it made exceptions for adults traveling with children. Trumpâ€™s tweet also claimed that family separations were done ""because that is the policy and law."" There is no law requiring that all families be separated once they cross the border. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in June tweeted, ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Â Period."" The ""zero-tolerance"" policy did not explicitly say parents and children had to be separated, but that was the result of parents being referred for prosecution. Katie Waldman, a DHS spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that families are separated for one of three reasons:Â when officialsÂ cannot establish the custodial relationship, when theyÂ believe the custodian may be a threat to the child, or when the custodian is being detained for prosecution. Trump also claimed that he ""tried to keep them together."" Trump in June insisted that he didnâ€™t have the executive power to end family separations â€”Â but he later did just that after mounting pressure and criticism over the separations. We rated Trumpâ€™s claim that he couldnâ€™t end family separations a Full Flop. Tweeting about family separations at the border, Trump claimed, ""we had the exact same policy as the Obama administration."" Thatâ€™s not true. Families were separated at the border as a result of a new Trump policy called ""zero-tolerance."" There were some family separations under the Obama administration, but experts say not at the scale of the Trump administration's and that they were relatively rare.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders says Obama's Border Patrol used tear gas once a month. Is that true?
","President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is under scrutiny for using tear gas on migrants at the southwest border, a response that pictures show affected young children. But the use of tear gas at the border isnâ€™t unique to the Trump administration, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders argued. Under former President Barack Obama, she said, it was routine. Asked if the White House regretted that children were exposed to the tear gas, Sanders said the White House ""would never want children to be in harm's way in any capacity whatsoever"" and that law enforcement officers use appropriate non-lethal force to protect themselves and prevent an illegal rush at the border. ""And let's also not forget that this isn't the first time that non-lethal force like this has been used,"" Sanders said Nov. 27. ""In fact, tear gas was used, on average, once a month during the Obama administration for very similar circumstances."" Sanders added that the Obama administration used tear gas for ""far less circumstances because they didn't have the same numbers and the mass rush that we're seeing in this caravan take place."" PolitiFact readers asked us to fact-check whether the Obama administration used tear gas on migrants on average once a month. Data from the Department of Homeland Security back Sandersâ€™ claim. But the agency did not provide additional information to compare the circumstances. Tear gas contains chemical compounds that temporarily make people unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tyler Q. Houlton, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, the department that oversees CBP, told PolitiFact that CBP has used Â 2-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS), commonly known as tear gas, since 2010. (A 2007 Associated Press report said Border Patrol then used tear gas at the border to counter attacks by assailants hurling rocks, bottles and bricks. George W. Bush was president at that time.) DHS did not provide data on the use of tear gas during the first few years of the Obama administration. It only offered annual data from fiscal years 2012 to 2018. (Fiscal years start Oct. 1 and run through Sept. 30.) So we don't know if oneÂ month with a lot of incidents threw a certain year's total. The Border Patrol has used tear gas in 126 incidents since fiscal year 2012, according to the agencyâ€™s data: According to DHS, from 2012 to 2016 (Obamaâ€™s last full fiscal year in office), there were 79 incidents for the use of tear gas. On average, thatâ€™s about 1.3 incidents per month. Fiscal year 2017 includes about four months of the Obama administration, but itâ€™s unclear how many of the 18 incidents in which tear gas was used in 2017 happened under Obamaâ€™s watch. (In 2017, there were an average of 1.5 incidents per month.) Thousands of migrants are at the Mexican side of the U.S-Mexico border. They got there as part of caravans trekking from Central America and seeking entry into the United States. Many say they want to apply for asylum in the United States. A share of the migrants, who are reportedly camping at a Tijuana stadium near the Tijuana-San Diego border area, left the stadium on Nov. 25 and marched over to the border to make their case to U.S. authorities and be let into the United States. However, the march ""veered out of control,"" and ""hundreds of people tried to evade a Mexican police blockade and run toward a giant border crossing that leads into San Diego,"" the New York Times reported. Migrants threw rocks and bottles at law enforcement officers, so the agents defended themselves with the use of tear gas, Border Patrol officials said. How does that compare to the use of tear gas under the Obama administration? Sanders said it was used for ""very similar"" and also for ""far less circumstances."" Houlton, the DHS spokesman, on Nov. 26 tweeted a 2013 article from the San Diego Union-Tribune that said border patrol agents used ""pepper spray and other means"" to force back into Mexico a group of about 100 migrants who threw rocks and bottles at agents. PolitiFact asked immigration officials to provide more information related to the tear gas incidents under the Obama administration, such as specific dates, locations and circumstances. They did not provide that information. The White House did not respond to comment. With just the numbers provided, the similarity among the incidents is unclear, including whether children were also affected by tear gas dispersed during the Obama administration. A viral photo from the Nov. 25, 2018, incident shows a woman and two young children running away from a nearby tear gas canister. DHS said that in addition to tear gas, CBP during law enforcement operations regularly uses, Pava Capsaicin, commonly known as pepper spray, which also irritates the senses. Significant differences between pepper spray and tear gas are their chemical makeup and how they are projected. Between 2012 and 2016, there were 434 incidents when pepper spray was used, or an average of 7 incidents per month. DHS did not specify when CBP began using pepper spray nor did it provide data for earlier years of the Obama administration. The Border Patrol used pepper spray in 533 incidents since the 2012 fiscal year, according to agency data: Sanders said, ""Tear gas was used on average once a month during the Obama administration for very similar circumstances."" The Trump administration used tear gas on migrants at the southwest border. Officials say the tear gas was a response to migrants throwing rocks at border patrol agents. Immigration officials provided data for tear gas use during the latter years of the Obama administration, starting in 2012. That data shows an average of 1.3 incidents per month. The circumstances of all those incidents is unclear. Sandersâ€™ statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrong about spending in Georgia race
","In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats managed to seize more than three dozen Republican-held House seats. One of these was Georgiaâ€™s 6th District, where Democratic challenger Lucy McBath defeated Republican incumbent Karen Handel. McBathâ€™s underdog victory â€” driven in part by suburban Atlanta votersâ€™ frustration over gun violence â€” caught the eye of another incoming Democratic freshman lawmaker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who herself had pulled off an upset. In the primary, Ocasio-Cortez ousted a senior Democrat in a New York City district. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Nov. 19: ""Lucy McBath is a hero. After losing her son to gun violence, she ran for Congress against her NRA incumbent. She was previously a flight attendant. Lucy was outspent 5-1, but she kept running with her conviction. She won. Flipped GA-06 in a major upset. No one saw her coming."" Lucy McBath is a hero. After losing her son to gun violence, she ran for Congress against her NRA incumbent. She was previously a flight attendant. Lucy was outspent 5-1, but she kept running with her conviction.She won. Flipped GA-06 in a major upset. No one saw her coming. https://t.co/txWhV2j52A In fact, the spending differential wasnâ€™t as big as Ocasio-Cortez said â€” and once spending by outside groups is factored in, McBath actually had the edge. The reason: As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution initially noted, Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s statement conflates money not just from the Handel-McBath matchup but also from the high-spending special election in 2017 in which Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff. (Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) We looked at the Georgia 6th page on the campaign finance data website OpenSecrets.org and found that for the 2018 election cycle, Handel had spent $7.99 million and McBath had spent $1.23 million. Thatâ€™s a 6.5-to-1 ratio in Handelâ€™s favor. (The amount each candidate raised â€” rather than spent â€” was closer to the 5-to-1 Handel edge that Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted about.) However, Handelâ€™s total was artificially inflated by the hard-fought and expensive open-seat battle she waged against Ossoff the previous year. That earlier race officially counts as being in the two-year-long 2018 election cycle. Sarah Bryner, the research director for the Center for Responsive Politics, which runs OpenSecrets.org, said their website is organized that way because thatâ€™s how the Federal Election Commission tabulates the data. ""It's not really possible to isolate out spending and fundraising numbers for specific time periods,"" Bryner said. We estimated the amount of money in the McBath-Handel race based on what the Journal-Constitution reported about dollars spent and raised in the special election. In July 2017, the newspaper reported that Handel had raised $6.3 million for the special election, with $430,000 remaining for the 2018 general election. That means that Handel raised $1.69 million specifically for the general election. If you add in the $430,000 she held over from the special election, that works out to about $2.12 million. McBath, for her part, raised $1.79 million for the general election. So depending on how you treat the $430,000 that Handel held over, she either modestly out-raised McBath or was modestly outraised by McBath. Either way, the two candidatesâ€™ fundraising ended up on pretty even footing, not a 5-to-1 edge for Handel. We can also estimate the amount each candidate spent, which is how Ocasio-Cortez phrased her tweet. Handel finished the general election with $402,000 left in the bank. Subtracting that from the money she had available for for the general election means that she actually spent $1.72 million. Thatâ€™s is more than the $1.22 million that McBath spent, but the difference is still more modest than what Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted â€” a ratio of about 1.4-to-1 in Handelâ€™s favor. But even this is misleading about the overall spending patterns in the race, because these figures only include dollars spent by the campaigns themselves, not by outside groups aligned with one candidate or the other. When outside groups are factored in, McBath actually had a sizable spending edge over Handel. We asked the Center for Responsive Politics to break down the outside spending on Georgiaâ€™s 6th District, and they tallied up just the contributions made after June 20, 2017, the date of the special runoff. Groups that either supported Handel or opposed McBath spent $1.6 million. By contrast, groups supporting McBath or opposing Handel spent almost $4.9 million. According to the Journal-Constitution, Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group affiliated with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, was the biggest spender aligned with McBath, allocating $4.5 million to the race. The primary outside group spending on behalf of Handel, the National Republican Congressional Committee, spent $1.4 million. So the outside spending edge for McBath actually dwarfed the candidate spending edge for Handel. This severely undercuts the point of Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s tweet. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that McBath ""was outspent 5-1"" in her race against Handel. Even looking just at the candidatesâ€™ own money, Handelâ€™s edge in fundraising and spending was no higher than 1.4-to-1. And once you include spending by outside groups, it was McBath who actually had the edge.

Recent cold spells irrelevant to climate change big picture
","If manâ€™s impact on climate goes unchecked, global warming could inflict devastating long-term effects on the environment, economy and public health, warn U.S. government scientists in a major new report. But while some heard the 1,600-page National Climate Assessment as a blaring distress call, others were less alarmed. On NBCâ€™s Meet the Press, Danielle Pletka, a foreign policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, allowed that climate change is happening, but hastened to add that she didnâ€™t know if itâ€™s caused by humans. (In fact, scientists say they are the main contributor.) She argued the issue of climate change is subject to ""hysteria"" and said certain weather phenomena, like periods of global cooling, are overlooked by the mainstream media narrative. ""We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years,"" Pletka said during a panel discussion. ""We don't talk about that because it's not part of the agenda."" Climate scientists told us that part of Pletkaâ€™s claim is false and part is misleading. Pletka said we just had two of the coldest years on record. Thatâ€™s wrong. Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, pointed us to a chart of NASA data showing global average temperatures over time:  The far-right dots represent the global temperatures of 2017 and 2016. According to this data, they are actually some of the warmest years on record â€” which contradicts this portion of Pletkaâ€™s claim. Weâ€™d note that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a slightly different way of calculating temperature, shows 2016 and 2015 as the warmest years on record. In the United States, according to NASA data, 2017 and 2016 were the second- and third-warmest years.  The other piece of Pletkaâ€™s claim â€” about cold spells â€” was not so much false, as misleading. She told us she was relying on an article from Real Clear Markets with the headline, ""Did You Know the Greatest Two-Year Global Cooling Event Just Took Place?"" The April 2018 article notes that from February 2016 to February 2018 (the latest month available at the time), global average temperatures dropped 0.56 degrees C. ""You have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop,"" the article states, referring also to the NASA data on global average temperatures. (The 1982-84 drop was 0.47 degrees C.) Climate scientists told us this is technically true, but that it misses the bigger trend thatâ€™s taken place over decades. ""Basically, itâ€™s just a statistical fluke that people have grabbed because it sounds good,"" Schmidt said. ""It has no relevance for the long-term trends."" Â  The drop in temperatures after 2016 was also unsurprising, climatologists said. 2016 was especially hot because it was at the peak of the last El NiÃ±o, a recurring event when the surface of the Pacific Ocean warms, leading to higher global average temperatures of a few tenths of a degree. As the event concluded, things cooled off. ""So the subsequent drop in temperature isn't surprising,"" said Judith Curry, a climatologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""A two-year trend is not meaningful in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing."" The Real Clear article is ostensibly a critique of the mainstream mediaâ€™s failure to cover cold spells, which the author argues should garner as much coverage as heat waves and extreme weather phenomena linked to climate change. (""None of this argues against global warming,"" the author states.) Pletka said, ""We just had two of the coldest years, biggest drop in global temperatures that we have had since the 1980s, the biggest in the last 100 years."" Her claim that we just had two of the coldest years is wrong. Globally, 2016 and 2017 were the two warmest years on record, according to one measure. Climate scientists told us a two-year trend is meaningless in terms of understanding anything about how climate is changing. With that in mind, Pletkaâ€™s assertion that weâ€™ve recently seen the biggest drop in global temperatures is a red herring. Itâ€™s based on a cherry-picked statistical fluke of no relevance, compared with long term trends. Bottom line: Cold spells can and do happen, but they do not negate the fact that global warming is real and a legitimate cause for concern, according to broad scientific consensus. We rate Pletkaâ€™s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FBC880>],/factchecks/2018/nov/28/danielle-pletka/recent-cold-spells-irrelevant-climate-change-big-p/
"['Elections', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Gordon Hintz']","
State Rep. Hintz hits the target with claim against Republicans seeking to add an election
","In the wake of the November 2018 midterm election, in which Democrats wrested the governorâ€™s office from Republicans, the political divide in Wisconsin continues. Republicans are proposing to move Wisconsin's presidential primary in 2020, which would improve the chances of conservative Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly retaining his seat. Kelly was appointed to the seat by soon-to-be-former Gov. Scott Walker. Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, is crying foul -- and hypocrisy. ""One year ago, (Republicans) would not fill seats vacated for people who went to the administration because of the cost of those elections,"" said Hintz, in a Nov. 18, 2018, interview on WISN-TVâ€™s ""UpFront with Mike Gousha."" ""Now, theyâ€™re talking about changing the rules to add additional elections that will cost millions of dollars of taxpayer expense."" Letâ€™s take a look at both parts of Hintzâ€™s claim. Legislative elections Walker did initially decline to call special elections after two GOP lawmakers stepped down in December 2017 to join his administration. Â  At the time, Walker argued for leaving the seats open until the regularly scheduled Nov. 6, 2018, election. Democrats countered it was not fair to leave residents of those districts without representation for that long, noting the law requires elections to be held promptly. Walker himself cited cost as a factor, speaking to reporters in Pewaukee: ""Itâ€™s just a waste of taxpayersâ€™ money. The Legislature would be adjourned before a special election was held so (candidates would) ... have to be running for the fall election for a state legislative seat at the same time there would be a special election for a seat that wouldnâ€™t get to vote on anything until after the fall election anyway."" The seats had belonged to former state Sen. Frank Lasee of De Pere and former state Rep. Keith Ripp of Lodi. The two Republicans stepped down in December 2017 to join Walker's administration. Voters in those areas took Walker to court with the help of a group headed by Eric Holder, the first attorney general under Democratic President Barack Obama. On March 22, 2018, Dane County Circuit Judge Josann Reynolds held Walker had a duty under state law to hold special elections. A second Dane County judge denied a delay. So did an appellate judge. Ultimately, Walker and the GOP dropped the matter instead of taking it to the state Supreme Court, and the elections were held. So, Walker and Republicans did describe scheduling the elections as a waste of money, though they also cited other reasons. Chiefly, that the Legislature would be adjourned before a special election was held. Presidential election Now to the second part of Hintzâ€™s claim -- that Republicans are now ""talking about changing the rules to add additional elections that will cost millions of dollars of taxpayer expense."" On Nov. 15, 2018, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Republicans are considering using the lame-duck session -- while they still hold the governorâ€™s office -- to help keep a conservative on the state Supreme Court and give GOP lawmakers greater control of two state boards. Republicans have been concerned about the 2020 state Supreme Court race because it is scheduled to be held alongside Wisconsin's presidential primary â€” when Democratic turnout is expected to far outpace Republican turnout, since Democrats will be deciding who will challenge President Donald Trump. A turnout imbalance could spell trouble for Kelly, whom Walker appointed in 2016. Republican legislative leaders, the Journal Sentinel reported, are looking at moving the 2020 presidential primary from April, possibly to March of that year. The GOP plan would require voters to go to the polls three times in the spring of 2020 â€” likely in February, March and April. Holding the extra election would indeed cost millions. Nearly 30 of Wisconsin's 72 county clerks have come out against the proposal, noting -- among other issues -- the statewide cost of holding a standard spring election is around $7 million. Hintzâ€™s statement was a bit off, however, in that he said the GOP was considering holding multiple extra elections. Only one is being considered. Our rating Hintz said, ""One year ago, (Republicans) would not fill seats vacated for people who went to the administration because of the cost of those elections. Now, theyâ€™re talking about changing the rules to add additional elections that will cost millions of dollars of taxpayer expense."" Hintz is generally on target: Republicans did cite cost as one factor -- among several -- when they initially planned to hold off on calling special elections to fill seats vacated by Walker appointees. And they are considering adding a single -- not multiple -- additional election in 2020, which by one estimate could cost taxpayers about $7 million.

Sanctuary jurisdictions 'violate the laws of our nation'? That's Mostly False
","During a hearing for President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee to lead a top immigration agency, Sen. Steve Daines said that so-called sanctuary jurisdictions are unlawful. ""Iâ€™d like to talk about sanctuary jurisdictions, places that violate the laws of our nation, encourage illegal immigration and compromise security of law-abiding citizens,"" Daines, R-Mont., said during Ronald Vitielloâ€™s hearing for director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Daines said an immigrant in the country illegally was recently charged for a triple murder in Missouri after being released from a New Jersey county jail. The jail did not honor a request from ICE to hold him until federal agents picked him up for deportation proceedings, Daines said. Sanctuary jurisdictions that donâ€™t cooperate with federal law enforcement ""are a direct affront to this country's rule of law and put innocent lives at risk,"" Daines added. Do sanctuary cities ""violate the laws of our nation,"" as Daines claimed? Itâ€™s possible that a city or state could be found in violation of the law â€” a specific section of U.S. code would apply. But our review found noÂ courts have yet determined a local jurisdiction has actually violated the code. A spokeswoman for Daines told us the senator was referring to U.S. Code Section 1373, the section of federal law related to the sharing of immigration information between local agencies and federal immigration authorities. The Justice Department has flagged jurisdictions that ""potentially violate"" Section 1373. But neither Dainesâ€™ office nor the Justice Department provided a list of jurisdictions decidedly in violation of federal law. The term ""sanctuary"" is broadly applied to jurisdictions limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But there is no single understanding of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction and the range of policies under that label is pretty wide, said Anil Kalhan, a law professor at the Thomas R. Kline School of Law at Drexel University. ""To my knowledge, no state or local jurisdiction has in fact instituted policies that violate 8 USC 1373 or other federal laws,"" Kalhan said. Section 1373 says federal, state or local government entities or officials may not prohibit or restrict the exchange of information with federal immigration officers regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any individual. In March 2017, then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed that the Justice Departmentâ€™s inspector general report found that sanctuary policies violate federal law. Thatâ€™s Mostly False. A 2016 memo from the inspector general raised questions about how local officials may be interpreting and applying ordinances that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But the memo explicitly said a formal legal determination on whether certain state and local laws or policies violate Section 1373 had not been made by immigration officials, and that his office was unaware of any department decision in that regard. For this fact-check, we asked the Justice Department to name jurisdictions violating Section 1373. It did not provide a response. Katie Schoettler, a spokeswoman for Daines, pointed to a January 2018 statement from Sessions related to letters sent to 23 jurisdictions over department concerns that their laws, policies, or practices ""may violate"" Section 1373. ""Protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law,"" Sessions said, urging them to reconsider their policies. But the department placed the onus on the local jurisdictions: asking them to prove that they are not violating federal law. Several jurisdictions have challenged the department in court, particularly because the department threatens to withhold a law enforcement grant from jurisdictions that donâ€™t comply with Section 1373. Schoettler said the Justice Department is suing multiple jurisdictions ""because it is the contention of the federal government"" that they ""are in fact in violation of the federal statute."" ""Until we see the outcome of the lawsuits, there is nothing to fact-check,"" Schoettler said. ""The courts will do that for you."" Schoettler noted a lawsuit filed in March by the Justice Department against California, seeking to block provisions in three state laws that it argued were ""contrary to federal law and interfere with federal immigration authoritiesâ€™ ability to carry out their lawful duties."" A federal judge in July denied the departmentâ€™s request to halt Californiaâ€™s sanctuary policies. One of the challenged laws was a so-called ""sanctuary state"" law, which says that California law enforcement agencies shall not use funds or personnel to investigate or arrest individuals for immigration enforcement purposes. ""Californiaâ€™s decision not to assist federal immigration enforcement in its endeavors is not an â€˜obstacleâ€™ to that enforcement effort. ...Refusing to help is not the same as impeding,"" wrote Judge John A. Mendez of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. The Justice Department appealed the case. At least three federal judges have found Section 1373 itself to be unconstitutional. (Those rulings applied to the jurisdictions specifically involved in the litigations; not nationwide.) During his discussion of sanctuary policies at the Senate hearing, Daines spoke against jails that did not honor ICE requests to hold immigrants. But an ICE detainer request ""carries no legal force and does not authorize state and local officials to hold anyone in custody â€” it is not an arrest warrant and does not provide probable cause for arrest,"" Kalhan said. Daines said, sanctuary jurisdictions ""violate the laws of our nation."" Daines was referring to Section 1373, but his office did not name a jurisdiction found to be violating that law. Instead, his office named jurisdictions that the Justice Department contends might be violating it. No courts have found a jurisdiction in violation of the law, and some courts have said the law itself might be unconstitutional. Dainesâ€™ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Energy', 'Regulation', 'Virginia', 'Clean Virginia']","
Clean Virginia tells half the story about state's high energy bills
","Virginians pay high power bills largely because the stateâ€™s regulatory system is ""rigged,"" in favor of energy companies, according to Clean Virginia, an advocacy group seeking reforms. Â  The group notes on its website that the stateâ€™s two dominant power companies - Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Co., who, together provide 82 percent of Virginiaâ€™s power and have contributed $12 million to state candidates since 1996 - have had a major role in writing the laws that regulate them. As a result, ""Virginians pay the 11th-highest power bills in the nation,"" Clean Virginia says. We wondered whether that ranking is correct. Our curiosity was sparked by a Nov. 16 column in The Roanoke by former state Sen. John Watkins, R-Chesterfield. He said the figures are misleading and accused Clean Virginia of trying to ""demonize Dominion."" Brennan Gilmore, executive director of the group, referred us to data on residential power use collected by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. They show that Virginians received an average residential electric bill of $124.54 a month in 2017. That, indeed, was the 11th-highest tab among all states and the District of Columbia. But thereâ€™s a caveat that Clean Virginiaâ€™s website omits. Power bills are generally tallied by multiplying two figures: the cost rate for a kilowatt of energy per hour times the number of kilowatt hours used. Virginiaâ€™s average residential rate of 11.55-cents per kilowatt hour is the 17th-lowest in the nation. Conversely, its average household use of 1,078 kilowatt hours a month is the eighth highest. In other words, the driving force behind high residential bills in Virginia is not the rate; itâ€™s the heavy use of electricity. EIA charts show a similar pattern across the nation. Households in states where power is relatively inexpensive usually consume more electricity than those in expensive states. Virginians, for example, use more than twice the power consumed by households in Vermont and Hawaii, which pay some of the highest rates in the nation. When the EIA divides states into 10 national regions, the ranking of areas by residential rates is the exact opposite of their ranking by usage. Generally, the highest rates are in the coldest regions. The highest consumption is in the mid-Atlantic and Southern regions stretching from Delaware to Texas. We asked David Jonas, policy director for Clean Virginia, if he agreed that Virginiaâ€™s high electric bills are driven by high consumption. ""Certainly, youâ€™re right to point to that,"" he said. Jonas added that Dominion could push its residential rates lower by encouraging more efficient use of energy. He pointed to a 2017 study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a Washington research group. It ranked Dominionâ€™s efficiency policies 50th among the nationâ€™s 51 largest power companies. Our ruling Clean Virginia says, ""Virginians pay the 11th-highest power bills in the nation."" Virginia does have the 11th-highest residential power rates in the country, according to 2017 federal government statistics. But thereâ€™s much to this ranking that Clean Virginia omits in trying to establish the bills as proof that Virginiaâ€™s regulation of power companies is ""rigged"" against consumers and ""corrupt."" The hefty bills are not caused by high electricity rates, which are established in negotiations between power companies, regulators, state politicians and other parties. To the contrary, Virginia has the 17th-lowest residential rates. Whatâ€™s driving the big bills is the high consumption of electricity by Virginia households who, on average, use the eighth-most power in the country. That follows a pattern across the U.S.; states with low residential rates use a lot of electricity and vice versa. Clean Virginia tellsÂ half the story, and we rate its statement Half True.

Is Saudi Arabia to thank for lower oil prices, as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump touted a reduction in oil prices ahead of Thanksgiving and thanked Saudi Arabia for making it possible. ""Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World,"" he tweeted. ""Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but letâ€™s go lower!"" Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but letâ€™s go lower! The tweet came a day after the president indicated he would not go after Saudi Arabia for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump has broken with the CIA, which concluded Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggiâ€™s assassination. Â  We wondered, how big has the price drop been? And how much of it can be attributed to actions by Saudi Arabia? The short answer is that both parts of the statement are exaggerated. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) There has been a drop in gas prices, but the fall-off has been less dramatic than Trump indicated. Thatâ€™s the case regardless of which metric you use: West Texas intermediate crude or benchmark Brent crude, the two key yardsticks for per-barrel crude oil prices. The last time a barrel of oil cost $82 was in October 2014, according to federal data for West Texas Intermediate crude. The price hit $76.40 as recently as early October 2018, and the most recent data shows it at $57.16. Thatâ€™s a drop of $19.24, not the $28 Trump said. For Brent crude, a barrel of oil did hit $86.07 in early October, and itâ€™s since fallen to $64.14. Thatâ€™s a $21.93 drop, again smaller than the drop Trump cited. In addition, the most recent price for Brent crude is still $10 more per barrel than Trump tweeted. Hereâ€™s how the two prices have tracked since early September. Â  That said, despite the decline in recent weeks,Â prices at the pump on the heavy-travel Thanksgiving week were still the highest in four years. Saudi Arabia is a major player in oil, and it has increased its output recently. But Saudi Arabiaâ€™s recent increase in oil production is not enough to explain the drop in oil prices, experts told PolitiFact. For starters, Saudi Arabia isnâ€™t as big a force in the world market as it once was. Oil production by the United States has experienced a larger net increase than the entire production increase from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, of which Saudi Arabia is part). Other countries have also increased their production, including Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Overall, this high level of production has had a significant impact on global markets. While Iran has decreased oil production in light of pending U.S. sanctions, that hasnâ€™t hurt supply as much as some expected, said Paul J. Sullivan, an economics professor in the Eisenhower School at the National Defense University. Another factor is on the demand side. A big reason for the decline is the expectation that the global economy will slow, leaving too much oil and not enough customers, Sullivan said. The International Energy Agency released revised expectations projecting this slower global demand growth through 2019, and those expectations play into the price drop, said Anna Mikulska, a nonresident fellow in the Center for Energy Studies at the Baker Institute. In addition, oil is priced in dollars, and the increasing strength of the dollar has also made oil cheaper, Sullivan said. All told, there are ""hundreds of other economic factors"" that played into oil prices outside of Saudi Arabia, Sullivan said. ""That tweet hits on maybe 15-20 percent of the explanation, but misses the other 80-85 percent."" Mikulska agreed. ""Saudi Arabia's commitment to higher production mattered in lowering oil prices since October, but it has not been the only factor,"" she said. Trump tweeted that just before Thanksgiving, oil was $54 a barrel, down from $82. He added, ""Thank you to Saudi Arabia."" The price of oil has dropped in recent weeks, and increased production by Saudi Arabia has played a role. However, oil prices havenâ€™t dropped by as much as Trump said, and several factors other than Saudi Arabia â€” including increased production by other big suppliers and an expected drop in demand â€” have played a significant role.

Would legislation have prevented California wildfires?
","As fire crews battledÂ Northern Californiaâ€™s Camp Fire,Â now the deadliest in the stateâ€™s history, and the Woolsey FireÂ farther south, social media users sharedÂ a story that partially places the blame for Californiaâ€™s wildfire woes on Gov. Jerry Brown. The Camp Fire has claimed the lives of more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes. A recent article by the Canada Free Press, a conservative Canadian news and opinion website, has been circulating online with a headline that says Gov. Jerry Brown ""vetoed 2016 wildfire management bill while California burned."" This story was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So did Brown actually veto a bill that would have helped scale back the prevalence of wildfires in the state? Not exactly, but the claim isnâ€™t completely off. Letâ€™s take a look. The 2016 piece of legislation in question, SB 1463, would have required the California Public Utilities Commission and Cal Fire (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection) to prioritize communities with conditions that could increase fire hazards associated with overhead utilities wires. What does that mean? The bill aimed to reduce the risk of power lines sparking fires in wooded areas and required the updating of fire safety maps. The maps determine whether utility companies have to clear brush in areas near overhead wires in order to alleviate the risk of fires. Related coverage:Â Examining Jerry Brownâ€™s veto of California wildfire legislation and the criticism of it Brown did veto the bill, but there is no direct evidence to suggest that the action increased the probability of wildfires. The commission also said it was already doing similar work before the proposal came along. But there are a still a few things to question here. SB 1463 had been unanimously approved by the state legislature and many have questioned why the governor would veto a bill that was unopposed. In his veto message, Brown says itâ€™s because it would have duplicated efforts, pointing out that agencies were already addressing the matter and that the process should continue ""in that forum."" Â  Jamie Court, president of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog Report, a progressive organization that advocates for taxpayer and consumer interests, disagrees, writing that the negligence of the stateâ€™s public utilities and Gov. Brownâ€™s failure to regulate them contributed to the fierce spread of past and current wildfires. Citing reporting by the Bay Area News Group, Court says that since the 2007 San Diego wildfires, PG&E (Pacific Gas and Electric Company) had stalled the creation of the new fire maps within the utility commissionâ€™s process. Court argues that the stonewalling, along with former PG&E executives being some of Brownâ€™s top aides, sheds light on the governorâ€™s role in the rapid spread of the stateâ€™s wildfires. But the California Public Utilities Commission has said the bill would have actually prolonged the safety work already going on by ""requiring the participation of certain entities, which was unnecessary because Cal Fire was already a party to the proceeding, and local governments and fire departments could also participate."" The commission also said that Cal Fire already has hazard maps, and based on those, people who live in high-risk areas face tougher construction standards. Regardless of which way you look at it, the statewide Fire-Threat Map was updated and approved in January 2018. A widely shared Canada Free Press article links California Gov. Jerry Brownâ€™s veto on a 2016 bill to the prevalence of the stateâ€™s wildfires over the past couple of years. It is accurate that Brown vetoed the bill, but the legislation only addressed one piece of wildfire management â€”Â a piece already being implemented by fire services and the stateâ€™s utility commission. The commission also said the bill would have slowed down their work. But some argue that for years the commission unnecessarily slowed the process of updating the fire safety maps, which played a role in failing to curb preventable wildfire damage. The maps were eventually updated and approved in January 2018. The story contains elements of truth, but fails to provide all the details.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Death Penalty', 'Illinois', 'Susana Mendoza']","
Did Mendoza cast the deciding vote to abolish Illinoisâ€™ death penalty? Not really.
","In the crowded race for Chicagoâ€™s next mayor, many of the would-be candidates are working to distinguish themselves by touting their progressive bona fides â€” or questioning those of their opponents. During a recent forum featuring five of those vying for the post, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza was called on to defend her criminal justice record by one of her opponents, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Mendoza was once a Democratic member of the Illinois House, where she honed a tough-on-crime reputation and had long supported the death penalty even as a succession of Illinois governors imposed a moratorium on the practice. Given that background, Preckwinkle asked Mendoza to explain how voters could trust her as mayor to push for criminal justice reforms. In response, Mendoza spoke of how her views on capital punishment had evolved. ""I know what itâ€™s like to be on the other side of crime,"" said Mendoza, who earlier in the debate had recalled how her family moved from Chicago's Little Village neighborhood when she was a child to escape violence. ""Having said that, yes I did support the death penalty. But I was the deciding vote on abolishing the death penalty in the state of Illinois. It would still be there had I not voted to abolish it."" The 2011 House vote to abolish executions in Illinois succeeded with the minimum number of 60 needed to pass. So, technically, any of those lawmakers who voted for the measure could lay claim to be a deciding vote. But did it really all come down to Mendoza? During debate on the House floor, Mendoza gave an impassioned speech describing how she had personally wrestled with the issue, legislative transcripts show. ""Throughout my entire life, Iâ€™ve been a staunch supporter of the death penalty and a firm believer in the justice it serves,"" Mendoza said on the House floor. ""But this debate for me is no longer about whether or not guilty killers deserve to die for their crimes,"" she added, describing how she had met with several former death row inmates in Illinois who had been wrongly convicted and then freed. ""Speaking to them and hearing their horror stories of being hours away from execution made me reflect on my own beliefs regarding our ability to apply the death penalty in a fair and error free way."" Even with Mendozaâ€™s support, however, the initial House vote on the measure was 59 to 58, one short of the 60-vote majority needed for passage. But the sponsor, then state Rep. Karen Yarbrough of Maywood, used a procedural move to allow for a second vote and then twisted the arm of a Quad Cities area Democrat to switch positions. ""Iâ€™d been back and forth on this since they started talking about abolishing it,"" then state Rep. Patrick Verschoore of Milan told the Bloomington Pantagraph in 2011 after the final vote. He said Yarbrough, who is now the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, called in a favor because she had supported him on other legislation. In light of this, we asked the Mendoza campaign to tell us how Mendoza could be considered the deciding vote on the measure. Spokeswoman Rebecca Evans emailed us a response that did not directly address the question. ""As is common during the legislative process, not everyone was accounted for during the initial vote for a variety of reasons,"" Evans wrote. ""The law to abolish the death penalty would not have passed without Susana's vote."" While defending her criminal justice record, Mendoza said she was ""the deciding vote on abolishing the death penalty in the state of Illinois."" Before making that claim, she accurately described her change of heart on the issue that led her to support the 2011 abolition measure after long backing capital punishment. And Mendoza is technically correct that the measure would have sunk had she voted the other way. By that standard, however, any one of the 59 other House members who supported the bill on final passage could make the same claim. Â  Even with Mendozaâ€™s support, the measure came up short on an initial vote. When the sponsor opted for a re-do later that day, a different lawmaker whoâ€™d opposed it on the first try switched his vote, securing its passage. In the end, it clearly didnâ€™t come down to Mendoza.

Facebook meme misleads about refugee benefits, Social Security checks
","False information is spreading on Facebook via a meme that supposedly compares monthly Â benefits for refugees with Social Security. The meme is a version of a false claim thatâ€™s circulated in Canada for years. ""Illegal refugees get $3,874/mo. Under the Federal Assistance Program. Our SS checks are approximately $1,200/mo.,"" said a meme posted on Facebook on Oct. 29 and so far shared more than 80,000 times. This post was flagged as part of Facebookâ€™s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Several elements of the claim about refugees are inaccurate or unsupported. The amount on Social Security checks is closer to the truth. One of the main things thatâ€™s off about the claim is its characterization of refugees as ""illegal."" Refugees are not here illegally. They enter the country legally under a refugee status and must apply for permanent lawful status one year after their arrival. The implication that they donâ€™t have a legal status is baseless. Refugees come to the United States because they are fleeing wars or persecution in their homelands. Upon arrival, many donâ€™t speak English and are unfamiliar with U.S. culture and norms. The United States offers them assistance with the aim of making them socially and economically self-sufficient. That aid is time-limited. The U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which has an agency in charge of refugee resettlement, did not provide PolitiFact an estimate on how much refugees receive per month under U.S. programs.Â Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) and Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) are available for eligible refugees for up to eight months from their date of arrival in the United States. In September 2017, for a story on refugee resettlement costs, an HHS spokeswoman told PolitiFact that the amount and type of federal assistance provided to refugees during their eligibility period can vary greatly. Cash and medical assistance are handled at the state level, and the state cost-sharing amounts vary significantly from state to state, HHS spokeswoman Victoria A. Palmer then told us. A State Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that the department provides a Reception and Placement per capita grant to nine national resettlement agencies to cover a portion of the initial reception, basic services, and material goods that resettlement agencies are required to provide to arriving refugees during their first 30 to 90 days in the United States. In fiscal year 2018, each grant totals $2,125 per refugee, according to the State Department. That includes assistance with rent, furnishings, necessary clothing, and food, as well as funding for the resettlement agency affiliate to provide case management services, cultural orientation, and connect refugees with employment services and English language classes, among other services, the State Department said. The specific $3,874 figure mirrors a 2017 Facebook post falsely claiming thatâ€™s how much one ""illegal"" refugee in Canada received per month from the ""federal assistance program."" Besides wrongfully labeling refugees as ""illegal,"" the post had several other shortcomings. For instance, the payment was not for one refugee, but for a family of five; and the $3,874 was not a recurring monthly payment. That amount did include some regular monthly benefits for housing, food, and transportation, but it also listed one-time ""start-up"" benefits and a loan, Snopes found in 2017. More than a decade ago, the Canadian government debunked a version of a false comparison of payments to refugees and pensioners. But that erroneous information persists and has transitioned from chain emails to social media posts. In December 2015, the public editor for Canadaâ€™s The Toronto Star wrote: ""Refugees to Canada do not get more financial help from the federal government than Canadian pensioners do. Unfortunately, the myth that they do is rooted in a mistake in a Toronto Star letter to the editor published in 2004."" The editor wrote that the mistake had ""come full circle"" â€” because it was published again in 2015 in another letter to the editor. Social Security beneficiaries include retirees and people with disabilities. The average Social Security disability benefit in 2018 is $1,200 per month and the average Social Security retirement benefit in 2018 is $1,422 per month, said Darren Lutz, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration. A Facebook post claims, ""Illegal refugees get $3,874/mo. Under the Federal Assistance Program. Our SS checks are approximately $1,200/mo."" Refugees are not in the United States illegally. The $3,874 figure traces back to a false claim circulating in Canada. The U.S. Health and Human Services department, which handles refugee resettlement, did not provide an estimate on how much refugees receive in assistance per month, but a department spokeswoman previously told us that the number can vary greatly. Social Security beneficiaries, such as retirees, on average receive more than $1,400 per month. The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Commonsense Ten ad accuses Roy Blunt of secretly adding provision to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris while girlfriend and son lobbied for the company
","
An independent group called Commonsense Ten has begun airing attack ads in several key Senate races including Missouri, where they have come after Rep. Roy Blunt with a potent cocktail, accusing Blunt of trying to push through pro-tobacco legislation while dating a Philip Morris lobbyist and cashing campaign checks from Philip Morris executives. 
Commonsense Ten, led by several Democratic strategists, sets the stage with a time/date stamp at the beginning of the ad: U.S. Capitol, Washington D.C., Nov. 13, 2002.

And then the conspiratorial-sounding voice-over:

""A critical national security bill is up for a vote. Just hours before, Roy Blunt secretly inserts language to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris. Blunt's girlfriend and son are lobbyists for the cigarette company, and just days earlier, 26 Philip Morris executives wrote checks to Blunt totaling $23,000.""

Republican Blunt's Democratic opponent Robin Carnahan included a similar allegation in one of her ads, stating, ""Congressman Roy Blunt. He got caught trying to insert a secret deal for tobacco giant Philip Morris into a bill just days after company executives gave him $30,000.""

The Commonsense Ten version scores an attack-ad trifecta. Big tobacco. Girlfriend and son lobbying for said big tobacco. And pay-to-play.

But is it accurate?

Let's start with the stuff in the ad that's not contested, or at least is well-documented. Back in November 2002, Blunt was dating Abigail Perlman, who was at that time a lobbyist for Philip Morris (and whom Blunt would later marry). Blunt's son, Andrew, was a lobbyist for Philip Morris in Missouri (not a federal lobbyist). And records show that Blunt got the donations cited in the ad from Philip Morris executives.

Now, to the contested part, whether Blunt secretly inserted language in a national security bill to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris.

It's an allegation that originated with a June 11, 2003 story in the Washington Post.

The Washington Post cited several unnamed sources who alleged Blunt -- just named the new majority whip -- ""surprised his fellow top Republicans by trying to quietly insert a provision benefiting Philip Morris USA into the 475-page bill creating a Department of Homeland Security.""

The story went on, ""Once alerted to the provision, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert's chief of staff, Scott Palmer, quickly had it pulled out, said a senior GOP leader who requested anonymity. Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Tex., also opposed what Blunt (Mo.) was trying to do, the member said, and 'worked against it' when he learned of it.""

According to the Post, ""the provision would have made it harder to sell tobacco products over the Internet and would have cracked down on the sale of contraband cigarettes, two practices that cut into Philip Morris's profits.""

Groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids opposed the Blunt provision at the time, arguing it had less to do with national security, which Blunt's office said was its intention, and more to do with protecting American cigarette companies. Among other things, they argued that while cracking down on cigarette smugglers, it also would have prevented U.S. tobacco companies from being sued by foreign governments which charged them with intentionally supporting international cigarette smuggling to avoid duties and taxes.

The Post story quoted a ""senior Republican lawmaker who requested anonymity"" saying ""some GOP members worried at the time that it would be 'embarrassing' to the party and its new whip if details of the effort were made public."" According to the story, ""Another Republican said Blunt's effort angered some leaders because there was 'so little support for' a pro-tobacco provision likely to generate controversy.""

Then, as now, Blunt defended the provision as good policy and a bona fide homeland security issue.

Blunt spokesman Rich Chrismer told us in an e-mail, ""The provision Roy Blunt and members of the House leadership supported would have cracked down on the illegal sale of contraband cigarettes to fund terrorist activities. Bipartisan legislation, originally sponsored by Democratic Senator Herb Kohl and Congressman Anthony Weiner, passed overwhelmingly in both bodies and is now the law of the land.""

Chrismer cited news accounts that documented the growing concern among federal law enforcement officials that smugglers were using millions of dollars acquired from illegal cigarette sales and funneling the cash to organizations such as al Qaeda and Hezbollah.

Chrismer also forwarded a letter former Majority Leader Dick Armey wrote to Blunt on July 21, 2004:

""I have been reading a lot about the anti-terrorism provision that you and others wanted to include in the homeland security bill in November 2002, and I wanted to correct the record on a few circumstances surrounding that effort.""

Armey wrote that he ""not only agreed with the provision, but understood the Senate would be supportive.""

""I recall that the Speaker's office was concerned that the Judiciary Committee had not yet thoroughly reviewed the provision by means of committee hearings and markup,"" Armey wrote. ""He did not want a jurisdictional fight on his hands, and it is his job to manage those issues. But, since then, the Judiciary Committee has held hearings and approved a freestanding bill to crack down on illegal sales of cigarettes and eliminate a source of funding for terrorist groups.

""The effort you and I supported has great momentum now,"" Armey stated, ""and I am tired of reading stories that only tell half the truth.""

But the provision proposed by Blunt was not identical to the later Kohl/Weiner bill referenced by Blunt spokesman Chrismer, which ultimately passed. The Kohl/Weiner legislation was similar, in that it sought to address Internet cigarette sales and other contraband trafficking of tobacco products. But there was nothing in that bill about blocking foreign governments from bringing lawsuits against U.S. tobacco companies in U.S. courts for their involvement in tobacco tax evasion or related contraband trafficking. That's the part of Blunt's provision that groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids opposed. In fact, the Campaign strongly supported the later, bipartisan legislation. 
According to a 2003 press release from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, ""The problem of contraband and Internet sales of tobacco products is a serious one that Congress should address. But the approach advocated by Philip Morris and Rep. Blunt is narrowly written to protect only Philip Morrisâ€™ commercial interests and not the broader public health or state government interests involved."" 
Allegations of ""secretly inserting"" provisions into bills are often a matter of interpretation. In this case, hours before a final vote on the Homeland Security Bill, Blunt proposed a provision that had not been vetted in a committee meeting or in legislative markup sessions. It may have been added in a way that meant there was little notice and little discussion, but that doesn't necessarily add up to ""secretly."" 
Blunt may argue the provision was a legitimate homeland security concern and that a similar version later received bipartisan support. But the Blunt provision was opposed by some anti-tobacco groups, who viewed it as special interest legislation to benefit big tobacco. And we note that those groups did not oppose the later legislation. 
When you date (and later marry) a Philip Morris lobbyist, when you have a son who works as a tobacco lobbyist, when you accept hefty sums of campaign money from tobacco executives, and then you add an 11th hour provision that some view as pro-big tobacco, you leave yourself open to the kind of criticism raised in the ad. ""Secretly"" may be overstating how Blunt acted, but the ad's other points are backed up, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E1D800>],/factchecks/2010/oct/05/commonsense-ten/commonsense-ten-ad-accuses-roy-blunt-secretly-inse/

Rick Scott says Alex Sink funneled $770,000 to her former employer, Bank of America, while serving as CFO
","
Rick Scott, who masterfully ran an insider vs. outsider campaign to defeat Bill McCollum in Florida's Republican primary for governor, is trying to use a similar tactic against his Democratic opponent, Alex Sink.

Scott is highlighting Sink's record as a member of the Florida Cabinet in a new ad called ""No bid,"" alleging that Sink steered government contracts -- and the money that goes with it -- to her former employer Bank of America. Watch the ad here.

""Newspapers discovered Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America,"" the narrator says. ""That's the same Bank of America once run by, you guessed it, Alex Sink.""

The ad goes on to say that Sink never disclosed her conflict of interest and ""never even asked for other bids.""

We wanted to put the no-bid Bank of America contract claim to the rigors of the Truth-O-Meter.

The single source in the ad is a St. Petersburg Times article published Aug. 2, 2009. The article, written by Sydney P. Freedberg and Adam C. Smith, deals with Sink's decision to create a blind trust to manage her personal investments. A blind trust is pretty much what it sounds like: Sink's investments are managed by third-party trustees, and Sink does not know when she buys or sells stocks.

She created the blind trust in December 2006 to guard against speculation that her stock portfolio would affect her decisions as state chief financial officer. Those very allegations dogged her predecessor, Tom Gallagher, who while in office traded stock in companies that had contracts with the state or were regulated by his office.

The Times article pointed out some flaws in Sink's decision, namely that the trust isn't truly blind because Sink knew what investments initially made up the blind trust. She also isn't required to list the specific investments that make up her blind trust as part of her annual financial disclosure form.

What does any of that have to do with funneling money to Bank of America, asÂ Scott's adÂ alleges?

Sink said that what went into her blind trust is substantially what she reported on a financial disclosure statement in 2006. Among other holdings, it listed two accounts that contained $4.9 million in assets, including stock in Bank of America and Raymond James. Sink spent 26 years in banking, retiring in 2000 as head of Bank of America's Florida operations. That year, she made $3.4 million from the bank in salary, pension, deferred compensation and stock grants.

In their article, Freedberg and Smith pointed out that Sink could still own Bank of America stock.

And in late 2008, Freedberg and Smith said, she ""voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit.""

If a state official casts a vote that would result in private gain, Florida law requires the official to disclose the conflict within 15 days. The law also prohibits a public official from having a financial relationship with any business entity that would create a continuing conflict or impede his or her duties. Sink didn't declare a conflict in this case.

Sink says she didn't know what interests she had, so she had no conflict to declare.

That's the background for the story, which is the foundation for the ad.

We can best analyze Scott's claim by taking apart and expanding on the two sentences in the Freedberg and Smith story. First up: ""Sink voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America.""

Credit crisis creates bond changes

At the height of the credit crisis in the fall of 2008, the state -- like everyone -- was having trouble borrowing money or selling bonds to borrow money to fund capital projects.

Of particular concern was the extreme volatility of the municipal bond market. Florida Division of Bond Finance Director Ben Watkins said the municipal bond market had slowed to 15 to 20 percent of its normal weekly flow, and interest rates varied daily by as much as 10-20 basis points.

One possible solution, Watkins said, was to add another way for the state to issue some bonds.

The state sells bonds through something called a competitive bond sale. In a competitive process, any broker dealer or dealer bank could bid on the bonds at a designated date and time. The bonds are then awarded to whoever offers the lowest interest rate. But the rigidity of the competitive process -- the date and time -- combined with a disinterest in the market, could put Florida at an adverse fiscal position, Watkins said.

An alternative is something called a negotiated sale process. In a negotiated sale, an underwriter is chosen by the state to purchase the bonds. The underwriter than re-sells the bonds to individual investors. Because the timing can be carefully planned, partners in a negotiated bond sale aren't at the mercy of the whims of investors or the news of the day. Conversely, in better times, partners could get locked into a higher interest rate than they otherwise could have seen on the open market.

To start the process, Watkins issued a request for proposals to find bond underwriters on Oct. 20, 2008. The state received 39 responses by the deadline of Nov. 3. A few weeks later, at a Nov. 20, 2008, meeting of the Cabinet, Watkins asked Cabinet members to approve a consortium of underwriters, and the negotiated sale process.

""If the market conditions continue to improve, stabilize, we may not ever need to use the negotiated method of sale in order to borrow money,"" Watkins said in a response to a question from Gov. Charlie Crist. ""So it really is a Plan B. It's contingency planning. We didn't know six weeks ago how long these problems would persist, and so it was prudent for us to plan an alternative, a Plan B, if you will, to be able to strategically access credit or sell bonds if in fact we couldn't do it in the normal way.""

During a susequent discussion, Attorney General Bill McCollum asked that the state add a two-year sunset on the approval of the negotiated sale process with the consortium of underwriters. He moved the approval of the sale process for a two-year period. Sink seconded the motion. It was approved unanimously.

Who made the consortium?

A group of five large firms, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan, three mid-size firms, three small firms and an Internet based firm.

Now, we can tackle Scott's specific claim, which comes from the second sentence in the Freedberg/Smith story: ""One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit.""

Exploring the Bank of America related deal

Less than three weeks after approving a new way of selling bonds, on Dec. 9, 2008, the governor and Cabinet were asked to issue up to $300 million in lottery revenue bonds to help implement classroom size reductions mandated by the class size amendment to the Florida Constitution.

Watkins proposed either a negotiated or competitive sale, depending on market conditions, and asked the Cabinet and governor to approve a resolution authorizing either process.

Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Bronson moved approval of the resolution, which was seconded by McColllum. It passed 4-0.

Fast forward to spring 2009. The Division of Bond Finance decided to use the negotiated process, not the competitive process, to sell the bonds. They negotiated the bond sale with the consortium and chose Merrill Lynch as senior manager.

A total of 12 underwriters participated in the bond sale, and were paid a commission based on their sales.

Merrill Lynch sold more than half of the bonds and received $739,773 in fees. Bank of America sold 2 percent of the bonds and received $30,548 in fees. That's a total of $770,321, and the basis for the claim in the Scott ad.

How?

Because Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch.

On Sept. 15, 2008, Bank of America announced an agreement to acquire Merrill Lynch. The merger was approved by stockholders Dec. 5, 2008, though it was not completed until January 2009. In their Nov. 3, 2008, responses to the RFP, both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch noted the pending merger.

""On September 15, 2008, the Corporation announced that it has agreed to acquire Merrill Lynch,"" Bank of America wrote in its response. Merrill Lynch's description of the pending transaction was almost identical.

Our ruling

As you might have noticed by now, at word 1,438 of this fact check, Scott's claim is way more complex than it sounds in his 30-second spot, ""No bid.""

We're checking his claim that ""Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America,"" the bank she used to work for.

Let's take this one step at a time.

Alex Sink funneled ... This is a misleading verb choice. First, she was one of four statewide elected officials to agree to change the process for selling state bonds that ultimately resulted in paying $770,321 in commission fees to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. Second, she had no idea when she approved the new bond sale process -- called a negotiated sale -- that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive $770,321. That came months later as part of the negotiations between the bond underwriters and the Division of Bond Finance.

Three quarters of a million dollars ... The money in question is just about right. The total commission paid to Bank of America and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit was $770,321.

In no-bid contracts ... This specific claim has generated some controversy. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org, for instance, said that the contract at issue was not a no-bid contract. We disagree. Here are the facts. The state held an RFP for companies to be bond underwriters in general, not to specifically bid on bond sales. Thirty-nine companies responded, and ultimately 12 were chosen. There was no competitive bidding for the $300 million lottery revenue bond issue. The state negotiated a deal among those 12 companies. That's a no-bid contract to us, because the setup specifically prevents open competition that could produce lower interest rates. The state said it needed to pursue negotiated deals because of the volatility of the credit market, and maybe that's true. But the question here isÂ whether there were bids for this specific bond issue. There were not.

To Bank of America ... The fees actually were paid to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired. But what's critical to note, again, is that while Bank of America interests represented two of the 12 members of the state bond underwriting team, Sink had no idea when she approved the slate of underwriters what specific role each bank would play in any specific bond sale. And even when she approved the $300 million lottery bond issue, it wasn't yet clear whether the sale of those bonds would be by a competitive or negotiated process. The resolution she and three others approved included either option. We should note that the ad claims that ""your tax dollars"" paid for the Bank of America commissions. That's not true. The bond issue was using lottery revenues, not general tax revenues. That means you buying lottery tickets paid for the bond sale and the bank commissions.

The basis of the claim in the Scott ad is a paragraph in a St. Petersburg Times story about Sink, saying she ""voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit."" That statement is accurate, as it properly notes that the negotiated bond sale process resulted in $770,000 in fees for Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, without trying to tie the money directly to Sink.

Scott isn't nearly as careful in his TV ad. Particularly, his use of the word ""funneled"" overshadows some of the facts Scott gets right in his claim. Sink didn't funnel $770,000 to Bank of America. First, she was one of four votes on the Cabinet to approve the particular type of bond issue in question -- along with Republicans Charlie Bronson and Bill McCollum and then-Republican Charlie Crist.Â  Second, she had no way of knowing how much commission Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive for the bond sale when she approved the deal. Those details came months later during negotiations between state bond administrators and the banks. We rate Scott's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809764C700>],/factchecks/2010/oct/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-alex-sink-funneled-770k-her-former/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'We Love USA PAC']","
PAC claims Klein's amendment would allow price gouging
","
A political action committee entered the fray between U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, and his Republican challenger Allen West. The ""We Love USA""Â PACÂ is not in love with Klein -- the group's website features an image of Klein dangling from puppet strings being directed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The entrance of a PAC isn't surprising in this big-money District 22 battleground in South Florida.

When we first spotted the website on Sept. 24, 2010, it had a video posted called ""Klein passing gas."" A few days later we found the same video on YouTubeÂ though the date was June 18, 2008 -- during Klein's previous re-election bid when he also faced West.

The 1-minute, 16-second video focuses on gasoline prices. Near the start, text on the screen states, ""While the prices at the pump are skyrocketing, Ron Klein speaks strong..."" The video shows an undated clip of him apparently speaking on the House floor about giving the Federal Trade Commission ""the authority to crack down on the people who price gouge."" Then the text says ""But Klein lies! ... Ron Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging.""

We wanted to know, did Klein sponsor an amendment related to gas prices that ""specifically allows price gouging""? In South Florida, with limited public transportation options, residents rely heavily on cars -- so gas prices matter to many voters. And in a region prone to gas shortages caused by hurricanes, we're sensitive to the issue of gouging.

The video mixes narration, text and photos. The images show a gas station with prices as high as $5.199 a gallon and a blurry image of Klein in front of another station. The text cites an amendment to H.R. 3355 offered by Klein on Nov. 8, 2007, and claims it was ""to modify the instruction prohibiting price gouging by replacing it with language discouraging price gouging, thereby legalizing price gouging.""

It continues: ""Middle-class families and their increasingly tight budgets need relief. Not more lies and broken promises. Floridians are paying twice as much at the gas pump as when Ron Klein came to office in 2006... Every time we pump gas into our car or truck, we should remember that Ron Klein allows price gouging!"" In the background, Gwen Stefani's sultry voice can be heard singing the hit single ""Don't Speak"" by No Doubt.

First, some background -- and we could find little -- about We Love USA.

The group's website states that the PAC was set up on Sept. 23, 2010, and that ""Our core mission is simple; showing the voters how the candidates have voted during the Obama administration. Those in Congress who voted with Pelosi on every single important bill are trying to hide their record thruÂ negative attacks and denial of their near unanimous voting with her. We will do our best to not let the voters forget where these politicians stand on the issues.""

FEC reportsÂ show that the PAC filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission Sept. 21 and lists Nancy Watkins, of the accounting firm Robert Watkins and CompanyÂ in Tampa, as the treasurer. The PAC filed an FEC report Sept. 28 showing it had spent $62,652 on advertising.

In an interview with the Miami Herald editorial board Sept. 27, both West and Klein said that they had nothing to do with the PAC. The PAC responded to e-mails about the gas video but not about the PAC itself. Nor did anyone return phone calls.

About three hours after our first e-mail Sept. 27 asking about the gas video, the PAC responded that it had taken down the video.

""Thank you for bringing to our attention that we should provide links to fact check our videos and statements we place on this website,'' said the e-mail signed ""Media Relations."" ""We have pulled the video 'Ron Klein Pass Gas' as it stated that Ron Klein came to office in 2006. In 2006, Ron Klein became Congressman-Elect, and officially took office in January 2007. Because of this oversight, we have decided to take the video off of the website.""

But the PAC still stood behind the claim about price gouging, and Mark Laffler of We Love USA e-mailed us the amendments cited in the ad.

Let's look at H.R. 3355. The bill, sponsored by Klein in 2007, was called the ""Homeowners Defense Act of 2007."" The bill was to provide federal support for state-sponsored insurance programs to help homeowners facing natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. On Nov. 8, 2007, U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, a Republican who represents west-central Florida, introduced an amendmentÂ to ""prohibit price gouging in any disaster area located within the State.""

The amendment defines price gouging as: ""providing of any consumer good or service by a supplier related to repair or restoration of property damaged from a catastrophe for a price that the supplier knows or has reason to know is greater, by at least the percentage set forth in a State law or regulation prohibiting such act (not withstanding any real cost increase due to any attendant business risk and other reasonable expenses that result from the major catastrophe involved), than the price charged by the supplier for such consumer good or service immediately before the disaster.""

Klein responded with his own amendment to strike ""prohibit"" and insert ""discourage."" He wanted to soften that price-gouging language because he didn't want to set up a barrier to many states joining the national disaster consortium.

The overall bill passed the House, 258-155, on Nov. 8, 2007, but stalled in the Senate. The Homeowners Defense Act of 2010, H.R. 2555,Â sponsored by Klein is pending.

That doesnâ€™t make Klein soft on gasoline price gouging though. We found three laws he voted for that were specifically aimed at prohibiting gas price gouging or limiting gas prices:

â€¢ Klein was one of 125 co-sponsors and voted for the ""Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act"" H.R. 1252Â in 2007. It would have made it illegal during an emergency to sell gas at an excessive price. That bill stalled in a Senate committee. A related bill, H.R. 6346Â the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act in 2008, failed to become law though Klein did vote for it.

â€¢ Klein voted for the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008 H.R. 6074,Â which would haveÂ made it illegal for foreign states to act together to limit the production of gas or set the price. The related Senate bill S. 879Â had hearings but no vote.

â€¢ Klein voted for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008 H.R. 6022. It passed and ""directs the Secretary of the Interior to suspend petroleum acquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the royalty-in-kind program"" through the end of 2008. Pelosi called for the move to bring down gas prices. This bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 19, 2008.

We also wanted to check the ad's claim that gas prices doubled during Klein's tenure in Congress. The PAC, in an e-mail, wrote that the price of gas doubled in 2008 and sent us a link to GasBuddyÂ for historical gas prices in Miami -- which is outside of Klein's Congressional district.

We contacted AAA and asked for gas prices for January 2006, January 2007 and the most recent month available in 2010 for Fort Lauderdale -- part of the city lies within the district. AAAâ€™s chart showed a gallon of unleaded gas cost $2.3855 in January 2006, $2.3074 in January 2007, and $2.7175 in September 2010. AAA figures show the average price rose to more than $4 in 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, though the peak was still more than 50 cents short of doubling from the start of Kleinâ€™s term.

Let's review: the We Love USA PAC had a video on its website that stated ""Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging."" Klein's amendment was to change the wording from ""prohibit"" price gouging to ""discourage."" The PAC interprets ""discourage"" to mean ""specifically allows,"" which is a stretch. Further, the video suggests to the viewer that the amendment was about gas prices -- but the bill was about homeowners insurance and property damage. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BDDB40>],/factchecks/2010/oct/05/we-love-usa-pac/pac-claims-kleins-amendment-would-allow-price-goug/
"['Health Care', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Voting Record', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Ron Johnson says Russ Feingold went against the wishes of Wisconsinites in voting for health care bill
","
U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold loves to remind Wisconsin voters he visits every county every year, with those ""listening sessions"" giving him the pulse of residents from Superior to Sturtevant.

So itâ€™s noteworthy when Republican challenger Ron Johnson attacks the three-term Democrat for not following the will of the people.

In a new TV ad, Johnson charges that Feingold ignored public opinion by voting in March for sweeping health care changes backed by President Barack Obama and Democrats. The topic is a rallying point in many GOP campaigns across the country.

""A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care,"" the ad says, as statistics from an opinion poll pop up. ""But Russ Feingold voted for it anyway. Feingold had a choice to make. The official Congressional Record shows Feingold toed the party line, instead of listening to us.""

So did Feingoldâ€™s vote fly in the face of majority opinion on the matter?

The poll cited in the Johnson ad was done by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank based in Hartland, Wis., and released 12 days before the March 25 congressional action on the landmark legislation.

The poll was directed by political scientist Ken Goldstein of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and surveyed 600 likely state voters. On the health care question, it found opponents (55 percent) outnumbered supporters (37 percent), with 8 percent undecided. The margin of error was four percentage points.

When we asked the Johnson campaign for any Â backup, they pointed us to a second poll: a June 2010 Rasmussen Reports poll -- three months after the Feingold vote -- that found 58 percent of likely state voters favored repealing the health care law.

We found two other polls that preceded the vote:

One from Rasmussen Reports looked at 500 likely voters, with 54 percent opposed and 43 percent in favor. That was released on March 18, 2010. The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points.

The other one we found was further removed from the vote, dating to November 2009, but is notable because it sampled a broader base -- adults in Wisconsin -- than the ""likely voters"" surveyed in the other two.

That was the UW Badger Poll conducted by the University of Wisconsin Survey Center, which found a virtual split: 46 percent opposed and 44 percent in favor, in a poll with a four percentage point margin of error.

The findings in the polls were in line with national tracking polls at the time, which consistently showed opponents outnumbering supporters, though the gap was narrowing in March 2010.

In this case, however, the polls donâ€™t end the argument.

A closer look at the language shows Johnson frames the issue around a question the polls did not ask.

The pre-vote polls used straightforward references to the ""health care reform plan"" or ""proposed changes to the health care system."" That is in contrast to the Johnson ad, which says a majority of Wisconsinites opposed -- and Feingold voted for -- a ""government takeover of health care.""

Goldstein, who ran the poll cited in the Johnson ad, said the campaignâ€™s language did not accurately summarize the question he posed. He noted the wide disagreement among policy experts over whether the Democratsâ€™ legislation was a ""government takeover.""

That two-word phrase -- government takeover -- became Republican shorthand in opposing the legislation, even though Democrats dropped the ""public option"" approach under which the feds would have run a plan to compete with private health insurance.

Our PolitiFact colleagues have repeatedly probed the truth of the government takeover charge, and found it ridiculously false -- a Pants on Fire. In truth, the health care law creates a market-based system that relies on private health insurance companies.

The Johnson mischaracterization of the poll language creates another wrinkle.

If you opposed the bill, it does not automatically follow that you also opposed a ""government takeover of health care"" (the phrase in Johnsonâ€™s ad), according to two national polls. One was by the Associated Press/Stanford University, and the other by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Those polls found that a significant chunk of the opposition is people who felt the federal government did not go far enough on making changes -- as opposed to going too far.

In the AP poll released in September, 2010, nearly one-quarter -- 23 percent -- of those who were opposed or neutral on the health care law reported that they liked most or all of it but thought it didnâ€™t ""do enough to improve the health care system.""

Notably, 32 percent of opponents who described themselves as independents felt that way, and 8 percent of Republicans.

The widely cited Kaiser Family Foundation health tracking poll asked a question in February 2010 that tried to measure whether opponents thought there was too little or too much reform in the package. They were asked a series of questions, including whether they were motivated by concerns the legislation ""doesnâ€™t go far enough in expanding coverage or controlling costs."" In response, Â 49 percent called that a major reason.

Still, given another option, a whopping 80 percent of opponents said government getting too big a role was also a major reason they didnâ€™t like it.

We could find no Wisconsin-specific polling on the nature of opponentsâ€™ complaints.

But the UW Badger poll last fall asked a specific question about the federal governmentâ€™s direct role in insurance. Nearly six in 10 of all respondents -- 58 percent -- favored a government run Â ""public option"" plan.

To be sure, Feingold did come under fire at many of his listening sessions for his support of the measure. But Johnsonâ€™s ad suggests there was hard-line certainty among state residents when the reality is much fuzzier.

What does Feingold say?

He told PolitiFact Wisconsin that in his vote he was following the wishes of people in Wisconsin, based on his overall experience at listening sessions and his re-election in 2004 on a health-care reform platform. He said polls during the long health care debate were all over the map.

""I saw polls that said that a certain percentage of people didnâ€™t want any bill, a certain percentage of people wanted a stronger bill, and a certain percentage wanted this bill,"" Feingold said. ""This bill is right in the middle of what Wisconsin people want in terms of when it comes to control over the insurance industry.""

Letâ€™s sort all this out.

Johnson turns to polling data for support of his claim but uses loaded language to mischaracterize the question in the poll -- and what Feingold voted for. The pollster himself said Â the description in the ad does not match the question that was asked. Whatâ€™s more, Johnsonâ€™s ad says a ""majority of Wisconsinites"" were opposed. But the more timely state polls measured only likely voters, not the entire adult population. The broadest poll we found -- measuring the view ofÂ  Wisconsin adults -- was older, but it did not find a majority in opposition.

We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D36380>],/factchecks/2010/oct/05/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-russ-feingold-went-against-wishes/

Attorney General Greg Abbott says more people have been killed because of the drug war in Juarez than have been killed in the war in Afghanistan
","
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has squared off with the federal government on several fronts: the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases threaten the environment, the new health care law and border security.

On a July 16 broadcast of Fox New's ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren,"" Abbott emphasized the gravity of violence on the Texas-Mexico border. 
""Look at the raw numbers,"" he said. ""More lives have been lost because of the war with the drug cartels in Juarez alone, just a few blocks from the United States of America, than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan. Over the past couple of years, more than 2,400 people in Juarez alone have been killed because of the drug cartel war, more than 5,000 across the country of Mexico. It is more dangerous to walk the streets of Juarez a few blocks from El Paso than it is to walk the streets of Baghdad."" 
Drug violence surged in Mexico in 2008, when the death toll doubled that of 2007, according to a January 2009 CNN story. A September 2008 memo from the U.S. Consulate General in Juarez warns Americans from traveling in Chiuahua due to ""an increase in violent criminal activity fueled by a war between drug cartels."" 
First we wondered whether Baghdad is really safer than Juarez, but one security expert suggested that would be a subjective call. The death toll is one indicator of how dangerous a city is, but there are other variables, said Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company. ""Safe for whom and safe from what?"" he asked. 
For now, we decided to focus on whether more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in Juarez than in the war in Afghanistan. 
Regarding the death toll in Juarez, Jerry Strickland, Abbott's spokesman, sent us links to three news stories and two government websites enumerating those killed in the border city across from El Paso. 
A Feb. 1 crime and safety report on Juarez posted on the federal Overseas Security Advisory Council website says that ""although Mexican media and government sources offer varying crime statistics, most sources report at least 2,640 murders committed in and around the city in 2009, up from 1,600 in 2008 and 300 in 2007 ... Violent crime is part of everyday life in Ciudad Juarez. However, the surge in homicides has mostly involved fighting between cartels and street gangs, or between cartels and security forces. Victims without direct involvement in organized crime represent only a small percentage of overall homicides."" 
From a July 13 Reuters story: ""The daily killings have become so normal they have almost ceased to shock. Unless Mexico's Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, bucks all previous indicators and undergoes a dramatic security turnaround, the death toll from the drug war raging in the city since January 2008 will reach 6,000 people this month. That is more than all the dead serving in the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan."" 
And McClatchy, citing the Diario newspaper in Juarez, reported in June that between January and June 27, the death toll rose to 1,363, up from 871 during that same period in 2009, and 520 in 2008. 
Relying on that information, Strickland told us that more than 5,733 people have been killed since January 2008. 
Stewart, at Stratfor, had slightly different numbers: 4,677 deaths in Juarez from January 2009 through August 2010. 
So, it seems that since January 2008, at least 3,000 to 5,000 people at least have been killed in Juarez. Since deaths unrelated to drug violence were nominal, according to the Overseas Security Advisory Council, Abbott's figure on Fox â€” at least 2,400 killed in Juarez in connection with the cartels â€” sounds conservative. 
What about Afghanistan? 
Strickland pointed us to military death tolls for 2008-10 on CNN.com, which has mapped U.S. coalition casualties in Afghanistan by age, location and date. During 2008 and 2009, 808 were killed in Afghanistan, according to the site. As of Oct. 4, 542 people had been killed in 2010. However, Strickland said 239 were killed as of June 1, bringing total military deaths to about 1,50 troops when he made his claim on Fox in July. 
Including civilian casualties tracked by the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, we found that 5,880 were killed in Afghanistan between 2008-10 â€” keeping in mind that our tally includes deaths that happened after Abbott made his statement. Abbott calculated 5,475 total casualties during the same time period. 
But the war in Afghanistan has lasted much longer than three years â€” the United States invaded in October 2001. 
When we asked Abbott's office why he limited the number killed in Afghanistan from 2008 to date, Strickland said it was an ""apples to apples comparison in terms of time frame."" 
That might be so, but Abbott flatly told Van Susteren that more lives have been lost in the war with drug cartels in Juarez than have been lost in the war in Afghanistan. Just because the violence in Mexico surged in the past couple years isn't reason to disregard those killed in Afghanistan prior to 2008. 
According to the U.S. Department of Defense, as of Sept. 27, 1,291 Americans had been killed as a result of the war in Afghanistan, including two civilian casualties, and 94 who were killed outside of Afghanistan. According to the CNN page that Strickland cites, 2,115 U.S. troops and coalition forces have been killed since 2001 (11 were killed that year). 
Stewart suggested we check iCasualties.org, a website that tracks military casualties, for a fuller picture of total deaths in Afghanistan: that tally was 2,128 when we looked at the site Oct. 4. 
Next, we looked at United Nations' data for civilian casualties since 2007, the earliest record we found. About 1,520 civilians died that year â€” about 6,050 since 2007. 
So even with limited information on how many civilians have been killed in Afghanistan, it seems at least 8,000 people have died as a result of the war since 2001. 
Where does that leave us? 
By Abbott's calculation, cobbled from various news and government reports, 258 more people were killed in Juarez than in Afghanistan between 2008 and this past summer, when Abbott appeared on Fox. But that's not what he said. He said more people have died as result of the drug war in Juarez, dating a couple years back, than have died as a result of the war in Afghanistan. That war started in 2001, and far as we can tell, more people have died from it.

"['Georgia', 'Jimmy Carter']","
Carter said record with Congress better than most presidents
","
Thirty years since losing the White House after a single term, Jimmy Carter is at ease with his presidential legacy.

In his recent book ""White House Diary,"" Carter released excerpts from a journal he kept as president. In its afterword, he acknowledged it may be his last chance to comment on the work he and his team carried out, and he is ""proud of what we accomplished.""

This pride extends to what he described as a winning record with the U.S. Congress, according to his Sept. 20 interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams.

""And as you probably know, I had the highest batting average with Congress than any president in modern days except Lyndon Johnson,"" Carter said. ""Better than John Kennedy, better than anybody else. Despite the fact that we had some highly controversial things. So I had a very successful term.""

The Carter Center uses his success rating (batting average) from Congressional Quarterly, a leading authority on Congress. They calculate percentage of votes that go a president's way during his term. It's also based on a University of Virginia essay on his presidency.

But wasn't Carter famously at odds with Congress? How could he possibly have been ""successful""?

We looked at Carter's ""White House Diary,"" where he elaborated more carefully on his track record in commentary accompanying Carter's April 19, 1977, entry:

""Despite the controversial and often unpopular nature of my proposals to the Congress, I had remarkably good success in congressional approval of bills I supported. The Congressional Quarterly reported that since 1953 Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy and I ranked in that order in obtaining approval of legislation proposed to Congress. The Miller Center reported that my record exceeded Kennedy's.""

CQ Almanac publishes vote studies each year that determine how often the president took a clear position on a vote in Congress, and how often they went his way.

The almanac lists success rates by term of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower through George W. Bush. If you average those rates for each president, Carter is third. He got his way 76.6 percent of the time. That's right behind Kennedy at 84.6 and Johnson at 82.2.

That seems simple enough, but things get complicated from there.

We also looked at the Miller Center of Public Affairs' website, which he cited for saying he was second only to Johnson. The book's afterword quoted the site directly:

""Carter gained a reputation for political ineptitude, even though his actual record in dealing with Congress belied that image. His success rate in getting presidential initiatives through Congress was much higher than that of Bush [...] Carter was also close to Johnson's success rates, and higher than Kennedy's record.""

The problem is that the website has since been revised since the book was published. Carter's CQ scores contradict it, so it was changed to avoid confusion, a Miller Center spokeswoman said.

The Miller Center's assessment that Carter's congressional record is much better than it is perceived still stands, the spokeswoman emphasized. Â  

We located no study that found Carter was second only to Johnson. Still, even if he's third behind Kennedy, who did not serve a full term, the change does not make that big of a difference, said Steven H. Hochman, director of research at the Carter Center.

""The difference was just Kennedy. Was he before or behind Kennedy? And it's not too much of a difference,"" Hochman said.

Now for the tough part.
Â  
There are many ways to assess a president's legislative success. Scholars think CQ's measure is helpful, but it does not take into account whether the president manages to turn his proposals into law. For instance, a tax package might pass the Senate but fail in the House. CQ would count the Senate vote as a success even though the overall effort failed.

Furthermore, it may not be fair to compare the average of a two-term president with Carter's single term, one scholar noted. Second-term scores tend to be lower and drag a president's overall average down. If you compare first terms only, Carter drops to fourth behind Dwight D. Eisenhower. 

And if you look at how many of Carter's initiatives actually were enacted, his record is unexceptional. According to an analysis by Andrew Rudalevige, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., who has studied presidential legislative successes, only 44 percent of his initiatives became law. This puts him behind Johnson, Bill Clinton, Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush and Kennedy, in that order. (Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush are tied.)Â  Â 

Plus, if you compare Carter to other presidents who served while their parties controlled both the House and Senate, he's at or near the bottom, according to another analysis published in 1990. Â 

Still, Carter won nearly 70 percent of his contested and important votes, according to CQ numbers cited in Rudalevige's analysis. Â 

Other problems with the CQ score are that it doesn't measure whether a president's proposal was watered down, or take into account whether he worked under unusually hostile conditions.

And Carter did push an ambitious agenda during a very difficult time, experts agreed. His proposals included reforms on health care, welfare and energy, topics that remain difficult today.

Furthermore, the Democratic Party was deeply divided during Carter's administration. Reforms in the House of Representatives dispersed power more widely among its members, making it difficult to influence the body as a whole.

Even Johnson, who is renowned for his legislative skill, would have struggled under those conditions, notes Mark A. Peterson, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who has written extensively on presidential legislative successes.

""Yes, by one measure Carter did very well legislatively, but not quite as well as he has claimed,"" Peterson said. He didn't do well compared to other presidents whose parties had majorities in both houses of Congress, but considering his party's divisions, his achievements are notable, he added.Â 

""And by another measure that really matters -- actually enacting legislation -- Carter fared quite poorly, with the recognition that he tried to push a bold, difficult agenda,"" Peterson said.Â 

Overall, though, experts we interviewed said Carter's legislative record exceeds its reputation.

""It's somewhat of a mixed case, but it is more successful than most people think,"" Rudalevige said.

Consider his victory on the 1978 Panama Canal treaties, noted George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University who has written about Carter's legislative record. In 1976, almost half of the Senate pledged they would vote against altering the existing arrangement. Carter managed to get the two-thirds vote needed to change it in 1978.

Now, what do we make of all this?

We found no evidence that Carter's record surpassed every president since Eisenhower's but Johnson's, but according to one measure, he was close.

A broader look at Carter's legislative record showed it was mixed. In at least one case, the Panama Canal treaties, his achievement was exceptional.

Yet while his proposals garnered favorable votes in one chamber, many never became law. It's hard to call that a true record of legislative success.Â 

Still, he did better than most people think.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia defines Half True as an accurate statement that leaves out important details or take things out of context.

And we rate Carter's statement as just that -- Half True.Â ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F93EC0>],/factchecks/2010/oct/05/jimmy-carter/carter-said-record-congress-better-most-presidents/

House Republicans accuse Will Rasmussen of supporting sales tax
","
In a political tit-for-tat, Oregon House Republicans are going after Will Rasmussen, the Democratic candidate for House District 37, for allegedly supporting a sales tax. This comes after Democrats targeted Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate, for the very same thing.

PolitiFact Oregon already looked into the charge levied against Parrish and found it lacking, but now Republicans say Rasmussen was just using those allegations as a way to cover up his own support for a sales tax.

""Why are Will Rasmussen and the House Democrats making false claims about Parrish's position on sales taxes?"" reads the e-mail from the House Republicans. ""Are they trying to mask Rasmussen's support of a sales tax as recently as last spring?""

We figured if we fact checked the Democratsâ€™ claim and found it to be a little less than truthful, it might be worth our time to check in on the Republicans, too.

The e-mail we received from the Republicans cites comments Rasmussen made on March 15, 2010, at a Washington County Public Affairs Forum as the basis for the attack. Specifically, it highlights a piece of an answer about the stateâ€™s initiative petition process.

Hereâ€™s the way the Republicans framed the remarks: ""Rasmussen told the Washington County Public Affairs Forum that Oregon should look â€˜at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable.â€™"" (That second quote is them quoting Rasmussen.)

So, we went back to the video of the forum. The comment came up after an audience member asked what the candidates thought about a proposal to make the monetary impact of ballot initiatives clearer to voters. Rasmussen used the question as an opportunity to talk about the stateâ€™s revenue structure.

Hereâ€™s the bulk of what he said: ""Oregon has the 3rd most volatile state revenue of any state in the Union. That's, of course, because we're so reliant on the income tax here in Oregon. And that's the most volatile tax. We have high highs and low lows. And what this does is create with mathematical certainty a funding crisis when the economy's bad. And here we find ourselves again six years or eight years after the last recession in a really bad economy and lo and behold we don't have dollars to go around. This is predictable insanity the way we currently have this structure set up. The challenge is how we fix it. There's several ways to go about it. You look at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable, a lot of folks want to look at a rainy day fund, and I think that makes a lot sense. That would help flatten out the highs and the lows of our revenue structure.""

House Republicans were upfront with the comments leading up to the talk about taxable transactions, but they left out Rasmussenâ€™s more-vocal support for a larger rainy day fund. That little bit goes a long way, we think, because Rasmussen clearly endorses that idea. ""I think that makes a lot sense,"" he says of the rainy day fund. With the bit about transactions, though, he seems to simply be naming one alternative that has popped up over the years: ""You look at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable."" There, his tone appears to be more matter-of-fact. It seems clear to us that he supports the rainy day fund, but he doesnâ€™t offer the same vocal support to a possible sales tax.

PolitiFact Oregon talked to Rasmussen to see if he could explain his remarks. ""We were discussing Oregonâ€™s volatile revenue,"" he said, ""and I was just summarizing the two general proposals that I had heard other people talking about neither of which were policy proposals that I was advocating.""

Upon review of the actual comments, it is clear that while Rasmussen might have mentioned a sales tax (and, yes, we think â€˜""transactions that may be taxable"" is pretty much code for sales tax), he isnâ€™t advocating for one. We rate this claim False.

Ad against Barbara Boxer says hospitals might stop taking Medicare. We find that unlikely.
","

Republicans are using the health care law as a springboard to attack Democrats on Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors. But some ads leave out so many details that they seem intended to simply scare people with threats of lost care.

Such is the case in an ad from Crossroads GPS, a Republican-controlled issues advocacy organization that is not required to disclose its donors. Crossroads GPS released an ad targeting California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who faces Republican challenger Carly Fiorina on Nov. 2, 2010.

""California seniors are worried,"" the ad begins. ""Barbara Boxer voted to cut spending on Medicare benefits by $500 billion, cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether. Boxer's cuts would sharply reduce benefits for some, and could jeopardize access to care for millions of others.""

The ad then advises, ""Check the facts and take action. Call Boxer; stop the Medicare cuts."" So we decided to step in. We're checking the ad's claim that Boxer voted ""to cut spending on Medicare benefits by $500 billion, cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether.""

We've looked into the claim of $500 billion in cuts to Medicare several times. The health care law --- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 -- does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

The health care law tries to change Medicare in a couple of ways. It improves the program for beneficiaries by paying more for prescription drugs and preventive care. It attempts to curb Medicare spending, both to make the program more efficient and to help pay for new programs for the uninsured. (The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation created an easily digestible tutorial on the overall changes to Medicare under health care reform.)

Of the $500 billion in reduced spending going forward, some comes from relatively minor changes, such as $36 billion in savings from increased premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion for administrative streamlining. The law directs a new national board to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. More significantly, there's $136 billion in projected savings from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.

Finally -- and here's where we get to the part about hospitals and nursing homes -- there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient -- for instance, by lowering payments for preventable hospital re-admissions.

These reductions have some people concerned, particularly Richard Forster, the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. Foster has issued several reports warning that the reduced payments will not achieve the cost savings that the law projects. The ad against Boxer throws up the logo of the Washington Post when it runs the words ""could stop taking Medicare altogether"" on the screen. We tracked the quote back to the actuary's November 2009 report. The report says that, over time, health care providers would have a more difficult time finding efficiencies and that some facilities might find it difficult to remain profitable. The actuary repeated that concern after the health care law's final passage in an April 2010 report. The actuary's projections showed that about 15 percent of all providers would become unprofitable during the next decade if the payment reductions stay in place. ""Although this policy could be monitored over time to avoid such an outcome, changes would likely result in smaller actual savings than shown here for these provisions,"" the report concluded.

At this point, let's take a minute to note a few factual conclusions: Yes, Boxer voted for the health care bill, but it didn't cut $500 billion out of the current Medicare program. Instead, it slowed growth over the next 10 years. And not all of that $500 billion applied to hospitals and nursing homes. It was only about $220 billion in prospective reduced payments that concerned the chief actuary. That's what the ad calls ""cuts so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether.""

Opinions differ on whether the reductions in Medicare payments are realistic or impossible to achieve. We won't resolve this policy dispute here. However, it's important to note that even those who think the payment reductions are unrealistic don't necessarily expect hospitals to stop taking Medicare. Instead, they expect the law to cost more than is projected.

""Hospitals are not going to stop taking Medicare. It's too big a part of their revenue,"" said Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s.

""I can say that's not going to actually happen, because someone is going to intervene. And when you intervene, you're not going to have the budget consequences that you originally envisioned,"" she said.

This same issue has played out with payments to doctors, who have been scheduled for payment reductions under Medicare for several years. Congress has delayed those payment reductions repeatedly. The current fix will expire Dec. 1, 2010. Wilensky said this is the critical issue Congress will have to address soon. ""You can't really talk sensibly about fixing Medicare unless you address how you pay physicians,"" Wilensky said. ""We're not really addressing what we have to do to fix Medicare in a key, fundamental way.""

Boxer's campaign, meanwhile, pointed to her votes on fixes for physicians as evidence that she also wouldn't let payment reductions to hospitals and nursing homes affect patient care. Boxer voted for a bill in October 2009 that would have permanently fixed doctor's payments; the bill failed in the Senate.

""Sen. Boxer has consistently voted against dangerously high pay cuts to doctors that provide services to Medicare beneficiaries, because she is concerned that these cuts would limit seniorsâ€™ access to health care,"" said campaign spokesman Matthew Kagan.

In our ruling, it's true that Boxer voted for the health care law, and that law includes reductions in payments for hospitals and nursing homes. But $500 billion includes all the cost reductions for Medicare; the reductions for hospitals and nursing homes are about $220 billion. Finally, those warning about the spending reductions say that it's unlikely Congress will allow them to go forward if they affect patient care. Boxer, meanwhile, has voted for similar types of payment fixes in the past. Because the ad leaves out important facts that undermine most of its claims, we find the statement from Crossroads GPS Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096788300>],/factchecks/2010/oct/04/crossroads-gps/ad-against-boxer-says-hospitals-might-stop-taking-/

Bob Gibbs' Social Security position somersaults from website to public statements to campaign lines
","
On his campaign website, GOP Congressional candidate Bob Gibbs says heâ€™s committed to retaining Social Security benefits for seniors and future retirees.

""We need to ensure that benefits are protected and that taxes and the retirement age are not increased,"" the website says. ""We have a responsibility and a commitment to seniors to fund our obligation to them and not place the system in jeopardy by moving away from the current program to privatization of the system.""

But Gibbs expressed a different view on the Social Security retirement age at a July 12 forum for congressional candidates sponsored by the Eastern Ohio Development Alliance that was videotaped by backers of the congressman he wants to replace, Dover Democrat Zack Space.

An audience member asked whether Gibbs agreed with House GOP Leader John Boehnerâ€™s stance that the Social Security retirement age should be raised to 70. Instead of citing his websiteâ€™s position, Gibbs applauded Boehnerâ€™s leadership and said the nation needs to seriously discuss how to make entitlement programs actuarially sound.

""Our younger folks in their 20s and 30s, they think their retirement age is going to move up, I think they expect that,"" said Gibbs. ""Weâ€™re living longer, our life expectancies are going up, and you just canâ€™t have an actuarially sound system if you donâ€™t make these changes or youâ€™re not going to have a system at all.""

That struck us as a complete reversal of his previous position -- Â a Full Flop.

Then at a Sept. 18 debate in Mount Vernon between Gibbs and Constitution Party candidate Lindsay Sutton, Gibbs suggested forming a bipartisan task force to ensure Social Securityâ€™s viability, and went on to say: ""I doubt I would have supported it back in the 1930â€™s when they did it, but we have it now and weâ€™ve got to fulfill our obligations.""

The remark that he might have opposed creation of Social Security prompted the Space campaign to denounce Gibbs. ""Bob Gibbsâ€™ complete hostility toward this crucial program is just plain shameless,"" Space spokesman Andrew Ricci said in a news release.

We asked for Gibbsâ€™ true stance on Social Security in light of his public comments. His spokeswoman, Emily Pettigrew, replied with this email:

""You can pull a clip here and a clip there and make it sound like anything, the fact is that Bob Gibbs stands firm that we should not raise the retirement age, we should not cut benefits, and we should not privatize Social Security.""

Pettigrew said efforts to highlight Gibbsâ€™ remarks were just a ""distraction tactic"" ""straight from Nancy Pelosiâ€™s playbook of desperation."" She accused Space of ""trying to take the focus off of the double-digit unemployment in the district"" under his watch.

But Gibbsâ€™ own words provide ample fodder for distraction.
Â  

Ultimately, we end up back where we started. But given the gyrations taken with Gibbsâ€™ public statements on Social Security, followed up by his campaign comment, he has earned high marks as a Flip-O-Meter gymnast. We award him a Full Flop.

Patriot Majority PAC conjures up Chilean dictator in attack on Sharron Angle
","
It isn't often that U.S. campaigns venture into Latin American retirement policy, but the knock-down, drag-out battle for a Nevada Senate seat has done just that.

It came up in an ad run by the Patriot Majority PAC, an obscure Washington-based group that appears to be spending big money on campaign advertising this year, primarily against Sharron Angle, the Republican who's challenging Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev.

The ad seizes on a comment made by Angle about Social Security privatization during an Aug. 12, 2010, interview with KLAS-TV. Here's the narration:

""How does Sharron Angle plan to phase out Social Security? (Video of Angle saying, ""Chile has done this."") Chile? The country once led by Augusto Pinochet, the military dictator and human rights violator? Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage. (Angle: ""Chile has done this."") Privatize? Phase out? Pinochet? (Angle: ""Chile has done this."") Another day, and another bad idea from Sharron Angle. What's next?""

We were somewhat caught off guard by the ad sponsor's effort to use Angle's pension-policy positions to link her to a ""military dictator and human rights violator,"" complete with footage of goose-stepping Chilean soldiers on parade. But that connection, tenuous though it may be, didn't strike us as checkable in our conventional sense. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad fairly describes the nuts and bolts of Chilean retirement security. Is the ad justified in saying that ""Chile's privatization scheme has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits and millions of people with no coverage""?

For many years, the Chilean system has been an inspiration to free-market advocates in the U.S. and elsewhere, so it's not surprising that Angle would have cited it. Here's some background on the system.

Chile created its first Social Security-style programs in the 1920s, a decade or so before the United States did. But the government under Pinochet made a big change in 1981, transitioning all new workers -- as well as beneficiaries of the old, defined-benefit system who were willing to make the switch -- to a pension plan based on individual accounts run by private-sector investment managers. By now, almost all Chileans are enrolled in the post-1981 system.

The program details have changed somewhat over the years, most recently due to a major round of changes in 2008. But the general outline has remained the same. Ten percent of workers' income is automatically deducted to fund their retirement, disability and survivor insurance, plus an additional charge for administrative costs. Employees can choose from among several government-approved private pension management companies, each of which offers five varieties of funds with varying degrees of risk. The funds and their approaches have been reviewed by a government regulator. Total assets in the system by the end of 2009 reached $107 billion in U.S dollars, or about 65 percent of Chileâ€™s gross domestic product.

Because the Chilean system has been a trendsetter, it has been studied extensively. Independent analyses suggest that over the long term, the level of support for retirees under Chile's system has been close or better than that in similar countries. But the Chilean system has also faced its share of criticism. Some of that criticism echoes what the ad says. Here's a closer look at the three issues raised in the ad.

â€¢ Hidden fees. High fees have been a longstanding concern about the Chilean system. Due to lack of competition among private-sector money managers that participate in the system, these management companies' profits have been much larger than profit margins in other sectors of Chileâ€™s financial services industry, wrote U.S. Social Security Administration researcher Barbara E. Kritzer in one paper. Over a full career contributing to the system, workers pay around 15 percent for administration, according to the International Organization of Pension Supervisors. This is in the middle of six Latin American countries and below five Eastern European countries with a Chilean-style individual accounts system. Several experts said that a series of government reforms in 2008 helped lower fees.

In our reporting, we found that even supporters of the system acknowledged that fees have been a problem. But are they ""hidden,"" as the ad says? None of the handful of experts we spoke to said so. In fact, fees are more obvious to contributors in Chile than in other countries because they are levied on top of the mandatory contribution to private pensions. So while the ad is on track in its criticism of fees, it is wrong to say they are hidden.

â€¢ Fewer benefits. Most studies have shown a long-term rate of return in the Chilean system of roughly 10 percent, which is high by international standards. But even if those rates of return are optimistic going forward -- whether because they were boosted by a period of unusually strong returns or because of insufficient participation by Chilean workers in the plan -- experts we spoke to agreed that for Chileans, the current system is preferable to the pre-1981 system. In fact, Pinochet's system remained in place after the transition to democracy and was retained by the socialist administration of Michelle Bachelet. (Bachelet lost power in March 2010.)

Mauricio Soto of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has written that the old pension system was ""in crisis"" prior to 1981 -- paying more in benefits than it was receiving in contributions, with a projected actuarial imbalance greater than the country's gross domestic product. In addition, the patchwork system was ""poorly administered and inefficient"" and led to discrepancies in which ""white-collar workers could comfortably retire in their 40s, while blue-collar workers had to wait until their 60s to qualify for minimum retirement benefits.""

There's no question that the current investor-based pension system carries risks, being subject to markets that can go up or down. But Chile's old system simply wasn't sustainable. ""It was unfunded and essentially a fantasy,"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime champion of the Chilean system.

So to suggest, as the ad does, that switching to a private system in 1981 resulted in ""fewer benefits"" is at best misleading.

â€¢ Millions of people with no coverage. This charge is true -- but misleading for a couple reasons.

Though the proportion of Chileans participating in the system has varied over time, the percentage has hovered around two-thirds, a rate similar to under the pre-1981 system. This is clearly less than the nearly universal coverage provided by the U.S. Social Security system. But Chile is also not nearly as rich as the U.S.

Several experts we spoke to agreed that the coverage gaps have at least as much to do with the nature of the Chilean economy as with the design of the country's retirement system. Soto notes that low-income Chileans working in the underground economy account for about 30 percent of the workforce. These workers are typically not covered by the pension system unless they have previously worked in a legitimate business. Meanwhile, participation by the self-employed was for many years voluntary (and very low), though mandatory participation is being phased in by the 2008 reforms. Even among workers in traditional jobs, participation rates have usually topped out around 80 percent, with the percentage taking part at any given time even lower, since workers do not always keep up their contributions due to unemployment or a failure to comply with the law.

This is a serious issue. As Kritzer notes, ""only a small portion"" of workers with less-than-perfect participation histories ""would have enough contributions to qualify for the guaranteed minimum benefit at retirement."" The 2008 reform addressed coverage concerns by introducing a universal pension paid to all Chileans over the age of 65 regardless of their contribution history. In addition, workers with small pensions from their individual accounts will have them topped up by the government.Â 

While we think it's fair for the ad to note that the Chilean system has holes, it's important to note that the pre-1981 system had holes too -- and that the nature of the Chilean economy plays at least as big a role in causing this problem as the retirement system itself.

So where does this leave us? The ad demonizes the Chilean system in ways that we think are exaggerated. Fees are a problem, but they are not hidden. Rather than offering smaller benefits, the system has provided strong returns and is almost certainly sounder today than prior to 1981. And the coverage gaps that exist now are not unique to the privatized system and have a lot to do with specific factors at play in Chile.

The ad does have a point that the Chilean system, at least if it's implemented without major differences, would likely be seen by most Americans as inferior to Social Security. The size of the coverage gaps in Chile's system, while understandable given Chile's economic situation, would be unacceptable to many, if not most, Americans. But this reasonable point is undercut by the ad's overheated rhetoric (""human rights violator""), imagery (the goose-stepping soldiers) and exaggerations about the substance of the Chilean plan. On balance, we rate the ad Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2A0280>],/factchecks/2010/oct/04/patriot-majority-pac/patriot-majority-pac-conjures-chilean-dictator-att/

Police union attacks Rick Scott's budget plan, saying it closes prisons and releases prisoners early
","
The state's two big police unions are backing Democrat Alex Sink for governor. Now one of them is bringing out its big guns to attack Sink's opponent, Republican Rick Scott.

The Florida Police Benevolent Association debuted a new television ad Sept. 27, 2010, that claims that Scott's plan to cut state budgets will result in fewer prisons and the early release of tens of thousands of violent criminals.

The ad shows a Rick Scott look-alike (wearing a T-shirt that says ""Rick Scott"") waiting at the prison gate happily greeting a gaggle of departing inmates dressed in classic black-and-white striped prison uniforms.

""Rick Scott's prison plan would cut Florida's prison budget in half, close prisons, and release tens of thousands of prisoners early -- murderers, rapists, sex offenders, armed robbers, drug dealers,"" a baritoned narrator says over a series of haunting, low minor chords.

The ad closes with the same group of inmates, led by a tattooed man with a chain, mocking Scott's famous slogan.

""Let's get to work,"" the inmate says directly into the camera.

""Yeah,"" the inmates reply, smiling.

The ad is powerful in its prose, and its visuals get the attention of viewers. But do the facts support the PBA's rhetoric?

The basis of the group's claim is rooted in Scott's 7-7-7 economic plan, something we've dealt with before. The bottom line: Scott says the 7-step plan will create 700,000 new private sector jobs in 7 years. Actually, if you read the plan it says it will only create about 660,000 new jobs, PolitiFact Florida found. But why let math get in the way of a catchy slogan?

Anyway, Scott has released what we consider an executive summary of the plan -- meaning it has some high-level ideas but little in the way of how Scott would accomplish them or how they'd create jobs, per se. Step 2 of the 7-step plan is to reduce government spending. Included in that section is Scott's discussion of the state Department of Corrections. Here's what he says: ""Paying competitive market-based salaries for corrections' staff, utilizing inmate labor to grow prison food, and competitively bidding health care contracts, prisoner costs would be reduced by $1 billion.""

Even the thought of cutting $1 billion out of the state Department of Corrections budget, in part by cutting salaries, has raised plenty of objections. In an article published by the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald -- and the source for the PBA ad -- former Corrections Secretary James McDonough, who served for two years under Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, called Scott's plan a ""shell game.""

The Florida Department of Corrections is the nation's third-largest prison system, with more than 100,000 inmates in 139 facilities. Scott's proposed cut represents more than 40 percent of the agency's $2.4 billion budget.

This is probably the point in the fact check where the two sides -- Scott and the PBA -- would stop agreeing. So let's break it down using each point of view.

What Scott says

Scott's plan to cut prison costs has three planks -- pay competitive salaries for staff (read, pay them less), have inmates grow their own food and competitively bid health care contracts.

There is no mention of closing prisons or releasing violent criminals early to make the numbers work.

Joe Kildea, a Scott spokesman, said that's because that isn't part of the plan. At all. ""Nowhere in Rick's plan does he discuss closing prisons. Rick Scott's budget 'plan' is to take every program and service through accountability budgeting; a cost benefit analysis to determine if tax dollars are being spent most effectively. As part of that process, we will look at what other states are doing well. There are other states that have lower prison budget costs than Florida, because they have some less expensive facilities and have lower recidivism rates. One billion dollars represents the gap between Florida's and Texas' costs, and is an example of where the accountability budgeting process will begin, but is not a final budget plan.""

What the PBA says

The PBA counters that it's impossible for Scott to cut the budget that much without closing prisons and releasing inmates.

They point to a quote from prison system spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger, who after digesting Scott's plan told the Times: ""You would have to close prisons."" (That's what she said).

PBA executive director David Murrell noted that in 2010, Department of Corrections Secretary Walt McNeil talked about having to close five state prisons and release 2,519 prisoners early when the Senate was debating shedding $100 million from the DOC budget.

State law requires prisoners who committed crimes on or after Oct. 1, 1995, to serve 85 percent of their sentence before being released, but that might need to be waived to comply with a court order related to prison overcrowding, McNeil said.

""Multiply a $100 million cut by 10 ($1 billion) and you have tens of thousands of inmates released to overcrowding,"" Murrell said.

Scott also promises voters in his 7-7-7 plan that he will cut the state workforce 5 percent. One in four state employees works in corrections.

What Scott says

We fired off a series of questions to Kildea, hoping to clarify Scott's position. Here's the result of that exchange.

Would Scott rule out closing prisons? Because the number of state prisoners is on the rise in Florida, it seems extremely unlikely that there would be a need to close prisons. (Florida's prison population has grown from about 62,000 in 1995 to 85,000 in 2005 to more than 100,000 today). 
Would Scott release prisoners early to make his budget figures work?Â  No. And he never indicated he would.

Does Scott even have the authority to release prisoners early? No. But that's irrelevant because he wouldn't anyway.

What the PBA says 

Saying you can cut $1 billion from the budget without closing prisons ignores reality, Murrell says.

""If Scott says that prisons will not have to be closed and dangerous inmates won't be released on his extreme budget cut idea, I would submit that he is engaging in the same sort of creative accounting which enabled him and his company to steal billions from American taxpayers in Medicare and Medicaid fraud,"" he said (we rated claims about Scott's time at Columbia/HCA here and here and here and here).

Time for us to jump in

First things first, the PBA says ""Rick Scott's prison plan would cut Florida's prison budget in half, close prisons, and release tens of thousands of prisoners early."" His plan doesn't call for that. It calls for cutting $1 billion from the Department of Corrections budget, but not by closing prisons and releasing inmates.

That's immediately misleading in the PBA ad.

When we asked whether Scott wants to, plans on, or will agree to release inmates early, the answer was no.

But the PBA argues there is no other way to cut $1 billion from the department's $2.4 billion budget. And maybe, they have a point.

PolitiFact Florida looked at the numbers. 
One of the ways Scott says he'll save $1 billion is by paying corrections employees competitively. Currently, the agency spends more than $1.5 billion on salaries and benefits for its nearly 27,700 employees. If Scott cut the compensation package for each and every employee 10 percent, the state would save $151 million in total, using DOC budget figures. That's less than one-fifth of the way to $1 billion. And that's using the example of a hefty 10 percent pay cut. 
Another way Scott wants to save money is by having inmates grow their own food. But having inmates in charge of their own meals may only provide minor cost savings. The agency fired two private food service vendors two years ago and now cooks all prison meals in house to save money. The daily food cost per inmate in August 2010 was $2.30. 
The Department of Corrections also already grows its own food. Inmates harvested over 4.7 million pounds of produce last year, including broccoli, cabbage, cantaloupe, and watermelon. The crops supplement inmate meals, but cannot sustain inmates because of unpredictable weather and the large inmate population, officials said.

The agency is also already competitively bidding some of its health care contracts, which is the third part of Scott's plan to reduce costs. Contracts for lab services, X-rays and pharmaceuticals are competitively bid, said DOC spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger. Contracts for physicians and hospitals are negotiated on a percentage of Medicare.

The agency spent a total of $413 million in health care costs, including for employees, last year.

According to the DOC, it costs an average $52.00 a day or $18,980 per year to house an inmate in a Florida prison. The Department of Justice, in 2006, said Florida's cost per prisoner was $71.93 -- Scott relies on that number, not the state produced figure.

In its ad, the Florida Police Benevolent Association says ""Rick Scott's prison plan would cut Florida's prison budget in half, close prisons, and release tens of thousands of prisoners early."" That's a prediction more than anything, though it doesn't come across that way in the 30-second commercial.

Scott's plan is to cut the prison budget by 40 percent, but not by closing prisons or releasing prisoners early. The Scott campaign maintains they can reach their targeted spending levels without closing prisons or releasing prisoners early, and has taken the option of releasing inmates off the table.

The PBA is editorializing, in essence, what would happen if Scott is elected and has a say over the Department of Corrections budget. At PolitiFact Florida, we shy away from trying predictions, so we're specifically not ruling on what would happen if the state cuts $1 billion out of its prison budget.

But we can say the PBA is about right on the size of the budget cuts being suggested by Scott, and wrong that's Scott's plan is to close prisons and release inmates.

Challenger Scott Hassett says Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen knew about district attorney sexting case but did nothing about it
","
Prosecutor Ken Kratz has been battered by a storm of denunciation since revelations in September 2010 that he used his position -- and sexually suggestive text messages -- to pursue a crime victim and possibly two other women who relied on him to do right by them in court. Â 

Among those castigating the Calumet County district attorney is Scott Hassett, the Democrat candidate for state attorney general.

But Hassettâ€™s thunder has also pounded another prosecutor, Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, his Republican opponent in the Nov. 2 election. It was Van Hollenâ€™s Department of Justice that in October 2009 conducted a criminal investigation of Kratzâ€™s most recent ""sexting.""

Hassett was blunt in a Sept. 21 e-mail to his supporters, declaring:

""Van Hollen knew about this case for nearly a year and did nothing about it.""

Hassett has since been more measured, saying Van Hollen did nothing ""substantive."" When we asked him to back up his claims, Hassett said Van Hollen should have taken a number of steps, including: 
Much has happened publicly in recent weeks, so itâ€™s important to keep in mind what was known at the time. Letâ€™s look at Hassettâ€™s accusation in light of how the case unfolded and the role of Van Hollenâ€™s office in it:

Criminal investigation

The Department of Justiceâ€™s involvement was limited to the racy texts sent to Stephanie Van Groll in October 2009 by Kratz, then the chair of the state Crime Victims Rights Board. Kratz had gained attention in 2007 for successfully prosecuting junkyard worker Steven Avery for the murder of a young photographer.

Reports about texts to the other two women and a separate woman who says Kratz invited her to an autopsy didnâ€™t surface until after the Associated Press revealed the Van Groll texts on Sept. 15, 2010.

Kratz, 50, had met Van Groll, 26, while prosecuting a domestic violence case against her former boyfriend. In one text, he wrote: ""You may be the tall, young, hot nymph, but I am the prize.""

On Oct. 22, 2009, the third day of receiving such text messages, Van Groll reported them to Kaukauna police. Van Groll said Kratz was harassing her and she feared that his interest in her could affect how Kratz prosecuted her former boyfriend, who was accused of strangling her.

Van Groll went to police in Kaukauna, in Outagamie County, because she lived there at the time. Kaukauna police turned their investigation over to the state Division of Criminal Investigation because the Police Department often works with the Calumet County district attorney's office.

The Justice Department opened its investigation on Oct. 27, 2009. It closed the probe several days later, without questioning Kratz.

Van Hollen told PolitiFact Wisconsin ""there werenâ€™t any facts that indicated any crimes were committed."" Van Hollen, who described himself as being ""very involved"" in the case, said he didnâ€™t question the decision by investigators who determined it was not necessary to interview Kratz. He noted the department took the step of replacing Kratz in the domestic violence case involving Van Groll with one of its own prosecutors.

Office of Lawyer Regulation

Even though Van Hollenâ€™s agency decided not to file criminal charges, Van Hollen and other department attorneys may have had an obligation to report Kratz to the state Office of Lawyer Regulation.

Wisconsin Supreme Court rules require a lawyer to make such a report if he or she knows another lawyer has committed professional misconduct. The misconduct must raise ""a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer.""

Two days after the Kratz scandal broke in the news, the Wisconsin District Attorneys Associationâ€™s executive committee -- which includes a Department of Justice official -- called on Kratz to resign his district attorney post. The committee judged his behavior with Van Groll as repugnant and ""inconsistent with the standards of our profession.""

That would seem to qualify as professional misconduct that the Department of Justice should have reported to the Office of Lawyer Regulation as it was reviewing the case for possible charges.

Van Hollenâ€™s office did not to report Kratz to the regulatory office -- but it did pressure him into reporting himself.

On Nov. 12, 2009, less than two weeks after the criminal investigation was closed, Department of Justice attorney Kevin Potter told Kratz in an e-mail ""we believe the matter needs to be reported to OLR. Again, we would be willing to discuss with you what we see as being your options and what we believe to be the best course of conduct for you to follow.""

Three weeks after that, on Dec. 4, 2009, Kratz reported his texts to Van Groll to the Office of Lawyer Regulation.

It could be argued that a complaint filed the Department of Justice would carry significant weight with OLR. But Van Hollen said his office believed that cases that are self-reported were more likely to result in disciplinary action.

The Department of Justice also pressured Kratz in an e-mail to resign from the state Crime Victims Rights Board, which investigates complaints of public agencies or officials accused of violating the rights of crime victims. About a month later, on Dec. 3, 2009, Kratz stepped down.

Ultimately, the Office of Lawyer Regulation did an initial review and told Van Groll on March 5, 2010, it would not conduct a formal investigation of Kratz. The letter said his texting, while inappropriate, ""did not appear to involve possible professional misconduct."" Since the news surfaced about the other women surfaced, however, OLR said it would open an investigation of Kratz.

Gov. Jim Doyle

After the news broke about Kratzâ€™s texts to Van Groll and the woman who said he invited her to an autopsy, Doyle used a state law that allows a governor to remove a district attorney from office to launch a process for deciding whether Kratz should be removed. The law allows the governor to oust a DA ""for cause,"" which is defined as ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, official misconduct, or malfeasance in office.""

Van Hollen said it wasnâ€™t necessary to inform Doyle because the Office of Lawyer Regulationâ€™s purpose is to investigate lawyer misconduct. He pointed out that while Doyle could remove Kratz as district attorney, OLR action could potentially result in Kratz being barred from practicing law altogether. Â 

OK. Weâ€™re ready to make a closing argument.

In his bid for attorney general, Democrat Scott Hassett accused Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen of doing nothing for nearly a year after his office learned that Calumet County District Attorney Ken Kratz had sent sexually suggestive text messages to a crime victim.

Van Hollenâ€™s office reviewed the case for possible criminal charges, but found no grounds for any. Van Hollen could have reported Kratz directly to the Office of Lawyer Regulation, but his office instead pressured Kratz himself to do so, feeling that would make the case even stronger. Â They also pressured him to resign from the Crime Victims Rights Board. They could have reported the text matter to Gov. Jim Doyle, but Van Hollen felt the review panel was in the best position to determine if Kratz committed professional misconduct.

Hassett argues Van Hollen could have done more. But his statement was that Van Hollen did nothing. Our verdict: Hassettâ€™s statement is False.

Kurt Schrader says Scott Bruun wants to cut the Department of Commerce and eliminate NOAA
","

When the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration affirmed Newport as the location of its new Pacific Marine Operations Center earlier this year, it was a rare bit of good news in an otherwise dim year for Oregon, economically speaking. The center will bring hundreds of jobs to the area.

Itâ€™s little wonder, then, that Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., has been telling constituents lately just how hard he lobbied for the move.

But last week, in an interview that aired on Newport-based radio station KCUP, Schrader went a step further. He took his Republican challenger Scott Bruun to task, saying Bruun was poised to undermine the whole deal.

""(I was) very concerned at the forum the other day when he said he wanted to cut the Department of Commerce and, you know, NOAA would be, of course, a big part of that,"" he said, referring to a debate held at the Salem City Club on Sept. 10, 2010. ""I just think that's very, very scary for residents on the coast when everybody in the community and our office, in particular, fought so hard to make sure that the NOAA fleet is going to come to Oregon. And I think that's a very, very bad statement for a candidate in the 5th District to say when we're working so hard to make sure this comes to fruition. Cutting the Department of Commerce and eliminating NOAA is not going to be a good message to those guys.""

Schraderâ€™s right: That wouldnâ€™t be a good message to send to the 5th District, which includes Newport. But did Bruun really say he wanted to eliminate NOAA?

PolitiFact Oregon went back and listened to the exchange at the Salem City Club. The Department of Commerce cropped up after an audience member asked the following question: ""I would like to ask the candidates what specific expenditure of the federal government they would like to discontinue.""

Hereâ€™s what Bruun replied: ""We have to look at some of the agencies that are out there right now -- I'll name a few, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of Housing and Urban Development -- to see whether or not what they're doing is valid, it's meeting its purposes and even if it is valid, is it better putting it in local governments. Is it better putting it in county government or state government, pushing some of it out into the states?""

(If you want to listen for yourself, this all starts around the 35-minute mark.)

We followed up with Schraderâ€™s campaign to see whether it had any additional evidence to support the congressmanâ€™s claim that Bruun had it out for NOAA. James Atkins, a spokesman for the campaign, pointed to a 1996 article in The Oregonian from the last time Bruun ran for national office. Back then, Bruun said he would vote to eliminate the same three departments he brought up in the most recent debate.

Of course, we know how much can change in 24 hours when it comes to politics, let alone 14 years, so PolitiFact Oregon brought the article up with the Bruun campaign. Spokeswoman Alee Lockman said Bruun no longer supports eliminating those departments, but he stands behind his statement that the departments need to be reviewed for possible savings.

What Lockman says tracks with what Bruun told KCUP in his own interview on the radio station on Sept. 16, 2010. Â ""I did name some big agencies that are big and encompassing and we do need to look at doing things better in those agencies. The Department of Commerce is one of those agencies,"" he said. Bruun also said he wholly supports NOAA coming to Newport and would fight, if ever necessary, to keep the agency there.

So far as we can tell, there are basically two pieces to Schraderâ€™s initial claim: 1) Bruun advocates possible cuts to the Department of Commerce and 2) Bruun advocates eliminating NOAA. Itâ€™s clear enough that the first bit is true, but even though NOAA is a part of that department, there is scant evidence that Bruun wants to do away with the agency entirely.

Weâ€™ll split the difference here and call this claim Half True.

Mark Hinkle, chairman of Libertarian Party, says exit polls show Democrats draw support from more than 70 percent of gay voters in federal elections
","
Urging gay voters to give his party's candidates consideration, the chairman of the nation's Libertarian Party says that like battered spouses who repeatedly return to their aggressors, gay voters keep handing their votes to Democrats who abuse them. 
In a Sept. 23 press release, Chairman Mark Hinkle also says: ""Exit polls indicate that Democrats get over 70 percent of"" lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) ""votes in federal elections. Those voters must really love the Democrats' rhetoric, because they certainly aren't seeing action."" Hinkle goes on to note that both the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and a federal act defining marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman remain in place despite Democrats holding majorities in Congress. 
Gays tilt Democratic more than 70 percent of the time in U.S. elections? We sought more information. 
Wes Benedict, a Texan serving as the national party's executive director, responded with a Web link to a Nov. 26, 2008 article on exit polling of gay voters in the 2008 elections posted by the Williams Institute, a think tank at the University of California at Los Angeles that describes itself as advancing ""sexual orientation law and public policy through rigorous, independent research and scholarship."" 
The article, published in Bay Windows, which calls itself New England's largest GLBT newspaper, says gay voters leaned heavily to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama that November. The article says a review of more than 80,000 votes cast in 56 heavily gay precincts over 11 cities in five states and the District of Columbia found 79 percent of the voters casting ballots for Obama, 19 percent for Republican John McCain and 1.5 percent for other candidates. Separately, the article says, exit polling conducted on behalf of five TV networks and the Associated Press shows that among voters who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, 70 percent voted for Obama, 27 percent for McCain and 3 percent for others--results we confirmed from a 2008 online post by CNN that also suggests 53 percent of non-gay voters favored Obama, 45 percent McCain. 
The article says that in 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry drew 77 percent of the LGB vote (a result we confirmed on CNN.com) and in 2000 Democrat Al Gore carried 70 percent of the LGB vote and in 1996 Bill Clinton, the Democratic president, carried 71 percent of the LGB vote. 
Next, we reached Patrick Egan, a New York University assistant professor of politics and public policy who has studied gay voting patterns. Egan said in an e-mail that gay voters ""lean Democratic in federal elections largely because the Democratic Party has taken more pro-gay stances on a variety of gay rights issues."" He said another reason gay voters tend to be pro-Democratic is that ""gay people are more likely than the general population to be raised in liberal families. If we assume that the trait of homosexuality is more or less randomly distributed throughout the population, this means that gay people are more likely to come out,"" or declare their sexual orientation, ""in families that are more tolerant. This tolerance affects gay people's views on everything, including party affiliation."" 
Egan said he couldn't speak directly to the Libertarian Party's appeal to gay voters, but he would quibble with anyone blaming Democrats for stalled gay-favored legislation. ""The blame for why few advances for gay rights have been achieved in this Congress has to be laid squarely on the Republican Party, not the Democrats,"" Egan writes. ""Republicans have voted en masse against every proposed change in favor of gay rights, and in most cases have blocked movement on this legislation. (One way to think about this: if every Democratic member of Congress had instead been a Libertarian in this session, we still would have had the same standstill outcome.)"" 
Perhaps, but we're not testing which party would best advance an agenda in this article. We rate the Libertarian Party's 70-percent-plus statement as True. 
This article has been updated to correct the year that Sen. John Kerry was the presidential nominee. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B42440>],/factchecks/2010/oct/04/mark-hinkle/mark-hinkle-chairman-libertarian-party-says-exit-p/

Gingrey says GM deal sign of federal overreach
","
Congressman Phil Gingrey was recently on CNN arguing in favor of repealing the federal health care legislation passed earlier this year when he steered the conversation to another area of what he considered government overreach.

The Marietta Republican used the federal government's bailout of General Motors as an example of Uncle Sam being too involved in the private sector.

""We're concerned with a powerful government who is telling General Motors now, maybe, what they can charge for their automobiles,"" said Gingrey, a physician. ""Indeed, if the government owns 61 percent, they can do that.""

Does the federal government have that type of influence?

""It's false,"" GM spokesman Greg Martin said.

So who's right here?

Let's begin with some background about the federal government's role in the automaker's management. In December 2008, during the final days of the presidency of George W. Bush, the government approved a $17.4 billion loan to GM and Chrysler to keep the companies running. GM received $13.4 billion, but a few months later, the company said it needed more money. GM produced a survival plan that included cutting 47,000 jobs worldwide and closing five U.S. factories. In June 2009, President Barack Obama approved a bankruptcy deal that gave GM $30 billion. In exchange, the government took a 60 percent controlling stake in the company. As of late September, GM had repaid $6.7 billion. The remaining money was converted to a 61 percent ownership stake in GM plus $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock, The Associated Press reported.

AJC PolitiFact Georgia looked at several contracts between the federal government and GM, and we didn't see any specific language that suggested Uncle Sam would have any influence over pricing.

We spoke with Gingrey's office and discussed our review of the contracts. The congressman's spokeswoman, Meredith Griffanti, said the federal government's stake in GM gives it the power to have some say on pricing.

""GM repaid the government $6.7 billion,"" Griffanti said in a statement. ""The remaining money was converted to a 61 percent ownership stake in GM plus $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock. Based on that, the government does in fact have a 61 percent stake in GM. Clearly that number makes the federal government the majority stakeholder, which undoubtedly allows 'big government' enormous influence over the direction of the company.""Â 

A Treasury Department spokesman forwarded us testimony in December from Assistant Secretary Herbert Allison, who said government involvement in the day-to-day management of GM is not its goal.

""Government involvement in the day-to-day management of a company might actually reduce the value of these investments, impede the ability of the companies to return fully to being privately owned,"" Allison said.

Obama has said ""the United States government has no interest in running GM.""

Most members of the 12-member GM board of directors have been appointed since the bankruptcy agreement. The board includes former Coca-Cola Chairman E. Neville Isdell and University System of Georgia Chancellor Errol Davis Jr. Records show the board has control over executive compensation and has a public policy committee. Martin, the GM spokesman, said that committee looks at regulatory issues concerning energy, the environment, trade and taxes. It also reviews GM's philanthropic activities. The board, Martin said, does not deal with day-to-day activities and pricing.

David Zaring, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, said ""it's possible"" for the federal government to have some influence over policy matters such as automobile pricing through its board appointments. However, Zaring said he has watched closely to see whether that has happened and, so far, it hasn't.

""It's easy to overstate how overinterventionist the government is being,"" Zaring said.

There's no written language in the GM contract with the federal government that states Uncle Sam has any control over vehicle pricing. The board has not gotten involved in such matters, according to GM and others who have paid attention.

Democratic governor candidate Tom Barrett says the headlines tell the story when it comes to opponent Scott Walker
","
It may be a politicianâ€™s dream to determine the headlines that go on the front page of the morning newspaper.

In a new attack ad, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tom Barrett makes it a reality, using purported replicas of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel to slam rival Republican Scott Walker for ""mismanagement"" of Milwaukee County.

The 30-second TV spot offers a trifecta of complaints: wasted money, exploding debt and shoddy oversight of county operations. The ad aims to undercut a main Walker selling point -- his fiscal management as Milwaukee County executive.

In the ad, the narrator declares ""the headlines ... tell the story.""

But do they?

Instead of using shots of actual newspapers, Barrettâ€™s ad creates a computer-generated version of the Journal Sentinelâ€™s front page and places various headlines at the top of the page -- regardless of where the stories actually appeared. There are a host of other tricks involved: Headlines and allegations are mismatched for effect and photos of Walker are added to amplify his role and responsibility in each item.

In response, Walker has issued a statement saying he is ""exploring legal action"" based on the ad. The Journal Sentinel has complained to the Barrett campaign about the false and misleading headlines associated with its trademark, said Editor Martin Kaiser.

In some cases, the Barrett claim made through the narrator may be correct, or partly so. But in this item we are evaluating the manner in which they are presented and whether the overall message -- that the headlines support the claims -- is accurate.

The ad opens with a cut from a Walker TV ad. In it, Walker says: ""It seems like every time I pick up a newspaper thereâ€™s another headline about our tax dollars being wasted.""

The first claim comes when the narrator steps in, saying: ""No kidding, Scott Walker. You mismanaged Milwaukee County so badly, spending went up $400 million."" As this is spoken, an image of a newspaper with the headline ""Millions down the drain"" Â appears on the screen.

The headline is from a story that appeared on JSOnline.com on Feb. 14, 2009, and in the Journal Sentinel the next day, concerning fraud in the $340 million Wisconsin Shares program, the stateâ€™s child-care subsidy program.

But Walker was not mentioned or pictured in the story.

At the time, the county did run some aspects of the state program. But the story was about overpayments to child-care providers. Those payments are made by the state from federal funds, not from the county budget, according to County Auditor Jerome Heer and Lisa Jo Marks, former interim head of the countyâ€™s Health and Human Services Department.

Under Walker, county spending has gone up more than $390 million, which approaches the $400 million cited in the ad. But as we noted when we reviewed a claim in an earlier Barrett ad about rising county spending, the bulk of the increase was due to the county taking in more state and federal dollars -- not due to budget increases by Walker. In fact, Democrats have complained for years that Walker has cut the budget too much.

In any case, the presentation leaves the viewer with the impression the $400 million is what has ""gone down the drain."" The story did not say that.

And the ad does not support that.

In the second claim, the narrator declares: ""County debt has skyrocketed 85 percent."" As the allegation is made, viewers see a headline that reads: ""Milwaukee County deficit projected at $6 million this year.""

The headline appeared on a story posted on JSOnline on May 20, 2010, but the date shown in the Barrett ad on the mock Journal Sentinel is June 22, 2010. The story appeared on page 3B, not the front page. Again, Walkerâ€™s picture is added, when it did not appear in print or online.

In this case, Walker was part of the story, which looked at the projection at the time of how much of a deficit the county was facing in the 2010 budget. Walker and county supervisors are aiming to address that one-time deficit by making cuts to assure the budget finishes in the black.

In any case, the annual deficit is much different than the debt, a measure of long-term obligations of the county. On this point, county debt has risen 85 percent under Walker, according to Cynthia Archer, the countyâ€™s director of administrative services.

The major reason for the increase is that, in March 2009, the county issued $400 million in pension obligation bonds that are to be repaid over 25 years. While the bonds are a new debt, Â the obligation isnâ€™t new -- the county already was on the hook to pay the future benefits.

Whatâ€™s more, the county didnâ€™t simply borrow the money. The county took the $400 million and invested it as part of an effort to shore up the pension fund. The county ultimately could end up paying more, but in the first year the return on the investment was high enough that the county paid $8.5 million less in pension benefits than it would have without the approach.

(We also covered pension-related claims in a review of another Barrett ad).

Like the first claim, the headline does not support -- or even relate to -- the spoken claim.

In the third claim, the narrator says: ""And the state had to take over your welfare program thanks to all the money you wasted."" The headline shown: ""State takes over countyâ€™s public assistance program.""

Although Walkerâ€™s picture was not included with the story, the ad shows a jubilant Walker in front of an American flag.

The headline is taken from an online version of a Journal Sentinel story that was posted Feb. 3, 2009. The story told about the state stripping Milwaukee County of its role in administering food aid, child care and medical assistance programs.

The state said the move was prompted by years of county mismanagement. Walker contended that state underfunding over the years was a big contributor to the problems.

Of the three claims, the link between the headline and the narration is closest to being on the mark -- though it presents a distorted view of how it appeared in print.

""Walkerâ€™s right,"" the narrator concludes, ""the headlines do tell the story. Scott Walker ... Canâ€™t trust him with our money, canâ€™t trust him to tell the truth.""

Phil Walzak, Barrett campaign spokesman, defended the ad's assertions of mismanagement and the specific claims. For instance, he said the ""millions down the drain"" story was relevant to Walker's record because the county was responsible for preventing fraud in the child-care program.

Walzak said he couldnâ€™t comment on the use of Journal Sentinel headlines because of legal issues.

The ad, he said, is airing in ""multiple markets,"" but not in the Milwaukee area at this time. The fact that the ad has not been posted with other ads on Barrettâ€™s campaign website ""is not by design,"" but because other material is being uploaded to the site, Walzak said.

The ad will be posted soon, he said. Â Â 

Where does this leave us?

In taking his swing at Walker, Barrett creates phony versions of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and trades on the newspaperâ€™s credibility when he declares ""the headlines â€¦ tell the story"" of Walkerâ€™s mismanagement of the county. But the ad uses digital trickery to mix-and-match headlines, give stories greater emphasis than they originally received and to amplify Walkerâ€™s role in each by adding photos to the layout. In the art world, that would be considered forgery.

There may be elements of truth to some of the claims in isolation, but the way they are presented give viewers a false impression of what happened, how it was covered and the role Walker played. Weâ€™ll make our ruling clear: Pants on Fire.

Back to Basics PAC says that Gov. Rick Perry pushed for a law that lets insurance companies raise homeowner rates without justifying the increase
","
Political group Back to Basics' latest television ad criticizing Gov. Rick Perry suggests that the Republican leader has used his office to help insurance companies boost their bottom lines. 
The ad says: ""Perry pushed for a law that lets insurance companies raise homeownersâ€™ rates without having to justify the increase."" 
The TV spot is the fourth to be aired by Back to Basics, which also has run a newspaper ad calling Perry a coward for not debating his Democratic opponent Bill White and for declining to meet with newspaper editorial boards. 
We wondered if Perry helped allow insurance companies to boost homeowners' rates ""without having to justify the increase."" Before gauging his role, we looked at the law and how it came about. 
Back in 2002, insurance rates being charged Texas homeowners were making headlines. The American-Statesman reported that October that Texas was ""in the grip of an insurance crisis,"" characterized by rising premiums for homeowners and reduced coverage for water and mold damage. The article reported that consumer advocates and legislators agreed that the root cause of the crisis was ""the state's failure to act as the insurance industry effectively deregulated itself during the past 20 years, moving all but 5 percent of its policies to subsidiaries whose rates are not under state control."" 
At the time, ""state control"" referred to the ""benchmark"" system, which required insurance companies to charge rates within a specified range set by the insurance commissioner. If a company wanted to charge higher or lower rates, it first had to get approval from the Texas Department of Insurance. 
The 2003 legislative session saw the passage of Senate Bill 14, which Perry signed into law; it switched Texas to a ""file-and-use"" system bringing all insurers back under state regulation. 
The result: A company can file its rates with the Texas Department of Insurance and start charging them right away, although most set the effective date at some time in the future. 
On a website providing backup information for the insurance ad, Back to Basics points to a report from consumer advocacy group Texas Watch that describes the switch as ""a major overhaul of the property and casualty insurance market in Texas."" The key sentence: ""Under the file-and-use system, insurers must simply inform (the Insurance Department) of any rates that it intends to charge, then may begin immediately charging that rate."" 
At the Texas Department of Insurance, though, spokesman Jerry Hagins disputed the idea that insurers can raise â€” or lower â€” rates without justification. 
Hagins explained the process this way: Rate filings are reviewed by department actuaries, who may ask the companies for more information. If the new rates are found to be ""excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory,"" the department can block them from going into effect. If that finding is made after the rates are already being charged, the department can order the company to rescind them, and give refunds, plus interest, to customers who paid premiums based on the rejected rates. 
But there's a catch. If a company challenges the department's finding, the new rates ""may continue to be used during the appeal process until the dispute is resolved,"" Hagins said. 
However, Hagins said rate filings rarely get to that stage. Also rare, he said, are filings of rate increases that are effective immediately, leaving no time for staff review. He added that the department often pushes back against proposed rate changes during informal communications with a company before it actually files. 
We looked at Insurance Department rate-filing data since 2003 for the largest eight companies writing homeowner policies in Texas and found about 15 filings that sought to increase rates within a week; seven were initially scheduled to go into effect the same day. At least nine rate filings have been ""rejected"" or ""disapproved"" since 2003. The vast majority of filings â€” more than 180 â€” are what Hagins described as ""overall revenue neutral,"" which he said ""means that the statewide average impact is zero; some consumers might see an increase while others would see a decrease."" 
Hagins also warned that the rejection numbers don't show how frequently the department pushes back against proposed rate changes during its communications with companies before a rate is officially filed, leading companies to adjust their plans. 
Has ""file and use"" helped consumers? According to a July 20, 2008, story in the American-Statesman, that question is ""hotly debated. Both Democratic and Republican legislators ... said they were frustrated that 'file and use' had not led to significant rate decreases for Texans."" We aren't going to get into that here. 
So much for how ""file and use"" works. Does the law spell out that companies must ""justify"" their rates before raising them? 
Beaman Floyd, director of an insurance special interest group, the Texas Coalition for Affordable Insurance Solutions, pointed to a section of the Insurance Code titled ""Rate Filings and Supporting Information,"" which specifies two materials â€” ""applicable rating manuals"" and ""supplementary rating information"" â€” that insurers ""shall file."" Those materials include a variety of backup information that companies use to determine rates. 
Requiring more information from a company is up to the insurance commissioner, who can make rules specifying what is needed. When we asked about that, Hagins pointed us to a section in the Texas Administrative Code requiring insurers to submit a two-page form and a memorandum that speaks to the overall impact of the rate filing. The rule says the memo may include ""reasons for changing rates."" 
But Alex Winslow, executive director of Texas Watch, said the critical issue in justifying rates is when it happens in the filing process. ""In a nutshell, is any sort of justification meaningful if the justification takes place after consumers are already forced to pay an excessive rate?"" 
For an outside perspective, we contacted Bob Klein, a professor at Georgia State University who is also director of the Center for Risk Management and Insurance Research. He disagreed with Back to Basics' description of a file-and-use system, saying that ""a company still has to justify a rate increase."" 
He said that based on his observation of the way the system works in Texas, the state lets companies know if they are not ""comfortable"" with the filing and typically, the company withdraws it. Texas ""does not have the reputation of being an easy state to get rate increases approved,"" he said. 
Finally, we looked into whether Perry pushed for the ""file and use"" bill that is now the law, as Back to Basics says. 
Perry was among many elected officials calling for homeowner insurance reform before the 2003 legislative session. According to his prepared remarks for a Feb. 12, 2002, news conference, Perry said he had asked the insurance commissioner to work with legislators ""to examine additional state regulations, legislative remedies and tort reforms to put the brakes on runaway homeowner's insurance costs."" 
One option, Perry said then, was a file-and-use system. ""A tougher option is a prior approval rating system,"" he added, which ""would require the insurance commissioner to approve or disapprove certain rate increases before customers are asked to pay."" Prior approval was preferred by consumer advocacy groups and many Democrats, but did not find favor in the 2003 legislative session. 
In a December 2002 press release declaring his intention to designate homeowners insurance an emergency issue for the upcoming legislative session, Perry mentioned several reform proposals, although he did not specify any regulatory system. After the session began in January, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that Perry had not yet ""thrown his weight"" behind any of the insurance-related bills that had been filed. Far as we can tell, he never did. 
When Perry signed the insurance legislation into law, his prepared remarks said it required rates to ""be fair, reasonable and justified. If future rates are unfair, the Department of Insurance now has the authority in law to reject excessive rates out of hand and force insurance companies to offer lower rates."" Among the legislators Perry thanked for their work on the legislation were Sens. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, and Mike Jackson, R-La Porte, architects of the insurance overhaul. 
We asked the two senators if Perry pushed for the file-and-use approach. Jackson said in a statement that Perry had no direct involvement with the proposal as it advanced. Fraser's office shared a November 2002 news article describing Perry as neither endorsing nor criticizing their approach. 
Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger said that ""the governor's office pushed for reform of the system, but not a particular regulatory structure."" 
Cliff Walker, director of Back to Basics PAC, told us that a Feb. 22, 2002, press release issued by Perry's office proves the governor backed file and use because it mentions that system as a ""legislative option."" But the release also mentions the possibility of a ""prior approval"" system. 
Summing up: The Back to Basics claim is based on the notion that Perry was instrumental in pushing the file-and-use system. Thatâ€™s not supported by news reports or other evidence. 
In addition, the suggestion that insurance companies need not justify homeownersâ€™ rate increases is off base: Thatâ€™s part of the information theyâ€™re asked to submit with their filings, and it plays a role in the back-and-forth that may ensue with the departmentâ€™s staff. 
We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AFC980>],/factchecks/2010/oct/03/back-basics/back-basics-pac-says-gov-rick-perry-pushed-law-let/
