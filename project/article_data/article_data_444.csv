Marsha Blackburn cites bipartisan opposition to some Obama administration measures
","On the eve of what should have been the first day of the Republican National Convention in Tampa – delayed a day by Hurricane Isaac – U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., went on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" to describe the accomplishments of the much-maligned and unpopular 112th Congress. The Republican Party has had control of the House of Representatives since January 2010 and GOP members have passed a lot of bills. Not many have become law because the U.S. Senate hasn’t taken them up. In some instances, Republican-backed legislation has won the tepid support of a handful of Democrats, and sometimes the full-throated endorsement of large numbers. Either way, that would constitute ""bipartisan support."" Blackburn’s full statement went like this: ""In the House, we've had bipartisan support for the repeal of Obamacare, bipartisan support for moving forward with the budget. We have had bipartisan support for getting rid of cap and trade and stopping that. We've had bipartisan support for building the Keystone Pipeline."" We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for the supporting evidence that there was, in fact, bipartisan support, reflected in floor votes, for repeal of the Affordable Care Act (so-called ""Obamacare""), for ""getting rid of cap and trade,"" and for building the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada to Texas. The House in fact voted to repeal Obamacare on July 11, for the second time. House Republicans have voted to repeal specific parts of the law 30 times. In the July vote, five Democrats — including Mike Ross of Arkansas, who’s not seeking re-election — joined the Republican majority. On cap and trade (an idea that originated with Republicans), back in June of 2009, when the Democrats controlled the House, the American Clean Energy and Security Act passed by a vote of 219-212, with 44 Democrats voting against it. The Senate failed to act, and nothing happened. The House has voted four times in favor of the Keystone XL Pipeline, most recently in April when 69 Democrats joined their Republican colleagues passing a federal highway bill that contained Sections 202-204 related to the pipeline project. By the time House and Senate conferees rewrote the measure, the pipeline language was removed. It then passed both houses and was signed by the president. So, technically, there was bipartisan support for building the pipeline in the House, but nothing happened. Our ruling It’s not unusual for a small number of members of Congress to defy their party’s leadership and vote the way they think is best. Blackburn’s larger point was that, even with bipartisanship on some significant measures, the bills passed in the House aren’t being signed into law because they aren’t being taken up by the Senate, where the various 60-vote requirements for a bill to proceed make passage much more difficult. But we’re not fact-checking whether U.S. federal government’s structure leads to gridlock. Blackburn’s statement that some measures received some level of bipartisan support is True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7FD9C0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/24/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-cites-bipartisanship-opposition-s/

Paul Ryan backs cutting veterans funding 24 percent, House opponent Rob Zerban says
","
So controversial are the budget and Medicare reforms pitched by GOP vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan that they’re being used not only to attack him, but other Republicans running for the U.S. House of Representatives, as well.

Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, is seeking election to an eighth two-year term even as his name appears on the ballot as Mitt Romney’s running mate.

Ryan’s opponent, Democrat Rob Zerban, went beyond the more common attacks when he appeared Aug. 9, 2012, on Ed Schultz’s national radio talk show.

Schultz, who also hosts a talk show on MSNBC, asked Zerban whether Ryan’s proposals play well in his southern Wisconsin district.

Zerban said constituents are ""overwhelmingly against"" them once they hear details, such as ""cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent.""

That’s a big reduction.

Has Ryan really sought a 24 percent cut for veterans?

Zerban’s evidence

When asked for evidence, Zerban campaign spokesman Karthik Ganapathy cited a Huffington Post article published 10 days after Zerban’s interview; it in turn cites an article published five months earlier in The Atlantic magazine. Both claim Ryan’s budget cuts veterans programs by 24 percent, but The Atlantic cites as its source a March 2012 item in The Washington Post Wonkblog.

The Post article says that over 10 years, Ryan’s budget would spend 13 percent less on veterans than Obama’s budget.

Ganapathy said the two articles he cited claimed a 24 percent cut because that was the figure Post originally used. The Post article does say it was updated, but refers only to the 13 percent figure, so it’s not clear whether 24 percent had been cited previously.

It doesn’t really matter.

Both the Ryan budget and the Obama budget cited by the Post actually raise -- not cut -- spending on medical, disability, housing and other services for veterans by billions of dollars. It’s just that Ryan’s budget doesn’t increase spending for veterans as much as Obama’s does.

To be sure, there are fears that Ryan’s long-term budget plans -- which largely aim to reduce federal spending -- could necessitate dramatic reductions in services.

Zerban’s spokesman cited a March 2012 article by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington, D.C. think tank, about the long-term spending ""path"" traced by Ryan’s budget. By 2050, the article claimed, ""most of the federal government aside from Social Security, health care and defense"" -- including veterans programs -- ""would cease to exist.""

But Zerban didn’t say Ryan’s plan would someday cause veterans programs to ""cease to exist."" What’s more, that sweeping prediction is a measure of long-term outcomes, not actions in one-year budget increments.

Indeed, many budget watchers point out that Ryan’s long-term plan lacks enough detail to know where, and to what degree, specific cuts would occur.

In an August 2012 analysis, University of Maryland public policy professor Philip Joyce said the level of proposed spending cuts ""will require the federal government to stop doing lots of things that it does now."" The cuts could be realized through a two-thirds reduction in, for example, doctors and nurses in veterans hospitals, the professor said.

But Joyce also said the lack of detail on cuts to federal services makes it ""impossible to know what the actual impact"" of Ryan’s long-term budget would be.

Similarly, our friends at FactCheck.org observed in August 2012 that ""Republicans boast of cutting the deficit more than the president, but don’t detail how what programs would have to be eliminated or reduced to achieve that. And the Democrats fill in the details, claiming popular programs like education are on the chopping block.""

Our rating

Zerban said Ryan supports ""cutting funding for veterans by 24 percent.""

But Ryan’s short-term budgets provide for spending increases for veterans services. And even if his long-term plans lead to spending reductions, there isn’t enough detail to know whether and how much programs for veterans would be trimmed.

We rate Zerban’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8A0B40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/23/rob-zerban/paul-ryan-backs-cutting-veterans-funding-24-percen/
"['Immigration', 'New Jersey', 'Rob Andrews']","
Rep. Rob Andrews claims most illegal immigrants first arrived legally with visas and then stayed past the expiration dates
","
Most illegal immigration does not start off with a race across the border, but instead with government visas allowing foreigners to tour the United States or attend school, according to U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews.

Once those visas expire, the individuals go from being welcomed visitors to outlaws, vanishing into the population, the Democratic congressman said.

Andrews, who represents parts of southern New Jersey, made that point during an interview posted online on Sept. 12 with Townsquare Media New Jersey. Andrews is seeking re-election this November against Republican challenger Gregory Horton.

""The number-one source of undocumented people in this country is not people coming across the Mexican border,"" Andrews said. ""It is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again.""

Pinning an exact number on a hidden population remains challenging, but most available estimates suggest Andrews is overstating how many illegal immigrants first arrived legally and stayed past the valid time limits.

That ""overstay"" population typically represents about one-third to roughly half of the country’s illegal immigrants. Therefore, about half to roughly two-thirds of illegal immigrants are generally those who entered the country illegally. 
In fact, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in April that people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent of illegal immigrants.

""That may be a high number, because what we have found is a lot of people who were marked as visa overstays had, in fact, left,"" according to a transcript of Napolitano’s remarks at a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. 
Defending Andrews’ statement, his chief of staff, Fran Tagmire, argued there are more visa overstayers than people who illegally crossed the Mexican border. But we told Tagmire that Andrews’ statement did not directly compare those two groups, but instead claimed overstayers are the ""number-one source"" of all illegal immigrants.

Now, let’s review the estimates we found.

A common measure for estimating the overstay population has been analyzing data from the immigration forms visa holders must file when they enter and leave the country.

Based on that methodology, in January 2003, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that out of the 7 million illegal immigrants in January 2000, 33 percent were individuals who stayed after their temporary visas had expired.

In a May 2004 report, the U.S. General Accounting Office argued overstayers also include certain groups who had entered the country legally without visas and did not fill out those immigration forms.

Using three alternative data sources, the GAO report estimated the overstay population at 31 percent, 27 percent and 57 percent.

The most recent estimate we found was released in May 2006 by the Pew Hispanic Center.

The center estimated that out of between 11.5 million and 12 million illegal immigrants in 2006, ""between 33% and 50% are visa overstayers."" That estimate is based in part on the immigration form data used in the January 2003 analysis.

Still, data on overstayers has been considered unreliable, in part because of the incomplete collection of those immigration forms when foreign visitors leave the country.

The majority of illegal immigrants appears to be due to illegal border crossings, but it’s difficult to reach a precise number, said Edward Alden, an expert in immigration policy for the Council on Foreign Relations.

Our ruling

In an interview with Townsquare Media New Jersey, Andrews claimed the ""number-one source"" of illegal immigration ""is people legally coming to the United States on a tourist visa or a student visa and then disappearing into the population and never being heard from again.""

Data on the overstay population has been labeled unreliable, but most available estimates suggest such individuals are not the ""number-one source."" Those estimates indicate most illegal immigrants had entered the country illegally.

Most studies have said overstayers range from about one-third to roughly half of all illegal immigrants, and the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary said people overstaying their visas may account for fewer than 40 percent.

We rate the statement False.

Michael Riley says U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin has received $20 million from taxpayers and special interests while in office to use at his own discretion
","
Michael Riley, the Republican businessman who wants to end Democrat U.S. Rep. James Langevin’s six-term run as congressman from Rhode Island’s 2nd District, unleashed new television and radio commercials last week, ripping into Langevin as a ravenous devourer of taxpayer money.

The radio ad opens with the menacing music from the movie ""Jaws"" in the background, as the narrator says Langevin has ""received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests while in office to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs. ""

The ad recites a list of problems, from high gas prices to unemployment,  and claims Langevin has few policy accomplishments to show for the money he’s received.

""Beware Rhode Island!"" the narrator warns. ""There’s a shark in the water, circling the Ocean State and looking to feast on your hard-earned tax dollars! That shark’s name is Jim Langevin.""

We’ll pass on the value of Langevin’s policy achievements; one party’s success is another’s crime against the Constitution. But there is an  objective element of Riley’s claim that can be examined: Has Langevin gotten nearly $20 million ""from taxpayers and special interests ... to use at his own discretion"" in his congressional career?

We called the Riley campaign for their backup. Spokesman  Nicholas Tsimortos told us the number is the sum of three elements:
  

Add them up and they come to more than $18 million, hence ""almost $20 million.""

Step one is figuring out if Riley’s numbers are right.

For Langevin’s campaign contribution totals, we went to Opensecrets.org, a campaign-finance database compiled by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.

According to its records, Langevin has raised $6,253,061 over his six previous campaigns and in his current one, through Aug. 22. So Riley’s campaign got that number right.

How about the $2 million in cumulative salary? When Langevin took office in January 2001, U.S. representatives got $145,100 annually; it’s up to $174,000 now. Add up Langevin’s total salary over those years and it’s $1,965,700, close enough to call it almost ""$2 million.""

Last, and not least, is the $11 million that Riley’s campaign says Langevin has spent on staff salaries. For that, we went to Legistorm.com, which tracks congressional office spending. According to that site, $11,021,686 was paid to the 63 people who have worked on Langevin’s federally financed staff over his congressional career. That’s in line with Tsimortos’ $11-million estimate.

So the numbers add up.

But accurate information can be put in a misleading context. And the context of Riley’s claim -- portraying the congressman as a shark devouring taxpayer dollars -- is highly misleading.

The first course of this alleged fiscal buffet is Langevin’s nearly $2 million in congressional pay. Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution requires that representatives be paid.

Langevin may have discretion on how he spends his salary, but there’s nothing sinister about his accepting the same compensation every other congressman receives -- and the same salary Riley would receive if he wins.

What about the $6 million in campaign contributions? Riley’s campaign says all that money comes from ""special interests.""  Even if we were to agree with that characterization -- and most independent analysts don’t  -- federal law limits what candidates can do with contributions. They can be used for commercials, polling and campaign staff, for example, but not a candidate’s personal expenses.

(According to his most recent filings, Riley has given $440,200 to his campaign and accepted $69,363 in contributions.)

Finally,  what about the $11 million Langevin’s office has spent in staff salaries?

According to the U.S. House of Representatives’ House Administration Committee website, each congressman gets an annual allowance for office salaries and expenses. It fluctuates from year to year, but has hovered at about $1 million recently.

Staffers spend much of their time helping constituents having problems with, say the Social Security Administration or the Veterans Administration. And they research issues, providing representatives with the information they need to decide how to vote.

Maybe Langevin could have decided not to have a staff and saved the taxpayers $11 million, but it would have meant Rhode Island’s 2nd District constituents would be less efficiently represented.

Our ruling

Michael Riley’s campaign ad says Rep. James Langevin ""has received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs.""

When you add Langevin’s salary, his staff salaries and his campaign contributions, you do get nearly $20 million.

But Riley’s claim -- and the ad’s portrayal of Langevin as a shark looking to ""feast"" on taxpayers’ dollars -- suggests he has a slush fund and has used it improperly.

That’s a gross distortion of very common practices allowed by law and the U.S. Constitution. We rule his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7BEA80>],/factchecks/2012/sep/23/michael-riley/michael-riley-says-us-rep-jim-langevin-has-receive/
"['Oregon', 'Gambling', ""It's Still a Bad Idea""]","
Was Grange investor part of New York casino deal called corrupt and rigged?
","
The people opposed to a private casino in Wood Village came out swinging in their first campaign ad. They renamed the Grange casino complex the ""Grunge"" and branded Canadian backers Clairvest as foreigners.

Not only that, but the TV spot claims that casino backers would bring ""a history of scandal and crime"" to Oregon. As evidence, they point to a failed New York venture in 2010.

""Their New York casino deal was called rigged and corrupt,"" says the television announcer, while on screen the words ""rigged"" and ""corrupt"" appear with the masthead for the ""New York Post"" daily newspaper tabloid.

The campaign ad prompted one question for PolitiFact Oregon: What happened in New York?

We need to introduce the players for those not following the campaign. The Grange is a $300 million entertainment and casino complex to be built at the old greyhound racing track in Wood Village if state voters approve Measures 82 and 83. Running the opposition campaign is the It’s Still a Bad Idea Committee, funded largely with money from tribes that could lose a lot of money should a private casino compete with their tribal casinos.  

The owner and operator of The Grange would be PDX Entertainment Company, but the big money backers are Clairvest Groupand the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation. Both are based in Canada and operate multiple casinos.

Clairvest previously had served as the primary financial backer on a race track casino project in Queens, New York, as part of the Aqueduct Entertainment Group consortium. AEG was awarded the contract in 2010 despite having the lowest up-front money bid. The offer was rescinded under media scrutiny. The deal fell apart.  

Michael Goodwin, a political columnist for The New York Post, wrote about the unraveling in a March 10, 2010, column. It is from this column that the words ""corrupt"" and ""rigged"" were taken for the ad, and as we usually do, we hunted down the source. Here are the relevant parts:

""The lucrative contract for video slots at the raceway looked and smelled corrupt from the start, and yesterday’s strange developments do nothing to dispel the suspicions,"" Goodwin wrote. ""In fact, the failure by the winning team to finish its application on time and the withdrawals of the Rev. Floyd Flake and rap star Jay-Z from the group adds to the suspicions the process was rigged.""

The state inspector general’s office weighed in on the whole tangled, tarnished process with a hefty investigative report in October 2010. The report described the bidding process as chaotic, lacking clear rules. The report criticized lawmakers and state officials, especially Senate Democratic leader John Sampson, who shared competitive information with AEG and apparently pressured its lobbyists for campaign contributions, which it made. No criminal charges were filed.

Anna Richter Taylor, a spokeswoman for the casino project in Wood Village, said it’s not fair for opponents to taint the Oregon project ""by linking it with headlines from a project that Clairvest,  one of our many investors, was involved in back east."" She added, ""The investigation revealed New York politicians trying to shake down participants in their legislative process. Thankfully Oregon is not New York.""

But Cynara Lilly, a spokeswoman for casino opponents, said voters shouldn’t minimize the role of Clairvest now or in the past. ""That they now have partners doesn't negate the importance of their record.""

We have to agree with Lilly. Clairvest is a major player in the Wood Village casino, with co-CEO Jeff Parr now serving as a director of PDX Entertainment Company. While the words ""corrupt"" and ""rigged"" are the opinions of a columnist and not legal findings, the New York inspector general’s report made it clear that Clairvest-backed AEG engaged in dubious activities in an attempt to win the contract.

The columnist wrote that ""the lucrative contract … looked and smelled corrupt"" and  that there were ""suspicions the process was rigged."" Driving the problems were lawmakers -- but that doesn’t exonerate Clairvest, which financed AEG, from paying to play.

Does that mean Clairvest will bring problems to Oregon? We can’t make that link, and neither can casino opponents. But opponents can say with accuracy that ""their New York casino deal was called rigged and corrupt."" The only additional information we’d offer is the abhorrent behavior of the others involved. 
We rule the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB0E7C40>],/factchecks/2012/sep/21/its-still-bad-idea/was-grange-investor-part-new-york-casino-deal-call/

Progress Texas says constitutional amendment instructed board headed by land commissioner to transfer $300 million to school fund
","
In a recent newsletter update, a Democratic-leaning group touted its campaign to sway a board headed by a Republican to dispatch $300 million to a fund that supports public school operations.

Progress Texas maintains that Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson is hoarding investment earnings despite a 2011 constitutional amendment intended to ease the flow of money to the Available School Fund, which helps pay for classroom instructional materials and technology.

The group’s Sept. 7, 2012, email update says: ""Proposition 6 instructed the three-person School Land Board, run by Chairman Jerry Patterson as part of the General Land Office, to put a portion of earnings -- $300 million, to be precise -- from investments on real estate assets into the Available School Fund as a way to soften the blow of $5.4 billion in cuts to public education.""

Patterson brought the update to our attention. We decided to check it out.

For nearly a decade, the land office has invested in real estate using proceeds received from selling land or drawing on revenue from mineral leases and royalties associated with the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, the agency notes on a web page. In turn, the land board, consisting of the land commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases.

In 2011, the board voted to release $250 million in earnings on investments in both 2012 and 2013 for school needs, as we noted in another fact check. The panel has yet to approve additional transfers to the school fund.

So, did the 2011 amendment ""instruct"" the board to dispatch precisely $300 million in investment earnings to the Available School Fund?

Not quite. The ballot language itself did not mention a dollar figure, while the amendment -- the language added to the constitution -- presented $300 million as the maximum amount that could be annually transferred.

As described in a voter guide prepared by the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area, published in the Oct. 23, 2011, Austin American-Statesman, Proposition 6 on the November 2011 ballot permitted up to $300 million of revenues to be transferred to the school fund. Among other observers, the Texas Tribune and San Antonio Express-News each reported that as much as $300 million -- though not necessarily $300 million -- would be allowed to be transferred.

However, the 2011 Legislature wrote the 2012-13 state budget including a provision for $150 million a year in such transfers, as noted in a July 25, 2012, Tribune news article pointing out the land board had not initiated a transfer at its latest meeting.

Patterson has said the board has through August 2013, the end of the current fiscal year, to decide. He maintains that calls for him to shift earnings must be weighed against the long-term value of simply investing returns.

The Tribune story quotes state Rep. Rob Orr, author of the constitutional amendment, as saying: ""I was told that there would be $300 million going into the Available School Fund. Everything was put in place to allow to that to happen.""

The story also quotes Orr as saying the land office agreed to transfer the money if the amendment won voter approval. But the story quotes Patterson as saying he did not recall committing to a transfer of the money and that his office had been unable to find ""any evidence or documents or memos or testimony"" that he did.

In a telephone interview, Orr, R-Burleson, said the amendment did not mandate a transfer amount after Patterson objected to an early version setting a minimum transfer level. Orr told us the amendment also did not instruct the board to transfer funds; it permitted or allowed such action.

Regardless, Orr told us, legislative colleagues who drafted the state budget ""would not put $300 million into a budget that they didn’t think they were getting.""

In emails, the executive director of Progress Texas, Matt Glazer, agreed it is up to the land board to approve transfers. Glazer said its update says the amendment ""instructed"" the board to act in the spirit of indicating guidance -- not an order. He pointed out Merriam-Webster’s definition of ""instruct,"" which leads off with ""to give knowledge to; to provide with authoritative information or advice."" The next listed definition: ""to give an order or command.""

Reminded that the amendment says the amount transferred is ""not to exceed $300 million each year,"" rather than saying precisely $300 million, Glazer said the group’s claim reflects the state budget.

The relevant budgetary provision provides for $150 million a year to be transferred to support the schools. But the stipulation, adopted before voters considered the proposition, also makes the transfers contingent on voter approval of the amendment as well as the land office moving to make the transfers. If either action doesn’t occur, the provision says, budgeted school aid is to be reduced accordingly.

Our ruling

The newsletter update said a 2011 constitutional amendment approved by Texas voters ""instructed"" a board headed by Patterson to put $300 million into a fund supporting public school operations.

This claim distorts aspects of the amendment. First, the word ""instructed"" is misleading; the amendment only authorized such transfers. Second, the amendment did not specify that $300 million be dispatched. That’s the maximum annual amount allowed to be transferred.

Finally, while lawmakers budgeted the cited $300 million in transfers during 2012-13, they also signed off on a reduction in budgeted school aid if the land office does not make the transfers -- signaling the result was out of their control.

This statement has an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBCF5740>],/factchecks/2012/sep/21/progress-texas/progress-texas-says-constitutional-amendment-instr/

Tennessee GOP chairman says Obama surrogate admits the country is not better off than four years ago
","
The pace of the nation’s economic recovery continues to be one of the most heavily debated issues as the presidential race enters its final stretch.

Republican Mitt Romney and his supporters have been trying to gain the upper hand in that debate by asking voters the same question that Ronald Reagan effectively used against Jimmy Carter in 1980: Are you better off than you were four years ago?

One of President Barack Obama’s top campaign surrogates, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, ""acknowledged that we are not better off than we were four years ago,"" Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Chris Devaney wrote in a posting on the party’s web site on Sept. 4.

To back up the claim, the party’s state executive director, Adam Nickas, directed us to O’Malley’s Sept. 2, appearance on CBS News’ ""Face the Nation."" The program, moderated by Bob Schieffer, was broadcast live on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.

Instead of paraphrasing the exchange in question, we’ll let a transcript from that pertinent segment of the broadcast speak for itself:

Schieffer: Can you honestly say that people are better off today than they were four years ago?

O’Malley: No, but that’s not the question of this election. The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses, the Bush recession, the Bush deficits, the series of desert wars, charged for the first time to credit cards, the national credit card …

When Schieffer pointed out that Bush is not on the ballot, O’Malley replied: ""Yeah. But we are making progress"" and are coming out of ""the deep, deep hole.""

O’Malley’s remarks lit up the web and the blogosphere. But the next day, he gave a different answer during a CNN panel discussion when moderator Soledad O’Brien referenced his earlier response on ""Face the Nation.""

Again, here is a transcript of the pertinent exchange:

O’Malley: Here’s the reality of our situation as a country. We are clearly better off as a country because we are now creating jobs rather than losing them.

O’Brien: But you said no …

O’Malley: But Soledad, we have not recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession. That’s why we need to continue to move forward. Is there anybody on this panel that thinks we’ve recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession? I don’t think anybody could say that. But clearly, we’re moving forward. We’re creating jobs. Unemployment is down. Job creation is up. And those positive movements would not have happened without the president’s leadership.

A few days later, on Friday, Sept. 7, O’Malley appeared on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" and said he didn’t mean to say that Americans were not better off when he made his earlier remarks.

O’Malley said he had been ""word-spliced"" on ""Face the Nation"" and that Americans are indeed doing better.

""Yes, of course we’re doing better when America is creating jobs, and we are creating jobs,"" he said.

He again said the United States has not recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession and insisted that is what he was talking about on ""Face the Nation.""

In fairness to Devaney, O’Malley’s appearance on ""Morning Joe"" happened three days after Devaney had posted his comments on the GOP web site. But O’Malley’s CNN appearance, in which he backed off of his earlier statement, came the day before Devaney had posted his comments.

Our ruling

During his ""Face the Nation"" appearance, O’Malley did, in fact, say Americans are not better off than they were four years ago, but he made clear he felt this was the fault of the Bush administration, not Obama’s. He further clarified his beliefs in a CNN interview the next day and in another television interview three days later. In those follow-up interviews, O’Malley said that while not all jobs lost during the recession have been recovered, Americans are still better off because the country is creating jobs instead of losing them.

Chairman Devaney correctly cited O’Malley’s original remarks but failed to mention that the governor had said the opposite in subsequent interviews. We understand that, especially in the hyper-partisan atmosphere surrounding a presidential election, politicos are going to cherry-pick comments that make their side look good and the other guy look bad. Still, we rate Devaney’s claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC671F00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/21/chris-devaney/tennessee-gop-chairman-says-obama-surrogate-admits/

Mitt Romney-aligned group says 'real' unemployment rate is 19 percent
","
A campaign ad by the pro-Mitt Romney group Restore Our Future blames President Barack Obama not only for the current high rate of unemployment, but also for leading many Americans to simply stop looking for jobs.

""Millions of Americans are disappearing from the work force because they can't find jobs,"" the ad says. ""The overall unemployment rate doesn't even count them any more. Eight million Americans have dropped out of the workforce since Obama became president. Counting people who dropped out or can't find full-time jobs, the real unemployment rate is 19 percent.""

Everybody knows the jobs bounceback from the most recent recession has been frustratingly modest. But have eight million Americans really ""dropped out of the work force since Obama became president""? And has that left the ""real"" unemployment rate at 19 percent?

Restore Our Future, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on what went into the group’s calculation. But the ad itself did offer its source: a Wall Street Journal column from Sept. 7, 2012, by businessman and editor Mortimer Zuckerman. Zuckerman wrote:

""How many people are out of work but not counted as unemployed because they hadn't sought work in the past four weeks? Eight million. ... The key indicator of our employment health, in all the statistics, is what the government calls U-6. This is the number who have applied for work in the past six months and includes people who are involuntary part-time workers — government-speak for those individuals whose jobs have been cut back to two or three days a week. They are working part-time only because they've been unable to find full-time work. This involuntary army of what's called ‘underutilized labor’ has been hovering for months at about 15 percent of the workforce. Include the eight million who have simply given up looking, and the real unemployment rate is closer to 19 percent.""

Zuckerman didn’t answer our inquiries. But we’ll look at the two pieces of the claim -- the 8 million and the 19 percent -- in order.

Eight million labor-force dropouts

The eight million figure has been bouncing around the conservative blogosphere in recent weeks, such as a widely shared column from Investor’s Business Daily that said that during the Obama recovery, ""the ranks of those who aren't in the labor force at all have swelled by nearly 8 million.""

We were able to track down a Bureau of Labor Statistics category that jibes with the 8 million claim. Called ""not in labor force,"" this statistic counts people age 16 years and older who are neither employed nor unemployed. (Being unemployed, according to BLS, means being available for work and having looked for work sometime during the previous four weeks.)

Between Obama’s inauguration and today, a 44-month period, the number of Americans ""not in the labor force"" rose by 8.4 million. Using a slightly different time frame -- starting the count at the end of the recession in June 2009 -- produces a rise of almost exactly 8 million. So the figure has a grain of truth.

But what does this number really mean? For starters, it’s actually not a measurement of people who ""can’t find jobs"" -- at least not entirely. In addition to discouraged job-seekers, it includes parents who decided to become a full-time mom or dad. It includes people who have decided to go back to school. And it includes people who have chosen to retire.

There’s no question that some of these decisions may have been influenced by a perception of weak job prospects ahead. But people make these career-changing decisions all the time; if you’re going to lay the blame for a shrinking workforce on today’s economy, it’s important to tell how much more common labor-market departures are now compared to what would have been happening in a more ""normal"" job market. The retirement numbers are particularly important, given the aging of the baby-boomer workforce.

Fortunately, there’s a way to get a rough sense of this, by looking at the trendline over a longer period of time. 
For the 44 months prior to January 2009, people left the labor force at a stable, predictable rate -- in fact, essentially the same rate back to 2002. During that time, 3.8 million people left the labor force. So if you consider this the ""normal"" amount of departures from the labor force over 44 months, Obama’s presidency has seen departures increase by an ""extra"" 4.6 million.

This 4.6 million number checks out if you look at the trendline for the civilian labor force -- that is, the number of people who are either employed or officially unemployed. After a steady rise through January 2009, this number has flatlined. If you were to extend the same pace of growth after January 2009 as there was before, the labor force would have had almost exactly 4.6 million extra members today.

Bottom line: An extra 4.6 million people leaving the labor force (or never joining it in the first place) is still a big number. But it’s not 8 million.

A 19 percent ""real"" unemployment rate

The statistic Zuckerman referred to in his column -- the U-6 unemployment rate -- is sometimes offered as a more ""complete"" picture of joblessness. It doesn’t just include those who BLS officially considers ""unemployed"" but also those working part time for economic reasons as well as those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force (meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force).

Currently, the U-6 rate of ""labor underutilization"" -- which is the broadest measure of unemployment and under-employment that BLS calculates -- is 14.7 percent. That’s a whole lot higher than the more familiar 8.1 percent unemployment rate, but it’s also well below the 19 percent claimed in the ad. As we can see from Zuckerman’s column, he has reached 19 percent by taking U-6 as his base and then broadening its definition of under-employment. The ad then ran with his calculation.

Labor economists we interviewed said that what Zuckerman did is fine in theory. Even though U-6 is the broadest measurement of under-employment that BLS calculates, it still doesn’t capture everyone affected by a bad job market, such as recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them.

The problem is that no reasonable expansion of U-6 gets the figure as high as 19 percent.

First, as we noted above, the more accurate figure to use for labor-force dropouts due to economic conditions is 4.6 million, not 8 million. Second, a big chunk of these 4.6 million are already counted in BLS’ basic U-6 calculation -- they’re ""marginally attached"" workers. In the most recent month, the marginally attached numbered 2.6 million. So to avoid double-counting, you have to subtract 2.6 million.

This leaves 2 million labor-force dropouts to add to the existing U-6 calculation. Running the new numbers -- perhaps we can call this new statistic ""U-7"" -- produces an under-employment rate of 16 percent, not 19 percent.

Again, this is just about double the already high ""official"" unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. But it’s not, as the ad claimed, 19 percent.

Our rating

Restore Our Future’s ad spotlights a reasonable attempt to quantify some of the hidden victims of today’s weak labor market. But due to errors of concept and calculation, the final numbers cited in the ad are too high. A more accurate measure of workforce dropouts due to the weak job market is 4.6 million, not 8 million, and what the ad would call the ""real"" unemployment rate is actually about 16 percent, not 19 percent.

Obama to blame for defense sequestration, says Romney ad
","
A new Florida-centric ad for Mitt Romney says ""Obama’s defense cuts"" are set to ""threaten thousands"" of jobs.

The ad opens with Romney speaking at the Republican National Convention in Tampa: ""This president can ask us to be patient. This president can tell us it was someone else's fault. But this president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office.""

A narrator then takes up the story line: ""Here in Florida, we’re not better off under President Obama. Over 100,000 jobs lost, and Obama’s defense cuts threaten thousands more. Romney’s plan? Reverse Obama’s defense cuts, strengthen our military, create over 700,000 jobs for Florida.""

Is President Barack Obama planning large defense cuts?

(We contacted both campaigns for this report, but didn’t hear back.)

Actually, Obama has said he opposes the major defense cuts set to take effect in fiscal year 2013. The Romney ad takes one piece of information from a larger, more complicated story about the federal budget.

That story goes back to the debt limit debate of 2011, so let’s start there.

Looking for a budget deal in 2011

Last year, the United States government was reaching its legal debt limit, which meant Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing.

Raising the debt limit (also called the debt ceiling) was in some ways symbolic: Congress has the power of the purse, and the decisions to spend the money had already been made.

In prior administrations, Congress approved higher debt limits with some partisan sniping (including from then-Sen. Obama against President George W. Bush) but without too much fuss.

But in the summer of 2011, House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts go along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the Obama White House, and at first the two sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, referred to in the media as a ""grand bargain.""

The closed-door negotiations fell apart, though, and since then journalists have been sorting through a lot of finger-pointing. Some blame Boehner for being unable to deliver his own Republicans on a deal, thanks to tea party opposition to any new taxes. Others blame Obama for his inexperience, for not cultivating relationships with congressional Republicans and for tactical mistakes at negotiating. Some blame both.  

At any rate, Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious agreement to raise the debt limit through the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law found approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. This 12-member committee became known as ""the super-committee.""

The super-committee was supposed to meet and agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 23, 2011. Their proposal -- which could include tax increases, spending reductions or both -- would then get a filibuster-proof, up-or-down vote in Congress.

As an incentive to the super-committee, the law included an unusual kind of budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are referred to as ""sequestration.""

Lo and behold, the super-committee didn’t agree on a deficit reduction package, so Congress never voted on it. Sequestration is now set to take effect with the 2013 budget. And that’s what the ad is referring to when it mentions ""Obama’s defense cuts,"" according to press releases from the Romney campaign.

""Obama’s"" sequester?

Does Obama support the sequester? Well, yes and no.

Some of the most detailed reporting on sequestration is from Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward and his new book The Price of Politics. Woodward’s reporting shows clearly that defense sequestration was an idea that came out of Obama’s White House.

But the intention was to force Republicans to negotiate, not to actually put the cuts into effect. Woodward summarizes the thoughts of the Obama team: ""There would be no chance the Republicans would want to pull the trigger and allow the sequester to force massive cuts to Defense."" Democrats, meanwhile, didn’t want to see their favorite domestic programs cut.

As the negotiations proceeded, Republicans seemed to think the same thing.

""Boehner told the House Republican leadership and other key members not to worry about the sequester … ‘Guys, this would be devastating to Defense,’ he said. ‘This would be devastating, from their perspective, on their domestic priorities. This is never going to happen.’ ""

But sequestration is now looming. In August 2012, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a reported detailing how sequestration will affect different departments. In its introduction, the OMB repeats the Obama administration’s opposition to the process.

""The specter of harmful across-the-board cuts to defense and nondefense programs was intended to drive both sides to compromise. Congress can and should take action to avoid it by passing a comprehensive and balanced deficit reduction package.

""As the Administration has made clear, no amount of planning can mitigate the effect of these cuts. Sequestration is a blunt and indiscriminate instrument. It is not the responsible way for our Nation to achieve deficit reduction.""

Still, some say that the Obama White House proposed sequestration, so that means Obama owns it.

""While both parties are culpable for sequestration because the Budget Control Act passed Congress, the president proposed it originally and ultimately owns its outcome,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, an expert on defense with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an adviser to the Romney campaign. ""That is because he alone can lead by calling the party leaders together for a resolution today if he wanted as president.""

Other see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration, especially since Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26)

""The logic that lays the blame for sequestration at Obama's feet, because he negotiated the BCA with GOP leaders in Congress, could just as easily apply to those other negotiators, or, indeed, any member of Congress who voted for the BCA in August 2011,"" said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Preble favors reductions to the defense budget.

""I do not believe it accurate to refer to the cuts that will occur in both defense and non-defense discretionary spending under sequestration as ‘Obama's cuts,’ "" he said.

Laura Peterson of Taxpayers for Common Sense also noted that sequestration results from a law passed in the usual manner. ""I think the fact that Congress passed it means it is not a presidential mandate. It was a law that originated in Congress and was sent to the president’s desk,"" she said.

Our ruling

The Romney campaign ad refers to ""Obama’s defense cuts"" that could threaten jobs. But in short-handing the looming defense cuts, the ad gives only one piece of a much larger story.

Obama’s negotiating team came up with the idea for defense cuts in 2011, but they were intended to motivate Congress to come up with a better deal for reining in the deficit, not as an effort to make those cuts reality.

Meanwhile, both parties voted for the legislation that set up the chain of events leading to defense cuts. Obama’s position is that Congress should now act to avoid those cuts.

We rate the statement Half True.

"['Bush Administration', 'Candidate Biography', 'Federal Budget', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Wisconsin', 'Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee']","
Democratic group says Thompson admitted Washington, D.C. stint changed him for the worse
","
Democrats and their allies are working overtime to convince Wisconsin voters that former Gov. Tommy Thompson isn’t the man he used to be.

Three new ads use Thompson’s own words in building a case that the U.S. Senate candidate changed for the worse after leaving President George W. Bush’s cabinet and making millions in part by working on behalf of drug companies, financial firms and other interests.

One spot, by the political arm of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal workers uses a snippet of a Thompson quote -- ""... Washington changed us …"" -- to bookend allegations that he’s changed so much he now ""supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs."" 
Another spot, by Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat seeking the Senate seat, uses it in support of an allegation regarding Thompson and drug companies. 
The newest ad, by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, uses the same snippet to say Thompson ""admitted"" being a guy who flew off to D.C. and ""hasn’t looked back.""

The list of grievances in the DSCC ad is long. Amid generic images of corporate deal-making, the spot says Thompson ""sold his influence and connections, becoming a partner in a powerful Washington lobbying firm, working for Wall Street and the big drug companies, making millions from the special interests at our expense.""

It skips any mention of Thompson’s four-year stint running the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services before he went to work in 2005 as a legal partner at the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld.

The ad ends with the narrator saying, ""Thompson even admitted…"" before the screen cuts to Thompson remarking at a presidential debate during his 2008 run: ""Washington changed us.""

Narrator: ""Yes it did.""

Just what was Thompson owning up to in the quote?

Return with us to the June 5, 2007 CNN-sponsored presidential debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. John Lewicke, an electrical engineer, posed this long question to a candidate panel that included Thompson and current nominee Mitt Romney:

""In 2006, we saw the worst Republican defeat in living memory. If we do more of the same, why do we expect anything different? And I'd like to ask each of the candidates why their position is -- or how their position differs from the present administration's, so that we won't see a repeat of 2006 in 2008.""

A transcript shows the candidates gave answers along two themes: Curb spending (unlike Bush) and show some vision. Few gave any details on spending cuts, other than to suggest banning pork-barrel projects. Ron Paul said the Iraq War costs were too high.

Enter Thompson, questioned by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.

BLITZER: ""The question is what - what's President Bush's biggest mistake over these past several years?""

THOMPSON: ""Because we went to Washington to change Washington and Washington changed us. We didn't come up with new ideas. We got to transform health care. We got to wind -- we got to wind down the war in Iraq. We got to make sure that we really are conservatives. If we're going to spend money like - as foolishly and as stupidly as the Democrats, the voters are going to vote for the professional spending, the Democrat not the amateur spender, the Republican."" (Laughter, applause.)

There was no commentary on Thompson’s private-sector jobs.

Rather, it seems clear Thompson’s ""admission"" concerned his regrets, however belated, over policy and budget matters during his days in the Bush cabinet.

But the DSCC uses the quote in the ad to give the false impression Thompson was standing in self-judgment over his work at the time for Akin Gump and others.

When asked about the quote, DSCC spokesman Matt Canter connected the dots this way:

Most observers, he argued, would say that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created with Thompson’s support under Bush was a giveaway to the big pharmaceutical companies. Thompson’s debate remarks talked about the failure to transform health care. Therefore, Thompson’s ""Washington changed us"" was an admission that such deals with special interests were wrong, Canter said.

To be sure, there is a connection between Thompson’s cabinet experience and his subsequent private work. PolitiFact Wisconsin has noted that connection in earlier items -- and those items are cited as a source for many of the statements in the ad.

We noted the connection when we checked a claim by Thompson’s GOP primary rival Eric Hovde that Thompson is ""a big corporate lobbyist"" and has been ""lobbying during the middle of the campaign.""      

We rated that Half True, noting that Thompson is not a registered lobbyist under the strict definition but ""has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register.""

His link to these firms is clear, and his own disclosure reports show he has made millions in the private sector as a corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker.

But we’re examining the claim that Thompson candidly ""admitted"" being ""changed"" by Washington into a corporate influence peddler.

Our rating

In claiming that Thompson ""admitted"" he had been changed by Washington and had sold out to make millions, the ad jumbles a snippet from a quote about the failings of himself and other GOP officials while running Washington with his actions after leaving government service.

The effect is to make it appear Thompson is condemning his own conduct and private-sector work.

We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBE6100>],/factchecks/2012/sep/21/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-thompson-admitted-washington/
"['New Hampshire', 'Jobs', 'Taxes', ""William O'Brien""]","
NH Speaker of the House says Democrats are to blame for high businesses taxes and unemployment rates
","
Eyes and ears for questionable campaign claims are everywhere.

Recently a New Boston reader reached out to PolitiFact New Hampshire with a campaign mailer he received from Speaker of the House Bill O’Brien R-Mont Vernon this summer.

The material was one of many tools incumbents are employing in a tussle for party control of the statehouse in 2013.

""When Republicans took over the legislature in 2010, we inherited a tax rate for employers that was 50th -- dead last -- in the nation,"" O’Brien said. ""Add to that one of the most intense regulatory state government structures in the country, and it was no wonder that the unemployment rate had more than doubled since the Democrats took power four years prior.""

Along with this excerpt, our reader had a simple request: ""Would you be willing to crunch the numbers here?""

We were happy to oblige.

First, we reached out to O’Brien through his campaign email and phone number, but we heard nothing back.

We broke his claim into two parts, and reached out to The Tax Foundation and the New Hampshire Employment Security for some answers.

The Tax Foundation, a business-backed policy group, offered some guidance for the part of the claim where O’Brien speaks about New Hampshire’s ""tax rate for employers"" in 2010.

That year New Hampshire ranked 50th on The Tax Foundation's corporate tax index, according to economist Scott Drenkard.

Every year The Tax Foundation takes an ""all-encompassing"" look at the entire tax system of a state, Drenkard said, breaking it into five subcategories: corporate, income, sales, unemployment insurance, and property taxes.

""The word ‘rate’ is concerning to me because it’s not exactly what it looks at,"" Drenkard said. ""The rate is only part of this story.""

Drenkard pointed us to a New Hampshire Watch Dog article that broke down the Tax Foundation’s ranking at the time.

As part of the study, New Hampshire ranked 7th best for overall business tax climate, and had been 7th since 2007. In 2006, the Granite State was 6th.

""New Hampshire’s economic competitiveness was dragged down in the rankings by its worst in the nation corporate tax policy,"" according to the article.

""The rate is fairly high,"" Drenkard said. ""That's part of the component there. There's a business profits tax and New Hampshire limits carryforwards, one of the things that's an important part of the base.""

New Hampshire also got ""dinged"" in 2010 for offering credits for creating jobs, as well as research and development credits and investment credits, which The Tax Foundation scores as negative in its corporate tax policy, Drenkard added.

""Those, for the most part, mixed with the high rate, ended up putting it in 50th in 2010,"" Drenkard said. ""In general, the spirit of what he’s trying to say is certainly true. We rank it as one of the worst corporate tax structures in the country.""

State legislatures write the laws that impact tax structure, Drenkard said. But it’s important to note that in 2012 -- under a Republican-controlled legislature -- the Granite State only hits 46th in its corporate tax rank compared to the rest of the country.

Each Tax Foundation study is considered exclusive to the year in which it is conducted and should not be compared with previous ranks, Drenkard said.

""For the most part, I don’t remember hearing any fantastic corporate tax reforms from New Hampshire at least recently,"" Drenkard said. ""So the story is it was bad in 2010 and for the most part is still one of our lowest ranked corporate tax codes.""

As for the Granite State’s unemployment statistics, O’Brien is fairly accurate on the numbers by themselves.

""Roughly, you could say it doubled,"" Annette Nielsen, an economist for New Hampshire Employment Security said.

Looking at 2006 generally -- four years prior to Republicans taking over the state legislature in November 2010 -- unemployment was in the 3.4-3.7 percent range, Nielsen said.

It stayed that way through May 2008, she added. In November and December that year, the recession hit, and state unemployment numbers started rising. By December 2008 the unemployment was 4.8 percent. By October 2009 it peaked at 6.7 percent and stayed that way through January 2010. Not quite the ""more than doubled"" number O’Brien cited, but close.

New Hampshire’s increasing unemployment rate followed nationwide trends, Nielsen said.

""The nation was at a much higher rate, it peaked in October at 10.1 or 10.2 percent,"" Nielsen said. ""It followed the general trend of the nation.""

Are Democrats to blame for the increased unemployment figures?

""Whether it could be better or worse, that's kind of a little more individual -- what people maybe feel,"" Nielsen said. ""There are some forces that are national that have an impact. New Hampshire is not an island by itself. It’s part of the nation and there were some greater forces that were taking place at that time.""

Dennis Delay, an economist with the N.H. Center for Public Policy Studies, an independent nonprofit that pursues data-based research on public policy matters, agreed.

Unemployment increased in New Hampshire as a result of the Great Recession, he said.

""States with Republican legislatures also saw unemployment rates rise substantially after 2007, because of the worldwide financial crisis and its impact on local economies,"" Delay added.

He provided a graph of job losses in the U.S. and compared it to New Hampshire, which shows the spike in job losses nationwide during that period of time.

""The situation in New Hampshire looks similar, although New Hampshire did not lose as many jobs in percentage terms as the U.S.,"" Delay added.

Our ruling:

O’Brien said that when Republicans took over the state legislature in 2010, the state's tax rate for employers was last in the nation, and unemployment had more than doubled under Democrats.

We find he generalized a 2010 tax study, zeroing in on New Hampshire’s corporate tax rate, when several other factors contribute to The Tax Foundation’s corporate tax index for New Hampshire. And he failed to mention that New Hampshire’s corporate tax rank is still in the same ballpark in 2012.

O’Brien used accurate unemployment figures comparing 2006 to 2010, but the numbers have more to do with the Great Recession than with the people (or the party) running the state.

O’Brien was on target with the rank and rates he cited, but there is context missing and misplaced blame. We rate his claim Half True.

Rob Portman says national debt is enough to buy Indians, Reds baseball franchises more than 1,900 times
","
""A billion here, a billion there,"" goes a quip about federal spending that's often attributed to the late Sen. Everett Dirksen, ""and pretty soon you're talking real money.""

Pretty soon, or eventually, you're talking trillions -- which is what the national debt reached in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

On Sept. 4, 2012, the accumulated debt topped $16 trillion.

Looking to put perspective on the size of what he called ""a dangerous milestone,"" Sen. Rob Portman released a list of things the money could do.

For example, he said, it's ""enough to buy both the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds 1,918 times.""

As fans of baseball, as well as fact checking, PolitiFact Ohio decided to see if Portman’s quip was fair or foul.

We checked with his staff, and they referred us to Forbes, which is famous for its money-related lists. Among them is its compilation of Major League Baseball team values. We dug in.

The Indians were ranked 26th of the 30 teams -- below Toronto and above Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay and Oakland -- with a value of $410 million.

The Reds were ranked 24th, with a current value of $424 million.

At the top end, by the way, were the Yankees at $1.8 billion, followed by the Dodgers at $1.4 billion and the Red Sox at $1 billion.

With pencil and paper in hand, we checked the math.

With a combined value of $834 million, by our calculation, the Tribe and the Reds could be bought 19,184 times for $16 trillion -- 10 times more than Portman’s release claimed. Unless, of course, the Dolan family and Bob Castellini, owners of the Indians and the Reds, respectively,  held out for more.

While we were at it, we wondered how football would rate, because Forbes also compiled a list of NFL team values.

They ranked the Cleveland Browns 21st of the 32 franchises at $987 million, which Forbes called ""the present value of the transaction"" in which Jimmy Haslam is buying the team from Randy Lerner for $1.05 billion.

The Cincinnati Bengals were 26th, at $871 million.

Sixteen trillion would cover the $1.858 billion combined price of the Browns and Bengals 8,611 times.

With that, let’s check the score.

Portman’s staff readily acknowledged their their baseball calculation error when we pointed out the lowball estimate. Somewhere in the proccess they dropped a zero. (For the record, 16 trillion has 12 zeroes, which was more than our pocket calculator could handle.)

But Portman's point was that $16 trillion is a whopping amount of money, and on that count he is accurate

Whether it matches the value of the two baseball franchises 1,918 times or 19,184 times, it’s still a whopping amount of money. Correcting the math error only makes that point more forcefully.

Another way to look at it is he was correct in saying that you could, theoretically, buy the Indians and the Reds 1,980 times with $16 trillion -- but you'd still have $14.3 trillion left to play with.

That’s additional information that provides clarification.

"['Georgia', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney goes to the tape to attack Obama
","
Mitt Romney, seeking to regain his footing after a recent controversial audio recording of himself was unearthed earlier this week, used an old tape of Barack Obama to put the president on the defensive.

""There’s a tape that came out just a couple of days ago where the president said, yes, he believes in redistribution,"" Romney, the Republican Party presidential nominee, said during a fundraiser Wednesday afternoon in Atlanta.

Romney first talked about the recording Tuesday in a Fox News interview, saying Obama ""likes"" redistribution. Romney then said he believes in free enterprise, not redistribution of wealth. His running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also has pounced on the Obama audio on the campaign trail.

We were curious to find out if the Romney campaign accurately reflected what Obama said and meant in the recording.

Here’s the sentence in which Obama specifically spoke about redistribution: ""I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution – because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot.""

Obama apparently made those remarks, according to a pro-Romney website, at Loyola University in Chicago on Oct. 19, 1998, when Obama was an Illinois state senator.

Obama campaign officials said Romney’s discussion of the recording was the sign of a desperate campaign.

""Fourteen years ago, then-Sen. Obama was making an argument for a more efficient, more effective government — specifically citing city government agencies that he didn’t think were working effectively,"" Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said, according to ABC News. ""He believed then, and believes now, that there are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a fair shot if they work hard. Unlike Gov. Romney, he doesn’t believe that if you’re a student who applies for a loan, you’re looking for a handout.""

We asked the Romney campaign Wednesday afternoon for any additional information they thought may be useful and may address any concerns that their candidate took Obama’s 1998 remarks out of context. Romney officials sent us a transcript of Obama’s remarks and link to the audio.

In the Fox News interview, Romney gave his interpretation of what he believed Obama meant.

""The president’s view is one of a larger government. There’s a tape that just came out today in which the president said that he likes redistribution,"" Romney said.

For months, the Obama and Romney campaigns have dueled over their drastically different ideals of what role the federal government should play in America.

Earlier this week, a secretly recorded audio of Romney went public in which he said at a Florida fundraiser in May that 47 percent of Americans will vote for Obama ""no matter what"" because they are dependent on government and feel that they are ""victims."" PolitiFact has fact-checked several of the claims in the Romney audio. Romney has since said his comments could have been more elegantly stated, but he stands by his larger point that a ""government-centered nation"" is not good for America.

Romney and Republicans have consistently portrayed Obama as a president who wants to expand government and engage in class warfare because of his proposal to increase income taxes on those who make more than $250,000 a year. In 2008, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Obama wanted to ""spread the wealth"" because of his tax policy and ""experiment with socialism"" as president. PolitiFact rated that claim a Pants on Fire.

The 96-second audio indicates Obama was near the end of his remarks at Loyola. The audio begins with Obama talking about policy research for the working poor. He then spoke about battling the notion that government action is ineffective.

""There has been a systematic propaganda campaign against the possibility of government action and its efficacy, and I think some of it has been deserved,"" Obama said.

In the audio, Obama is critical of the Chicago Housing Authority and Chicago Public Schools, saying neither has been a good model of policymaking. The portion of the recording that the Romney campaign has seized upon ends with Obama discussing redistribution. But Obama said more, NBC News reports.

NBC News found an additional clip of the recording. Here’s what Obama said:

""I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot. How do we pool resources at the same time as we decentralize delivery systems in ways that both foster competition, can work in the marketplace, and can foster innovation at the local level and can be tailored to particular communities.""

So Obama is also talking about ways to encourage competitiveness and innovation, themes Romney consistently extols on the campaign trail. Romney, though, may disagree with Obama’s definition of competitiveness and innovation.

Finally, Obama has long advocated raising taxes on the wealthy in order to avoid cuts to social spending programs for the middle and lower classes. Polls show most Americans support increasing taxes on the wealthy. That’s a form of ""redistribution,"" though Obama doesn’t call it that today.

Also, the progressive income tax code itself, which both parties have supported in the past, could fairly be called ""redistribution."" It enshrines the idea that the rich pay a larger share of their income for government services that benefit everyone.

Our ruling:

To review, Romney said Obama ""believes in redistribution."" Romney said on Fox in discussing the 1998 audio that Obama shows he believes in ""a larger government.""

Obama said in the recording that he believes in structuring ""government systems that pool resources"" to make sure everyone has a shot. Obama didn’t specifically talk about making government bigger in those remarks. Obama was even critical of some government agencies in Chicago in the clip. Obama also spoke about ways to foster competition and innovation.

Obama spoke of redistribution in a way that government can create an even playing field for everyone and encourage competition. The clip of the 1998 audio that Romney referenced to criticize Obama doesn’t tell the complete story.

We rate Romney’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE0F100>],/factchecks/2012/sep/20/mitt-romney/romney-goes-tape-attack-obama/

Shelley Moore Capito correct on suicides in West Virginia
","Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., recently sought to raise awareness about suicide, focusing on its toll in her home state. ""On average, one person dies by suicide every 22 hours in West Virginia,"" Capito said in a Facebook post on Sept. 19. She went on to note her efforts with two Senate colleagues, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Doug Jones, D-Ala., to pass the Suicide Training and Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention, or STANDUP, Act, which would expand efforts to educate young people about mental health resources. Is Capito correct about the frequency of suicide in West Virginia? Capito’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we were able to find statistics that backed up her assertion. We turned to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s WISQARS database, which includes data as recently as 2017. The database shows that there were 393 suicides in West Virginia.  With 8,760 hours in a year, that comes out to about one suicide every 22.3 hours, making Capito’s statistic correct. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in West Virginia. It ranks even higher for certain age groups, ranking second among those between 15 and 34 and fourth among those between 35 and 54. On a per capita basis, West Virginia has the eighth-highest rate of suicide in the nation.  We checked with both the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and University of Denver associate professor of social work Stacey Freedenthal, a specialist in suicide, and both agreed that there are no complications with the data that would undercut Capito’s statement. Capito said, ""On average, one person dies by suicide every 22 hours in West Virginia.""

Is Murray Energy the nation's largest coal company?
","Murray Energy Corp., a major player in the coal-mining industry, declared bankruptcy in late October, sending shockwaves across coal-dependent regions of West Virginia and neighboring states. In addition to putting coal employment at risk, the company is the last major employer contributing to the United Mine Workers of America’s pension plan.  With such a big development, it was no surprise that Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., quickly weighed in on Twitter. ""Murray Energy, the largest coal company in the United States, filed for bankruptcy,"" Manchin tweeted on Oct. 29, 2019.

Before last night it was projected to be insolvent by 2022.   However, we noticed a problem with how Manchin described Murray Energy. Is it really the largest coal company in the United States? Manchin’s office pointed us to a New York Times article published about the bankruptcy the same day as his tweet.

Trump’s right. Food stamp recipients in Vermont dropped 12K under his watch.
","President Donald Trump’s campaign announced in an email to Vermont media this week that it will be deploying resources to Vermont to help elect Republicans up and down the ballot in 2020.   In the email, the campaign took credit for the economic improvement the state has seen under Trump’s presidency.  It said that since he took office in 2017, Trump has added thousands of jobs across the state and given Vermonters an average tax cut of about $1,500.  It also claimed that under Trump, fewer Vermonters have had to rely on food stamps. ""President Trump has lifted the prospect of voters across Vermont, overseeing a 11,742 decline of Vermont residents on food stamps,"" the campaign wrote.  We know that Trump is in favor of restricting food stamp eligibility, and has even proposed a rule change that would cut benefits worth $7.5 million to about 5,200 households in Vermont.  But has his presidency really led to reduced demand for the benefits?  Trump’s campaign, which did not respond to a request for comment, is correct that since the president took office, Vermont has seen about 12,000 fewer people using food stamps.  When he entered the White House in January 2017, Vermont had 78,878 residents receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  In August 2019, the last month for which public data was available, that number was 67,195 — representing a drop of 11,683.  But data also show that the demand for food stamps in Vermont has been falling consistently since around 2013, when Vermont’s economy started turning a corner after the Great Recession.  At peak demand in 2013, about 100,000 Vermonters were using food stamps. By January 2017, when Trump took office, that number had already fallen to about 79,000.  Sean Brown, deputy commissioner of Vermont’s Economic Services Division, said that since 2013, when the economy took a turn for the better and jobs started returning to the state, food stamps in Vermont have seen steady decline in use.  ""That’s just been a trend that we’ve been experiencing for the last six years as the economy has improved and stayed strong,"" Brown said.  Since 2014, the steady decline in demand for SNAP benefits has been a national trend, according to Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute’s Income and Benefits Policy Center.  She said that Trump deserves some credit for the drop in Vermont and around the U.S., because the economy during his time in office has remained strong. But she said it can’t all be pinned on his presidency.   ""It’s been a continuation of a trend that’s already begun,"" Wexler said. ""Certainly the continued improvement of the economy contributes to that because more people are working and more people may have income available that would put them above that cutoff but it wouldn’t solely be related to one administration or the other.""  Erin O’Brien, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston who specializes in  U.S. social welfare policy, said that it may not just be the economy that’s leading fewer Vermonters to use food stamps.  Trump’s proposed cuts to SNAP may also be discouraging more people from using the program, she said. And she added that undocumented immigrants may be avoiding signing up for food stamps, fearing Trump’s hard-line immigration policies.  ""It’s not necessarily that people are being lifted out of poverty,"" she said. ""It’s that they’re increasingly afraid to use a government program, or they think it might be cut.""  She said that ""correlation isn’t causation,"" and that just because the demand for food stamps has fallen under Trump doesn’t mean he’s responsible for the trend.  ""Sitting presidents like to take credit for trends that predate them when they’re positive, but when it’s bad news sitting presidents are very good at blaming the last guy in office,"" she said.  Trump’s campaign is right about the numbers. About 12,000 fewer Vermonters are on food stamps now than when he first took office.  But while he may have overseen a decline of Vermonters using the program, the trend has been occurring for years, since the state rebounded from the Great Recession.  It’s true that the economy has remained strong under Trump’s presidency. But the steady drop in demand for food stamps had started long before he took office, and may not be entirely attributable to economic uplift.   We rate this claim Mostly True.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misspelled Elaine Waxman’s name.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBB6EC0>],/factchecks/2019/nov/07/donald-trump/trumps-right-food-stamp-recipients-vermont-dropped/

Facebook post mischaracterizes mental health coverage and gun access
","A recent Facebook post with a hashtag indicating support for U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid argued this point in favor of the candidate’s signature healthcare plan, Medicare for All: ""Just so we’re clear: people with pre-existing mental health conditions have access to firearms and not healthcare.""  This post, which has been shared more than 58,000 times since it was published on Aug. 4, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First, let’s look at whether people with pre-existing mental health conditions can access guns.  Federal law prohibits the purchase and possession of firearms by people with felony convictions, domestic abusers, and people with specific kinds of mental health histories. The Gun Control Act prohibits transferring a gun to a person who ""has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution,"" according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Such people are also prohibited from possessing a gun.  The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence — which advocates for a more comprehensive system for reporting mental illness and conducting background checks — states on its website that while such checks have blocked more than 3 million people in those categories from getting firearms, federal gun law generally doesn’t affect other people who public health researchers have identified as having a higher risk of being dangerous, including other people who have suffered from severe mental illness.   ""The system intended to limit access to firearms for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis still includes dangerous loopholes,"" the center says. The law center also points to a 2012 Mother Jones story. It reported that among 62 people accused in mass shootings in recent years, 38 ""displayed signs of possible mental health problems prior to the killings."" Nearly 80 percent of the perpetrators obtained their weapons legally, according to the publication.  In 2016, the New York Times detailed how people with mental illness are able to get guns. They can buy them from private sellers because federal law doesn’t require background checks for such transactions. Or, they fall under a broader category of mental illness and skirt the restrictions federal law has for people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital or deemed a ""mental defective"" by a court or other authority. Plus, mental health records are ""overwhelmingly under-reported to federal and state databases scanned during a background check,"" the story says. So while federal law prohibits people with certain kinds of mental health histories from owning a gun, there are gaps that leave room for people with severe mental illness to buy guns.  Next, let’s look at whether people with pre-existing mental health conditions can’t access health care.  The Affordable Care Act requires health plans in individual and small group markets to cover 10 essential benefits. Among them: mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral health treatment like counseling and psychotherapy.  ""Pre-existing mental and behavioral health conditions are covered, and spending limits aren’t allowed,"" reads a page on healthcare.gov covering mental health and substance abuse coverage. ""Marketplace plans can’t deny you coverage or charge you more just because you have any pre-existing condition, including mental health and substance use disorder conditions.""  Other health plans characterized as ""short-term, limited duration insurance"" — often purchased to fill in coverage gaps such as when a person is between jobs — are not required to include Obamacare’s essential benefits and can exclude pre-existing conditions from coverage or reject people entirely. The Obama administration limited these policies to just three months and regulated them so they couldn’t be renewed, NPR reported in October, but the Trump Administration has changed that; in some states, people can buy such policies that last a year and can renew them twice.  The National Alliance on Mental Illness has decried these short-term plans, saying they discriminate against mental illness. But they’re not sold on the health insurance marketplace and people can’t use federal subsidies to help pay for them. For very healthy people, these plans can be cheaper than what’s available on healthcare.gov, said Linda Blumberg an institute fellow at Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, but it’s a small segment of the overall insured population.  Job-based coverage from large employers — meaning those with more than 50 employees -— could also limit mental health coverage, Blumberg said. But since the passage of federal mental health parity laws and the Affordable Care Act, plans that offer mental health benefits must do so in a way comparable to the other medical services they cover. Today, there are still problems with accessing mental health care, Blumberg said. Some areas have a shortage of providers, for example, or providers who aren’t covered by certain insurance plans. Plus, if the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals sustains a lower court’s decision to overturn the Affordable Care Act, she said, this Facebook post could be more meaningful.  But with the exception of short-term plans, Blumberg said the claim that people with pre-existing mental health conditions don’t have access to health care isn’t correct.  Our ruling The Facebook post says people with pre-existing mental health conditions have access to firearms and not health care. There are gaps in both gun control and health care systems. But the post leaves a misleading impression that anyone with pre-existing mental health conditions can’t get health care coverage when, in reality, it’s only a slice of all health insurance plans that don’t have to comply with federal rules about pre-existing conditions.  We rate this post Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBD5340>],/factchecks/2019/nov/07/facebook-posts/Facebook-post-mischaracterizes-mental-health-guns/

Did Thom Tillis vote to let Trump administration raid $80 million from NC military projects?
","Democrats say President Trump’s border wall has raided North Carolina of $80 million for military projects with the support of the state’s Republican senator Thom Tillis.  Trump decided the money was needed because, contrary to his stump speech rallying cry, Mexico won’t foot the bill for the wall. Instead, the funds will come from military construction projects across the United States and abroad.  Trump gained access to those funds after declaring a national emergency at the southern border. Congress has voted twice — first in March and then in late September — to block the emergency declaration. But both times, Democrats were unable to secure a two-thirds majority and Trump vetoed the measures. After the most recent vote, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called out Tillis, who voted against blocking the president’s emergency declaration. The DSCC’s tweet said, ""Thom Tillis yet again voted to support Trump’s irresponsible emergency declaration — even though he knows it will allow the administration to raid $80 million from North Carolina. Tillis’ vote is putting military communities in harm’s way."" We wondered if it’s true that Tillis supported the emergency declaration and whether North Carolina actually stands to lose $80 million. Trump used the National Emergencies Act to secure border wall funding  During the 2016 campaign, President Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border and have Mexico pay for it. When Congress reached a stalemate over funding border security, Trump decided to act on his own. He declared a national emergency at the southern border, an initial step toward building the wall.  He acted under the National Emergencies Act, which authorizes the administration to ""undertake military construction projects … not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces."" The move angered some members of Congress who believed that Trump was abusing the National Emergencies Act. Tillis even wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post that said the emergency declaration ""was not the right answer.""  But when Congress voted to overturn the emergency declaration in March, Tillis sided with Trump. He voted to uphold the president’s action both times. (The reversal earned Tillis a Full Flop on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter.) On the Senate floor, he explained that he did not take issue with Trump’s action, but instead was concerned that the National Emergencies Act gives future presidents too much power. ""My main concern with this executive action is future potential abuses. I have a concern with the executive action that the president took, the emergency order. That’s why I voiced it,"" Tillis said. ""But I’m sympathetic to what he was trying to do … and I thought we could view this as an opportunity to where maybe we could have a discussion about the National Emergencies Act and potentially make a real difference here."" Tillis is a co-sponsor of the Article One Act, which was introduced days before the March vote and would automatically end emergency declarations after 30 days. The measure has stalled in the Senate since then. But in the meantime, Tillis is supporting Trump’s decision to divert funding from military bases around the world. The National Emergencies Act requires the money for the wall come from other military construction projects that have been appropriated, but not obligated, by Congress. That means the administration has to take money from dozens of projects, such as a fire and crash rescue station at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, a dining facility at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and a small arms range at Truax Field in Wisconsin. NC to lose $80 million The Pentagon listed each project affected by the national emergency at the southern border. It includes four at North Carolina military bases, and they do in fact total $80 million as the DSCC claims.  The North Carolina projects are a new battalion complex and ambulatory care center at Camp Lejeune, an elementary school at Fort Bragg, and a tanker storage facility at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. None of the projects were scheduled to break ground until 2020. But while the DSCC’s statement is accurate, there’s an important caveat. Almost $33 million of the $80 million would have been reallocated anyway because the $32.9 million Fort Bragg school project had already been canceled ""due to declining enrollment."" The construction of the school would have been canceled regardless of Trump’s emergency declaration and its funding could have been reallocated to other projects in North Carolina or elsewhere. (Fort Bragg has several urgent needs, including a $21 million fire station.) In a September town hall, Tillis acknowledged the $80 million shift in funding but said, ""Half of that was for a project at Fort Bragg that was not moving forward."" Funding for the other three projects remains uncertain, but Tillis has given assurances that Congress can replenish the money. In an op-ed in the Greensboro News & Record, Tillis wrote that Congress ""has plenty of time to re-allocate funding"" and called on other members of Congress to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act. Our ruling The DSCC said Tillis supported Trump’s emergency declaration, which enabled the administration to raid $80 million from North Carolina military projects. The group is correct that the Trump administration diverted $80 million that had been appropriated by Congress for four military projects in North Carolina. But that included an elementary school at Fort Bragg that had already been canceled.  The claim is accurate but needs additional information.

Donald Trump distorts Stacey Abrams' position on noncitizens voting
","President Donald Trump riffed on a familiar theme of accusing Democrats of wanting to give rights to undocumented immigrants, singling out Georgia’s Stacey Abrams. Speaking at a rally in Tupelo, Miss., on Nov. 1, Trump recounted how Georgia Republican Brian Kemp beat Abrams in the 2018 race for governor. ""Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this?"" Trump asked.  Trump, who has made multiple inaccurate statements about noncitizens voting, then pivoted to a broad attack on Democrats wanting to give immigrants in the country illegally free health care and even ""more advantages than our own military has."" (See a related fact-check.) Trump’s attack on Abrams does not reflect her position. Other iterations of the attack by Trump and Kemp were deemed  ""misleading,"" a ""distortion"" or ""wrong"" in fact-checks by journalists since last year. The gist of the fact-check: Abrams mentioned undocumented immigrants in a long list of groups that made up the ""blue wave"" supporting her campaign, but she never asked anyone ineligible to vote to cast a ballot. Noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections, but they can vote in some local elections in a few jurisdictions. When asked by a reporter earlier this year during a discussion of municipal voting rights if she would support noncitizens voting in some cases, Abrams made a distinction between municipal elections and federal elections, and she said she wasn't arguing for it but ""wouldn’t oppose it."" The Trump campaign pointed to a comment Abrams made Oct. 9, 2018, in front of supporters at a campaign event. Abrams was speaking about the diversity of the ""blue wave,"" referring to a groundswell of Democratic voters. Abrams said: ""The blue wave is African American. It’s white, it’s Latino, it’s Asian, Pacific Islander. It is disabled. It is differently abled. It is LGBTQ. It is law enforcement. It is veterans. It is made up of those who have been told they are not worthy of being here. It is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented. It is made up of those who have been told they’re successful and those that have been told they are left behind. But the real wave is when we come together and we tell Georgia we are here and we are not going anywhere."" Abrams didn’t actually say she wanted undocumented immigrants to cast ballots for her, which would have been illegal.  A few days later, a clip of Abrams’ comments was publicized by the Washington Free Beacon and then spread to other media. Over the next few weeks, Abrams and her campaign argued she wasn’t calling for ineligible voters to cast ballots. ""I've never once argued for anyone who is not legally allowed to vote in the state of Georgia to be allowed to vote,"" Abrams said. ""What I said that day is that this is a state that should be looking out for everyone in our state, and I would hope that anyone running for governor should believe in all of Georgia."" Kemp pounced on her comments in an interview on Fox News and later said during a debate that Abrams had ""called on illegals"" to vote for her. Abrams disputed his characterization and criticized the state’s ""exact match"" law that placed the registrations of tens of thousands of voters on hold, largely of African Americans. ""I am one of the foremost experts in the state on expansion of voting rights,"" she said. ""I have never in my life asked for anyone who was not legally eligible to vote to be able to cast a ballot."" A spokeswoman for Abrams’ organization, Fair Fight Action, told PolitiFact that Abrams was referring to the resistance against Trump, including his administration’s policies on immigration. ""Undocumented people are a part of that resistance, because they deserve human dignity that Donald Trump is trying to take away,"" said spokesman Seth Bringman. The Trump campaign also pointed to comments Abrams made in January 2019 during an interview on PBS when she was asked about her view on cities allowing some noncitizens to vote in local elections. Abrams sounded open to the reasons for a noncitizen voting in a local election but said she was ""not arguing for it or against it.""  ""I think there’s a difference between municipal and state and federal,"" she said. ""Part of municipality — I’m not arguing for it or against it, but I will say, having been deputy city attorney, there’s a very — the granularity of what cities decide is so specific, as to, I think, allow for people to be participants in the process without it somehow undermining our larger democratic ethic that says that you should be a citizen to be a part of the conversation."" The reporter followed up: ""So, in some cases, you would be supportive of noncitizens voting?"" ""I wouldn’t be — I wouldn’t oppose it,"" Abrams said. Trump said, ""Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote."" Trump’s attack on Abrams is overly broad. In her unsuccessful bid for governor, Abrams spoke about the diversity of the ""blue wave"" in Georgia and mentioned a long list of groups including undocumented immigrants. She didn’t say they should be given the right to vote, and that has not been her documented position.  Later, Abrams said she ""wouldn’t oppose"" noncitizens voting in municipal elections, but she specified that it was different from state or federal races. It would be possible for listeners to wrongly assume from Trump’s claim that Abrams wants noncitizens to vote in all elections.  This statement rates Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC678CC0>],/factchecks/2019/nov/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-distorts-stacey-abrams-comments-ab/

Steil errs comparing Donald Trump impeachment rights to Clinton, Nixon
","For the third time in the last 50 years, Congress is taking steps toward impeaching the president. Democrats had long talked about impeachment over a variety of matters, but did not launch proceedings until a whistleblower report raised concerns over Trump seeking a Ukrainian investigation of Joe Biden, a key rival in the 2020 presidential race. The first vote on impeachment came Oct. 31, 2019, when the U.S. House of Representatives established rules for how the process would proceed. The measure passed 232 to 196 over unanimous Republican opposition. The move drew an expected array of criticism from Republicans. A freshman lawmaker from Wisconsin zeroed in on the protections given to Trump. ""Today’s resolution does not provide the president with due process protections that were afforded to both President Clinton and President Nixon,"" U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Janesville, said in a tweet the day the rules passed. He was far from the only person to compare the Trump push to past impeachment proceedings, which makes this a good time for a history lesson. Did past presidents get impeachment protections that Democrats are refusing to afford Trump? The impeachment process is complex, and the committee procedures used change a bit each time it is used, but there are two basic elements. The House investigates the president and decides whether to issue formal articles of impeachment (similar to the role of police and prosecutor in the criminal justice system). Those charges then go to the U.S. Senate, which decides whether to convict (similar to a jury). Steil is comparing Trump to the last two presidents to face impeachment. Bill Clinton was impeached by the House in 1998, formally accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of his affair with a 22-year-old White House intern. Clinton served out his term when the U.S. Senate ultimately acquitted him. Richard Nixon was not actually impeached. The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment in July 1974 and sent them to the full House for consideration. But Nixon resigned in August 1974 after the Supreme Court forced him to release incriminating White House tapes, leaving office before the House could vote. The only other president to be impeached was Andrew Johnson in 1868, amid a showdown with Congress over appointments for Secretary of War. The Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction, so Johnson served out his term. In Trump’s case, rules passed by the House split the impeachment responsibilities between the Intelligence and Judiciary committees. The Intelligence Committee conducts the investigation, while the Judiciary then assesses whether those findings add up to an impeachable offense. Sally Fox, a Steil spokeswoman, acknowledged the due process protections laid out for Trump before the Judiciary are ""similar"" to those afforded Nixon and Clinton. But she pointed to two elements that she said supported Steil’s claim that Trump’s protections are diminished. 1) Though Trump and his attorneys can see and question witnesses before the Judiciary Committee, he is not able to do so for the Intelligence Committee proceedings. Fox said this is troubling to Steil since the Intelligence Committee isn’t required to transmit all material to the Judiciary Committee, so Trump will only see information that is forwarded for the Judiciary to use in making its decision. 2) The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is given the power to eliminate Trump’s due process protections if the president is deemed uncooperative. We’ll examine those one at a time. Steil is objecting to Trump not having the same protections before the Intelligence Committee that past presidents had before impeachment committees, but experts say this is the first time a House committee has filled such an investigative role. ""It doesn't make sense to say that President Clinton and President Nixon were given those opportunities in that parallel stage of those impeachment inquiries, because there wasn't any preliminary hearing before another committee in those inquiries,"" Stanford law professor Dave Sklansky said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""The closest analogy in the Clinton impeachment proceedings to what the House Intelligence Committee is now doing was the work of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the federal grand jury he convened."" And Clinton, of course, did not participate in Starr’s investigation, which took place outside the House. Just as Nixon wasn’t involved in the investigation preceding his impeachment proceedings. Sarah Binder, professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institute, called it an apples and oranges comparison.  ""I think it's fair to think of the (Intelligence Committee) investigation as the rough equivalent to those behind-closed-door Clinton and Nixon investigations,"" Binder said in an email. In other words, those presidents didn’t have any due process protections at that stage that are now withheld from Trump. Steil’s team is correct that the ability to punish Trump for a lack of cooperation is novel, Binder said. Here’s the description of that point from the Congressional Record: Should the President unlawfully refuse to make witnesses available for testimony to, or to produce documents requested by, the investigative committees ... the chair shall have the discretion to impose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the President or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses. But Binder questioned whether it’s fair to summarize that as not having due process protections. ""It doesn't per se mean … that President Trump has fewer procedural protections than did his predecessors,"" Binder said in an email. ""It does mean that should the president fail to cooperate, he could be penalized by the committee for such behavior."" Experts also question whether it’s reasonable to refer to any of Trump’s protections during the House proceedings as ""due process."" Here’s the breakdown from PolitiFact National. They rated as False a claim from Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., that Trump was being denied ""due process accorded every American."" Graham’s claim that Trump has been denied due process — a claim he has repeated on Twitter and in Congress — does not square with the law or the way impeachment works. If such rights apply at all, they would be granted to Trump during the trial phase, which the Constitution says takes place in the Senate. The House’s job is to determine whether there’s enough evidence to show that the president committed an impeachable offense. ""It is only after charges have been filed and the case has reached the trial stage that criminal defendants have the right to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, have access to evidence, and have counsel present,"" said former federal prosecutor and Stanford Law professor David Sklansky, adding that the due process complaint is ""not a good argument."" Writing for Reason, Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said due process rights are protected in ""situations where an individual stands to lose her ‘life, liberty, or property,’ none of which is at risk here."" The Constitution says that the House ""shall have the sole Power of Impeachment"" and the Senate ""shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments."" Steil said Trump isn’t being afforded the ""due process protections"" that presidents Clinton and Nixon received in their impeachment proceedings since he can’t participate in the Intelligence Committee phase and can lose his protections before the Judiciary Committee if he doesn’t cooperate. But the Intelligence Committee claim doesn’t hold up since that body is filling a unique investigative role. The closest analog from past impeachments is the investigative work done before the matter even reached the House — and Clinton and Nixon had no role or protection during those. The potential for Trump to lose protections if he doesn’t cooperate is indeed unique this time, but it doesn’t inherently limit Trump. It just imposes consequences if the President fails to cooperate with the inquiry. What’s more, the House is only the investigative side of an impeachment inquiry; the trial side — where due process more directly applies —  is handled in the Senate. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE395C0>],/factchecks/2019/nov/05/bryan-steil/steil-errs-comparing-trump-clinton-nixon-impeachme/

Fact-checking Pete Buttigieg on the success of Democratic presidential nominees in last 50 years
","Pete Buttigieg entered the 2020 presidential race as one of the lesser-known faces — and without many people knowing how to even pronounce his last name. But the South Bend, Ind., mayor recently suggested that those attributes might work to his party’s advantage, saying that historically, it’s worked out for Democrats to nominate newcomers to the national scene for president. After Buttigieg filed to be on New Hampshire’s presidential primary ballot, a reporter asked him whether stumbles and gaffes by fellow candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden were a ""troublesome sign."" Buttigieg said Democrats needed to turn the page and ""build up a new normal."" ""I'll also say when it comes to electability, every single time my party has won the presidency in the last 50 years, it’s been with a candidate who was new on the national scene, hadn’t spent a lot of time in Washington, and represented a new generation of leadership,"" Buttigieg said Oct. 30. ""By contrast, every single time in the last 50 years we have put forward the most Washington-oriented candidate, we have come up short in November."" NEW: After filing for #FITN - @PeteButtigieg -asked about @joebiden - tells @foxnewspolitics""in order to win, we need to put forward a candidate who can demonstrate the readiness to lead this country forward..it’s not as simple as going back to normal"" #2020Election pic.twitter.com/IyiPdLo6eI We wondered if Buttigieg was right that when Democrats have won the presidency in the last 50 years, it has been with a fresh face in Washington. It’s important to note that what happened in past elections doesn’t determine future outcomes. But when we looked back at past elections, we found Buttigieg was more accurate than not.  Buttigieg’s campaign said his claim references presidential elections since 1972. (Going back 50 years takes us to 1969, when there was no election. In 1968, Republican nominee Richard Nixon beat Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey, who was then vice president and had served in the U.S. Senate.) Since 1972, three Democratic presidential nominees have won elections: Jimmy Carter in 1976; Bill Clinton in 1992 (re-elected in 1996); and Barack Obama in 2008 (re-elected in 2012). Is it accurate to characterize them as ""new on the national scene"" when they were elected? Generally, yes, but with some caveats, political science experts told PolitiFact. For starters, Buttigieg’s claim makes sense if it’s understood to be about Democratic races when a candidate is running for the first time and not for re-election, said Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.  Incumbent presidents are not new on the national scene or to Washington, and re-election campaigns are subject to different dynamics. Political parties tend to back an incumbent seeking an additional term. ""Setting aside instances where an incumbent president is running for re-election, Democrats in the modern era have fared better when nominating new faces rather than Washington insiders,"" said Barry Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Carter served as governor of Georgia before being elected president in 1976. He had not held elected federal office.  ""It is worth noting that Carter's presidency was seen as less than successful in part because of his outsider status in the party,"" said Casey Dominguez, who teaches American politics at the University of San Diego. Carter lost his re-election bid in 1980 to Republican challenger Ronald Reagan. ""Carter was certainly more of an establishment figure in 1980 than in 1976,"" Burden said. Before his election in 1992, Clinton had not held elected federal office, either.  That said, including Clinton among those who were ""new on the national scene"" is somewhat debatable, Rauch said. By 1992, Clinton had been governor of Arkansas for more than a decade and had chaired the National Governors Association and the Democratic Leadership Council. Clinton ""was well known in Democratic party leadership circles, so under some definitions of 'the national scene,’ he might not count as an entirely new face,"" Dominguez said. Experts agreed that although Obama was a U.S. senator by the time of his 2008 election, it is reasonable to consider him a candidate who was new on the national scene.  Obama had not completed his first term in the Senate and was not well known nationally beyond his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. His primary challenger in 2008 was Hillary Clinton, an establishment figure. Michael Dukakis, a governor from Massachusetts who had never held elected federal office, won the Democratic party’s nomination in 1988. He lost the general presidential election to the Republican nominee, George H. W. Bush. Buttigieg’s campaign acknowledged that Dukakis was unsuccessful in his bid for the White House even though he had not spent time in Washington. But Buttigieg didn’t say Democrats won every time they nominated someone who was not from Washington, said Chris Meagher, Buttigieg’s national press secretary. ""He said every time we have won, it's been someone new on the scene,"" Meagher said. ""And every time we've put forward the most Washington-oriented, we have come up short."" Other Democratic nominees in the last 50 years who spent years in Washington and failed to win the presidency included senators and vice presidents. Those presidential candidates were U.S. Sen. George McGovern (lost in 1972); former vice president Walter Mondale (lost in 1984); vice president Al Gore (lost in 2000); U.S. Sen. John Kerry (lost in 2004); and former U.S. Sen. and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton (lost in 2016). ""Frankly, there have been too few modern Democratic nominees to really test any specific claims about candidate age or 'outsider-status' on a candidate's chance of winning,"" said Dominguez, the professor at the University of San Diego.  ""Thinking about the voters, one would have to look at initial poll standing to get a sense of how new each of these candidates was to the voters at large,"" Dominguez said. For example, while Kerry had a long career in the Senate, it’s not clear how well known he was to the national electorate. Based on analysis of voter behavior, Dominguez said, ""candidate qualities do not seem to be the main driver of voter decision-making in the general election."" ""Outsider candidates tend to be younger than establishment candidates,"" Burden said. ""But it is not clear if hailing from outside the Washington system is what matters or representing a different generational perspective."" Buttigieg said, ""When it comes to electability, every single time my party has won the presidency in the last 50 years, it’s been with a candidate who was new on the national scene, hadn’t spent a lot of time in Washington, and represented a new generation of leadership."" What happened in past elections doesn’t determine future outcomes. But looking back at the past 50 years, three Democratic presidential nominees have been elected: Carter, Clinton, and Obama. Before their election, Carter and Clinton served as governors but not in Congress. Obama was a relatively new U.S. senator who wasn’t widely known nationally before his presidential election. However, political scientists say that while Clinton had not held elected federal office, he was well known in national Democratic circles, having chaired the National Governors Association and the Democratic Leadership Council.   Buttigieg’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

In both cases, law enforcement told the news outlets that while dialing 112 in the United States can sometimes redirect callers to 911, it does not result in any special handling of one’s emergency call. A sergeant told Fox that because several wireless carriers sell cell phones in both the United States and overseas, they convert the emergency number dialed to the appropriate local emergency number.

Surgeon general: Pot has a 'unique' impact on the developing brain
","Speaking about a recent federal advisory on marijuana, Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, put a new spin on long-standing admonitions about the drug. ""Marijuana has a unique impact on the developing brain. It can prime your brain for addiction to other substances,"" Adams said at a substance abuse conference sponsored by Oxford House, a recovery center network. This is a reiteration of the old ""gateway"" argument: the idea that marijuana is frequently an entree to using other, harder drugs. And the surgeon general’s emphasis comes just as many states are loosening restrictions around its medicinal and adult recreational use. But marijuana research is limited, and this particular hypothesis is fairly controversial. We decided to put Adams’ claim to the test. Is his central thesis –  marijuana has a ""unique impact"" on developing brains and can ""prime your brain for addiction"" – accurate? We contacted the surgeon general’s office, which directed us to statements from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. NIDA noted that marijuana may have a gateway effect, but that most people who use the drug don’t progress to other, harder substances; and that alcohol and nicotine appear to have a similar impact. But the surgeon general’s office was also unequivocal on a related point: ""From a public health perspective, no amount of drug use is safe for the developing brain."" So how fair is Adams’ statement? When we interviewed experts, the responses were all over the map – reflecting just how contested this issue is and how difficult it is to speak definitively about marijuana’s impact. The gateway effect? The idea that marijuana can ""prime your brain for addiction"" has some basis: namely, the results of some studies conducted with rodents. There are findings to suggest that early exposure to the drug may ""sensitize animals to the effects of other drugs,"" noted Joshua Isen, an assistant professor at the University of South Alabama, who researches adolescent marijuana use. For instance, Adams’ office noted that preclinical studies indicate exposure to THC – marijuana’s main psychoactive compound –  during a period roughly equivalent to adolescence in rats resulted in greater self-administration of heroin when the animals reach adulthood. In addition, THC exposure yielded changes in their brains’ reward system – in other words, yes, priming the brain for the rewarding effects of opioids.  But, Isen said, it’s scientifically problematic to draw a line from the effects seen in rodents to what might be happening to a human. Ethical considerations about human research make it more or less impossible to do a randomized controlled trial – the gold standard of scientific research – that would measure how marijuana does or doesn’t affect a still-developing brain. ""We should remain agnostic about the surgeon general’s claim,"" Isen argued. Other experts suggested otherwise, saying that since animal research is the best we can get, it’s worth taking seriously – and it is fairly conclusive. Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa., took a more optimistic view of that research, arguing that the animal evidence is ""very clear"" when it comes to marijuana’s neurological impact. He called it a fair basis for the surgeon general’s warning. ""What we know is strong enough to say that exposure during adolescence when the brain is developing is a risk,"" said Susan Weiss, a scientific adviser to the NIDA director. But how meaningful of a risk – and how it compares to other drugs – is exceptionally tough to say, given the limitations on research. Studies on actual humans are limited because people who use marijuana at a young age may be exposed to other risk factors, such as peer influences using harder drugs, or sociodemographic factors that might predispose them to abuse or addiction. As Dr. Sue Sisley, an Arizona-based psychiatrist who tracks the state of marijuana research, put it: ""I don’t see very much good, rigorous data to confirm either way."" What about uniqueness? In the most narrow sense, marijuana indeed has a ""unique"" effect on the brain. It elicits a response from what are called ""endocannabinoid receptors."" Other drugs don’t – they interact with different brain receptors. So, certainly, marijuana affects development using a different (or ""unique"") neurological mechanism than the ones used by, say, nicotine or alcohol. And, as best as science can tell us, marijuana harms developing brains, both Weiss and Sisley said. From a common sense, public health perspective, young people in particular should be exceptionally cautious when it comes to using the drug. But – and this is important context – marijuana is not the only substance that has this potential ""priming"" for subsequent addiction. The surgeon general’s office acknowledged this finding when we asked follow-up questions. That same context, though, is missing from Adams’ public statement. ""It seems that early exposure to many substances can make it likely someone will be addicted to other substances,"" Weiss said. She acknowledged that rodent studies do also suggest nicotine may have a priming effect, albeit via a different neurological route. On a practical level, Isen said, while one could highlight the distinct scientific effect marijuana has, ""there is no evidence that marijuana has a uniquely deleterious effect on the developing brain - certainly not more than other substances such as alcohol."" Our ruling Speaking about the risks associated with marijuana, the surgeon general said it ""has a unique impact on the developing brain"" and ""can prime your brain for addiction to other substances."" The implications are tricky, and it’s important to note the significant limitations on marijuana research, as well as how it compares to other drugs. It may have its own, unique mechanism of ""priming"" adult addiction. Still, other substances have similar effects – even if they take a different brain path to get there. And since this idea about marijuana’s priming effect is central to Adams’ broader public health campaign, emphasizing that nicotine and alcohol also could function in this manner matters even more. This statement is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details and context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8C8780>],/factchecks/2019/nov/05/jerome-adams/surgeon-general-pot-has-unique-impact-developing-b/

No, Bill Cosby wasn’t framed for sexual assault to stop him from buying NBC
","Actor and comedian Bill Cosby was convicted on three counts of felony sexual assault in April 2018 after a jury found him guilty of drugging and assaulting a woman in 2004. She was one of 60 women who publicly accused Cosby of rape, sexual assault or harassment over the years. He was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison and is currently incarcerated. But one conspiracy theory that’s persisted in recent years claims that Cosby was framed by the Illuminati, alleged to be a secret society of elites that control the world’s affairs. The rumor has been making the rounds on the internet since at least 2016 and continues to be shared on social media.  We came across one version of the story that’s been shared on Facebook over 1,800 times. The account was posted on a Wordpress blog called ""Governmental Services Corporation Watch"" in June 2017 and is identical to another story that was posted (and is now deleted) by News Punch, a website that’s been associated with spreading fake news stories and conspiracy theories.  The story says that a ""Hollywood insider"" came forward and alleged that Cosby was ""framed with rape allegations in order to prevent him from buxying TV network NBC.""  ""Cosby, known as ‘America’s Dad’, is standing trial for aggravated sexual assault in Pittsburgh, and has responded to allegations that he drugged and sexually abused women with fierce denials. The Hollywood insider says that Bill Cosby became such a threat to the establishment elite that they had to invent the vilest of accusations against him in order to destroy his career. The accusers are women who have worked with the Illuminati in the past and were paid to state they are victims of rape. Only one of Cosby’s accusers leveled accusations against him within the statute of limitations (12 years), and the others, according to the Hollywood insider, are opportunists who have been paid off to smear Cosby’s reputation and destroy his career."" The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The account lacks corroborating evidence and does not include any sources besides the unnamed ""Hollywood insider."" The article further diminishes in credibility by claiming that the ""Illuminati"" is behind framing Cosby. While there was a secret group called the Bavarian Illuminati that operated from 1776 to 1785 that sought to empower a small group of people to be influential world leaders, there is no evidence it exists today. Yet the group is often implicated by conspiracy theorists of being the masterminds behind government dealings, the media and major events. These theories have long been discredited and debunked.  It is accurate that Cosby was reportedly interested in purchasing NBC in the early 1990s from its owner at the time, General Electric. But that was more than 20 years before the accusations against Cosby started to surface publicly. We reviewed Nexis news archives for coverage of Cosby’s efforts to buy the network, and found that talk of any possible deal appears to have dissipated after 1993, when the Associated Press characterized Cosby’s interest as ""short-lived.""  The New York Times also said that the asking price for NBC at the time was likely to be around $4 billion when Cosby’s net worth was estimated at $300 million. A 1993 Vanity Fair article said, because of this, Cosby was willing to team up with others but the offer was declined twice by Brandon Tartikoff, the network’s president at the time. An internet rumor posted on multiple blogs says that Cosby was framed for sexual assault by the Illuminati to keep him from buying NBC. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. Credible news coverage indicates Cosby was interested in purchasing the network in the early 1990s – decades before he was publicly accused of sexual assault – but no deal was made.  We rate this Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE60780>],/factchecks/2019/nov/04/facebook-posts/no-bill-cosby-wasnt-framed-sexual-assault-stop-him/

Subpoenas vs. bills: What this CNN pundit got wrong
","CNN commentator Mike Shields took aim at House Democrats during a recent on-air panel, claiming they have spent more time pursuing President Donald Trump’s impeachment than legislating. ""The Democrats are frittering away their majority,"" said Shields, the former chief of staff for the Republican National Committee and founder of the communications firm Convergence Media, in an Oct. 31 appearance on CNN. ""They have issued more subpoenas than they’ve passed bills."" Shields’ claim parrots a similar attack that has made the rounds among conservative pundits and Republican lawmakers as the House continues its probe into Trump’s actions on Ukraine. The claim has roots in an Oct. 22 article from the Washington Times, which said that under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats have issued 56 subpoenas while passing just 46 bills that went on to become laws.  But while other Republicans specified that the Washington Times article counted congressional subpoenas against House bills that were ultimately signed into law, Shields was less precise, instead comparing subpoenas issued to bills passed.  In fact, House Democrats have helped pass more than 500 bills and resolutions, although many have not made their way to Trump’s desk. When we reached out to Shields, he said he ""misspoke,"" and he later clarified his point on Twitter.  ""I meant to say more subpoenas than laws that have been passed, not bills,"" he told us.   Mea Culpa - I misspoke on @TheLeadCNN yesterday when I said House Democrats have issued more subpoenas than they have passed bills. It's more subpoenas than they have had laws *passed/signed*. Still a valid point about their wasted majority but want to be accurate https://t.co/I1k5aMe3no Even this revised claim gives a misleading impression, however. Experts said it’s meaningless to compare subpoenas with House bills enacted into law, because while a committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, there are more hurdles when it comes to legislation. The Washington Times counted 56 publicly acknowledged subpoenas that House Democrats issued between the start of their majority and the article’s Oct. 22 publication, including 15 related to the impeachment inquiry. The report’s authors did not respond to requests for comment, but their subpoena tally lines up with what other news outlets have reported. By our count, the House has subpoenaed at least 24 people to date as part of the impeachment inquiry.  Pelosi spokesperson Ashley Etienne said she believes the House has issued approximately 47 in total, adding that many were due to ""stonewalling of the current administration and Trump’s posture of refusing to respond to congressional requests, inquiries and subpoenas."" Etienne also pointed out that during President Bill Clinton’s administration, Republicans in the majority issued more than 1,000 subpoenas. The Washington Times said the House has introduced and passed 46 bills-turned-laws since Democrats took over in January. According to Congress.gov, that’s accurate: There are 43 bills and 3 joint resolutions that originated in the House, passed the Senate and were signed into law by Trump. But Josh Tauberer, president of GovTrack.us, a nonpartisan website that tracks government and congressional data, said the number of House bills that become law is not a reliable indicator of how hard the House is working to legislate. That’s because bills are often introduced in pairs, with the House and Senate each proposing their own versions. ""But which one is enacted is up to chance and doesn't indicate that only legislators in one chamber put in any effort,"" Tauberer said. Not only that, but the text of a bill is often replaced as it goes through the legislative process, meaning ""the chamber that a bill originated in, and a bill's original sponsor, may have no connection to the substance of the bill when it is enacted,"" he said. This year, the House and Senate have combined to pass 66 bills that earned Trump’s signature, according to Congress.gov. But Tauberer said Pelosi’s House has voted on about 1,200 pages of new law and roughly 200 unique legislative proposals that ended up in those enacted laws.  Experts said the biggest problem with the subpoenas-to-bills comparison is the lack of attention it pays to the Senate’s role in sending House-backed bills to the president’s desk. ""The House can't pass ‘bills into law’ by itself,"" said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. According to Congress.gov, the House has passed or agreed to 522 bills and resolutions since January. But the Senate hasn’t acted on many of them. In July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., vowed to block Democrats’ progressive policy proposals, telling an audience to ""think of me as the grim reaper."" The GOP doesn’t have the same blocking power when it comes to subpoenas, however.  ""We are talking about two completely different processes,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Washington think tank. ""A committee chairman can unilaterally issue a subpoena, whereas it takes a majority of House members and senators to enact a law. The latter is a much bigger hump to surmount."" Of course, Shields’ botched version of the comparison is even more wrong, since he originally said there have been more subpoenas than bills passed, which simply isn’t true. Shields said Democrats ""have issued more subpoenas than they’ve passed bills."" That’s wrong, and Shields clarified his point on Twitter. But the claim that House Democrats are responsible for more subpoenas than bills passed into law is also misleading, since it compares two very different processes.

Kamala Harris didn’t say Democrats are ‘coming for’ Trump supporters in 2020
","A quote from Sen. Kamala Harris attacking supporters of President Donald Trump has been widely shared on social media. But it’s made-up. The quote, which was published Oct. 29  and Nov. 2 on Facebook, makes it look like Harris, a Democratic senator running for president in 2020, threatened people who voted for Trump in 2016. The quote reads: ""And once he’s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions, because we’ll be coming for you next. You will feel the vengeance of a nation. No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation. For it is you who have betrayed us."" The post, which has been shared more than 700 times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Harris is not shy about her disdain for the Trump administration. But the popular Facebook quote is fake. The bottom of the Facebook image has ""Warriorcode.us"" written across it. Warriorcode.us is a website that sells pro-gun apparel. One of the site’s Facebook pages published the same photo Oct. 24. It later edited the post to acknowledge that the quote was made-up. It appears the post originated in an Aug. 7 story from Bustatroll.org, a satirical site known for publishing made-up political stories. Its owner, Christopher Blair, operates several similar sites with the goal of fooling conservatives into sharing bogus content. The article fabricated a speech in which Harris said she would round up Trump supporters if Democrats won the White House in 2020. We could find no evidence that Harris ever made such a speech. While the Bustatroll.org story includes several disclosures that its content is satirical, the Facebook post does not. Commenters took the quote at face value. The Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDEA600>],/factchecks/2019/nov/04/facebook-posts/kamala-harris-didnt-say-democrats-are-coming-trump/
