COVID has struck Florida harder than Virginia, contrary to Pete Snyder's claim
","Virginia could learn a lot from Florida about battling COVID-19, says Pete Snyder, a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the Old Dominion. Snyder has been accusing Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, of hurting businesses by keeping the state under COVID restrictions. He says Northam should have followed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who refused to order mask wearing and, in September 2020, generally lifted all restrictions. Snyder, during a March 12 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond, recalled how DeSantis was criticized in spring 2020 for taking a reckless approach to COVID. ""Nearly a year later, there is no discernible difference between the spread and deaths of COVID in Virginia than there is in Florida,"" Snyder said, adding that Virginia’s economy ""is in the tank"" because of Northam’s ""horrendous"" policies. We fact-checked Snyder’s statement that there’s ""no discernible difference"" between the two states in COVID spread and deaths - a claim he also made during a Feb. 25 radio interview on WCHV in Charlottesville.  Snyder’s campaign said his information came from the ""COVID Data Tracker"" kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our review of the data, however, found Florida has had significantly higher COVID case and death rates than Virginia since spring 2020. Because Snyder used the time frame of ""nearly a year,"" we compared the states from the starting point of the CDC’s data on April 1, 2020 to the date of Snyder’s WRVA claim on March 12, 2021. During that span, Florida had 8,994 COVID cases per 100,000 people, and Virginia had 6,954 cases per 100,000. Florida’s per capita caseload was 29% higher than Virginia’s.  During the same span, Florida saw 150 deaths per 100,000 people, compared 117 per 100,000 in Virginia. Florida’s death rate was 28% higher than Virginia’s.  Put another way, Virginia had 593,562 COVID cases during the time span. Florida’s per capita rate would have meant an additional 173,900 cases in Virginia. Virginia had totaled 9,985 COVID deaths when Snyder made his WRVA statement. Florida’s per capita rate would have meant an additional 2,820 deaths in Virginia.  So, contrary to Snyder’s claim, Florida has seen discernibly higher COVID case and death rates than Virginia during the last 12 months.  On the day of Snyder’s statement, Virginia had the 9th lowest cumulative per capita case rate; Florida ranked 22nd among states. Virginia had the 13th lowest COVID death rate; Florida ranked 24th. The only change to the rankings if we carry them out to this writing on March 29 is that Virginia has moved up one spot, to 8th, in per capita deaths.  More perspective Most of the 12-month gap between the two states came in July and August 2020 when the virus raged in Florida and eased in Virginia. During the two months, Florida’s case rate was three times higher than Virginia and its death rate was nearly four times higher. Over  the other 10 months, Florida’s case and death rates were 6% higher than Virginia’s.  DeSantis lifted almost all restrictions on Sept. 25, 2020, winning praise from many conservatives, including former President Donald Trump. Since then, DeSantis has boasted that Florida has much lower COVID case rates than ""locked down"" states, a claim PolitiFact National rated Half True in November 2020. Social media has been rife with comparisons of Florida’s record to other states - particularly New York, the first state to be slammed by COVID. Virginia has continued to restrict the number of people in restaurants and at public events. Although Northam is slowly easing the limits, he plans to carry them into April.  From Sept. 25 to March 12 (the day of Snyder’s statement), Florida’s COVID case rate was 10% higher than Virginia’s; it’s COVID death rate was 6% higher.   Perils of Comparisons Although it has become politically popular to compare state COVID statistics, disease experts have told PolitiFact it offers poor guidance on whether a state should end or keep restrictions. Each state has its own demographics, climate and economy which may, at times, put it more or less at risk. For example, Florida’s warm weather made it easier for people to eat and gather outdoors during the fall and winter. The same lifting of restrictions would not have been as safe in colder states, including Virginia, where people tend to gather inside and face more risk of COVID exposure. It’s also important to remember that states aren’t walled-off jurisdictions. During much of the pandemic, Florida has been open to tourists, which means we don’t know whether coronavirus transmission within Florida is increasing infections in other states after those tourists return home, according to Marissa Levine, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. Our ruling Snyder recounted criticism of DeSantis in April 2020 when the Florida governor resisted some COVID restrictions, including mandatory mask wearing. ""Nearly a year later, there is no discernible difference between the spread and deaths of COVID in Virginia that there is in Florida,"" Snyder said. In fact, there are easily discernible differences between that April and March 12,2021, when Snyder made his statement. Florida’s cumulative COVID case rate was 29% higher than Virginia’s; its cumulative death rate from the virus was 28% higher. So, we rate Snyder’s statement False.  ",/factchecks/2021/mar/30/pete-snyder/covid-has-struck-florida-harder-virginia-contrary-/

Fact-checking number of people killed by rifles and by people in US illegally
","The day after the Boulder, Colo., shooting that killed 10 people, President Joe Biden called on Congress to enact legislation to revive a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines.  A Facebook post suggests the administration is overreacting to gun killings, while being too lax with its border control policies. ""Less than 500 people a year killed by all rifles combined. Let’s ban them,"" the post said, above a picture of an assault-style gun. ""4000 a year killed by illegals. Let’s give them assistance and register them to vote and keep the border WIDE OPEN.""  The claim, originally posted in March 2019 but widely reshared after the mass shootings in Boulder and a few days earlier in Atlanta, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post wildly exaggerates Biden administration policy on both guns and immigration. Biden’s proposal would ban certain semi-automatic rifles classified as assault weapons — not all rifles. And neither he nor his allies in Congress have proposed keeping the border wide open or allowing immigrants who are in the country illegally to register to vote. But for this fact-check, we’re looking at the accuracy of the numbers the Facebook post cites in arguing for stricter border enforcement over stricter gun control.  Fewer than 500 people were murdered with a rifle in each of the past three years, according to the latest annual FBI statistics available. No national statistics are kept on the number of people killed by people who are in the country illegally. But the available figures indicate the number is far below the 4,000 per year claimed. One estimate puts it at about 300. It’s important to note that this claim compares two different things: killings with a type of weapon vs. killings by a category of people. The FBI’s latest annual figures show there were 10,258 murders committed with guns in 2019, including 364 with rifles. The number for rifles was 297 in 2018 and 403 in 2017. That includes various kinds of long guns, including AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles involved in many deadly mass shootings over the past decade.  We found no evidence to support the claim about 4,000 killings a year by people in the country illegally. There are no national crime statistics that are broken down by immigration status. For a rough estimate of the numbers, we looked at administrative arrests by the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. These are arrests of people who were either present in the U.S. illegally or had somehow violated the terms of their entry or status in the country. Many such arrests occur after local law enforcement officials do background checks on people they have arrested for crimes, said ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2020, ICE made a total of 103,603 administrative arrests. It said 90% of those arrests were for immigrants with a history of criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. The criminal histories included 1,837 offenses involving homicide — 1,468 convictions and pending 369 charges. In the previous year, the total was 1,923 — 1,549 convictions and 374 pending charges. But the combined offenses noted in those two years didn’t necessarily involve homicide cases from those years. They were people who had been charged with or convicted of homicide in the United States at some time in the past — ICE data doesn’t indicate when. So the claim of 4,000 homicides a year is not supported by ICE data. Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that in Texas, which does track immigration status in crimes, 42 immigrants in the country illegally were convicted of committing a total of 50 homicides in 2019. If those numbers were representative of the country overall, he estimated, about 294 homicides would have been committed by immigrants in the country illegally in 2019. A widely recirculated Facebook post claimed: ""Less than 500 people a year killed by all rifles combined"" and ""4,000 a year killed by illegals.""  The latest FBI figures show there were 364 murders committed with rifles in 2019.  No national crime statistics are kept on the number of people killed by people who are in the country illegally. One estimate based on Texas data puts the national number at under 300. In fiscal 2020, ICE arrested people on immigration violations whose criminal histories included 1,837 homicide convictions or charges sometime in the past, but its data doesn’t say when the killings or convictions occurred. The post contains only an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/mar/30/facebook-posts/fact-checking-number-people-killed-rifles-and-peop/

No evidence suspected mass shooter bought gun illegally or entered US illegally
","A Facebook user made several claims about Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, the man charged with the Boulder, Colo. mass shooting.

""Just found this about the Colorado shooting share it before it disappears"" reads text above a photo of bloodied and nearly naked Alissa being taken into custody by two officers.

However, there is no evidence that he entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico or that he bought a gun illegally. Alissa’s religious background On March 22, a gunman walked into a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, a college town northwest of Denver, and opened fire. Ten people were killed in the shooting, including one police officer. Police arrested Alissa, 21, in connection with the attack, during which he was shot through his right leg. Alissa’s brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN that their family emigrated from Syria to the U.S. in 2002, and court records and Alissa’s Facebook page said that he was born in 1999 in Syria, a majority-Muslim country. Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN that in high school bullies made fun of Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa’s name and for being Muslim. The Washington Post reported that Alissa complained about hostility toward refugees and Muslims, writing in sharing a link about the impact of immigration on the U.S. economy: ""Why refugees and immigrants are good for America."" A classmate of Alissa’s in high school in Arvada, about 20 miles southeast of Boulder, told the Denver Post that in high school, Alissa was often concerned about being targeted because of his Muslim faith. Alissa often spoke about his Muslim faith on social media and said he believed he was targeted over Islamophobia and racism, Heavy.com reported. We don’t yet know the full details of how Alissa’s family immigrated to the U.S. But there is no evidence they entered illegally through Mexico. We rated Mostly False a claim by conservative activist Jack Posobiec that Alissa ""was a Syrian refugee who arrived via Obama-era asylum programs."" The best available information shows he arrived about seven years before Obama took office. In their arrest warrant for Alissa, police said Alissa had removed all of his clothing and was dressed only in shorts when he was taken into custody in the store. A rifle, described as a ""possible AR-15,"" and a semiautomatic handgun were found with Alissa’s clothes and a tactical vest in the store, the warrant said.  ""Using law enforcement databases, investigators determined that Alissa had purchased a Ruger AR-556 pistol on March 16, 2021,"" the warrant said.  The owner of the Arvada gun store that sold him the Ruger, a pistol that looks like a rifle, has said Alissa passed a background check in purchasing the gun. The charges filed against Alissa do not include any gun charges.

No, autopsy doesn’t say George Floyd died of overdose
","Months after a video of George Floyd gasping for air sparked months of protests nationwide, the murder trial began for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes. At the center of the case is the question of how Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died. In the runup to the trial, social media users and some conservative commentators have recycled debunked claims that the autopsies said Floyd died of a drug overdose.  ""Toxicology report was made public by the MN prosecution revealing the cause of George Floyd’s death was a fentanyl overdose,"" said one March 24 Facebook post. The Facebook post is wrong about what the Hennepin County medical examiner’s autopsy said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Two autopsies were completed after Floyd died in May 2020, following what video footage shows was roughly nine minutes spent pinned under Chauvin’s knee. The two reports found different causes of death, but neither ruled that Floyd died because of an overdose. An independent autopsy ordered by Floyd’s family ruled Floyd’s death a homicide. The two doctors who conducted the autopsy concluded that Floyd died of asphyxiation, or suffocation. The Hennepin County medical examiner’s office also ruled that Floyd died in a homicide. But it said the cause of his death was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law-enforcement subdual restraint, and neck compression,"" which occurred while Floyd was being ""restrained."" In other words, Floyd’s heart stopped as Chauvin restrained him, as PolitiFact has reported. Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The medical examiner also found that Floyd had a combination of underlying health conditions, including heart issues, and that he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system. Notes from a meeting, which were submitted as evidence, show that Andrew Baker, the county’s chief medical examiner, told prosecutors that Floyd’s fentanyl use was higher than what a chronic pain patient would be on. ""If he were found dead at home alone and no other apparent causes, this could be acceptable to call an OD,"" Baker said, per the notes. Baker added: ""I am not saying this killed him."" Defense attorney Eric Nelson argued on the first day of Chauvin’s trial that Floyd’s health issues and drug use combined with ""the adrenaline flowing through his body"" to make his ""already compromised"" heart fail. The defense previously made the same case in court documents. But several experts in toxicology, cardiology and drug use told the Washington Post ahead of Chauvin’s trial that death by fentanyl overdose was unlikely or impossible.  ""From my review of the video and the autopsy report, I see nothing that makes me think he died of an opioid overdose,"" Kavita Babu, chief opioid officer and chief of the Division of Medical Toxicology at UMass Memorial Health Care in Worcester, Mass., told the Post. A Facebook post said, ""Toxicology report was made public by the MN prosecution revealing the cause of George Floyd’s death was a fentanyl overdose."" That’s not what the county medical examiner’s autopsy revealed. The report indicated that relatively high levels of fentanyl were found in Floyd’s system, but it ruled the manner of death a homicide and said the cause of his death was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law-enforcement subdual restraint, and neck compression.""  An independent autopsy ordered by Floyd’s family also ruled Floyd’s death a homicide, and it said the cause was asphyxiation.

Yes, late-night hosts are making fun of Joe Biden
","It’s safe to say that President Joe Biden has been mentioned on television numerous times each day.

We found that Fallon and Colbert are indeed telling jokes about Biden, including about his fall on the stairs. Kimmel's show was on hiatus that week, but he has made other cracks about the new president. Fallon of ""The Tonight Show"" mentioned Biden’s stumble more than once.  ""This next poll asks, ‘What is the worst trip you’ve ever taken? 50% said a family trip, 49% said a work retreat, and President Biden said ‘Walking up the stairs of Air Force One,"" Fallon said March 23.  Fallon also mentioned it during his opening monologue later in the week, though it was more as a dig about what reporters would ask in the March 25 press conference with Biden. ""Biden’s dealing with North Korea, a border crisis and a global pandemic. But of course the first question will be, ‘Sir, why did you fall three times going up the stairs of Air Force One?’"" Fallon said March 24. Colbert made a quip about Biden’s fall in his ""Late Show"" monologue on March 22. ""Biden promised 100 million shots in 100 days. Well, last week he fulfilled that goal in 58 days. Our new president is on a roll, baby! Nothing can stop him now,"" Colbert said. ""Except stairs."" Kimmel's show was on hiatus during the week of Biden's fall. But the ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" host has joked about Biden since he took office, including on Jan. 21, the day after Biden’s inauguration. ""It was Inauguration Day here in the U.S.A.

Google Earth didn’t block the Suez Canal. The difference in color is from lighting, camera angles

Border barrier wasn’t 90% finished when Biden halted construction
","A Facebook post claims that construction of a southern border wall stopped just before completion. It’s highly misleading. ""We spent billions on a border wall and quit when it was 90% finished,"" said a March 23 Facebook post, which included a photo claiming to show people streaming through an opening at the border. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) President Joe Biden on his first day in office issued a proclamation to pause construction on the southern border and to assess the legality of the funding and construction contracts. Critics of the Biden administration say his policies are encouraging people to migrate illegally to the U.S. But the post fails to account for some important facts. Among them is that former President Donald Trump routinely moved the goal post regarding how many miles of border wall he wanted to build. Most of the construction that happened under his presidency involved the replacement of old barriers with new fencing that’s expected to be more effective in stopping illegal immigration. And experts have said that the border barriers are not a significant factor in the current migration surge. ""The amount of wall that would have been built between January and now is negligible and would have practically no effect on how many people are crossing the border,"" Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, recently told PolitiFact North Carolina. As a presidential candidate, Trump repeatedly said that the nearly 2,000-mile southern border needed a wall only along 1,000 miles. Natural barriers took care of the rest, he said.  After his election, Trump offered varying estimates on the length of the wall and how many miles needed protection. He lowered projections the longer he was in office.  ""You’ll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles,"" he said in July 2017.  ""We are going to do about 537 miles altogether,"" he said in July 2020. About a week before he left office — with about 450 miles of barriers completed — Trump claimed to have ""completed the wall."" ""And today, we celebrate an extraordinary milestone, the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall, 450 miles,"" Trump said Jan. 12. He claimed that an additional 300 miles were ""either in construction or pre-construction."" Trump’s inconsistent statements make it tough to measure his success. But we did not find a way to get to 90% completion, regardless of the metric used. Trump’s talk of a border wall commonly gave the impression that no barriers existed at the southern border and that he would build a wall along hundreds of unprotected miles. That’s not what happened. The Trump administration is responsible for about 7% of the approximately 700 miles of primary barriers now in place on the southern border. When Trump entered office, the southern border had 654 miles of primary barriers — fencing to stop people on foot and in vehicles. By the time he left, that increased by 52 miles, to 706 miles of primary barriers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that since January 2017, officials had ""identified"" about $15 billion for about 738 miles of border projects. As of late January 2021, crews had completed work on about 458 miles of those 738 miles (mainly replacement projects). So even by that metric, overall construction was not ""90% finished"" by the time Trump left office. Here’s a breakdown of what construction crews had done by late January: Replaced 351 miles of outdated and/or dilapidated primary barriers; Replaced 22 miles of outdated and/or dilapidated secondary barriers; Installed 52 miles of primary barriers in places where no barriers previously existed; Installed 33 miles of secondary barriers in places where no barriers previously existed. Despite Trump’s promise, Mexico did not pay for the construction. Funding for the projects came from the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Defense, and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, CBP said.  A Facebook post said, ""We spent billions on a border wall and quit when it was 90% finished."" Contracts for construction at the southern border total billions of dollars, and Biden has directed a pause in construction. That’s not in dispute. But construction was not 90% finished. In addition, most of the work completed under the Trump administration involved the replacement of older barriers. The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The facts about Georgia’s ban on food, water giveaways to voters
","On ""Fox News Sunday,"" host Chris Wallace and a Republican strategist argued about the particulars of Georgia’s new law banning certain food and water giveaways to voters in line. ""Why on earth, if Americans are willing to wait in hours to vote, would you make it a crime for people to come and give them a bottle of water?"" Wallace asked.  Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Sen. Mitch McConnell, later came on and circled back to respond to Wallace’s assertion. Holmes said that Democrats have misrepresented that provision of a new Georgia law. ""I've heard it a couple times on this program, that the idea that they've criminalized giving people bottles of water. They have not,"" said Holmes, founder of a consulting firm. ""What is in the statute, what is absolutely clear, is that they're preventing political organizations from giving people in line things: meals, water, what have you. Water is and should be provided at the polls for people who are standing in line."" Wallace and Holmes went back and forth about the particulars of the new Georgia law. Wallace repeatedly said that the new law bans giving food and water to voters in line, and Holmes pushed back. ""Are you really suggesting that it should be wrong to provide water or drinks to people waiting in line to exercise their democratic franchise?"" Wallace asked. Holmes replied: ""No, I'm not. What I'm suggesting is wrong is to suggest that the law does that."" He later said, ""It very specifically says that it can't be provided by political entities seeking to one way or another influence an outcome of a vote."" We decided to fact-check Holmes’ statement that the Georgia law doesn’t criminalize giving voters bottles of water. Gov. Brian Kemp signed SB 202 on March 25. Voting rights advocates quickly sued and raised multiple objections, including to what the law says about food and water giveaways.  Voting rights advocates routinely organize food and water distribution near voting sites where residents sometimes have to wait in line for hours to vote, often in nonwhite communities, where polling places are more crowded. Some of the larger events are organized by those with ties to the left, although they make the food and water available to anyone. Following the show, the debate moved to Twitter where ""Fox News Sunday"" and Holmes tweeted provisions of SB 202. Here is what that section of the law says: ""(a) No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method, nor shall any person distribute or display any campaign material, nor shall any person give, offer to give,  or participate in the giving of any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink, to an elector, nor shall any person solicit signatures for any petition, nor shall any person, other than election officials discharging their duties, establish or set up any tables or booths on any day in which ballots are being cast (1) Within 150 feet of the outer edge of any building within which a polling place is established; (2) Within any polling place; or (3) Within 25 feet of any voter standing in line to vote at any polling place."" The bill also states that poll workers can make available ""self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote."" But nothing in the law requires poll workers to make water easily available to voters while they are waiting in line. Holmes tweeted that the ""last section clearly exempts poll workers from prohibitions on political entities providing, water etc."" Holmes is correct that poll workers can set up self-serve water stations. However, during the show he misled when he said the law doesn’t criminalize giving away water. The law makes it a misdemeanor to give away food or water within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place building or within 25 feet of any voter in line. Violations of this law are punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. While people other than poll workers can give away food or water, they have to adhere to these boundaries to avoid breaking the law. Holmes emphasized in an email to PolitiFact that water is allowed, but from an unattended receptacle. And he repeated his assertion that the law is targeted at preventing people from political organizations from making such handouts. ""I was responding specifically to the repeated claims that it criminalized water at the polls,"" Holmes told PolitiFact. ""In reading the statute and speaking with Georgia officials, I understand that the intent of the statute is to deter electioneering at the polls, which is consistent with many other state laws. What I thought required clarification about the claim of criminalizing water, is that this Georgia statute was not silent on the issue. It specifically addressed the manner in which it may be provided."" But the language in the law doesn’t ban only political entities from handing out water. Keith Williams, general counsel to Republican House Speaker David Ralston, told PolitiFact: ""Any individual other than a worker at a polling place is prohibited from handing out water, etc., within 150 feet of a polling place or within 25 feet of the line.""  Election law experts reached similar conclusions. ""I read the solicitation provision and the prohibition on food and water at the polls to be separate prohibitions in the law,"" said Richard Hasen, a University of California Irvine election law professor. ""It is not limited to those who are soliciting votes."" Justin Levitt, a Loyola Marymount University law school professor, told PolitiFact: ""I read, and I believe courts would read, SB 202 to prohibit anyone from giving food or water to any voter in line."" A spokesperson with Georgia's secretary of state noted that voters are welcome to bring their own food and refreshments with them to stand in line. He said the purpose of the provision is to avoid having situations such as candidates handing out water or food wrapped in campaign materials. Cracking down on food and water giveaways to voters in Georgia is not new. A state law already banned giving gifts ""for the purpose of registering as a voter, voting, or voting for a particular candidate."" That provision doesn’t mention food or water directly, but Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had previously interpreted it to include food or water.  Holmes said a Georgia law has not ""criminalized giving people bottles of water."" It pertains to political organizations. SB 202 makes it a crime for people — and not just people from political organizations — to hand out food or bottles of water within 150 feet of a polling place or 25 feet of any voter standing in line. The only kernel of truth is that the law has a sentence which allows poll workers to make available ""self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote."" But just because poll workers can make self-service water available, doesn’t mean they are required to come up with a way to make water accessible to voters in every line at every polling site. Also, people could hand out water or food to voters outside the 150-foot and 25-foot boundaries.

James Clyburn misspeaks in saying 43 states have passed voting restrictions
","One of the biggest political controversies today involves laws that govern voting and elections.  In Washington, D.C., Democrats passed a bill that would use national standards to preempt many of the proposed state laws pushed by Republicans. State by state, Republican legislators have offered measures that tighten procedures for registering to vote and casting a ballot.  Republicans say these proposals would target voter fraud, but Democrats counter that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent, and that these proposals would unfairly disenfranchise voters. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., the third-ranking Democrat in the House leadership, touted the House bill on MSNBC on March 25. ""There are 43 states that have now passed voter suppression laws,"" Clyburn said. ""So I believe, and I've talked to Sen. (Jeff) Merkley about this, I said to him, if you’ve got 43 states, that’s only seven short of all 50 states. We ought to make the Voting Rights Act apply to all 50 states. Just put it out there and have it applied (to) all 50 states. Because 43 have now proved that they needed it to apply for it. Every state will be treated alike."" A reader emailed us, suggesting that we check the claim. The reader noted that if 43 states have enacted such restrictive laws, that number would include a lot of solidly Democratic states — and that would run counter to the conventional thinking that Democratic states favor easing restrictions on voting, not tightening them. The reader was correct to question Clyburn’s statement. When we checked with Clyburn’s office, a spokesperson told us, ""Yes, he misspoke."" Clyburn appears to have been thinking of a widely shared finding by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. In February, the group published a report detailing efforts at the state level to enact bills that either restrict or expand voting-related procedures. (The term ""voter suppression"" is hard to define and is subject to dispute, but for the purposes of this fact-check, we’ll stipulate that it means proposals to tighten registration or voting procedures.) The group counted 253 voting-restrictive bills that had been proposed in 43 states. (It also found 704 bills to expand voting access in a different set of 43 states.) Some states, notably Iowa and Georgia, have passed significant bills that tighten prior election rules. But because many state legislatures are still in session, most of the measures tracked by the Brennan Center have not yet had a final vote. And the restrictive bills proposed by Republicans in Democratic-controlled states face no clear route to passage. The bottom line is that the standard used by the Brennan Center was to track laws that had been ""proposed."" Due to Clyburn’s mistake in the interview, a viewer would take away the message that many more states had actually enacted restrictive election laws than have done so in reality. Clyburn said, ""There are 43 states that have now passed voter suppression laws."" His office acknowledged to PolitiFact that he misspoke. Bills to restrict voting procedures have been proposed in 43 states — not passed. That’s a significant distinction, because any lawmaker in a chamber controlled by the other party can propose a bill, but it’s vastly harder to actually enact the legislation into law.

Viral tweet wrongly ties Biden, attorney's resignation, election fraud
","A viral tweet suggests President Joe Biden may have pushed out a federal prosecutor for investigating the integrity of the election. ""Joe Biden forced the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina to resign after 24 people were charged with election fraud and the Mainstream Media never even batted an eyelash,"" the tweet says.  The account has more than 40,000 followers and the tweet was shared more than 1,900 times. The tweet cobbles some factual information together but links them under a false premise. Let’s start with the facts. On Feb. 9, Biden asked for the resignation of nearly all Trump-era U.S. attorneys — including Robert Higdon Jr., the attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina. On Feb. 11, Higdon announced he would resign at the end of the month.  On March 19, the Office for the Eastern District issued a press release announcing it had filed criminal charges against 24 people as the result of an investigation into voter fraud. While the announcement came after Higdon left, the probe spanned 18 months and the charges were filed under Higdon’s watch. ""The charges include making false claims of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote, naturalization fraud, and fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other documents as it relates to the registration to vote, and false statements in immigration proceedings. Two defendants are charged with illegally voting in the 2016 general election,"" the press release said. It’s inaccurate to claim that the media ignored these events. News media reported on Biden’s request, Higdon’s resignation announcement, and the voter fraud charges brought by Higdon’s office. In fact, PolitiFact partner WRAL and other media outlets have followed the voter fraud investigation for 18 months, producing an in-depth report just three days after the viral tweet. Because of how the tweet is written, someone could get the impression Biden asked Higdon to resign as retaliation for the charges. However, there’s no evidence the two events are related. Let’s address some possible misconceptions. The resignation request: It’s not uncommon for new presidents to ask federal prosecutors to step down if they were appointed by another administration. U.S. attorneys are political appointees, as NBC News reported.  Donald Trump, when he assumed office in 2017, likewise ordered the resignation of 46 attorneys who served during the Obama administration. Higdon’s resignation letter didn’t mention any of his office’s projects or even hint at any animosity toward Biden. ""The tweet is not accurate,"" said Don Connelly, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina. ""All of the presidentially appointed U.S. Attorneys were asked to resign and it had nothing to do with any case,"" Connelly told PolitiFact NC in an email. The fraud investigation: The tweet could give the impression that Higdon acted alone in finding voter fraud. That’s not exactly how it works.  While Higdon’s office at times had a contentious relationship with the North Carolina State Board of Elections, Connelly said the voter fraud probe ""was the result of the Board of Elections contacting our office to initiate the investigation."" The charges stemmed from an audit produced by the North Carolina elections board in 2017, board spokesman Patrick Gannon told PolitiFact. ""When the U.S. Attorney’s office heard about the audit, they subpoenaed records from the State and County Boards of Elections and launched an investigation,"" he said. Generally speaking, Gannon said the board receives tips about voting irregularities and fraud from multiple sources, ""including county boards of elections, election watchdog and advocacy organizations, internal audits of elections data, private citizens, political parties and candidates."" If the board believes a crime was committed, it refers the evidence to a prosecutorial agency. In other words, Higdon was not solely responsible for the 24 filed charges and he’s not the only person looking for voter fraud. The fraud charges: The tweet could also give the impression that the fraud was related to Biden’s election win. That’s not true either. None of the 24 charges announced are for casting a fraudulent ballot in the 2020 election. In fact, included in those charges are 11 that were filed before last year’s election.  Two of the defendants were charged with unlawful voting in the 2016 general election. Meanwhile, more than 15 were related to unlawful voter registration in earlier elections. Arrests were made in the last two years. Federal prosecutors under Trump, including Higdon, did search for what some suspected was ""systemic"" or ""pervasive"" election fraud. Ultimately, the multi-year North Carolina investigation yielded charges for about 70 people. In the press release about the latest charges, attorneys for the Eastern District of North Carolina specifically noted that the defendants were charged individually and that ""there are no charges of conspiracy."" The tweet said ""Joe Biden forced the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina to resign after 24 people were charged with election fraud and the Mainstream Media never even batted an eyelash.""  Biden did ask for the resignation of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, as is common practice during a presidential transition. And the attorney recently announced charges against 24 people as part of an investigation into voter fraud.
But this tweet leaves out context about those events and wrongly suggests the events are somehow related. It’s also inaccurate to say that the media didn’t report on these matters. There was extensive reporting surrounding the investigation that led to election fraud charges, as well as the post-election changes in the attorney general’s office. The tweet contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Border surge of minors is due to numerous factors, Biden policies among them
","U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, joined CNN host Jake Tapper on March 14 to defend President Joe Biden’s response to the influx of unaccompanied children at the southern border and shift blame to the Trump administration.  The number of unaccompanied children encountered by Border Patrol increased sharply earlier this year, from 5,858 in January to 9,457 in February — a 61% increase, according to federal data. It’s the largest one month percentage increase since U.S. Customs and Border Protection began reporting the data in 2010.  ""Is this a crisis?"" Tapper asked Escobar.   ""There is no doubt, Jake, that what we're seeing today is an enormous challenge,"" Escobar replied, adding that the uptick is a consequence of the Trump administration’s immigration policies that the Biden administration is ""is working day and night"" to amend.   ""We began seeing the increase in unaccompanied minors going back to last April 2020. This is not something that happened as a result of Joe Biden becoming president,"" Escobar said. ""We saw the increases dating back almost a year. And this was during the Trump administration.""  The growing number of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border has become a  partisan issue — Democrats blaming the uptick on Trump policies while Republicans blame it on changes the Biden administration has implemented.  During a March 21 interview on ABC News, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas made comments similar to Escobar’s.  ""Why is it especially challenging and difficult now? Because the entire system under United States law that has been in place throughout administrations of both parties was dismantled in its entirety by the Trump administration,"" Mayorkas said. Gov. Greg Abbott, on the other hand, has blamed Biden’s ""reckless open border policies"" for the ""surge in border crossings and cartel activity."" Migration patterns are complex and driven by numerous factors beyond changes in U.S. immigration policy, experts say. Is Escobar accurate in saying that increases in the number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the border dates back to the Trump administration? And is she correct to say that these increases are not ""a result of Joe Biden becoming president""?  The first part of Escobar’s statement is accurate — the number of unaccompanied minors encountered at the border has been increasing since April 2020. But this trend generally follows seasonal migration patterns. Migration numbers typically peak in the spring, usually in May, and decrease in the late summer.   But in 2020, the steady rise continued through the winter. According to Art Arthur, a former immigration judge and a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank that advocates for low immigration numbers, the steady rise in migrants through June, July and August is a ""reversion to the mean.""   Migration numbers across the board ""fell off a cliff"" in late March 2020 after the Trump administration activated Title 42, a provision of the 1944 Public Health and Safety Act that allows Border Patrol to expel any migrant for health and safety reasons, in this case to limit the spread of COVID-19 into the U.S. Since migration numbers bottomed out in April 2020 because of Title 42, the increases in migrant numbers throughout the remainder of 2020 returned monthly totals closer to average levels, Arthur said. But that steady rise changed in February, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported the 61% uptick. ""We are seeing a reversion to the mean as it relates to unaccompanied children, but we saw a huge spike (in February 2021), and it’s a bigger spike than we’ve seen in any February ever,"" Arthur said.  That uptick occurred in the same month the Biden administration suspended Title 42 for unaccompanied children only, leaving it in place for all other categories of apprehended migrants, much to the chagrin of immigrant advocates.  In late January, after a federal appeals court ruled that the federal government could use Title 42 to expel unaccompanied minors, the White House announced that, unlike under the Trump administration, it would no longer apply Title 42 to children crossing the border alone. The uptick in unaccompanied minors was recorded soon after that announcement. And as of March 23, there were 4,962 children in Customs and Border Patrol custody, well above the 30-day average of 3,243, according to NBC News. ""I can’t identify a single other factor that would point to that,"" Arthur said. ""There’s no other variable other than that."" While Arthur highlights the White House’s policy change as a pull factor that was a primary driver behind February’s uptick, other experts underscore the push factors driving migrants out of their origin countries.  Migrants and migrant children travel from their origin countries — primarily Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — to the southern U.S. border for a multitude of reasons: worsened economic conditions due to COVID-19, cartel violence, corruption, natural disasters, agricultural diseases or droughts and, among others, the vagaries of U.S aid. These issues have factored into people’s migration decisions for decades.  One such push factor challenged the Central America region in November, when two category-4 hurricanes struck Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala within a two-week span. More than 200 people were killed, and millions were left in need of aid. The hurricanes exacerbated poverty and worsened access to clean water, giving an extra nudge to people considering northern migration.  ""There are clearly push factors coming out of all those countries, regardless of what our policies are,"" said Ruth Wasem, a professor of public policy at the University of Texas. And it’s hard to say that pull factors created by liberalized U.S. immigration policies are stronger than the push factors driving migrants away from their origin countries, she said.  To Wasem, it’s no surprise border authorities are reporting high numbers of unaccompanied minors after four years of austere immigration policies under the Trump administration, which revamped the asylum-seeking processes in many ways that reduced the number of asylum seekers entering the U.S.   But the near closure of the U.S.-Mexico border under Trump doesn’t mean that migrants stopped packing their bags for the U.S.  ""Trump basically shut down our immigration system and ended the laws on the books,"" Wasem said. ""So there’s going to be a pent-up number of people that were waiting to come, or that were en route.""  Wasem points to data from the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance, a Mexican federal agency that processes refugee-status applications. Under Trump administration policies, asylum seekers were required to apply for asylum and be denied in one of the countries they passed through before seeking asylum in the U.S.  According to the data, monthly application numbers ebbed and flowed prior to Biden’s policy changes, showing that push factors in origin countries are a major driver behind migrant and unaccompanied children seeking to enter the U.S., Wasem said.  ""Unaccompanied children coming to the U.S. is a result of what's going on in the countries they're coming from,"" she said. ""How we respond to them changes from administration to administration. So when Escobar says the increase in unaccompanied children didn't happen as a result of Biden, I would say the ebb and flow isn't a result of who's in the White House.""  That logic is echoed by other immigration researchers. Writing for the Washington Post, Director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center Tom Wong and University of California at San Diego researchers say that the latest spike is attributable to a migration backlog.  ""The current increase in apprehensions fits a predictable pattern of seasonal changes in undocumented immigration combined with a backlog of demand because of 2020’s coronavirus border closure,"" they wrote in their analysis of federal immigration data.   Long-term federal data suggests that ""Title 42 expulsions delayed prospective migrants rather than deterred them — and they’re arriving now,"" they wrote.   There’s little doubt that migrants, and young children in particular, are being sent across the border inspired by Biden’s new immigration policies. But Wasem says that the hope Biden administration policies have inspired in migrants is hard to measure.  ""Are people coming because the thought of Biden’s presidency gives them hope? That might be. But you can't measure that,"" she said.  One 9-year-old boy, for instance, traveled on foot for over a month through Mexico from Honduras aiming to connect with a family member in Florida. He was discovered by Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley and told one ABC News reporter that his mother had sent him because she had heard that immigration authorities were turning families away, but not children.  Biden himself has acknowledged that while his administration has drawn the attention of migrant families, his more humanitarian policies can’t be the only factor compelling families to send their kids on the perilous northward journey. Many of the push factors cited by Wasem — like worsening poverty or gang violence — are also factoring into the calculus of migrants. ""That (9-year-old boy’s) mother did not sit around at the kitchen table and say, ‘I got a great idea. The way I’m going to make sure my son gets taken care of is I’m going to send him on a 10,000-mile journey through the desert into the U.S. because I know Joe Biden’s a nice guy and he’ll take care of him,’"" Biden said. ""What a desperate act to have to take. Circumstances must be horrible.""  Escobar, whose office did not respond to requests for comment, said that increases in the number of unaccompanied minors reaching the southern U.S. border have been increasing since April 2020, when Trump was president.   It’s accurate to say that the number of children traveling alone to the border has been increasing since last April, but her statement downplays the fact that February saw a record increase in unaccompanied minors encountered by Border Patrol agents. Escobar also said that these increases are not ""a result of Joe Biden becoming president."" Experts say that the pull factor created by Biden’s policy change to stop expulsions of the minors is one of several factors driving the uptick in unaccompanied minors. However, there’s dispute over whether this pull factor is a more primary driver than other push factors.  We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2021/mar/29/veronica-escobar/surge-minors-border-due-numerous-factors-biden-pol/

Moby’s claim there would be ‘no pandemics’ if world were vegans ignores important context
","It’s been just over a year since the COVID-19 pandemic spawned mass shutdowns and exploded into the public consciousness, and scientists still don’t fully understand the origins of the disease that has killed millions around the world. Electronica easy-listening pop artist Richard Melville Hall — known professionally as Moby — suggested in a Facebook post that all of this could have been avoided if humans did not consume animals:  ""In a vegan world there would be no pandemics. 100% of pandemics are zoonotic in origin,"" his March 23 post read. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is he right? In short, no — and for some of the same reasons we found a similar claim specific to COVID-19 Mostly False. We reached out to Moby’s representatives through email but did hear back. While scientists have found that most human infectious diseases originate with animals — and, yes, all pandemics in the last 100 years fall into this category — it’s not accurate to say that they would be eliminated if humans did not eat other animals. There are other means by which a disease can move from animal to human. Likewise, there are other ways a disease could emerge and become a pandemic.     With COVID-19, scientists largely agree that the novel coronavirus likely originated in a bat, but by the same token they also agree that an intermediary host would have been necessary for the virus to be transmitted to a human — and we still don't know what that intermediary source is. Therefore, ""patient zero"" almost certainly did not contract COVID-19 by consuming a bat. Moby’s broader claim suggests that any pandemic would not exist if the world’s population practiced veganism, the practice of not eating or using animal products. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a disease is ""zoonotic"" if it can be spread from animals to humans.  ""Zoonotic diseases are caused by harmful germs like viruses, bacterial, parasites, and fungi,"" CDC’s guidance reads. ""These germs can cause many different types of illnesses in people and animals, ranging from mild to serious illness and even death."" Zoonotic diseases, or ""zoonoses,"" are extremely common considering they comprise at least 60% of known infectious diseases. Additionally, the CDC notes, roughly 75% of new or emerging infectious diseases are known to come from animals. But a pandemic can also evolve from sources beyond wildlife. ""Most human infectious diseases find their origin in another animal species,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. ""However, there are environmentally acquired infectious diseases such as anthrax, tetanus, and botulism. However, these tend to be non-communicable between person to person and therefore not able to cause a pandemic.""  ""It is within the realm of possibility that an environmental fungus, for example, could infect a large amount of humans,"" Adalja said. ""In amphibian species, for instance, environmental fungal disease (e.g. chytrid disease) are pandemics. One could also envision a stable human pathogen, by chance, acquiring some new trait allowing it to spread in a new manner. "" In a recent interview with the online news magazine Inverse published March 24, Adalja also pushed back directly on Moby’s claim.  Adalja told the publication that a determining factor in which a zoonotic illness becomes a pandemic has less to do with animal consumption and more to do with how humans generally interact with animals since there are other ways beyond consumption an animal-borne pathogen can be transmitted. ""You can get bitten by a raccoon and get rabies,"" Adalja said in the interview, ""not because you were going to eat it, but just because you happened to encounter it in the wild."" Moby said, ""In a vegan world there would be no pandemics. 100% of pandemics are zoonotic in origin."" Scientists have found that the pandemics of the last 100 years have been zoonotic. And they say that most infectious disease in humans originates with animals. But that does not mean that worldwide adherence to veganism would eradicate pandemics. There are other sources by which disease can emerge — and consuming animals is not the only path by which disease can make the jump from animals to humans. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Viral post claiming voter fraud in 2012 election errs on photo ID numbers
","A viral post shared on several websites claims to offer evidence that President Barack Obama benefited from voter fraud during his 2012 reelection race against Mitt Romney. Headlined ""Ever Wonder Why Republicans Want Voter ID?"" the post offers factoids that seem to point to voter fraud in critical states. We've rated the Florida claims Pants on Fire! PolitiFact is also looking at the claims about Pennsylvania and Ohio in separate fact-checks. For this item, we'll look at the ""fun fact"" at the end of the meme: ""Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote.""  It's clear from the context that the post is talking about the 2012 election, because it mentions Republican Mitt Romney twice. So did voter ID determine whether Obama won or lost in a state? Not at all. We checked with the National Conference of State Legislatures, the nonpartisan Washington-based organization that keeps track of which states have voter identification laws and rates the rigidity of those laws. The group made a tally of the mandatory photo ID laws in effect for the 2012 election. It's true that Obama lost in the states that had a strict photo-only ID requirement in 2012, but merely four states — Georgia, Indiana, Kansas and Tennessee — had that requirement, a salient fact the post neglects to mention. (A few more states have added a strict photo ID requirement that apply in the 2016 elections.) That a Democrat would lose in those states, regardless of a photo ID requirement, is not surprising. Georgia and Indiana have voted for Republican candidates in seven of the last eight presidential elections since 1984, Tennessee has done it in six out of eight, and Kansas has done it in eight out of eight. This trend pre-dated the photo ID laws, the first of which was implemented in 2008. The post is ridiculously wrong when it says Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID. Obama lost in 20 of the 46 states without a strict photo ID requirement. If you include the seven additional states that asked for a photo ID but allowed other types of identification as well, such as a credit or debit card in the voter's name, Obama won four (Florida, Hawaii, Michigan and New Hampshire) and lost three (Idaho, Louisiana and South Dakota). The post does not identify who created it. Our ruling An anonymous, viral post claims that in 2012, ""Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote."" Obama did lose in the four states that had such a law in effect in 2012, but those states historically vote Republican in presidential elections anyway. The post is flat wrong about Obama winning states that do not require a photo ID. He lost in 20 states that lacked the requirement.

Donald Trump accurately says media wrong that he kicked baby out of rally
","Donald Trump is crying foul at news reports alleging he kicked a crying baby out of a Virginia rally last week. ""The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, ‘the baby’ and so much more. Very dishonest!"" he tweeted. We looked into his widely reported comments on Crimea and a host of other issues. But is it true that babygate isn’t based on reality? Trump’s charge of media distortion sticks. The ""scandal"" started at an Aug. 2 Trump rally in Ashburn, Va. As he was talking about trade, a baby began to cry in the audience, prompting the famously off-the-cuff Trump to chime in. ""I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it,"" he said. ""What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want."" As the baby continued to cry, Trump continued to comment. ""Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here,"" he said. ""I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's okay. People don't understand. That's okay."" These sentences caught fire in the press. Here’s a smattering of headlines from a variety of media outlets: • New York Daily News: ""SEE IT: Donald Trump kicks crying baby out of rally"" • Rolling Stone: ""Watch Donald Trump Throw Crying Baby Out of Rally"" • New York Times: ""Donald Trump Jousts With a Crying Baby at His Rally"" • Fox News: ""Trump has infant removed from rally for making noise"" • Salon: "" ‘You can get that baby out of here’: Donald Trump, upstaged by crying baby, orders it removed from rally"" • Wired: ""Trump didn’t just banish a baby. He banished a mother"" • Baltimore Sun: ""Trump banished the baby, humiliated the mother"" But, as our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reported, Trump didn’t actually kick the baby out of his rally.   Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale cleared things up that day, writing that Trump’s ""get the baby out of here"" comment came as the mother was already exiting. ""A joke? Possibly. An insensitive, heartless, ordinary-person-embarrassing remark? Possibly. Trump’s tone is eternally hard to read,"" Dale wrote. ""But, to my eyes, it certainly was not an ejection — it was an unusually barbed endorsement of the mother’s own decision to depart."" NBC reporter Katy Tur was also at the event and said comment was very clearly a joke and ""the baby stayed."" Tur reported about the incident on Bloomberg’s With All Due Respect (around the 30 minute mark). Another guest on the program, the Washington Post’s Phil Rucker, agreed: ""I was there, too. It was a joke. It was definitely a joke."" The Associated Press reported that after saying ""you can get that baby out of here,"" Trump ""then seemed to suggest that he was joking and the baby could stay. The child soon stopped crying."" Devan Ebert, the mother herself, said as much in widely circulated Facebook posts soon after the news reports began appearing. Ebert confirmed to PolitiFact that this statement came from her: ""I excused myself and my child when he awoke from his nap and began to cry. It was only because I had to grab my child's belongings and then make my way out of the aisle I was seated in that I wasn't out of there sooner. ... ""I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment. ""I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby. I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally."" Ebert reiterated this in an interview, telling us she was never kicked out of the rally and Trump still has her vote. ""I appreciate that Mr. Trump made light of an otherwise stressful situation,"" she said. At the time of this report, none of the publications listed above have issued corrections or updated their stories. Our ruling Trump said the media distorted what happened with a baby at his rally. Many media outlets reported that Trump ""threw out"" or ""ejected"" a crying baby from a campaign event in Virginia, based on his commentary on the incident. But this isn’t true. Trump’s comments came as the mother was already voluntarily exiting from the rally. We rate Trump’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/598870c7-2bbd-47a5-8d22-04f0a67ebc97",/factchecks/2016/aug/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-accurately-says-media-wrong-he-kicked/

Anthony Weiner lacks collateral in claim about Donald Trump's loan sources
","Donald Trump's relationship with Russia has become an issue because of several factors: his campaign's ties in the region; the claim that the leaks of Democratic National Committee email originated from Russian hackers; Trump's conflicting claims about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin; and Trump's invitation to the Russians to hack Hillary's Clinton's emails. Former Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner discussed Trump's Russian ties on the July 27, 2016, edition of Real Time with Bill Maher. (Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a Clinton top adviser. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal.) ""The reason he loves Putin, we know this now. The banks no longer loan him money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these (Russian) oligarchs and borrows money. He knows the end game is coming for him. He's thinking about who he wants to ingratiate himself (with). We have a presidential candidate who is literally kind of approaching Russia on his knees because he needs them to loan him money."" Banks are no longer loaning Trump money, and Trump is trying to get it from Russian oligarchs? When we contacted Weiner, he characterized his comment as ""informed speculation among real estate builders and bankers. There is some transparency on lending for buildings. But since he hasn’t really built anything since the Soho Grand, there isn’t much to look at. The part about him being a terrible risk is borne out by his record of not paying debts."" So we went looking for some evidence on the question of who is lending Trump money. Hard evidence is lacking because Trump runs a private business, so most of his records are not available to the public. In addition, he has repeatedly refused to release any recent tax returns, which could be another indication of his source of capital. We sought out what's available. No loans for Trump? The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2016 that the candidate's available financial statements show that the struggling German bank Deutsche Bank ""is the only bank with a big Wall Street presence that continues to lend to him."" Other large institutions do little if any business with Trump, the newspaper reported, but smaller institutions do. The Journal said ""many big banks have shunned him,"" but the paper also reported that Trump has few loans with big banks. ""Bankers say that's partly because Mr. Trump has moved away from developing multimillion-dollar real-estate projects to managing them and licensing the Trump name, reducing his need to borrow."" Daughter Ivanka told the Journal that the big banks are not wary of investing with Trump:  ""The biggest banking institutions are constantly soliciting us. But we don't need a lot of financing because we have a great balance sheet and a tremendous amount of cash."" In addition, she said, Trump has moved to private banks that have lower interest rates. Nonetheless, various media outlets have stated, without offering any documentation, that Trump can't get funds from most banks. From Slate: ""After his 2004 bankruptcy and his long streak of lawsuits, the big banks decided he wasn’t worth the effort. They’d rather not touch the self-proclaimed 'king of debt.' "" From Talking Points Memo: ""Trump has been blackballed by all major US banks."" For his part, Weiner pointed us to an Aug. 2 commentary posted on Time.com, which reported that ""the real truth is that, as major banks in America stopped lending him money following his many bankruptcies, the Trump organization was forced to seek financing from non-traditional institutions. Several had direct ties to Russian financial interests in ways that have raised eyebrows."" Which leads us to the Russian part of Weiner's claim. Loans from oligarchs? Weiner also sent us a Politico article explaining how Trump has tried to get Russians as tenants and buyers for his various properties, including a 17-bedroom mansion in Palm Beach, which he bought in bankruptcy for $41 million in 2004. He eventually sold the property to a Russian oligarch for $95 million in 2008. But that was a property sale. Weiner was talking about getting loans from oligarchs, a very different thing. Other media outlets have reported that Trump has actively marketed condo projects to Russians, particularly Russians with money to burn — or hide. Politico reported that when it came to the Palm Beach property Trump sold to oligarch billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, Rybolovlev has probably never been in the house. He subsequently denied owning it and preparations are underway to tear it down. This may explain why, at a real estate conference in 2008, Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's son, said that ""Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."" But the issue for this fact-check is borrowing money, and we couldn't find any evidence that Trump has been getting loans from any oligarchs. The few cases we found involved Trump partnering with people with ties to the region. Trump has been looking for business opportunities in the Soviet Union since at least 1987, when he flew there to try to develop luxury hotels in Moscow and Leningrad. None of the real estate deals ever led to a groundbreaking. Russian involvement in financing deals seems to be coming indirectly. The best-known example is a company that Trump partnered with for hotel-condominium projects — one in Toronto, the other in Lower Manhattan known as Trump SoHo. The company that partnered with Trump is the Bayrock Group, chaired by former Soviet official Tevfik Arif, who hails from Kazakhstan. Bayrock has drawn attention for a host of reasons. First, one of its prominent associates is Felix Satter (later changed to Sater), a Russian immigrant with an office in Trump Tower in New York. Satter served time beginning in 1993 for slashing a man's face in a barroom brawl and, in a lawsuit, was accused of threatening to electrocute the testicles of a Trump investor, according to Slate. In addition, Satter was ""implicated in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals,"" according to the New York Times. He later became an FBI informant. Second, when the company's finance director, Jody Kriss, sued Bayrock for fraud, Kriss alleged that the company, founded in 1989 in Moscow, was ""backed by oligarchs and money they stole from the Russian people."" According to that lawsuit, ""Month after month for two years, ... whenever Bayrock ran out of cash, Bayrock Holdings would magically show up with a wire from ‘somewhere’ just large enough to keep the company going."" Also feeding into the pot of Bayrock money was a fund called the FL Group. Kriss' lawsuit says it attracted Russian investors ""in favor with Putin."" It chipped in $50 million in 2007, which became controversial after the $50 million partnership deal was re-classified as a loan, a move of questionable legality because it seemed to be designed to avoid U.S. taxes, according to the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. This may seem far removed from Trump, but the Telegraph reported that Trump signed off on that deal. According to the paper, Alan Garten, Trump’s lawyer, claimed that the billionaire had simply signed letters acknowledging the deal as a ""limited partner"" with Bayrock. The Kriss suit, while claiming that ""tax evasion and money-laundering are the core of Bayrock’s business model,"" also says, ""There is no evidence (Donald) Trump took any part in, or knew of, their racketeering. Any contrary inference would be unjust."" (Editor’s note, Aug. 16, 2016: After we published our fact-check, we received a response from a representative for Bayrock, which said, ""The allegations made by Jody Kriss are baseless and unsubstantiated."") The Trump campaign declined to comment when we inquired about Weiner's statement. Our ruling Weiner said of Trump, ""We know this now. The banks no longer loan him money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these oligarchs and borrows money."" Weiner called it ""informed speculation."" But at PolitiFact, we operate on the principle that the person making the claim is responsible for providing evidence. In this case the evidence is lacking, in part because Trump has revealed so little. Even his net worth remains a mystery. Nonetheless, records show that banks are still loaning money to him, albeit not the big U.S. institutions. There's no evidence to prove that it's because the large banks have shut him out. Similarly, there's little evidence to show that Trump has been seeking loans from oligarchs instead of financial institutions. There's circumstantial evidence that oligarchs have been involved in his business dealings, but mostly through intermediary companies that own a financial stake in his projects. That's different from a direct loan. Because the statement seems to contain some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/749a7984-1f65-451f-996f-cfb469302219",/factchecks/2016/aug/08/anthony-weiner/anthony-weiner-lacks-collateral-claim-about-donald/

Howard Dean largely right on Mike Pence's health policy record
","Speakers at the Democratic National Convention made clear their disdain for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean did just that but also managed to attack Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, on his health policy record. In the speech, Dean said that Trump would ""rip up Obamacare."" He continued by saying, ""His vice presidential pick is no better. Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which Hillary helped to start,"" among other claims about Pence's health care policy positions.  We decided to look into Dean's statement about Pence and the Children's Health Insurance Program, called CHIP. Is Dean's statement accurate?  Pence on the Children’s Health Insurance Program The Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, was first created by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under Bill Clinton’s administration. According to Medicaid, it has insured over 8 million low-income children who could not afford private coverage. The Hillary Clinton campaign has touted her role in passing the legislation. While she did play a significant part from the White House, others were pivotal in moving it through the Republican-controlled Congress, notably the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. We've rated the statement that she helped get the program ""done"" as Mostly True.  So, did Pence vote against the legislation? Pence served in Congress from 2001 to 2012. During that time, there were four major roll call votes directly affecting CHIP. Although Pence did not vote in favor of the reauthorization proposals in 2007 or 2009, he did offer statements on the legislation. In an editorial for the Star Press in Indiana, Pence wrote that while he supports expanding health insurance for poor children, the Democratic legislation ""represented a massive expansion of this anti-poverty program into the middle class."" Instead of the CHIP reauthorizations, Pence had supported other bills like the More Children, More Choices Act of 2007, which expand coverage but use tax credits. Dean’s assertion that Pence voted against CHIP is accurate, though Pence did support Republican legislation to get health care to low-income children. Pence in Indiana We should note that Pence's health care record isn't entirely against the Democratic policy agenda. While Dean attacked Pence’s congressional record, Pence’s most notable healthcare-related policies have come during his time as governor of Indiana. The state is known for the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), which many have called a compromise between Obamacare and conservative health policy ideas. HIP expanded the state’s Medicaid coverage by using federal dollars, which is now optional for states since a 2012 Supreme Court ruling. While adopting provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Indiana expanded Medicaid through a waiver plan, allowing the state to add additional stipulations and restrictions. Particularly contentious is HIP’s premium contribution requirement, which forces Medicaid recipients to pay a small premium each month. If people fail to pay, they are locked out of benefits for six months. Sherry Glied, professor of public service at New York University with an extensive background in health policy, notes that the benefits of Indiana’s Medicaid expansion ""include the same essential benefits required under Obamacare for all individual market and Medicaid plans, among them mental health and substance use benefits."" So, although Dean is largely correct about Pence’s voting record on CHIP in Congress, Pence’s policies as governor have added other benefits at the state level. Our ruling Dean criticized Pence’s health policy record, saying, ""Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance program,which Hillary helped to start."" That claim is largely accurate. Pence voted against CHIP when he was in Congress, and Clinton did have a role in starting the program when she was First Lady. But it is important to note that Pence has supported health policy as governor of Indiana that was in line with health policies that Dean and other Democrats support. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/08/howard-dean/howard-dean-largely-right-mike-pences-health-polic/

Tim Kaine falsely says Trump said 'all Mexicans are rapists'
","Tim Kaine’s two-word description of Donald Trump is ""trash talker."" Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, used the term repeatedly during an Aug. 1 campaign rally in his hometown of Richmond. He accused Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, of ""trash talking"" about U.S. allies, foreign leaders, people with disabilities, women and other Republicans. ""The thing that amazes me is the depth of his trash talking with Latinos, saying all Mexicans are rapists and going after Latino immigrants,"" Kaine said. No doubt, Trump has made controversial statements about the groups Kaine cited. But did Trump go as far as saying ""all Mexicans are rapists?"" We asked the Clinton-Kaine campaign for evidence. It cited 16 instances since June 2015 when Trump said that some of the unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. are hardened criminals and rapists. Topping the list was a Trump statement that made international headlines when he announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015. ""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,"" Trump said. ""They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" Trump’s statements about Mexican immigration have been discredited in fact checks. PolitiFact National has twice given Pants on Fire ratings to his claim that the Mexican government is sending violent criminals to the U.S. Trump hasn’t provided proof for his repeated claims and a number immigration say there’s no evidence to support them. Experts say unauthorized Latino immigrants usually come to the U.S. looking for jobs and to reunite with families that already are here. There’s no knowing the number or percentage of U.S violent crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants, because the U.S. doesn’t keep such statistics. There’s is strong evidence, however, that the border-crossers haven’t made the U.S. more dangerous. The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. grew from 3.5 million in 1990 to 11.2 million in 2012, according to estimates by the Pew Research Center. That’s a 220 percent increase. During the same years, the violent crime rate in the U.S. declined by 47 percent, according to FBI data. Now, let’s get back to Kaine. His campaign, as we’ve noted, cited 16 times  when Trump said ""rapists"" and other violent sorts are coming into the U.S. from Mexico. But Trump, in none of the quotes, made the charge that ""all Mexicans are rapists,"" as Kaine said. There’s nothing that even approached such a contention. ""Sen. Kaine was clearly referencing Trump's attacks on Latino immigrants -- as he said in his comments -- from Mexico,"" Amy Dudley, a national spokesprson for Kaine, wrote us in an email. Our ruling Trump has roiled emotions with his debunked claims that the Mexican government is sending ""rapists"" and other violent criminals into the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants."" Kaine has embellished the controversy by saying Trump has said ""all Mexicans are rapists."" The Democrat doesn’t come close to proving his claim; all of the Trump quotes Kaine’s campaign sent us pertain to unauthorized immigrants crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. No doubt, many Latinos have taken umbrage with what Trump actually has said. But Kaine put an insult into the mouth of Trump that never was uttered. So we rate Kaine’s statement False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/08/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-falsely-says-trump-said-all-mexicans-are/

Tim Kaine says he hasn't changed his position on Trans-Pacific Partnership (unlike Clinton)
","Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine defended Hillary Clinton from public skepticism over her trustworthiness and addressed his own pro-trade baggage Aug. 7 on NBC’s Meet the Press. Clinton has ""learned from"" her email controversy and will be ""real transparent"" moving forward, Kaine said. While Clinton’s trust issue lies predominantly with independent and Republican voters, Kaine’s critics are progressives who fault him for his perceived past support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Host Chuck Todd said Kaine ""essentially switched"" his position on the trade deal to align with Clinton’s own flip-flop, but Kaine begged to differ: ""I haven’t switched my position,"" he said. ""I was a strong supporter a year ago of giving President Obama the ability to negotiate a trade deal. But I said at the time, when that deal was done and on the table, I was going to look at it very carefully. And I even expressed a very serious concern I had with how it was developed, which is that companies were given rights to enforce provisions, but the labor and environmental provisions could not be effectively enforced. That was never fixed. I've asked again and again to understand this piece of the TPP. And I've never gotten a good answer. We can't have a deal that cannot be enforced. And so, for that reason, yeah, I'm going to oppose it in the lame duck if it comes up after Election Day."" Has Kaine’s position on the trade deal been consistent? Kaine’s turn on the trade deal was not as dramatic as the presidential nominee’s. But there was still a noticeable shift when he became Clinton’s running mate. Kaine is against the deal now, but he had kinder things to say about it before without taking a firm position. Many point to Kaine’s support for Trade Promotion Authority — which allows the president to negotiate a trade treaty with only an up-or-down vote on the final package in the Senate — as proof of his pro-TPP stance. Kaine was just one of 13 Senate Democrats who voted in June 2015 to give Obama fast-track authority. On the day of the vote, Kaine explained his thinking to The Atlantic. ""For my sake, I got assurances I need that made me feel comfortable voting today. But I've got a backstop, which is if those assurances are not met, then I will vote against the treaty when it eventually hits the table,"" he said. ""I'm not going to vote for TPP when there is no program to retrain workers who are affected by trade."" That’s roughly what he’s been saying for the past year and a half: He supports giving Obama negotiating authority, but would wait for TPP to be finalized before taking a stance on it. Here are some examples of what he’s said: • May 7, 2015, interview with Politico: ""I tell everybody the same thing: I’m pro-trade, but it’s got to be under the right conditions, and I want to make sure that that’s the case."" • May 14, 2015, statement to the Hampton Daily Press: Giving Obama fast-track authority ""gives the U.S. the best chance of elevating the standards for global trade in ways that will level the playing field,"" but ""as we prepare to take up major trade initiatives in the coming months, my biggest priority is ensuring we can negotiate enforceable deals that protect workers' rights, environmental standards and intellectual property, while eliminating barriers that some countries erect to keep American products out."" • May 16, 2015, column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch: ""I will support TPA because it gives the U.S. the best chance of elevating the standards for global trade in ways that will level the playing field for our workers, farmers and companies. My support for TPA is not a blind endorsement of any pending trade negotiation. Once we establish our key principles, I will make sure that the specifics of any final deal are placed before the public and fully debated to see if they meet our standards and help Virginia."" • June 18, 2015, interview on the John Frederick Show: ""I support the president’s ability to try to negotiate trade deals that other presidents have had — that’s the Trade Promotion Authority. And if the president and his team can get a good deal with the 12 Pacific rim nations — this Trans-Pacific Partnership — I will be supportive of a good deal. I won't support a bad deal."" • Nov. 5, 2015, statement applauding the public release of the deal: ""I look forward to having extensive dialogue with Virginians about the provisions of the deal."" So Kaine is right that he never took an official stance on TPP and has always advocated for labor and environmental provisions. But in recent weeks, he’s also praised the deal without saying he would support it. (The Senate voted for fast-track authority in June 2015, but TPP itself has yet to be ratified. Given that Clinton and Donald Trump are both against the deal, supporters are hoping a lame-duck Congress will pass it before 2017.) ""I see much in the TPP draft — which has now been public and apparent to everybody for quite a while — that I like,"" he said to Politico on July 11. ""There’s one piece that I’m still really digging into is the dispute resolution."" ""I am having discussions with a lot of groups around Virginia about the treaty itself. I see much to like. I think it’s an upgrade of labor standards, I think it’s an upgrade of environmental standards. I think it’s an upgrade of intellectual property protections,"" he told the Intercept on July 21, a day before Clinton announced him as her VP pick. Kaine then formally came out opposing TPP when he officially joined the ticket. When asked how Obama felt about Kaine’s shift on the deal, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he’d let Kaine speak for himself. Our ruling Kaine said, ""I haven’t switched my position"" on TPP. Though Kaine voted to give Obama fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals, a piece of legislation that paved the groundwork for TPP, he never took an official position on the deal itself. Throughout 2015, he reiterated he would oppose the deal if it didn’t have strong environmental and labor provisions. But in July 2016, Kaine repeatedly praised TPP for including those exact protections. Days later, as Clinton’s running mate, he came out against the trade deal.

Pro-Trump super PAC ad misleads on Clintons' wealth, foundation cash link
","A super PAC backing Donald Trump, Rebuilding America Now, released a new ad attacking Hillary Clinton. It’s running in the battleground states of Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, and it hits both Hillary and Bill Clinton on their personal finances. The ad, which PAC chairman and Florida Gov. Rick Scott unveiled on NBC’s Meet the Press, opens with a clip of Hillary Clinton saying that when she and Bill left the White House, they were dead broke (a claim we rated Mostly False). As the logo of the Clinton Foundation appears on the screen, the narration begins. ""A foundation was created, and money started to roll. Speeches, connections and donations. Misogynistic regimes, Wall Street insiders, corrupt dictators. They all had one thing in common: Their check cleared. The Clintons are now worth in excess of $100 million."" Anyone watching the ad would get the sense that somehow through the Clinton Foundation, the Clintons amassed a net worth of over $100 million in about 15 years. That’s misleading, for a few reasons. Let’s start with the $100 million-plus in net worth. We reached out to the super PAC, through its website and with an email to one of the Republican strategists behind it, to get its sources and did not hear back. The ad itself points to something published in Fortune on Feb. 2, 2015. We couldn’t find a matching article. We did find a later article from September 2015 in Fortune that estimated Hillary Clinton’s net worth at about $30 million. In October 2015, Forbes wrote, ""After layering years of disclosures on top of annual tax returns, Forbes estimates their combined net worth at $45 million."" The most current estimate comes from Hillary Clinton’s federal financial disclosure filing, something she had to provide as a presidential candidate. That form states explicitly that the assets of both the candidate and his or her spouse must be included. The values are reported in ranges. On the low end, the Clintons reported assets of $11.3 million. On the high end, they might have as much as $52.7 million. The couple listed no liabilities. Kathleen Clark, a specialist in government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the only significant item those forms don’t include is real estate. ""You don’t need to report the value of the home you live in,"" Clark said. ""And that goes for a second home, too. So long as you don’t rent it out for income."" The Clinton’s own two homes, one in New York and one in Washington, D.C. Together they are worth about $9 million. When we add it up, the highest amount we could find is about $62 million. The Clintons have done very well. Between multi-million dollar book contracts and speaking fees of $225,000 or more, they have earned an estimated $230 million in the 15 years since they left the White House. But income is not wealth. As high as those earnings are, that still doesn’t bring them close to the $100 million mark, much less take them beyond it. We found several articles that said Bill Clinton has a net worth of $80 million, but none said how they got that number. By law, his assets must also be disclosed on his wife’s federal filing. The ad’s claim about the role of the Clinton Foundation is suggestive but unclear. The foundation has grown rapidly, raising over $2 billion to fight AIDS, reduce hunger and poverty, and rein in climate change. It has received millions from several Middle Eastern kingdoms, mega-wealthy businessmen and major corporations. The ad doesn’t say how that money translates into cash for the Clintons. In point of fact, according to the foundation’s tax filings and its website, none of the Clintons are paid by the foundation. Our ruling The super PAC Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump entity, said that the Clintons built a net worth of over $100 million after creating the Clinton Foundation. While some unsourced articles have used that number, official documents and the assessments of other, more rigorous reports show a net worth between $11 million and about $53 million. Even after accounting for the value of their two homes, the highest figure we found was $62 million. There is no evidence that money given to the Clinton Foundation has made its way into the Clintons’ pockets. The Clintons have become wealthy since its creation, but the ad hints darkly at shady dealings without proof. The statement twists a grain of truth to paint a misleading picture. We rate this statement Mostly False. Editor's note: After we published, the Super PAC Rebuildng America Now sent us their supporting material on wealthy donors to the Clinton Foundation, speaking fees, and a corrected link to an article citing the Clintons' net worth. That article stated the amount as an estimate without any source provided. The fact-check and rating remain unchanged. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b3c130e-a1a9-4ec6-b341-3af704b071d7",/factchecks/2016/aug/07/america-rising-now/pro-trump-super-pac-ad-wrong-clinton-wealth/

NC Sen. Richard Burr says nuclear deal 'will arm Iran'
","The United States is the world’s largest arms dealer, but Iran is one country the government usually doesn’t like doing business with. Yet on the heels of a Wall Street Journal article on connections between the Iran nuclear deal, prisoner swaps and $400 million in cash being secretly flown to that country, Republican U.S. Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina said President Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton paved the way for Iran to expand its military strength. ""The administration, including President Obama and Secretary Clinton, is responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran, the number one state sponsor of terrorism,"" Burr said in a press release Wednesday. Previous PolitiFact articles have found it’s False to say the Iran deal will allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons, since it actually does the opposite. But Burr made a broader statement, saying the deal ""will arm Iran"" in general, with no specific mention of nukes. We wondered if that, too, was wrong. Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is seeking re-election to a third term in the Senate. He faces Democratic challenger Deborah Ross. A nuclear armed Iran? Iran was within two or three months of building eight to 10 nuclear weapons before the deal was signed in July 2015, according to the Obama administration. The deal forced destruction or removal of nuclear equipment and the loss of 97 percent of Iran’s enriched uranium. Iran also had to promise never to build or buy a nuke. For a good refresher on the deal, see PolitiFact’s ""6 things to know about the Iran deal."" It will be allowed to enrich uranium again starting in a decade, but only for research and power plants. International inspectors will be tasked with ensuring it’s not enriching uranium more than 3.67 percent. Approximately 90 percent enrichment is necessary to make a bomb. And even after some restrictions sunset (others never do), wrote Brookings Institution senior fellow Richard Nephew, Iran will still be subject to other nuclear treaties – and violations ""permit the United States and its partners to respond with a range of options, up to and including the use of military force."" Non-nuclear weapons Burr’s spokesperson, Taylor Holgate, told us Burr really meant that the Iran deal gives the pariah nation more money and access to buy other, non-nuclear weapons. ""With more resources including access to global markets and this most recent injection of $400 million, Iran will continue and even grow its nefarious efforts via its military and proxies in the region,"" Holgate said. Like with nukes, the Iran deal does not literally arm Iran with conventional weapons either. No one sent weapons to Iran in exchange for giving up its nuclear work. But since Burr’s office clarified his remarks as being about about money, we’ll take a look at that, too. As part of the deal, countries that had frozen Iranian-owned bank accounts will release that money. Estimates range from $56 billion to $150 billion, plus the $400 million from the U.S. that inspired Burr’s original claim. That’s enough money to buy some serious military gear. Unfortunately for Iran, it can’t. The nuclear deal did not lift a worldwide embargo on selling such weapons as helicopters, tanks, artillery and missiles to Iran. That is set to remain in effect until October 2020, said Arms Control Association nonproliferation policy director Kelsey Davenport. She said the embargo could be lifted before then if inspectors think Iran is following the terms of the deal. But the U.S. and other world powers can put the embargo back in place. ""It can be snapped back into place by the (United Nations) Security Council through 2025 if one of the states party to the deal believes that Iran is violating the agreement,"" she said. Clinton’s role in the nuclear deal Burr attacked Clinton for the Iran deal, although it was actually her successor as Secretary of State, John Kerry, who finalized the deal. Clinton had been out of office more than two years by the time the U.S., Iran, China, Russia, France, Germany and United Kingdom signed it. However, that doesn’t mean Burr is wrong for including Clinton. She has claimed responsibility for the deal, too. ""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table,"" Clinton said previously. PolitiFact rated that Mostly True. Experts believe sanctions from her time in office did help bring Iran to the table, but so did sanctions passed both before and after her tenure. A separate settlement Burr’s statement attacking Clinton and Obama referenced a $400 million payment the U.S. reportedly made to Iran in January that the Wall Street Journal reported recently. However, that payment was made under Kerry, not Clinton. It was the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement over a failed 1979 arms deal. The U.S. took $400 million for a delivery of fighter jets but never sent them or gave back the cash after Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the king, who had himself consolidated power in a 1953 CIA-sponsored coup. Burr and his spokesperson both referenced that January payment as something that could help Iran buy weapons. However, the Wall Street Journal also quoted CIA Director John Brennan saying the U.S. is monitoring the money. There was no mention of concerns over military spending. ""The money, the revenue that’s flowing into Iran is being used to support its currency, to provide moneys to the departments and agencies, build up its infrastructure,"" Brennan reportedly said. Our ruling Sen. Richard Burr said that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are ""responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran."" That’s not true in a strictly literal sense, except for the fact that Obama and Clinton (and John Kerry) are responsible for the Iran deal, along with Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Iran is not being given any weapons, and in fact it is giving up some very powerful weapons it was on the verge of developing. However, if Iran plays by the rules, it will have access in the future to weapons dealers and to billions of dollars in cash that it can’t legally access now. There’s no guarantee it will happen, but it will if everything goes according to plan. Essentially, the deal does not arm Iran but could allow Iran to better arm itself. We rate this claim Half True because it’s partially accurate but leaves out important details.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a847c865-1a11-4e90-8090-fa9a6d8ebd8b",/factchecks/2016/aug/05/richard-burr/nc-sen-richard-burr-says-nuclear-deal-will-arm-ira/

State money for SolarCity buys more than 500 jobs
","Buffalo developer Carl Paladino, who’s no fan of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has worked to boost Donald Trump’s electoral chances in New York State. Now, he’s showering praise on Trump’s pick for vice president, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and he’s using Cuomo as his foil. Speaking to The Buffalo News at the Republican National Convention, Paladino praised Pence’s jobs record. ""I've been reading up on Pence. Pence created 2,000 jobs with an investment that cost about $5,000 per job. Andrew Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job,"" Paladino said, referring to Buffalo’s SolarCity project. ""It's so obviously incompetent, if not corrupt."" Cuomo’s investment in the SolarCity project, seen by many as a boost for Buffalo, has been criticized by others. Is Paladino right about Cuomo’s effort in Buffalo? Indiana’s 2,000 new jobs Paladino did not reply to our request on what formed the basis for his claim. Abby Gras of the Indiana Economic Development Corp. - a state entity similar to Empire State Development - pointed to one possibility. Subaru of Indiana Automotive announced last year it would create 1,204 jobs in Lafayette, Indiana. The state offered the company up to $7.9 million in performance-based tax credits, which comes out to roughly $6,500 per job. While not the numbers Paladino cited, he came close. The economic development agency has said the average investment in performance based tax credit for jobs created statewide in 2016 was about $9,400 per job. Cost of SolarCity jobs When the RiverBend facility was announced, the state said it would invest $750 million to build the facility and buy equipment that SolarCity needs to open. The state does not give money directly to the company. The state invested the money on the condition the company creates more than 1,400 jobs in the Buffalo area. Initially the jobs were expected to be in manufacturing. Earlier this year, the company said it will still create the same number of jobs - but not all in manufacturing. As The News previously reported, more automation at the facility will mean fewer manufacturing workers will be needed. SolarCity said it is still committed to a minimum of 500 manufacturing positions at RiverBend, while other positions will be shifted to sales, project development and other functions. If you count only the 500 manufacturing jobs, Paladino's statement would be correct. Spending $750 million on a facility for 500 manufacturing jobs comes out to $1.5 million per job. But the company’s agreement with the state calls for creating 1,460 jobs in the Buffalo area. The company also agreed to invest $5 billion in New York State and create 5,000 jobs statewide. If the company doesn’t fulfill its end of the bargain, it has to pay the state $41 million in penalties per year. Based on those numbers the cost per job for the company's commitment statewide is $160,000 per job, but the state says that’s not a fair way to look at it. ""The problem with using grade school math to analyze an economic development project of this magnitude is that it doesn’t take into account the multi-billion dollar investment from SolarCity, and impact of the thousands of direct and indirect jobs that will be created statewide,"" said Jason Conwall from Empire State Development. ""When we evaluate supporting a project, we base our decision on all of its merits. So, while thousands of new jobs are part of the project, our investment is based on the project in its entirety, including the investment, new jobs and overall economic impact in both Western NY and New York State."" The state also owns the building and the equipment it bought, which the state can use to attract another company should SolarCity leave. In the meantime, the state says the project has created about 1,500 temporary construction jobs. This is not the first time the state has undertaken a project like this. Since 1997 the state has spent about $947 million over two decades building the NanoTech Complex in Albany. The building houses both the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering and 4,000 employees from more than 300 corporate partners. The original building was a $16.5 million investment that was built and equipped to attract companies interested in investing in nanotechnology. Since then, more than $20 billion has been invested by companies into work being done at the facility. The project has largely been a success, attracting corporate partners like IBM and Samsung. The same idea is now being replicated in a handful of cities upstate like Rochester where a photonics manufacturing facility is planned. Comparing both Experts say comparing the SolarCity project to Indiana’s tax incentive program is like apples to oranges. Indiana offers a simple tax break. New York State is building and equipping a factory. The value of New York’s approach – and thus the cost per job created – depends on what would happen if SolarCity fails. If New York State could find a new tenant or even sell the factory and equipment, the state’s investment per job is much lower than if the factory and equipment has no value if SolarCity leaves. Ron Deutsch from the Fiscal Policy Institute agreed the two situations were largely incomparable. Our ruling Carl Paladino referred to Buffalo’s SolarCity project when he said at the Republican National Convention that ""Cuomo will create maybe 500 jobs if it ever happens at all, at about $1.5 million per job. Paladino understated the number of jobs being created by SolarCity, which overstated the cost. The agreement between SolarCity and the state called for 1,460 total jobs to be created in Buffalo.   We rate this claim as False.",/factchecks/2016/aug/05/carl-paladino/state-money-solarcity-buys-more-500-jobs/

Obama claims positive relationship between Trans-Pacific Partnership and human rights in Malaysia
","Trying to rally support for the oft-criticized Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obama said it will go a long way to improving human rights conditions across the globe. Specifically, he said during a press conference with Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Loong, it will curb human trafficking in Malaysia. ""The same is true for things like human trafficking, where we've got a country like Malaysia taking really serious efforts to crack down on human trafficking,"" Obama said. ""Why? Because TPP says you need to."" We’ve rated two other claims from this press conference (a Mostly True on tariff cuts and a Half True on Vietnamese labor rights). Here, we look at the situation on the ground in Malaysia. Trafficking in Malaysia  Malaysia has long been classified a human trafficking-destination by the U.S. State Department. In its 2015 ""Trafficking in Persons"" report, the State Department said Malaysia was guilty of debt bondage, unfair recruitment, wage fraud and passport confiscation. Trafficking in the construction industry has long made Malaysia stand out, said Eric Edmonds, an economics professor at Dartmouth University. Sex trafficking is not as big a problem there, he said. The State Department has classified Malaysia among countries working toward better compliance with correcting human trafficking problems. This leads us to the TPP. Consistency plan The White House pointed us to the ""consistency plan"" negotiated between the United States and Malaysia, which sets out changes Malaysia must make in its legal codes and procedures before the agreement can enter into force. The plan also establishes a bilateral committee to handle any compliance complaints. Provisions within the plan include: preventing employers from withholding employees’ passports, ensuring fair recruitment practices, allowing trafficking victims to move freely between shelters and allocating resources to labor law enforcement and data collection. Prior to the TPP being finalized in October, Malaysia has taken other efforts to combat human trafficking. In June 2015, Malaysia amended its law to improve treatment of trafficking victims. Among the changes, Malaysia gave victims better access to government shelters, transitional housing and more victim-friendly restitution procedures. Cathleen Ciminio-Isaacs, a research associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a group that has been described as pro-trade, noted this was an example of complying with the TPP. Edmonds added Malaysia has worked to prevent trafficking in the construction industry, by pulling construction visas. If workers can’t come into the country via construction visas, it is unlikely trafficking will occur, he explained. ""A way to evaluate the success of the anti-trafficking factors is when we stop doing the things that allows there to be trafficking,"" Edmonds said. He said that this action would qualify as a ""crackdown,"" when defined as a serious effort having an impact. While pulling visas is not contained in the consistency plan, Edmonds said the administrative change came ""at the behest of the Obama administration."" He added that, although the cause-effect relationship between the TPP and these actions is ""loosy goosy,"" the TPP ""absolutely"" had a strong influence on legal changes that occurred while negotiations were underway. ‘Serious effort’ Experts we spoke to had slightly varied opinions on what a ""serious effort to combat human trafficking"" entails. But there is something being done. John Sifton, Asia Advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, had a stricter interpretation of Obama’s claim, saying ""serious efforts"" would require actual results on the ground. He said results, at least as of now, are lacking. ""Malaysia has promised to crack down on human trafficking,"" he said. ""Are they cracking down on human trafficking? No, not yet. They have a long way to go. The best way to describe the president’s language is he’s premature."" He added that it is likely Malaysia would change its legal code, but that implementation is a trickier proposition. Case in point, Sifton said, the number of prosecutions brought against trafficking in Malaysia is low. In 2015, the State Department reported, there were 38 prosecutions, down from 54 in 2014. There were seven convictions, up from three in 2014. The White House emphasized, however, that statistical evidence of declining trafficking, given the nature of the crime, will be hard to come by. Other experts said there is a ""serious effort"" happening. Alison Brysk, Mellichamp professor of global governance at the University of California, Santa Barbara, agreed that on-the-ground enforcement action hasn’t changed much. However, that doesn’t mean ""serious efforts"" aren’t being taken. Looking at the consistency plan, she said some of the provisions — such as its withholding passport provisions — are ""relevant and meaningful"" in terms of improving enforcement practices. ""If Malaysia is doing all of these things, than that is movement in the right direction,"" Brysk said. Our ruling Obama said Malaysia is ""taking really serious efforts to crack down on human trafficking"" due to the TPP.   Malaysia has been drafting changes to its legal code, experts told us, and already made legislative and administrative changes to combat human trafficking. Even if human trafficking numbers haven’t yet changed, experts said what Malaysia has done constituted a ""serious effort,"" and that the TPP had an influence.

Interior deportations down, at a 9-year low, border group says
","The National Border Patrol Council is speaking out against Hillary Clinton’s immigration plan, arguing it’s dangerous for all American families. The group says her stance on immigration expands policies under President Barack Obama that have created an ""era of no consequences."" Obama’s policies have decimated border security, the council says. ""For seven years, the president’s marketers sold him as the ‘Deporter in Chief.’ There was no truth behind that marketing campaign,"" the group said in a statement published July 28, coinciding with the last day of the Democratic National Convention. ""The truth is that those living in the U.S. illegally were less likely to be deported than under any previous administration. Interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low."" The line about interior deportations under Obama sliding 40 percent and reaching nine-year lows piqued our interest. The National Border Patrol Council did not respond to our requests for information on the data behind that statement. Donald Trump’s campaign posted on its website the council’s statement, but they did not respond for comments either. The National Border Patrol Council identifies as the official group representing 16,500 border patrol agents. It endorsed Donald Trump for president in March, saying it was the first time ever it endorsed a presidential candidate in the primaries. ICE immigration removals declining The Department of Homeland Security agencies include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles naturalization and permanent residency applications, among other things. ICE guided us to the agency’s most recent statistical report on immigration removals.  ICE says that in fiscal year 2015 (Oct. 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015) the agency began implementing the Obama administration’s ""clearer and more refined"" civil immigration enforcement priorities, with emphasis on the removal of convicted felons over non-criminals. As a result, there were fewer removals in fiscal 2015 (235,413) than in fiscal 2014 (315,943), ICE said. That’s a single-year decrease of 25.5 percent.   ‘Down 40 percent and at a nine-year low’ The National Border Patrol Council’s statement said ""interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low."" ICE’s fiscal 2015 immigration removals report distinguishes between interior and border removals. Interior removals account for individuals ""identified or apprehended in the United States by an ICE officer or agent."" These can include apprehensions from jails or elsewhere inside the country, immigration experts say. Border removals, meanwhile, refers to individuals removed by ICE who were ""apprehended by a CBP officer or agent while attempting to illicitly enter the United States at or between the ports of entry."" ICE says those individuals are also referred to as recent border crossers. These CBP apprehensions at or between ports of entry are then handled by ICE. Interior removals declined about 71 percent from 237,941 in fiscal 2009 (the first year Obama entered office), to 69,478 in fiscal 2015, based on ICE data.  And interior removals in fiscal 2015 were the lowest over the eight fiscal years noted in the ICE report. 
 We don’t have data before fiscal year 2008, according to Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank founded by Democratic and Republican senators that has researched the removal data. So it’s difficult to determine if interior deportations are at a 9-year low. But certainly interior deportations have dropped significantly. Immigration policy analysts have told us that interior deportations have decreased under Obama due to the administration’s priority on border apprehensions and on removing undocumented immigrants who pose threats to public safety. Our ruling The National Border Patrol Council said in a statement that ""interior deportations under Obama were down 40 percent and at a nine-year low."" The group did not return requests for comment, but we found ICE data that references ""interior"" and ""border"" removals. Using that data, there isn’t a 40 percent drop -- actually it's about 71 percent. Reports say interior or border removal data wasn’t broken down that way before fiscal 2008, so there isn’t a way to measure the 9-year low, though fiscal 2015 interior removals do represent an 8-year low. We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/aug/05/national-border-patrol-council/interior-deportations-down-9-year-low/
"['Terrorism', 'New York', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Nuclear deal allows Iran to access its frozen assets
","Speaking at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani took aim at the U.S. nuclear weapons deal with Iran last year. ""To defeat Islamic extremist terrorists, we must put them on defense. If they are at war against us, which they have declared, we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them,"" Giuliani said. ""This includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made - Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran that will eventually let them become a nuclear power and it’s putting billions of dollars back into a country that’s the world’s largest supporter of terrorism. We are actually giving them the money to fund the terrorists that are killing us and our allies. We are giving them the money. Are we crazy? Donald Trump will make sure any agreement with Iran meets the original goals of the U.N. and our allies - a non-nuclear Iran."" Republicans in Congress have opposed the nuclear deal. They tried to block it through a vote in the Senate, but the effort failed by two votes. Since then it’s been a talking point on the campaign trail both in national and statewide races. Is Giuliani right about the details of the Iran nuclear deal? ‘Billions of dollars’ to Iran A similar claim has been made before about the money Iran will receive under the deal. In March, Donald Trump said in Florida that Iran would be given $150 billion ‘for nothing’ as part of the deal. As PolitiFact has reported previously, the money already belongs to Iran and the final amount is expected to be closer to $50 billion. Giuliani did not specify an amount that Iran will receive. PolitiFact previously rated Donald Trump’s claim as False. Money to Iran The countries involved are not collectively writing a check to Iran. According to Richard Nephew from Columbia University, the money is revenue from oil and gas sales that foreign banks are forced to hold. With the sanctions lifted, Iran was expected to end up with about $50 billion after financial obligations and other matters, according to experts we spoke to and testimony from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Iran would not receive the money without U.S. permission. If the U.S. had not cut a deal with Iran, the funds would still be frozen under the sanctions. So while no taxpayer money goes to Iran, the U.S. allowed Iran to receive billions of dollars. It’s unclear how much money has been released to Iran. The sanctions were lifted when the deal was implemented earlier this year, but only the Iranian Central Bank knows exactly how much is available to the country. Sponsor of terrorism More than 30 years ago the U.S. State Department designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. The country remains on that list. Each year the State Department releases reports on international terrorism for Congress and the public. This year’s report was released in June. In a briefing with reporters to discuss the report, the department’s acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Justin Siberell called Iran the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Iran sponsors Hezbollah in Lebanon, terrorist groups in Gaza, and groups in Iraq and the Middle East. Experts we spoke to are mixed on whether the deal means Iran has increased terror funding. Matthew Kroenig from Georgetown University suggests that could happen. No experts had evidence that Iran's funding of terror groups had grown.  Our ruling At the Republican National Convention, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the United States is giving Iran billions of dollars under the Iran nuclear deal and that the money is being used to fund terrorists. He also called Iran the world’s largest supporter of terrorism. Giuliani is right that Iran ranks as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. The billions of dollars released to Iran was already Iran’s money, but could only be released with U.S. consent. On the last part of Giuiani's claim, experts have said it’s difficult to know whether Iran has used any of the money to sponsor terrorist groups. We rate this claim as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d81d1a7d-7aa5-47d8-b7e3-1859f23fc5b8",/factchecks/2016/aug/05/rudy-giuliani/no-one-writing-iran-check-under-nuclear-deal/

Donald Trump says he didn't see video of cash being transferred for ransom after all
","For two days, Donald Trump told rally audiences a detailed account of seeing video footage of stacks of cash being taken off an airplane, destined to pay Iran for the release of American hostages. Now, even Trump acknowledges that such video footage doesn’t exist. The issue emerged because news reports suggested that a $400 million cash payment from the U.S. government amounted to ransom for hostages held by Iran. Republicans have charged that a quid pro quo ran counter to longstanding U.S. policy not to pay ransom for hostages. The White House has responded that the payments were the conclusion of a decades-old dispute over funds frozen after the fall of the Shah of Iran and were not a ransom. But questions surrounding Trump’s depiction of video footage has distracted from the substantive policy dispute over whether and how such a payment should have been made. Almost from the moment Trump mentioned seeing the video, skeptics wondered whether it actually existed, because none had been publicly released. So what actually happened? What Trump said Trump addressed this topic at two different rallies. The first was an Aug. 3 rally in Daytona Beach, Fla.  Here’s what he said: ""I got up this morning, and I pick up the papers, and then I turn on the news, and I see $400 million being shipped in cash, they didn’t want dollars, it’s in different currencies, and it's being shipped overnight to Iran -- $400 million. … I look, and I'll never forget the scene this morning. And remember this: Iran -- I don't think you've heard this anywhere, but here -- Iran provided all of that footage, the tape, of taking that money off that airplane, right? $400 million in cash. … And they have a perfect tape done by obviously a government camera and the tape is of the people taking the money off the plane, right? That means that in order to embarrass us further, Iran sent us the tapes, right? It's a military tape. It's a tape that was a perfect angle, nice and steady. Nobody getting nervous because they're going to be shot because they're shooting a picture of money pouring off a plane."" The next day, he held a rally in Portland, Maine.  He said this: ""You saw that with the airplane coming in. Nice plane. And the airplane coming in. And the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians. You know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president, because we have a president who's incompetent."" Trump certainly makes it sound as if there’s video footage of the cash being hustled off a plane, and that he’s seen that footage. The backtrack But before the second rally was even held, his campaign had already backed off that claim. The Washington Post reported that late on Aug. 3 -- which was after the Daytona Beach event but before the Portland event -- Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to an email ""that asked if the footage Trump was referencing was actually widely shown video of a private plane landing in Switzerland in January with three American prisoners who had just been released by Iran, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian."" According to the Post, Hicks responded in an email, ""Yes. Merely the b-roll footage included in every broadcast."" (B-roll is a television industry term for pre-recorded videotape spliced into a live report.) Still, Trump went out and made the remarks again. After the second rally, Trump himself tweeted that he was referring to a different piece of video. ""The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!""  In other words, Trump had seen widely reported video footage of the hostages being released, but described it in some detail -- and incorrectly -- as showing stacks of money being unloaded from a plane. Here’s a still from the footage of the hostage transfer that was aired on U.S. television.  A final note On Aug. 5, several hours after Trump’s tweet, conservative websites including the Washington Free Beacon posted footage from what it called an Iranian documentary aired earlier this year in Iran. During a discussion of the hostage transfer, the documentary showed a brief image of a stack of pallets. According to the Free Beacon, ""The footage is part of a February documentary published by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency, which is affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The documentary purported to reveal behind-the-scenes details of the negotiations with the United States to free the American hostages. It maintains the negotiations were tied up in efforts to push the Iran nuclear agreement forward as it moved towards implementation."" The pallets in the footage are partially obscured, and it is too blurry to tell for sure whether these pallets hold piles of currency. ""Iran experts who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon said that it is impossible to verify if the images show the same pallets of cash transferred by the Obama administration,"" the Free Beacon reported. We checked with the Trump campaign to learn whether this was actually the video he was referring to, even though it didn’t show money ""pouring"" off a plane and even though it had not aired on U.S. news channels. We did not hear back. For now, we are going by Trump’s own statement, backed up by Hicks’ statement, that he was referring to a different video -- the widely aired footage that shows the hostages being released, without any money being transferred. Our ruling Trump said he had seen videotape ""of the people taking the money off the plane"" to pay ransom to Iran for hostages. He and his campaign now acknowledge that they were referring to a different video -- of the hostages themselves being freed -- that did not include any transfer of money from a plane.

Surprise! Faced with Zika, South Florida fosters a mess of mosquitoes
","The Zika outbreak in Miami has pointed out what Floridians and vacationers have known for years: There is no shortage of mosquitoes in the Sunshine State. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at an Aug. 3 briefing that the region’s experience in fighting the bloodsucking insects will help efforts to prevent the further spread of the virus. At last count, the state had 338 travel-related cases of Zika, but there have been at least 15 locally transmitted instances — 13 in Miami and two in Broward County. ""We know the mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country,"" Earnest said. He added that prior experience dealing with other mosquito-borne diseases has established the expertise for how to deal with outbreaks like this one. As anyone who has ever attended an outdoor concert or Little League game can confirm, Florida sure does have a lot of winged menaces. But do we really have more than most other communities? PolitiFact Florida didn’t have to go camping in July to quickly learn that the answer is unequivocally yes, for many reasons. A vacation for vectors Zika is a virus named after the Zika Forest in Uganda, where it was first discovered in 1947. Several cases were documented in Africa and Asia over the decades until the disease made it to a couple of Pacific island nations in 2007 and 2013. The current pandemic took off in May 2015, when Brazil reported cases of Zika in connection with an increase in babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. With evidence that the disease can be spread both through sexual contact and via mosquito bites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there are more than 50 countries and territories with active Zika transmissions. The World Health Organization provides periodic updates of cases, and has tracked hundreds of thousands of confirmed and suspected infections in the Americas. Symptoms of the virus include fever, rash, joint pain and headaches or muscle pain, although almost four out of five infected people don’t show symptoms. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, so focus has been on prevention. The CDC has issued a travel warning for pregnant women and their partners to not travel to Wynwood, the neighborhood north of downtown Miami where the new cases appeared. About those mosquitoes A main culprit for the spread of the disease is mosquitoes, especially a species called Aedes aegypti. It is known for carrying tropical maladies like yellow and dengue fevers. Aegypti is not a fan of cold, northern winters. It lives across the southern United States, where it can generally survive all year long. That means the insect is just as fond of Florida as the snowbirds and sunbelters it feasts upon. The White House did not specify to us whether Earnest meant Florida had the most mosquitoes or the most different kinds of mosquitoes, but experts told us that’s largely irrelevant. What Earnest said is that the mosquito population in South Florida is larger than many other places in the United States, and that’s undoubtedly correct. The Sunshine State is a veritable mosquito encyclopedia, with about 80 species found here. American Mosquito Control Association technical adviser Joe Conlon, a retired Navy entomologist, pointed out Texas has 85 species, but ""when you’re talking about 80 versus 85, it doesn’t matter; it’s a lot."" Exactly how many individual mosquitoes are in any one place is an uncountable number. There’s no way to take a comprehensive mosquito census, although there are ways to get a rough idea. Various traps can count eggs and larvae in standing water, or the number and species of captured adult mosquitoes and extrapolate from there. Florida’s 61 mosquito control programs regularly conduct such surveys to determine if they need to spray or raise public awareness about preventing mosquito populations from growing. Of course, aegypti is an especially sneaky species that is notoriously difficult to count, Conlon said. Individuals can breed in multiple places, and adults tend to avoid traps. (Note: Only female mosquitoes bite.) If you’re wondering whether Florida is the most popular home for the particular aegypti species, there’s just no way to know that. New Orleans, for example, historically has more aegypti in terms of sheer numbers. That city and Memphis, Tenn., have experienced major mosquito-borne outbreaks in the past. That’s because mosquitoes flourish in hot climates with lots of standing water. Florida’s heat, humidity, rainfall and topography combine to make the state a garden spot for more than just New Yorkers escaping state income taxes. With salt marshes, the Everglades and plenty of man-made pools of water, South Florida faces an even bigger threat. ""Indeed, they have some of the worst mosquito problems on Earth there,"" Conlon said. Even if there were a way to take a comprehensive count of mosquitoes in an area, that number would never remain constant. ""Mosquito populations fluctuate over time and at any given point in time the mosquito population in Newburyport, Mass., may be greater than that in North Miami,"" University of Florida Entomologist Jonathan Day, of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory in Vero Beach, told us in an email. ""However, over the long run (for example, an entire year), South Florida mosquito populations are likely consistently higher than those observed in other communities in the country."" Our ruling Earnest said, ""The mosquito population in South Florida is larger than it is in many other communities in the country."" There’s little doubt about that. Mosquito populations can go up or down anywhere, but experts said the conditions in South Florida sustain a large and diverse collection of the insects essentially all year long. Be safe out there, and don’t forget the DEET. This may not be a biting revelation, but we rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/93f73910-214f-40e5-9e4d-b76af85889a8",/factchecks/2016/aug/05/josh-earnest/surprise-zika-south-florida-fosters-mosquitoes/

Donald Trump wrongly says Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on the middle class
","Hillary Clinton just admitted to a big tax hike, at least according to Donald Trump. The Trump campaign sent an email blast to supporters embedded with a video of a Clinton event in Omaha, Neb., entitled, ""Hillary Clinton says she wants to ‘raise taxes on the middle class.’"" The subtitles of Clinton’s speech read: ""Trump wants to cuts taxes for the super rich. Well, we’re not going there, my friends. I’m telling you right now, we’re going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class."" ""Wait what?"" the videos continues, before playing the damning sentence in slow motion: ""We are going to raise taxes on the middle class."" ""Wait, what?"" was the reaction of the Clinton campaign too. Spokesman Josh Schwerin told us Clinton actually said the exact opposite. He pointed to numerous reporters who agreed and forwarded us a transcript of Clinton’s prepared remarks that reads, ""We aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class."" It’s a classic case of she-heard-he-heard, so we asked experts to arbitrate. They agreed with the Clinton camp and offered some technical evidence to prove it. Get ready for some science. Alan Yu, a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago who specializes in phonology, ran the audio through a computer program called Praat, which analyzes phonetics. By analyzing the sound waves, we can see that Clinton was saying ""aren’t,"" because she definitely pronounced the ""n,"" though she didn’t really hit the ""t."" Here’s a screenshot of the results:  As you can see, the phoneme (unit of sound) highlighted in pink is an ""n,"" though there’s not a ""t."" That still suggests she was trying for the word ""aren’t."" ""It is pretty common for people to not release the final ‘t in word-final -nt clusters and is definitely not likely for someone to release the ‘t’in a three-consonant sequence like ‘ntg’ in ‘aren't going,’"" Yu told us. ""In any case, since she did pronounce the ‘n’ in ‘aren't’, it is clear that she produced the negated form of the copula ‘are.’"" Edward Flemming, a linguistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also ran the audio through Praat and came up with the same results. But even if we didn’t have Praat, he said, context alone sways the argument in the Clinton camp’s favor. ""Also if she was going to say ‘we are going to’, wouldn’t she contract it to ‘we’re’, as she does a few words earlier?"" Flemming pointed out. ""To my ears, it is clear that she is saying ‘aren’t’."" Clinton’s tax plan, by the way, does not change the tax rates for the middle class and instead targets the wealthy through small reforms. Our ruling The Trump campaign said, ""Hillary Clinton says  she wants to, ‘raise taxes on the middle class.’ "" According to the transcript, numerous reporters, experts and a computer program, Clinton said the exact opposite.

Feinstein’s claim about marijuana ads on ‘prime time’ TV goes up in smoke
"," Editor’s Note: A week after we published our fact check, a Sacramento Superior Court judge ordered campaigns for and against Prop 64 to soften their claims about what the initiative would do. The No on Prop 64 campaign was ordered to change claims similar to Feinstein’s statement at the center of this fact check. Claims such as ""marijuana smoking ads will be legal on all broadcast primetime shows"" were dialed back to ""could be allowed."" On the Yes on 64 side, however, the judge ruled there should be ""No change"" to that campaign’s statement that ""Nothing in 64 makes it legal to show marijuana ads on TV. Federal law prohibits it!"" We continue to view Feinstein’s claim that Prop 64 ""allows"" recreational marijuana ads on TV as misleading. Had the senator said Prop 64 could open the door, someday, to recreational marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate. We continue to rate her statement Mostly False. Californians will decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana through Proposition 64, a much-debated measure on the state’s ballot. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-CA, who opposes Prop 64, says a green light for the initiative could strip away advertising rules and dramatically change what’s seen on TV. Prop 64 ""allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers,"" Feinstein said on July 12, 2016, in a No On Prop. 64 campaign press release. We know Prop 64 would allow Californians to legally smoke pot in their homes, yards and possibly in designated shops where it’s sold and regulated. But would it also lead to marijuana ads on ""prime time"" TV? Or is Feinstein blowing smoke? We decided to fact-check the senator’s statement. Half-baked claim? Prop 64 is backed by Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Democratic Party. Recreational marijuana is already legal in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. Several states in addition to California are set to decide on legalizing pot in November. Feinstein’s office did not expand on her statement. Instead, it referred us to the No On Prop. 64 campaign. The campaign pointed us to Prop 64’s chapter on advertising and marketing restrictions, specifically Section 26151. It states: ""Any advertising or marketing placed in broadcast, cable, radio, print and digital communications shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older, as determined by reliable, up-to-date audience composition data."" Wayne Johnson, spokesman for No On Prop. 64, said the 71.6 percent threshold is so low that only a few shows, such as Saturday morning cartoons, would be prohibited from airing marijuana ads. ""It’s a ridiculous standard,"" Johnson said. ""It only applies to the tiniest handful of shows.""  In this photo taken on Thursday, May 26, 2016, Sarah Seiter, curator of the exhibit ""Altered State: Marijuana in California"" handles a cannabis leaf with gloved hands at the Oakland Museum in Oakland, Calif.  Ben Margot / AP Claim ignores federal law TV and legal experts say Feinstein’s statement ignores federal law, which classifies marijuana as an illegal drug and prohibits advertising it on television. ""If Prop 64 passes, nothing will change in terms of what radio and television stations can legally broadcast,"" said Joe Berry, president of the California Broadcasters Association. ""The federal government licenses the radio and TV stations in California. The federal government’s position is that marijuana is an illegal substance. So, it’s illegal to advertise that substance."" Berry added: ""The stations themselves are federally licensed. So, there is a risk to the license for the station at license renewal."" Experts said cable and satellite television services would likely be subject to similar restrictions. They point to Section 843 of the Controlled Substances Act, which specifically prohibits using ""communications facilities"" to transmit advertisements for the sale of Schedule I drugs, which includes marijuana, heroin and ecstasy, among others. The law was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Nixon in 1970. It defines ""communications facilities"" as any and all public and private instrumentalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds of all kinds and includes mail, telephone, wire, radio, and all other means of communication.""  Marijuana leaf (AP photo) Legality a cloudy issue Others say the legality of advertising marijuana on television -- particularly in states that have legalized the drug -- remains cloudy, at best. ""There is no (Federal Communications Commission) rule that prohibits such advertisements in states with legalized cannabis,"" Kathleen Kirby, a media lawyer based in Washington D.C., told PolitiFact California in an email. A spokeswoman at the FCC could not point us to one, and declined to elaborate on the subject. Kirby said several of her clients in states where pot is legal have been approached to run marijuana advertisements. ""I don’t say no, but I counsel,"" regarding the lack of clarity, Kirby told the American Bar Association in an online article. Kirby noted in the December 2015 article that all of her clients had decided to hold off on the ads. She added in her email to PolitiFact California that federal law ""would need to change to make accepting such ads risk free. The feds have more or less signaled that they will look the other way, but you never know with changes in administration or even changes in federal prosecutors."" No TV ads in other states In recent years, federal drug enforcement authorities have taken a ‘hands-off’ approach on the sale and cultivation of marijuana in states that have legalized and regulated the drug. That doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll look the other way on federal advertising rules, said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University and editor of the Marijuana Law, Policy and Reform blog. A local TV station in Colorado had planned to run the nation’s first marijuana TV advertisement in 2015, but backed away over concerns about federal rules. Stations have yet to air any marijuana ads on television, Berman said. Those ads would be treated ""from a federal regulatory perspective as equivalent to if you were broadcasting (ads for) heroin,"" the law professor added. The Yes on Proposition 64 campaign filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court in early August demanding what they described as ""false and/or misleading statements"" -- including the claim about marijuana ads on TV at the center of this fact check -- be removed from the official ballot arguments submitted by the measure’s opponents. Efforts to change federal law are underway. But it’s unclear if, when and how much the law will change. Berman said California’s provisions, if approved through Prop 64, could pave the way for advertising on TV, but only if the federal rules change first. ""It ain’t happening anytime soon,"" he said. ""Certainly, it’s not something that’s going to automatically happen based on how California votes this fall."" Our ruling California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein recently said the state’s pot legalization initiative ""allows marijuana smoking ads in prime time, on programs with millions of children and teenage viewers."" Proposition 64 includes a provision that marijuana advertisements ""shall only be displayed where at least 71.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 years of age or older."" If Feinstein had said Prop 64 helps pave the way for marijuana ads on TV, that might have been accurate. But experts say Feinstein’s claim, as she stated it, is misleading. The federal Controlled Substances Act bans TV stations from advertising illegal substances, including marijuana. There’s an element of truth to Feinstein’s statement: The FCC doesn’t have a rule expressly prohibiting marijuana television ads in states that legalize the drug. And federal authorities could choose to ignore the Controlled Substances Act. Still, the experts we spoke with say California’s Prop 64 will not lift the legal cloud of uncertainty by itself. Feinstein’s statement goes too far. We rate her claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim about doing better than Kelly Ayotte in N.H. polls
","Presidential nominee Donald Trump waded into New Hampshire’s U.S. Senate race this week, claiming he is doing better than fellow Republican Kelly Ayotte in statewide polls. ""You have a Kelly Ayotte, who doesn’t want to talk about Trump, but I’m beating her in the polls by a lot,"" Trump told the Washington Post in an interview on Aug. 2. ""I don’t know Kelly Ayotte. I know she’s given me no support, zero support, and yet I’m leading her in the polls."" Do the numbers bear that out? We took a closer look. Of course, the Republican businessman is running for president, not against Ayotte for Senate. But we interpreted his comment as saying he is having a better showing in polls in New Hampshire. Trump didn’t name any specific polls in his interview, and his campaign did not provide source material or respond to a request for comment. So we looked at their favorability ratings among the state’s voters, and also examined how tight their races are in New Hampshire. We turned to RealClearPolitics.com, which tracks polling data and calculates an average of the most recent voter surveys. The site’s New Hampshire presidential polling average showed that on Aug. 2, when Trump made the comment, Democrat Hillary Clinton led the businessman in the state, 43.25 percent to 40.5 percent, a margin of nearly three percentage points. By contrast, the RealClearPolitics.com polling average for the state’s U.S. Senate race showed that Ayotte was virtually tied with Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan, 45.8 to 45.2 percent, on the same day. Those averages have since changed slightly. WBUR released a new poll two days after Trump’s interview that showed both Democrats widening their leads in New Hampshire. Clinton led Trump by 15 percentage points, the new survey showed, while Hassan led Ayotte by 10. So, not only is Trump not ""beating (Ayotte) in the polls by a lot,"" he’s not beating her in the polls at all. Ayotte is doing better than Trump in New Hampshire. Just to be extra careful, we also checked to see whether there was a period in which Trump was performing better against Clinton than Ayotte was against Hassan but couldn’t find one in the RealClearPolitics.com archive. How about favorability ratings, which show how warmly voters feel towards a candidate, rather than whether they would or would not vote for them in an election matchup? The most recent WMUR Granite State Poll, released in late July, showed that Trump had a net favorability of negative 29 percent, while Ayotte scored a positive two percent net favorability rating. (Net favorability refers to the candidate’s favorability score minus his or her unfavorability score.) Specifically, the survey found 32 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, while 61 percent had an unfavorable opinion of the businessman. Six percent were neutral. And the poll showed that 42 percent of state voters had a favorable opinion of Ayotte, 40 percent had an unfavorable view, seven percent were neutral and 11 percent didn’t know enough to say. The WBUR poll, released on August 4 after Trump’s comment, showed similar patterns. Twenty-nine percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Trump, it found, while 60 percent had an unfavorable opinion, with 10 percent are undecided. The same poll showed 42 percent of New Hampshire voters had a favorable view of Ayotte, compared to 38 percent who had an unfavorable opinion. Sixteen percent were undecided and three percent hadn’t heard of her or refused to answer. So the two recent polls showed that Ayotte’s favorability rating in the Granite State was far higher than Trump’s. Our ruling Trump said he is beating Ayotte in the polls ""by a lot."" However, Ayotte recent surveys have shown that New Hampshire voters view Ayotte more favorably than Trump. The polls also indicate that Ayotte is locked in a closer race against her Democratic challenger than Trump.
