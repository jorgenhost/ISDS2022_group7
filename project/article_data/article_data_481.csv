Gov. Rick Perry says Texas has created more than 850,000 jobs, more than the other states combined
","
In a recent TV ad, Gov. Rick Perry boasts that Texas is ""open for business."" 
""We've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined,"" Perry says in the Sept. 12 spot. An Aug. 24 Houston Chronicle headline appears on the screen: ""By any measure, Texas tops nation in job creation."" 
The Perry campaign pointed us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks jobs in each state. In January 2001, shortly after Perry became governor, Texas had 9,542,400 nonfarm jobs. As of June: 10,395,800. That's a net gain of 853,400 jobs, a surge of 8.9 percent. From July 2000 to July 2009, the state grew by about 3.8 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Texas, the second-largest state, has created more jobs than any other state in Perry's time as governor. Arizona created the second-most jobs, 132,700, followed by Utah with 113,200. 
Twenty states and the District of Columbia have enjoyed a net job gain during Perry's tenure, while California, the most populous state, has lost the most jobs: 827,800. Michigan lost the second most, 755,900, followed by Ohio, at 557,300. 
Excluding Texas and including the District of Columbia, which had a net gain of 59,100 jobs, all the states combined had a net job loss of 3,185,000 from January 2001 to June 2010. 
Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, confirmed that Perry is correct in saying that Texas added more jobs than all the other states combined. ""Texas was one of the very few who even added jobs over that time,"" she said. 
That's not to say that Texas hasn't lost jobs. At its peak, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs in August 2008. About a year later, when the recession was in full swing, only 10.21 million jobs were on the payroll — about 430,000 less. Since, Texas has added about 180,000 jobs. That's about 250,000 fewer than its best. 
Worth noting: the Houston Chronicle article that the ad highlights looks at Texas job gains during that recent upswing, from July 2009 to July 2010 — just the past year of Perry's tenure as governor. 
We also wondered how many jobs were created in the state government — Perry's domain. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, Texas had 334,100 state government jobs in 2001, the year Perry took office, and 369,800 in 2009 — an increase of 35,700 jobs, or 10.7 percent, on Perry's watch. 
Significantly, Perry doesn't overtly take personal credit for the state leading the nation in jobs gained over his years as governor. We rate his statement as True. 
This story has been updated to correct the month that Perry became governor. He succeeded George W. Bush on December 21, 2000, not in January 2001. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7C88C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/23/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-has-created-more-850000-/

GOP says Alex Sink gave bonuses to state pension workers who lost billions
","
Millions of Americans had that stomach-churning feeling when the headlines announced another bad day on Wall Street as stock and bond markets plunged in value. People watched helplessly as investment nest eggs cracked, leaving many -- particularly seniors -- worried they would never recover what they had dutifully built up in savings.

That raw fear is exploited in a new statewide television ad paid for by the Republican Party of Florida on behalf of the Rick Scott for governor campaign and against Democrat Alex Sink. The 30-second ad began airing on Sept. 21, 2010. It opens with black and white photos of older people as a narrator says: ""You worked your whole life. You saved. It's your pension. You earned it. But with Alex Sink in charge, Florida’s pension fund has lost 24 billion dollars. That's not a typo. $24 billion -- gone.""

The ad continues: ""Experts even warned Sink she was making risky investments. Sink gave bonuses to staffers. They were hired to invest our seniors' money. Lost billions. Then Sink gave them bonuses. And now she wants a promotion?""

It's less than six weeks to the election, and television is loaded with ads that take facts or issues out of context. The Associated Press labeled the RPOF ad ""deceptive,"" and, within hours of its release, the Sink campaign sent out an e-mail statement firing back. That statement targeted Scott, claiming that the Florida pension fund lost money when his former company, Columbia/HCA, was hit with fraud charges and the pension fund had to sue his company.

To get to the truth and put the GOP ad in perspective, there are four questions to probe here. One is: Did the Florida pension fund lose $24 billion and is it ""gone?"" A second is whether Sink was ""in charge?"" Did experts warn her ""she was making risky investments?"" And, did Sink give ""bonuses to staffers"" who lost billions?

Let’s start with some background. Sink is Florida’s chief financial officer and is required by law to sit as one of three members of the  Board of Trustees on the State Board of Administration. The board has oversight authority over the state's largest pension fund, known as the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund. The other members of the board are Gov. Charlie Crist and Attorney General Bill McCollum.

Losses

The trust fund is a massive investment account, today worth about $117 billion and holding the retirement assets of about 1 million current and retired state employees, as well as some local police and firefighters. It is one of the largest retirement funds in the nation, even the world. According to the last actuarial report completed in 2009, the fund is 88.5 percent funded -- meaning if every employee retired today, they would get 88.5 percent of their retirement benefits. A funding level of 80 percent is considered healthy. 
So when Wall Street melted down, and stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets began their steep decline in 2008, the value of Florida's retirement fund fell, too. Did the retirement fund lose $24 billion? RPOF does the math this way: On June 30, 2007, the fund was at its peak at $138.4 billion and by June 30, 2010, the value had declined to $109.34 billion, a $29 billion drop in value. 
The RPOF cites the $4.5 billion paid out to retirees in 2009-10 and concludes the net investment loss is $24.56 billion. Their number is wrong for these reasons: First, the value of the fund was $136.4 billion, not $138.4 billion, in June 2007. And second, the party subtracted the 2009-2010 payments to retirees from that three-year loss, but failed to subtract the payments to retirees in the other two years as well. Those payments were $3.4 billion in 2007-2008 and $3.2 billion in 2008-2009. If they had subtracted all three years, the drop in value since 2007, then, is $15.96 billion. But party spokesman Dan Conston then said that none of the payouts should have subtracted unless new contributions from the state and other agencies were also added, and he didn’t provide those amounts. 
In addition to getting the number wrong, the ad also is inaccurate when it suggests that the money is gone. The loss in value represented a snapshot in time and since June 30, 2010, the trust fund had recovered $8 billion. By Sept. 21, 2010, when the ad began airing, the value of the fund was back to $117 billion, making the net change from the June 30, 2007, value just $8.3 billion.

It's become common to refer to drops in value as losses but, as Dennis MacKee, spokesman for the SBA, points out, ""These are changes in net asset values, (they) are not losses until you sell. You don't realize a loss in value until you sell the asset.""

We agree. The nature of investing is to see values rise and fall, and it is inaccurate to say that $24 billion of the state pension fund is ""gone"" when that number is wrong and it's not a permanent loss anyway.

In charge

State law requires the SBA to ""make purchases, sales, exchanges, investments, and reinvestments for and on behalf of the funds"" and ""see that moneys invested under the provisions of ss. 215.44-215.53 are at all times handled in the best interests of the state."" Does that mean Sink was ""in charge"" of the pension fund? According to the statute, the three-member board ""may retain investment advisers or managers, or both, external to in-house staff, to assist the board in carrying out the power specified,"" and the board ""shall create an audit committee to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.""

The SBA policy statement, which the trustees approve, requires that ""the Board delegates to the Executive Director the administrative and investment authority, within the statutory limitations and rules, to manage the investment of FRS assets.""

MacKee describes it this way: ""Trustees generally deal at a policy level while their appointees assist at a more strategic level."" Ash Williams is the SBA's executive director, and the job of investing the state's assets is divided between in-house investment managers and external investment managers.

The type of investment often determines whether the asset is managed internally or with an outside firm. For example, 60 percent of all domestic equities, foreign equity and fixed income investments are managed by external managers while most real estate, private equity and strategic investments are managed internally, MacKee said.

So as a trustee, Sink does not actually do the investing. The RPOF ad is carefully worded, and we agree it is accurate to say Sink was ""in charge,"" along with the two other trustees. But we believe  the implication that she had a broader role in investment outcomes is misleading.

Expert warnings

We asked RPOF what they were referring to when the ad said that ""experts even warned Sink she was making risky investments."" We’ve established it's inaccurate to say that Sink was making the investments, so let's look at whether she and the other trustees were warned. RPOF cited a Jan. 25, 2009, St. Petersburg Times story that cited audits warning the SBA that it was overexposed to risk and cited specifically the investment in a $5.4 billion apartment complex on 80 acres in Manhattan known as Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The investment was indeed a boondoggle, a real estate deal anchored down by both too much debt and too high a price tag. When the bonds on the property were downgraded and the investment eventually collapsed this year, Florida’s SBA was forced to write off its entire $250 million investment, a $266 million net loss.

It's a fair question to ask whether Sink, as a member of the SBA, asked enough questions and demanded enough answers when the agency auditors were raising these warnings. It is not accurate to imply that she alone was making the investments. Could Sink have done more? It's a good question but the ad doesn't ask; it concludes she knew all. MacKee said that with 15,000 individual securities and 36 managed investment funds with different investment objectives, the odds of large fluctuations in value are great depending on the daily shifts in the market. ""We've had the value of the pension fund in one day move by more than $1 billion…To think you’d have the opportunity with any governing board to look at individual investments -- it's not done at that level.""

Bonuses

The RPOF cites an April 16, 2008, story in the Palm Beach Post about bonuses handed out to 17 SBA employees ""from $371 to $2,500 for their work during an unprecedented two-week, $16 billion run of withdrawals."" In addition to the retirement account, the SBA manages the Local Government Investment Pool, which was facing a slew of withdrawals after news broke that the pool had lost value because of investments in risky, mortgage-backed securities.

The facts are more complicated. The losses in the Local Government Investment Pool were the result of investments in asset-backed commercial paper starting in 2000, before Sink was elected to office, MacKee said. Unlike the pension fund, which can handle the kind of volatility in those markets, the LGIP is ""managed as a liquidity fund, basically a bank account,"" he said. So when local governments started to see the value of the LGIP drop because of the risky securities, many panicked and started to withdraw money in droves -- $16 billion over two weeks in November 2007.

The bonus checks were in the works for more than a year before they were handed out, MacKee said. The SBA has an internal policy for allocating bonuses, based on a fixed set of performance measures reached by staff who manage the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund, MacKee said. The bonuses were distributed in January 2008 based on the performance of the retirement fund between June 2006 and June 2007, he said. That was the year the fund reached its peak of $136.4 billion. It was also the last time bonuses were paid, MacKee said, and ""the checks were cut in 2008 because you need to know what the performance was.""

Did Sink approve the bonuses? Not directly. It was included in the 2007-08 SBA budget, MacKee said, and Sink and the other trustees approved the budget. On this point, the RPOF is again misleading. More importantly, the ad inaccurately implies that the bonuses were linked to the investment losses.

Our ruling

Now let's return to the key claim, that state pension fund staffers ""lost billions. Then Sink gave them bonuses."" This ad accurately highlights Sink's oversight role of the state's pension fund but after that, this ad stretches the facts and misleads the viewer. The $24 billion is not gone. Sink did not personally make the risky investments or give bonuses to staffers, and the staff bonuses preceded the fund's loss in value. We rate the RPOF ad Barely True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB92B240>],/factchecks/2010/sep/23/republican-party-florida/gop-says-alex-sink-gave-bonuses-state-pension-work/

""Mourning in America"" ad echoing Reagan classic gets its numbers right
","
On Sept. 21, 2010, a group called Citizens for the Republic unveiled a television ad called ""Mourning in America,"" that mirrored, right down to its understated visuals and narration, a famous Ronald Reagan ad from his 1984 re-election campaign titled ""Morning in America."" Whereas the original ad exuded confidence and pride in the United States under Reagan's leadership, the new version -- aired by a group run by veterans of the Reagan administration -- presented a bleak look at the current state of the economy and a tone of sadness about the country's seemingly diminished prospects.

""There's mourning in America,"" the ad begins. ""Today, 15 million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work. Businesses shuttered. Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall. This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married, each of their children to be born with a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt.""

We won't judge whether these statistics support the idea that the country is ""fading,"" that President Barack Obama's policy has ""failed"" or the ad's exhortation to vote for a ""smaller, more caring government."" But we will look at each of the statistics mentioned in the ad. (The ad was put together by Fred Davis, a leading Republican ad-man. We discuss some of the ads he made this year in a story posted today.)

• ""Fifteen million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work."" According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, there were 14.9 million unemployed Americans in August. Close enough for us.

• ""Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall."" According to RealtyTrac, the leading authority on foreclosure statistics, ""lenders foreclosed on 95,364 U.S. properties in August (2010), the highest monthly total in the history of the report."" If you divide that total by 31 days, you get 3,076 foreclosures per day. That's actually a little more than the ad indicates.

• ""This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married."" This statistic was presumably included so the current ad would mirror the script of the one from 1984, which cited the then-rate of 6,500 marriages per day as evidence that couples were heading optimistically into the future. Since then, marriage rates have dropped, though it's not clear how much of this is due to economic conditions, as opposed to broader social and demographic trends.

The most recent figures from the National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency, show that there were 2,077,000 marriages in 2009. Dividing this total by 365 days, you get 5,690 marriages per day. That's a little lower than what the ad says -- by about 5 percent. Also, those who are really picky may quibble that the number of marriages completed on weekdays is a lot lower than 6,000, and it's a lot higher on weekend days. Still, the ad is pretty close.

• Each child born will have ""a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt."" At first, we were confused by this statistic because our reading of the ad's wording suggested that it should involve how many children were going to be born to couples who got married this year. But it turns out this statistic is much simpler than that. The ad writers divided the total estimate for the public debt at the end of 2010 ($9,297,653,000,000) by the total U.S. population (307,006,550) and came out with $30,286 for every man, woman and child.

In a recent item, we discussed the relative merits of two different measures for the national debt. One is debt held by the public (which the makers of ""Mourning in America"" used, and the other is that amount plus debt held by the government, typically in trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. When we asked economists for their opinion of which measurement is more relevant, each of the two statistics had its fans, so we concluded that both are legitimate measurements. For completeness, we'll note here that using the larger figure, called gross federal debt, the per-person debt load would be just shy of $45,000, which would only make the ad's argument stronger.

Put it all together and you have four statistics that are all very, very close to being accurate. So we rate the facts in the ad True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFCF980>],/factchecks/2010/sep/23/citizens-republic/mourning-america-ad-echoing-reagan-classic-gets-it/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Bill Clinton']","
Bill Clinton says his administration paid down the debt
","
UPDATE: This version corrects the percentage by which Clinton overestimated the amount his administration paid down the public debt. 
On the Sept. 19, 2010, edition of Meet the Press, former President Bill Clinton drew a contrast between his record on fiscal policy and those of the Republican presidents who preceded and succeeded him.

Asked about the fiscally conservative tea party movement, Clinton said, ""Well, first of all, I think that a lot of the voters who are voting for the tea party candidates have really good impulses. That is, they believe that for years and years and years, the people with wealth and power or government power have done well and ordinary people have not. That's true. They believe those in the Republican Party, believe that they've talked a good game about balancing the budget, but the debt was quadrupled in the 12 years before I became president, and then we paid down the debt for four years, paid down $600 billion on the national debt, and then my budget was abandoned and they doubled the debt again.""

After a reader sent us a blog post from NewsBusters, a conservative website, we were inspired to check Clinton's claim that during his tenure the U.S. ""paid down the debt for four years -- paid down $600 billion on the national debt.""

In the NewsBusters post, associate editor Noel Sheppard took issue with Clinton's portrayal. Pointing to the interactive federal debt calculator at TreasuryDirect.gov, he challenged readers to find any year in which the debt declined between Sept. 30, 1993, and Sept. 30, 2001 -- the years in which the Clinton Administration was directly responsible for putting together the budget.

""You can't, can you?"" Sheppard wrote. ""Want to know why? Well, because it never happened."" 
So who's right? It depends on what the definition of ""national debt"" is.

First, let's dispense with one common point of confusion. Every year, the federal government (or a business) either runs a surplus or a deficit. When there's a surplus, it means that more money came in than was spent; when there's a deficit, it means that more money was spent than came in.

Deficits are typically calculated on an annual basis. But if you add up all the past deficits (and subtract all the past surpluses), then the resulting figure, if it's negative, is the ""debt."" Unlike deficits, which start fresh every year, the debt is cumulative and continuous.

There are actually a few ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future.

The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the public debt will reach $9.3 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2010. Add in the $4.5 trillion in debt held by the government, and you come up with a gross federal debt of $13.8 trillion.

Now let's look at Clinton's tenure. Using the public debt figures, we see that the debt rose year by year during the first four fiscal years of Clinton's stewardship, then fell during each of the following four fiscal years, from a 1997 peak to a 2001 trough.

So using this measurement, Clinton is correct that ""we paid down the debt for four years,"" though he did overestimate the amount that was paid down when he said it was $600 billion. The actual amount was $452 billion -- which was equal to about 12 percent of the existing public debt in 1997.

But what about gross federal debt? On this score, NewsBusters is correct: In each fiscal year from 1993 to 2001, the gross federal debt increased, because the increase in money in government trust funds exceeded the annual decreases in the federal budget deficit.

So by one of these measures, Clinton is correct, and by another, he's wrong.

""The discrepancy between the two concepts of federal debt in these years occurred because of program surpluses and the rapid growth of reserves held by the various trust fund accounts, such as Social Security,"" said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. Social Security surpluses don't go into a ""lock box"" but are instead invested in government bonds; the proceeds of these purchases go into the general treasury, and when the bonds mature, the treasury is obligated to pay back the Social Security trust both principal and interest.

""The growth of these surpluses meant the rest of the federal government did not have to issue as much debt to the public,"" Burtless said. ""In fact, the federal government paid off more of its old debt than it issued new debt to the public. Therefore, net federal debt held by the public declined.""

So, is there any reason to prefer any single measurement? On this question, we couldn't find a clear consensus.

The Congressional Budget Office wrote in a 2009 report that government-held debt, such as the Social Security trust fund, ""has no direct, immediate impact on the economy. Instead, it simply represents credits to the various government accounts that can be redeemed as necessary to authorize payments for benefits or other expenses."" By contrast, CBO wrote, ""long-term projections of federal debt held by the public, measured relative to the size of the economy, provide useful yardsticks for assessing the sustainability of fiscal policies.""

James Horney, of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted that most key studies of the debt in recent years have focused on public debt. Horney gets support from a leading conservative, Dan Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute. Public debt, Mitchell said, ""is the key variable since it measures the amount of money the government is draining from private capital markets, or adding, in the case of surpluses. Government spending grew very slowly during the Clinton years, just 2.9 percent annually between 1994 and 1998. This was a very good accomplishment, and Bill Clinton, and the GOP Congress, should be proud. If we could do the same thing now, we could balance the budget in about 10 years and make all the tax cuts permanent.""

At the same time, economists on both the left and the right told us that they consider both measures acceptable yardsticks. ""Both are reasonable measures,"" said liberal economist Dean Baker. ""People most often do use the publicly held debt number, so I don't think Clinton can be blamed for using the standard figure. Of course it is not wrong to point out what happened with the gross debt, either.""

For his part, Sheppard, the NewsBusters blogger, stood by his decision to base his post on gross federal debt.

""If the public debt during those years was bought with other debt -- meaning by the Social Security trust and the Federal Reserve -- we didn't actually pay down any debt, did we? If you take out an equity line of credit on your home to pay off your car loan, your debt didn't decrease. Furthermore, if you take out an equity line of credit to pay off your car loan and buy a boat, it would be deceitful on your part to say you reduced your debt, right? This is what happened those four years: We did retire some debt held by the public, but we did so by increasing debt held by the government and the (Federal Reserve). That's not retiring debt. That's just shifting it from one lender to another.""

We see merit in using both public debt and gross debt, so we are reluctant to declare that Clinton is definitively right or definitively wrong in citing statistics supported by the public debt figure. Clinton's phrasing -- talking about ""the debt"" and ""the national debt"" -- strikes us as vague enough to refer to either the public debt or the gross federal debt. 
So we are left with a statement that's correct using one measurement and incorrect using another measurement. In addition, Clinton overestimated by about one-third the dollar amount by which the public debt declined from its peak during his term, though he also correctly characterized the changes in the debt under Republican presidents. So on balance, we rule Clinton's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECA9D840>],/factchecks/2010/sep/23/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-his-administration-paid-down-deb/
"['National', 'Human Rights', 'Crime', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Mahmoud Ahmadinejad']","
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies executions are up fourfold
","
In an interview on ABC's This Week, host Christiane Amanpour asked Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad if he was aware that ""since you've been the President executions in Iran have increased by four times.""

""That is not true at all,"" Ahmadinejad responded. ""Not at all. Not at all.""

""So you deny that?"" Amanpour asked, noting that the statistic came from independent human rights groups.

""How do they know?"" Ahmadinejad said. ""They haven't come to Iran.""

The Iranian government doesn't keep statistics on executions. Or, at least, it doesn't make them public.

But a couple of human rights groups outside Iran keep tallies on executions based largely on official or ""semi-official"" news accounts in Iran.

Amnesty International, which opposes the death penalty, issues an annual report on executions in Iran and elsewhere around the world.

According to Amnesty International's tally, there were at least 94 people executed in Iran in 2005, including at least eight aged under 18 at the time of the crime. Ahmadinejad became president in August of that year. That same year, 94 percent of all known executions took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. (which had 60), the report states.

In contrast, Amnesty International recorded at least 388 executions in Iran in 2009 (the U.S. had 52). The report states, ""the death penalty continued to be applied in political cases, in which individuals are commonly accused of 'enmity against God.'"" In addition, the report states, a ""sharp increase in the rate of executions was registered in the eight-week period between the presidential election on 12 June and the inauguration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for a second term as president on 5 August. Many of those executed were convicted in flawed legal proceedings, some after having made televised 'confessions.'""

So that's where Amanpour got her fourfold estimate (94 in 2005 when Ahmadinejad was elected; and 388 in 2009).

Without official government statistics, where does Amnesty International get its data?

""Information about the vast majority of these executions comes from official Iranian sources: newspapers and provincial judiciary websites,"" said Ann Harrison, a researcher at Amnesty International in London, in an e-mail exchange with PolitiFact. ""Very few come from other sources such as local human rights groups or family members of those executed. However, we believe that the true number of executions is likely to be higher, as the authorities do not publish official statistics on their use of the death penalty, and we always later receive reports of other executions, which were not known about at the time.""

Amnesty International isn't the only human rights group that keeps tabs on executions in Iran. Since 2001, the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, a group that promotes human rights and democracy in Iran, has scoured 50 to 60 newspapers, websites and blogs on a daily basis looking for information on executions. Most of the sites are ""official or semi-official state news agencies and prison websites,"" said Roya Boroumand, executive director and co-founder of the foundation.

The foundation documented 127 executions in 2004 (the year before Ahmadinejad took office); 65 in 2005; 132 in 2006; 468 in 2007;381 in 2008; and 399 in 2009.

""I can't swear to you that's an exact number,"" Boroumand said. ""This is more or less what's reported.""

The foundation keeps detailed and well-sourced databases to substantiate their figures. Boroumand shared a spreadsheet for 2007, as an example. The spreadsheet lists the names of those executed, their crimes (most were for drug trafficking, murder or sex crimes), and the source of the information (such as the state news agency or a police office website).

Boroumand warned not to assume the charges listed are accurate, however, as Iranian authorities do not allow the independent investigation and monitoring of cases in which the death penalty is enforced.

While the totals are not exact, she said, they have used the same method of data collection every year.

Their tally shows executions ""have increased several times in recent years,"" Boroumand said. But they are not the highest number in modern history, by any means. In 1990, for example, there were about 900 executions, she said. But the number of executions dropped off in the late 1990s and early 2000s before increasing again the last several years, she said.

Boroumand attributes the rise to ""a more military-oriented government...So they are more arrogant.""

The United Nations does not track the exact number of executions in Iran, but an October 2008 report notes that the U.N.'s Human Rights Committee ""expressed grave concern over the extremely high number of death sentences, many resulting from trials in which the guarantees of due process of law had not been properly applied.""

The report also says the ""continuing high incidence of executions remains an ongoing concern, with a sudden surge of executions reported in recent months, which the authorities argue
are part of efforts to combat drug trafficking.""

The report notes, for example, that on July 27, 2008, there were reportedly 29 executions, 18 for drug-related offenses.

We asked Gary Sick, a senior research scholar at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs who served on the National Security Council under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan, what he thought of Ahmadinejad's denial of rising executions under his presidency.

""Ahmadinejad doesn't like to be reminded Iran is one of the leading countries in the world in terms of executions,"" Sick said. ""And to avoid the issue, he lies about it.""

Again, the Iranian government does not publicly release statistics on executions, but we think the human rights reports provide convincing evidence that executions in Iran have risen dramatically during Ahmadinejad's presidency. The reports are meticulously documented, and are mostly sourced to government websites and government news agencies within Iran that have reported specific cases. And, while even the human rights groups acknowledge their numbers are imprecise (and likely under-reported), the same method for gathering the data has been used for years. That seems the best way, under the circumstances, to establish a trend. And so we rule that Ahmadinejad's denial of an increase in executions during his presidency is False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE2E180>],/factchecks/2010/sep/23/mahmoud-ahmadinejad/iranian-president-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-denies-execu/

Rob Portman raps Lee Fisher for Ohio's job losses while he was the state's development director
","
Editor's note: This item originally was rated as Mostly True, but was downgraded when job loss figures in it were updated. 
Like the refrain of a ubiquitous pop song, the phrase -- ""Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch"" -- is playing over and over on the airwaves. And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy.

Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich is singing it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland, and the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich.

And U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohio’s lieutenant governor and former head of the state’s economic development department, in a statewide ad titled ""Job Czar.""

""Under Lee Fisher Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs,"" is the key line in Portman's ad.

The phrase has been aired so often, it's approaching the status of an oldie. Whether it's a goodie is the question.

The Republicans are referring to the state’s net job losses since Strickland and Fisher took office in January 2007. Ohio lost about 390,000 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through July of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year.

When we reviewed the Republican Governor’s Association rendition that focused on Strickland, we rated it Half True. We said then that the claim hit a clunker when Republicans suggest that the governor was responsible for the job losses.

Ohio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector.

It’s also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the offices of governor and lieutenant governor seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years.

Strickland has argued for the administration that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis.

Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What made Daniels’ comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the state’s job losses.

But Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007.

Echoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states’ economic woes, he said, ""To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different.""

But this claim that targets Fisher has a slightly different tune.

The ad that targeted Strickland phrased the job loss as happening ""on his watch,"" which we think implies he is at fault. This claim phrased the job loss as happening ""under Lee Fisher,"" which we think is more neutral language that conveys the idea that it occurred while he was the director of the agency.

Also, Fisher’s role here was different than that of Strickland. While Strickland, as governor, may set policy for the administration to follow, Fisher held a hands-on position of control in the Department of Development.

Consider it this way: It might be unfair to blame the high school principal for unruly behavior in a classroom, but reasonable to hold the teacher in charge of that class to a higher standard.

That the ad focuses on Fisher as the state's development director raises another issue. Fisher stepped down as development director in February 2009. BLS data shows that during his tenure Ohio had a net loss of about 255,000 jobs; a significant number of jobs, although not as many as the Portman ad states. The higher jobs figure in the ad reflects net jobs lost into this year. 
Still, at a time when Ohio lost thousands of jobs, Fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to Ohio. That doesn’t mean he’s responsible for the job losses, but he was in charge of the department most capable of addressing the problem.

We find Portman’s claim in his Job Czar ad to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC080C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/23/rob-portman/rob-portman-raps-lee-fisher-ohios-job-losses-while/

Senate candidate Ron Johnson likens Social Security to Bernie Madoff style Ponzi scheme
","It’s not often that a key platform of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal is compared to Bernie Madoff’s $65 billion Ponzi scheme.

But 2010 is anything but a typical election year.

Like numerous Republicans, U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson has been likening Social Security -- created 75 years ago to provide retirees with a steady income -- to a Ponzi scheme. It’s an eye-catching comparison that has been made by Senate candidates Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharon Angle in Nevada, among others.

Where does Johnson fit in?

In a move to head off criticism from his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, Johnson put his Ponzi comparison at the center of TV and radio ads that began running Sept. 15, 2010.

""I'm going to tell you what Senator Feingold and his allies' next attack against me will be,"" Johnson says in the radio ad. ""They're going to tell you I said Washington politicians have run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.

Johnson goes on to say: ""I did say that, and it's true. During his 18 years in the Senate, Russ Feingold and politicians from both parties have raided $2 trillion from the Social Security trust fund. They spent your savings. The money is gone. And what did we get? Bigger government, wasteful spending and an IOU.""

The television ad is similar, with Johnson instead saying ""Washington treats Social Security like a Ponzi scheme.""

A  $2 trillion Ponzi scheme?

Now that would be a big-time crime, especially since Social Security affects virtually every American. Indeed, at that size, even Madoff would be green with envy.

Let’s start with what the phrase ""Ponzi scheme"" means.

The scheme was named after Charles Ponzi, the Boston con man who in 1920 bilked investors out of about $10 million by promising returns of up to 100% in just 45 days. Ponzi invested little of the cash. Instead, he used it to finance his lavish lifestyle. He kept the scheme afloat by using new money to pay off older investors

Think robbing Peter to pay Paul.  

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission offers a simple definition:  ""A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.""

On one level, that sounds like Social Security, which uses taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans. But remember: The SEC also notes that a Ponzi is an ""investment fraud.""

Let’s look deeper, at how Johnson applies the characterization to the Social Security system. Is he going beyond superficial similarities?

Here’s what Johnson said at a July 26, 2010  luncheon sponsored by Wispolitics.com, when he was asked about the Ponzi comparison.

""What is the most famous Ponzi scheme we most recently heard of?"" Johnson asked.

Audience members responded Madoff.

Johnson went on to say:  ""What did Bernie Madoff  do? .... He took money in from investors. He paid some of the older investors off and he spent the rest of the money. The money was spent, it’s gone.""

In the next breath he moved on to Social Security and said:  ""You just tell me how that’s different from a Ponzi scheme.""

So, Johnson takes it beyond simply saying Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. He’s invoking Madoff’s name to make his point.

Johnson’s campaign manager, Juston Johnson, said neither he nor his boss is ""saying the Social Security Administration is a fraud"" -- pointing out the candidate wants to fix the system. Asked why the candidate used Madoff’s name, if it wasn’t meant to imply criminal wrongdoing, the spokesman declined to answer.

The issue, according to Juston Johnson, is the more than $2 trillion the Senate candidate says was raided from the Social Security Trust Fund.

While the Social Security Administration objects to politicians saying the trust fund was raided, spokeswoman Dorothy Clark said in an e-mail that ""The Social Security Trust Funds currently holds over $2.5 trillion in interest bearing Treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.""

In other words, a giant IOU.

The IOU part echoes what Johnson said, but the candidate misses a huge point -- and one that undermines his own statement. A Ponzi scheme is based on a lie. There is a promise that participants will get their money back plus a whole lot more.  But the bulk of the money isn’t invested -- it’s generally blown by the swindler.

The IOU to the fund, on the other hand,  is backed by the full credit and faith of the U.S. government.  It must be repaid, with interest -- though doing so may cause the government to borrow even more.

Eugene Steuerle, a Social Security expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy research think tank, said the $2 trillion in debt came about because the Social Security system used to run a surplus -- which helped encourage bigger spending by the rest of the government.

Said Steuerle: ""To the extent that the candidate is arguing (that Social Security) is run like a Ponzi scheme, in the sense that there’s really no significant savings in the system, that’s right.""

To combat the Ponzi comparisons, the Social Security Administration created a web page in 2009 that looked at Ponzi’s scheme and its own operation.

The site  acknowledges ""a superficial analogy"" between a Ponzi scheme and pay-as-you-go programs such as Social Security. But, it argues the ""structure, logic, and mode of operation (of Social Security has) nothing in common with Ponzi schemes or chain letters or pyramid schemes.""

The agency’s conclusion: ""The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days.""   

We figured there were two people who could truly sort out the comparison.

Unfortunately, Ponzi died in 1949. And the Federal Bureau of Prisons does not expect the 72-year-old Madoff to be available for public appearances until Nov. 14, 2039.

So, we went to the next best person -- Mitchell Zuckoff, who, in 2005, wrote the book ""Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend.""

He doesn’t buy the comparison.

""The important difference and the fundamental difference is that there is no secret to how Social Security is run,""  said Zuckoff, who researched the question for a 2009 article in Fortune Magazine. ""No one is being misled, no one is taking the money and running,  which are fundamental aspects of a true Ponzi schemes.""

Comparing the two ""is a common, and I  think deeply misleading suggestion, that is openly used more as scare tactic than to truly illuminate the real issues,"" Zuckoff said in an interview.

In his Fortune piece, Zuckoff wrote:  ""Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme and fundamentally different from what Madoff ... did.""

So, let’s come back to Johnson’s original statement.

The candidate says politicians ""run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme."" On a superficial level, that is true -- money is taken in from current workers (new participants) and used to pay off obligations to retirees (old participants). The operative word is ""superficial.""

Unlike a Ponzi, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits, a commitment the shysters who run Ponzi schemes do not share. As for those IOUs, the government is required to make good on the money borrowed from the fund -- and to pay it back with interest.

What’s more, participants are aware of how the system is operating. It’s all public. In a Ponzi, investors have no clue where their money is going and are told lies by the promoters.  

We rate Johnson’s claim Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCDA3C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/23/ron-johnson/senate-candidate-ron-johnson-likens-social-securit/
"['Afghanistan', 'Food Safety', 'Iraq', 'Texas', 'Ted Ankrum']","
Ted Ankrum, Democrat for U.S. House, says annual U.S. deaths due to food poisoning exceed U.S. deaths in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts
","
Ted Ankrum, the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House seat held by Michael McCaul, R-Austin, floats a startling comparison in an e-mail blast advocating laws ensuring food inspections: ""More people were killed in the United States last year by tainted food than U.S. troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the wars began,"" his Aug. 31 statement says. ""... It takes laws to require testing and inspections AND government inspectors to enforce them. Yet, we do not have the laws since Congress won’t pass them.""

Wait a sec: Tainted food kills more o' us than war?

To our inquiry, Ankrum told us by e-mail that he made the comparison by recalling an article in The New York Times. Via an online search, we found the relevant July 24, 2010, op-ed column, titled ""Unsafe at Any Meal."" The piece, by Eric Schlosser, author of ""Fast Food Nation,"" says about 200,000 Americans are sickened every day by contaminated food and every year about 325,000 people are hospitalized (due to) a food-borne illness.

It goes on: ""And the number who are killed annually by something they ate is roughly the same as the number of Americans who’ve been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003.""

While that punch line is less sweeping than Ankrum's statement, the article doesn't substantiate the comparison. Seeking evidence, we visited websites that respectively track casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. deaths due to foodborne diseases.

According to the Iraq Coalition Casualties Count, the United States suffered 4,421 deaths in Iraq from 2003 to Sept. 21, 2010 and 1,301 deaths in Afghanistan since 2001, for a total of 5,722. Keeping in mind when Ankrum made his statement, we also checked U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan as of the end of August 2010; that total was 5,670, according to numbers posted by the U.S. Department of Defense covering deaths in Afghanistan as of Aug. 31 and deaths in Iraq as of Sept. 4.

And what of deaths due to food? 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 76 million cases of foodborne disease occur each year in the United States, most of them mild. The CDC estimates 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths related to foodborne illnesses each year. A CDC official, Barbara Mahon, told us via e-mail that although the 5,000 figure was declared in a 1999 article, it remains the best number to cite until the CDC completes an update that's under way.

Mahon said: ""Making these (death) estimates is a complex process that uses multiple data sources and statistical methods."" For instance, she said, threatening Salmonella bacteria can come from many sources including food, water, direct animal contact or even transmission from another person.

If a person dies from such an infection, she said, ""there is usually no way to know whether they got their infection from contaminated food or from another source. Only if they are part of an outbreak for which a source is determined (usually less than 5 percent of cases of Salmonella infection) would it be possible to know where that particular infection came from. Otherwise, it might or might not have been foodborne.""

Mahon noted that people ""could die of Salmonella without it ever being diagnosed. So, to estimate the true number of Salmonella deaths due to food, it is necessary to take all of this into account, which requires looking at many different kinds of data from multiple sources and using appropriate statistical techniques to adjust for the various sources of infection and for under-diagnosis and under-reporting.""

Back to Ankrum's statement: It looks like annual U.S. food-borne deaths, based on the figure aired in 1999, run short of U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan by about 700.

When we followed up, Ankrum told us he relied on his memory of Schlosser's op-ed column in making his statement. ""So 'uncle,' you got me,"" he said.

Side note: Schlosser's comparison might have fared better on the Truth-O-Meter even though it says U.S. residents killed by what they eat each year is ""roughly"" the same as U.S. deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003. Accounting for his 2003 limit and also adjusting for when the column appeared reduces combined U.S. deaths in the conflicts to 5,477-- less than 10 percent off the CDC's number for annual U.S. deaths from food-borne causes.

We rate Ankrum's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDD1980>],/factchecks/2010/sep/22/ted-ankrum/ted-ankrum-democrat-us-house-says-annual-us-deaths/

Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claims woman was never sentenced to stoning
","
Asked about his thoughts on stoning in light of the international uproar over the case of an Iranian woman who reportedly received the sentence for adultery, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed the case as pure western media propaganda. In fact, he said on ABC's This Week that Sakineh Mohammadi-Ashtiani, 43, was never actually sentenced to stoning in the first place.

""First, what I want to say is that Miss Mohammadi was never sentenced to stoning,"" Ahmadinejad told This Week host Christiane Amanpour in an interviewed aired on Sept. 19, 2010. ""This was news that was produced and incorrect, and regretably, U.S. media affected -- was infected by U.S. politicians to make a piece of news out of it.""

""But the Iranian government lifted the sentence..."" Amanpour interjected.

Said Ahmadinejad: ""Allow me. Allow me. When I represent the Iranian government, how is it that I am unaware of what you are telling me and that you should be aware of it? This is an issue that is being considered. It is still being processed. Given that there was no sentence of stoning issued in the first place this was the news that was made up. The propaganda behind it was big, and then those same murderers of people become supporters of human rights.

""Now this is ancient method, an ancient method that needs to change.""

The following day, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry echoed Ahmadinejad's claim, saying the controversy over Ashtiani being sentenced to death by stoning for adultery was ""organized media propaganda against Iran and to build up a human rights (violation) case,"" according to the news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur.

When pressed about the matter while attending a U.N. anti-poverty summit on Sept. 21, Ahmadinejad defended the handling of the case, telling reporters, ""You do not understand our judicial system.""

Iranian officials have made it clear that the case involving Ashtiani, who, in addition to adultery, is also charged with having been an accomplice in the killing of her husband, is still under investigation, and Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said no final sentence has been issued yet on either of the charges.

But was Ahmadinejad correct that the issue of stoning in this case was pure fabrication, that Ashtiani ""was never sentenced to stoning""?

Ahmadinejad's claim is at odds with earlier comments from Iranian justice officials who seemed to acknowledge the stoning sentence while announcing in July the penalty had been shelved ""for now.""

In July, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, the top judicial official in the province where Ashtiani was convicted, told the Iranian state news agency IRNA that her crimes were ""heinous"" and that the stoning would still take place if the judiciary wanted. ""Although the verdict is definitive and applicable, the verdict has been halted due to humanitarian reservations and upon the order of the honourable judiciary chief, and it will not be carried out for the moment,"" according to reports from the Associated Press and Agence France Presse.

That same week, Mohammed Javad Larijani of Iran's human rights council told the state news agency that the ""review and appeal of the verdict is on the agenda,"" and maintained that ""the hue and cry that the West has launched over this case will not affect our judges.""

""The implementation of Islamic regulations like stoning and the headscarf have always been faced with their impudent hostility and opposition,"" he said.

Moreover, Ahmadinejad's claim is directly contradicted by two court documents smuggled out of the country by Mohammad Mostafaei, Ashtiani's original attorney.

We spoke to Mostafaei, who fled Iran in August under threat of arrest and sought amnesty in Oslo, Norway.

""Everything Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on TV is not true,"" Mostafaei said, adding that the sentence of stoning was handed down by the lower court, and confirmed in an appeals court, before the international furor among human rights activists pressured Iranian officials to review the case.

Mostafaei thinks Ahmadinejad simply didn't calculate that he had taken copies of court documents with him.

One of the documents, he said, is the original sentencing document, obtained by Amnesty International and posted online by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Amnesty International provided us with a translation of the document, which was originally written in Persian.

It reads, in part, ""In this case, Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, born in 1968, from and resident of Oskou, daughter of Asghar, is accused of adultery with strangers. In consideration of the file contents, the complaint of her children from her murdered husband, the late Ebrahim Qaderzadeh, the police report, and the express confessions of the aforementioned during all preliminary investigations and cross examinations...it seems that the main motive of the aforementioned for murdering her husband in complicity with one of the strangers -– this charge against her is being examined by another court of the province –- was her illicit relations with strangers and strong moral corruption. Other indications and adminicles all point to the committing of the said adultery offence and have led to the achievement of knowledge by the majority. Therefore, invoking Articles 63, 83 and 105 of the Islamic Penal Code, the majority of court members sentence Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, daughter of Asghar, to stoning for adultery (repeatedly with strangers). This sentence may be appealed before the Supreme Court within 20 days of its notification."" (An adminicle is something that contributes to proving a point.)

In addition, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran posted a document that Mostafaei said was issued by the Supreme Court administration on July 7, 2010. The document is also written in Persian, and Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said the document acknowledges the receipt of an appeals request to rule on the stoning sentence of Sakineh Ashtiani.

We had the documents independently translated and confirmed both documents list stoning as the sentence.

""It explicitly states her sentence as stoning,"" Ghaemi told us. ""If there was no stoning sentence, the Supreme Court would not have issued this report.""

Amnesty International pointed us to one other piece of evidence.

A press release issued by the Iranian embassy in London on July 8, 2010, ""denies the false news aired in this respect (the Ashtiani case) and notifies the Ministry that according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in Iran, she will not be executed by stoning punishment. It is notable that this kind of punishment has rarely been implemented in Iran, and various means and remedies must be probed and exhausted to finally come up with such a punishment.""

The statement also notes that ""the stoning punishment has not been cited in the draft Islamic Penal Code being deliberated in the Iranian Parliament.""

According to a 2008 report from the United Nations on human rights issues in Iran, the head of Iran's judiciary issued a circular to prohibit stoning as a punishment. ""However,"" the report states, ""as in the case of the ban on public executions, this circular does not have a binding legal effect and serves only as an instruction for individual judges.""

Reports of stoning sentences in Iran are uncommon, and it's even more rare that the sentence is actually carried out. The U.N. report notes that stoning verdicts have been suspended for at least 14 people (11 women and three men); and an active coalition exists in the country seeking to ban the practice of stoning altogether.

Nonetheless, the practice of stoning still occurs -- with the most recent instance in 2007, according to the U.N.

Mostafaei said he has handled about 10 cases involving stoning. In a handful of cases, the punishment was later reduced to 99 lashes, he said. About 14 people in Iran have been sentenced to stoning and are in prison awaiting punishment.

Mostafaei believes international denunciation has worked, and in an open letter, he talks broadly about human rights issues facing Iran.

""I think the government can't continue this punishment in the future, in my opinion,"" he said.

Iranian officials have accused Mostafaei of taking advantage of the case to get asylum in Europe.

In August and September, a woman claiming to be Ashtiani appeared on state television (with her face blurred out) and confessed to being an accomplice to her husband's murder. The woman also criticized Mostafaei, saying that he had shamed her by making the case an international human rights issue. Her lawyer said the interviews were coerced.

We are not weighing the issue of Ahtiani's guilt or innocence but whether she was ""never sentenced to stoning."" We think there's enough evidence -- from previously reported statements from Iranian judicial officials and from court documents provided by Ashtiani's one-time attorney -- to show that stoning was the sentence by the lower court. In this case, the sentence has been suspended, and the case is under review. Ahmadinejad may have a point that stoning sentences are rare, that the sentence is often overturned and that there is often a prolonged process of review before such sentences are carried out. But we rule his claim that Ashtiani was never sentenced to stoning in the first place is False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC19400>],/factchecks/2010/sep/22/mahmoud-ahmadinejad/iranian-president-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-claims-woman/
"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich claims Ohio's Department of Development only spends a small fraction of its money on bringing jobs to Ohio
","
If elected governor in November, Republican challenger John Kasich is certain to rule the state like a CEO managing a Fortune 500 company. In fact, Kasich has said he wanted to completely eliminate the Ohio Department of Development, the state’s primary job development agency. Instead, Kasich would outsource Ohio’s job recruiting and developing efforts to a 12-member private board of hand-picked business leaders who would report to him.

In selling this idea to reporters in August, Kasich, who is challenging Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, ripped the current job creation efforts by the Department of Development as feeble and inefficient.

""The total number of dollars that passes through the Department of Development is like $900 million and like $650 (million) of it has nothing to do with development, which is breathtaking when you think about it,"" Kasich told reporters Aug. 17 in Columbus.

Essentially, Kasich is charging that the state’s primary job creation division only uses 28 cents of every taxpayer dollar it spends on seeking out and bringing jobs to Ohio.

PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know, did Kasich make an accurate statement or just blurt out a comment to perfectly accompany his new idea?

For starters, it is true that there is a lot more going on at the Department of Development besides job creation. The state agency also oversees home winterization and energy reduction projects, Ohio’s tourism marketing, and community development and housing programs, to name a few.

The agency’s fiscal year 2011 budget is a little over $930 million. Of that, the agency is spending $327 million this year (not including federal matching funds) directly on what it calls economic development, which is job development programs. That would mean the department spends about 35 percent of its funds for job creation. Thus far, Kasich’s figures are off but his larger point — that a state agency charged with bringing jobs to Ohio spends the bulk of its money elsewhere — has some merit.

But those easy to capture figures do not reveal the entire picture, says development Director Lisa Patt-McDaniel.

Part of the problem is that through the years as various programs were added, such as providing heating assistance to people who can’t afford to pay their utility bills, state leaders often had no idea where to officially house the programs. Eventually, the Department of Development emerged as a catchall of various projects. Adding more slices to the pie actually crowds the slice entitled ""job creation"" and makes it appear the agency isn’t putting its all behind its main purpose.

Money the department spends in other areas, such as, the Home Winterization Assistance Program, the Community Development Block Grant, even tourism, also each might contain job training programs that indirectly lead to economic development, Patt-McDaniel said.

Also, those programs under development that focus on cleaning up brownfields, tidying up neighborhoods and green energy projects all make Ohio a more attractive place to live and do business, which also indirectly lures jobs.

Development is really more comprehensive than just straight job development figures, she said. ""It's important to understand that companies want to be in good communities with good quality of life and an educated workforce. They are all intertwined and important to each other. Our business is to make a business-friendly climate.""

For example, the department has budgeted $210 million for winterizing and making other energy saving adjustments to Ohio homes this coming winter. The department says the program alone has helped create 1,300 jobs. But the department cannot say how much of that $210 million can be extrapolated as purely job creation spending.

To Kasich’s point, it is hard to believe that a state agency charged with bringing and retaining jobs for Ohio could spend only a small fraction of its state funds on its primary duty. Give him credit for the over-arching point. But his figures are off and do not encapsulate the full picture. Take some credit away for that.

""But we were at a point where two of the big three automakers were about to liquidate, in the midst of this huge recession, and we would have lost an additional million jobs as a consequence, but also lost what is a signature manufacturing industry in this country. I mean, we built the world auto industry. And so what we did was we said to the auto companies, we are going to help you, but you’ve got to make some changes.""

We'll leave it to posterity to decide whether saving America's automakers -- or bailing them out, depending on your point of view -- was the right thing for the government to do. What we noticed in Obama's statement was that ""the previous administration had been helping them, giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return."" That's a claim at odds with the historical record.

We first looked into this issue a few months ago when Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel made a similar claim on the Sunday morning show ABC's This Week. Economics blogger Keith Hennessey, a former Bush administration official, wrote a detailed rebuttal that caught our attention, and our own reporting confirmed much of his argument.

Back in the fall of 2008, the Bush administration realized the automakers were in dire staights and looked to Congress to put together an aid package. But by December, Congress showed no intention of acting. So the Bush administration decided to go ahead on its own, using money the Treasury Department already had authorization to use through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

The Treasury Department released documents Dec. 19, 2008, that outlined conditions for $13.4 billion in loans it was offering General Motors and Chrysler.

The documents show, and press reports from the time confirm, that the Bush administration put specific requirements on the auto companies that included paying down debt, limits on executive compensation and negotiated reductions in wages and benefits for autoworkers. It also required the companies to submit detailed restructuring plans by Feb. 17, 2009, to show how the companies planned to achieve and sustain ""long-term viability, international competitiveness and energy efficiency.""

The requirements did have one clause that some critics of the plan said meant the details were nonbinding. The agreement said that the companies had to file additional reports by March 31, 2009, identifying any deviations from the requirements and explaining ""why such deviations do not jeopardize the borrower's long-term viability."" If the president's designee didn't approve the explanations, the loan would have to be paid back within 30 days.

Still, coverage from the time indicates the auto companies thought the Bush administration's demands were plenty tough. The Detroit Free Press wrote that the loan agreements ""not only call for deep concessions outlined in wide-ranging plans due by mid-February but also start a ticking bomb that could explode in Detroit's face unless dramatic change is on the way."" The Wall Street Journal reported the loans were ""just the first step in what could be a long and painful revamping of the three Detroit companies during a recession.""

The Detroit Free Press, in a 2009 eight-part series looking back at the auto industry's turmoil, again described the requirements as rigorous: ""The deal set tough targets for the two companies -- a two-thirds cut in debt, a 50% reduction in payments to health care funds for UAW retirees and proof of net positive value by March 31. It also came with a threat: Should the automakers fall short, the loans would be called back immediately and bankruptcy would follow.""

These loan agreements happened after President Obama was elected but before he took office. At the time, Obama called the loans ""necessary steps ... to help avoid a collapse of our auto industry."" The March 31 deadline for the auto companies gave Obama about two months in office in which to make his own decisions about the companies.

Obama said at the town hall meeting that ""the previous administration had been helping (the auto companies), giving them billions of dollars and just asking nothing in return."" The historical record indicates that the Bush administration did ask for things in return -- and even gave the Obama administration the power to recall the loans if the terms weren't meant. We know that Obama isn't a fan of the Bush administration, but this particular claim seems to be re-writing history. We rate Obama's statement False.

Union attacks Marco Rubio over unemployment benefits extension
","
The AFL-CIO is targeting Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio in a new mailer that calls him anti-worker.

The issue: Rubio's supposed opposition to extending unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans.

""How do we know Marco Rubio is a bad choice for workers?"" asks the mailer, which began circulating Sept. 20, 2010. ""His anti-union voting record says it all. Our jobless rate is almost 12%, but Rubio still opposes extending unemployment benefits to the workers who need it most right now.""

Does the AFL-CIO detail Rubio's position correctly?

First, a little background: When workers lose full-time work through no fault of their own, they are usually eligible for unemployment benefits, small weekly payments intended to partially make up for lost wages. Employers pay taxes to fund the program, and states administer it based on federal guidelines. How much a person gets and how long benefits are paid varies by state. Usually, the benefits last about six months.

In tough times, though, Congress often extends benefits, because of the difficulty of finding new jobs when unemployment is very high, as it has been since 2008, when the economy floundered. As a result, Congress has been arguing this summer about extending benefits again after extending them five times since Obama took office in 2009. Recent extensions have been structured so that workers in states where unemployment is higher receive additional weeks of benefits. In the states where unemployment is highest, some unemployed workers have been paid benefits for close to two years.

This summer, Republicans in the House and Senate balked at extending jobless benefits to about 3 million Americans without first finding a way to offset the $34 billion cost. Republicans proposed to pay for the extension with unspent funds from the 2009 economic stimulus package. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky even offered a specific proposal to extend benefits for two months while cutting the deficit $1.7 billion, he said. How? By adjusting Medicaid payments, trimming stimulus-funded food stamps in 2014, cutting $600 million in stimulus-supported programs to expand broadband Internet access and eliminating a provision letting qualified residents receive their earned-income tax credit throughout the year instead of at the end of the tax filing season. 
Democrats rejected McConnell's proposal, saying that the stimulus money would be needed elsewhere to boost job growth. They also accused Republicans of playing political games and noted correctly that emergency extensions typically never include cost offsets. 
The Senate passed the extension on July 21, without cost offsets, by a vote of 59-39. Maine Republicans Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins joined all but one Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, in supporting the extension without a way to pay for it.

The House passed the benefits extension the next day 275-152. Six Florida Republicans supported the extension in the House -- Gus Bilirakis, C.W. Bill Young, Mario Diaz-Balart, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Bill Posey and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.

How would Rubio have voted?

No, spokesman Alex Burgos told us.

""Marco opposes Washington's continued borrow-and-spend binge that is growing our debt and threatening to diminish America,"" Burgos told PolitiFact Florida. ""While he believes unemployment benefits are legitimate government safety net programs, he would only have supported the last round of extensions if specific cuts were identified to offset the cost.""

Burgos' explanation mirrors the one Rubio gave to the St. Petersburg Times' Adam C. Smith back on July 20, when the debate over extending unemployment benefits was raging. 
Smith wrote that Rubio would support extending benefits ""only if specific cuts were identified to offset the $34 billion cost."" He then quoted Rubio as saying, ""At some point someone has to draw a line in the sand and say we are serious about not growing debt."" 
For the record, Charlie Crist and Kendrick Meek both supported extending unemployment benefits without a cost offset. 
The key to Rubio's position appears to have gotten lost in translation by the AFL-CIO, which said in a mailer that Rubio ""opposes extending unemployment benefits."" Really, Rubio opposed extending benefits without a way to pay for it, which was the main Republican argument in Congress. We rate the AFL-CIO claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECD00140>],/factchecks/2010/sep/22/afl-cio/union-attacks-marco-rubio-over-unemployment-benefi/

Barack Obama says taxes are lower today than under Reagan, Eisenhower
","
CORRECTION: The original version of this story misstated some of the income thresholds that qualified a taxpayer for the top rate. For individuals today, the top rate kicks in at $373,650, rather than $186,825. In 1981, the top rate of 70 percent kicked in at $108,300 rather than $107,100. In 1988, the top rate of 28 percent kicked in at $17,850 for individuals (rather than $113,300) and at $29,750 for married couples (rather than $149,250). Today, those incomes would be equivalent to $33,229 and $55,382 respectively.

We had already argued in our assessment that 1988 was the one year where Obama’s comparison was inaccurate, which is why we rated his comment Mostly True rather than True. The corrected numbers do not invalidate that conclusion, so we are keeping our rating.

A blog post at Media Matters for America, a liberal group, argued that the premise of our comparison was misleading, since we only compared the the top tax rates. We agree that a comparison of all tax brackets would have an advantage over a look at just the top brackets. But as we indicated in the story, comparing a dozen or more income ranges -- each of which need to be adjusted for inflation -- over a series of nearly 20 separate tax years is a complicated process, and we were not convinced that Obama had actually intended to make the more detailed comparison. So we compared just the top rate. Others are free to make the alternative calculations, but we believe we’ve used a valid methodology. (March 1, 2011) 
*** 
During a Sept. 20, 2010, town hall televised on CNBC, President Barack Obama made a pointed comparison involving taxation under his presidency. 
""Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan,"" Obama said. ""They're much lower than they were under Dwight Eisenhower."" 
We thought that claim was worth a run through the Truth-O-Meter. 
The most obvious way to make the comparison is to use income tax rates paid by people in various tax brackets. Due to the complexity of comparing a dozen or more income ranges that each need to be adjusted for inflation, economists most frequently compare just the top rate. 
First, we'll look at the tax rates, using a convenient historical guide published by the Tax Foundation, an independent tax research group. The tables go as far back as the dawn of the income tax in 1913. 
Today, the top income tax rate is 35 percent, starting at $373,650 for individuals and couples. 
By contrast, during the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, the top rate averaged roughly 90 percent, typically hitting individuals making $200,000 a year or couples making $400,000 a year. In 2010 dollars, that's equivalent to $1.6 million for an individual and $3.2 million for a couple. Someone making the 1954 equivalent of $373,650 in today's money would have paid a tax rate of 72 percent back then. 
So by this measure, Obama's comparison with Eisenhower earns a True. 
Now for Ronald Reagan. 
In 1981, Reagan's first year, the top tax rate was 70 percent, hitting individuals earning $108,300 and couples earning $215,400. The top rate dropped immediately to 50 percent in 1982 and stayed there through 1986. In 1987, the top rate fell again to 38.5 percent, and in 1988, it fell to 28 percent, kicking in at $17,850 for married individuals and $29,750 for married couples. (The 1988 incomes would be equivalent to $33,229 and $55,382 today.) 
So, for one year of the Reagan presidency, the top rate was lower than it is now under Obama. For the other seven years, it was higher. 
For the Reagan comparison, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True. 
But we'll add a few caveats. The first is that looking at the top income tax rate offers an incomplete look at overall tax policy because it only looks at income taxes, not at other levies such as payroll, sales and property taxes. This is not a trivial difference: According to the Tax Foundation, more than two-thirds of all taxes paid by Americans in 2010 will be something other than income taxes. 
There is another way -- calculating all taxes paid by Americans and dividing the sum by the nation's total income. To make this calculation, we turned to the Tax Foundation's annual ""Tax Freedom Day"" report, which offers calculations of total tax burden going back to 1900. (There was no federal income tax then, but there were state and other taxes.) 
The foundation's expected tax burden for 2010 is 26.9 percent, up slightly from the 2009 tax burden of 26.6 percent. (This is not unusual: The tax burden typically falls during recessions, as taxpayers move to lower tax brackets.) 
Under Eisenhower, that figure ranged from 24.8 percent to 27.7 percent, with the figure lower than 26.9 percent for seven out of eight years. So by this measurement, the tax burden was lower most of the time under Eisenhower. 
Under Reagan, it ranged from 29.2 percent to 31.1 percent, meaning that in all eight years it was higher than the current tax burden under Obama. 
Still, Obama did speak of ""tax rates,"" not ""taxes"" or ""tax burdens,"" so we'll stick to the tax bracket comparison in making our ruling. 
The second caveat we'll mention is that conservatives say it's inappropriate for Obama to claim credit for lower taxes. They note that today's tax rates were established by his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. In fact, they say, it is Obama's stated intention to increase taxes on individuals earning $200,000 and couples earning $250,000, which would push the top tax bracket to 39.6 percent. 
They also note (as we have, in giving him a Promise Broken on the Obameter) that the president has already signed into law several tax increases. He hiked the levy on cigarettes; imposed tax penalties on people without insurance; taxed tanning services, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and raised Medicare tax rates for upper-income individuals. (Not all of these taxes kick in immediately.) 
We think it's fair to note that Obama has raised taxes and promises to do so again. But we don't think that undermines the factual accuracy of his statement from the town hall. If you make the comparison using tax brackets -- which we think was Obama's clear intent -- then the president is right when comparing today's rates to Eisenhower's, and he's close to right when he makes the comparison to Reagan. On balance, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF3FE00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-taxes-are-lower-today-under-reag/
"['Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Evelyn Sanguinetti']","
Illinois lite guv calls progressive tax idea regressive
","Illinois’ flat income tax, currently set at a rate of 4.95 percent for all individual taxpayers, is an outlier. The federal government, as well as most states that have an income tax, feature what is commonly referred to as a progressive tax system in which higher earners pay higher rates. Democrat J.B. Pritzker, the challenger to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the November election, says he wants to switch Illinois to a progressive tax, though he has been vague about details. Rauner’s running mate, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Sanguinetti, recently ripped into Pritzker’s tax plan during an interview on a Fox News-affiliated talk radio station that serves the Illinois suburbs of St. Louis. Pritzker will ""stick you with that progressive income tax which is surely to be an increase—not to mention the fact that it is wholly regressive,"" Sanguinetti told Marc Cox of KFTK. That is quite the oxymoron. Can a progressive income tax actually be regressive? We decided to check. The Illinois Constitution mandates a flat-rate income tax, and any move to try to change that would have to overcome difficult procedural hurdles in the state legislature as well as sharp ideological and political disputes. Republicans, Rauner among them, contend that taxing income at graduated levels would inevitably lead to an unfair and unnecessary tax increase in sheep’s clothing. Democrats, meanwhile, insist the change is critical to easing the burden on lower-income taxpayers and raising revenue to fund key services like public education. Pritzker backs a constitutional amendment to allow for a progressive tax. As a stopgap until that could be accomplished, however, the Democrat says he wants to raise the current flat tax rate—he hasn’t specified how much—but would make it ""artificially progressive"" by offsetting the increased cost for the non-affluent with enhanced tax credits. That’s where Sanguinetti’s up-is-down critique comes in. We asked a spokesman for the Rauner/Sanguinetti campaign to explain what she meant. He took a pass on explaining her thesis that ""progressive"" means ""regressive,"" but it seems unlikely it was a slip-of-the-tongue because the campaign promoted audio and a transcript of the interview on its website. No less an authority than the Internal Revenue Service says a regressive tax pretty much means what it sounds like, too. The IRS defines it as a tax that ""takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups."" The spokesman, Justin Giorgio, did however weigh in on Sanguinetti’s contention that taxes would rise. ""Lt. Governor Sanguinetti was simply saying that if J.B. Pritzker has his way, more Illinoisans will be paying higher taxes,"" Giorgio said in an email, referencing Pritzker’s constitutional workaround plan. Last December, we rated as Mostly False a similar claim from Rauner that calls for a progressive tax from Pritzker and his then rivals in the Democratic primary for governor were tantamount to advocating a ""massive income tax hike."" That fact check noted that a Pritzker spokesman had specifically ruled out anything that would raise taxes on middle-class families. It also highlighted how several states with graduated taxes had set rates for middle- and low-income earners below the flat tax rate Illinois now charges. As for Sanguinetti’s progressive-is-regressive scenario, economist J. Fred Giertz with the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois told us a plan like Pritzker’s wouldn’t qualify as regressive. ""If lower income people pay a lower rate than higher income people, that by definition is a progressive rate,"" Giertz said. ""The only way a regressive rate exists is if low-income people pay … a higher rate of tax."" For the record, Giertz says Illinois’ current flat-tax system isn’t regressive either and could even be considered slightly progressive because it already includes some tax credits for low-income earners that enable them to pay a lower effective tax rate than those of higher income. Sanguinetti said in a recent radio interview that Pritzker’s plan for a ""progressive income tax"" is ""wholly regressive."" A spokesman declined to explain what she meant by that. But the federal definition for a regressive tax makes her statement read like something straight out of Opposite Day. According to both the IRS and an Illinois economics expert, a regressive tax is one that takes a greater share of income from those who earn less than from those who earn more. A progressive tax, on the other hand, is one that requires higher earners to pay a higher rate than their lower earning counterparts. We rated as Mostly False Rauner’s earlier claim about an inevitable ""massive"" tax hike if a progressive tax system was implemented in Illinois. Sanguinetti takes that even further with her rhetorical head-scratcher, which is why we rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE325C0>],/factchecks/2018/jul/02/evelyn-sanguinetti/illinois-lite-guv-calls-progressive-tax-idea-regre/

President Trump makes some interesting claims about Wisconsin's Republican voting history
","On a warm June afternoon, President Donald Trump proudly presided over the groundbreaking of Foxconn’s new $10 billion operation in Mount Pleasant, Wis. Shovelsful of dirt were tossed and speeches were made hailing the company’s decision to build its complex in Wisconsin. In the midst of it all, Trump took a moment to hail his own 2016 victory in Wisconsin, a win that was vital to securing the presidency. Wisconsin, Trump said on June 28, 2018, ""hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952."" He went on: ""And I won Wisconsin. And I like Wisconsin a lot, but we won Wisconsin. And Ronald Reagan, remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win."" (He made a nearly identical claim the night before, at a rally in Fargo, N.D.) Say what, Mr. President? A look at the numbers According to the American Presidency Project, the following Republicans have won Wisconsin’s presidential vote since 1952: 1956: Dwight D. Eisenhower 1960: Richard M. Nixon 1968: Richard M. Nixon 1972: Richard M. Nixon 1980: Ronald Reagan 1984: Ronald Reagan 2016: Donald Trump The Republican presidential dry spell stretched from the 1988 election, when Democrat Michael Dukakis won Wisconsin, through 2012 when Democrat Barack Obama won Wisconsin. But it did not stretch back to Eisenhower. And, for the record, the one state Reagan lost in 1984 was neighboring Minnesota, not Wisconsin. Our rating Trump said Wisconsin ""hadn’t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1952."" and that ""Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win."" Election records show that Trump is wrong on both counts. Very wrong. The president might want to find another applause line for Wisconsin, because Republican candidates not named Trump won the state six times since Eisenhower’s 1952 win.

Putnam parrots previous absurd claim on food stamps for illegal immigrants
","The top two Republicans running for governor in Florida, Adam Putnam and Ron DeSantis, tried to paint a picture that the other was weak on immigration issues during a nationally televised debate on Fox News June 28, 2018. Moderator Bret Baier of Fox News asked Putnam, the state’s agriculture commissioner, to respond to a DeSantis’ attack ad calling him ""Amnesty Adam."" Putnam shot back, ""That’s rich for somebody who voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants."" Off-screen, DeSantis, a Florida congressman who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, responded, ""That’s not true, you know that, come on."" So, is that true? No, it’s not. The bill in question is a 2014 agricultural bill, H.R. 2642. Farm bills are passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food assistance benefits, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The bill mentioned illegal immigrants briefly, in Section 4015, to mandate that states would be ""required to use an immigration status verification system"" when distributing food assistance benefits. DeSantis voted against the bill, which passed 251-166. He also voted against a predecessor of the bill which failed to pass through the House, but had a similar provision against immigrants in the country illegally obtaining food assistance benefits. Putnam and his supporters frequently cite these votes as evidence that DeSantis was in favor of extending SNAP to people in the country illegally. The thinking goes that by voting against the farm bill in total, DeSantis voted against a provision that sought to verify that food assistance benefits only went to U.S. citizens. As a result, Putnam and his supporters claim, DeSantis supported distributing food assistance benefits without a citizenship test. And therefore, he supported distributing food assistance benefits to people in the country illegally. In April, seven radio stations have pulled a radio ad from the National Liberty Federation making the same claim as Putnam made during the Fox News debate, according to the DeSantis campaign. Even if H.R. 2642 had been voted down, SNAP regulations already in place prohibited people living in the United States illegally from receiving benefits. Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, told PolitiFact in March 2018, ""Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens."" After the vote in 2014, DeSantis wrote a Facebook post clarifying his reasoning: he voted against the bill because of the high cost and low return. The bill, he wrote, is a ""bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms."" Specifically, he was concerned that the bill did not do enough to cut back the rising cost of food stamp program—a far cry from wanting to expand it to include illegal immigrants. When asked about the claim, Putnam campaign spokesperson Meredith Beatrice directed us toward DeSantis’s voting record on the 2014 bill and its predecessor, as well as a link to this similarly misleading Central Florida Post article. Putnam claimed DeSantis ""voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants."" DeSantis actually voted against the bill, and explained later it had nothing to do with provisions related to immigration. Putnam has cast the vote against the farm bill as somehow allowing people living in the country illegally to receive food assistance benefits. But the practice was prohibited before the 2014 vote, and it remained prohibited after the 2014 vote.

Did Adam Putnam endorse the Gang of Eight immigration amnesty?
","Republican candidate for Florida governor Adam Putnam has been accused of not being conservative enough — especially when it comes to immigration. The attacks continued during a nationally televised Fox News Republican debate. Putnam’s opponent, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, accused Putnam of voting for amnesty on immigration three times. ""When he was acting commissioner (Putnam) endorsed the Obama-Schumer Gang of Immigration amnesty,"" DeSantis said. ""The biggest amnesty in history, it would have lowered wages for American workers and it would have created an incentive to come illegally."" We have looked at Putnam’s record on immigration multiple times, but this time we wanted to take a close look at the specific ""Gang of Eight"" legislation. Did Putnam endorse the ""Obama-Schumer Gang of immigration amnesty?"" Putnam did voice support of the Gang of Eight bill, but it’s worth noting that the bill was bipartisan and supported by several prominent Republicans. Characterizing the bill as amnesty requires additional context, too. In June 2013 while he was Florida’s agriculture commissioner, Putnam told reporters that he supported the ""Gang of Eight"" bill, which he saw as a benefit to multiple industries including agriculture. ""It makes improvements at the border and employee verification, while also creating a more modern visa program so that jobs in our economy can be filled when there is a shortfall of domestic labor,"" he told the Lakeland Ledger. ""That has been particularly acute in agriculture."" The bill would have eliminated the diversity lottery program, set up a path to legal status and an eventual opportunity for citizenship. It also would have allowed the president to designate certain groups outside the United States as particularly at risk, and other officials to label certain refugees in the United States as having nowhere to go. It further would have repealed the deadline for refugees already here to apply for asylum. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., was one of the four Democrats who supported the bill, and it was endorsed by former President Barack Obama. But the ""Gang of Eight"" actually refers to a bipartisan group of eight United States senators Democrats and four Republicans. So, the bill also -- at least for a time -- had support of prominent senators Jeff Flake, R-Az., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Lindsey Graham, R- S.C., and John McCain R-Az. The bill passed the Senate, 68-32. Fourteen Republicans joined 52 Democrats and two independent Senators in voting for the bill. The bill did not get a hearing in the House. DeSantis called the bill ""immigration amnesty"" and that requires additional context. As we’ve concluded in the past, defining amnesty is tricky. Some view it as blanket permission for undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, while others view amnesty as any measure that is favorable to any undocumented immigrants, even if it includes a list of tough measures they have to meet. Republicans who supported the legislation emphasized the bill was not amnesty. ""This is not amnesty,"" Rubio said on Fox News Sunday on April 14, 2013. ""Amnesty is the forgiveness of something. Amnesty is anything that says do it illegally, it will be cheaper and easier."" We rated Rubio’s claim Half True. We found that the bill does not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods, and it’s tougher than its 1986 predecessor. But it also offered a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. ""This bill includes numerous punishments for unauthorized immigrants who broke the laws, including paying fines and other legal sanctions,"" Alex Nowrasteh with the libertarian Cato Institute told PolitiFact in 2013. ""If it was amnesty they would be legalized immediately with no punishment, no process. They would just be forgiven and handed a green card."" DeSantis said Putnam ""endorsed the Schumer-Obama Gang of Eight immigration amnesty."" Putnam endorsed a bill that laid out a path to legal status and eventual opportunity for citizenship, but several prominent Republicans also supported it, including Rubio. Calling the bill amnesty is also at least partially misleading. The bill did not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants.

Do more than 450,000 Americans sit in jail because they are too poor to pay bail?
","A California Democrat responded to news of Paul Manafort’s pretrial jailing by pointing out that many other Americans suffer the same fate, due to a simple lack of money. Responding to an appearance by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz on Fox & Friends in which Dershowitz called the pretrial jailing of Paul Manafort ""unfair,"" U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu took to Twitter to point out how pretrial detention affects the poor. ""Dear @AlanDersh: I hope you will work with us on bail reform. Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys,"" Lieu tweeted. Dear @AlanDersh: I hope you will work with us on bail reform. Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys. Call me at 202 225 3976. Let's reform bail. https://t.co/mxVAsJ5qRj Various media outlets and experts in the field have referred to a figure of 450,000 Americans when discussing the scope of the problems with bail. However, we wanted to figure out where Lieu got his numbers from, so we did some digging of our own. Ultimately, we found that the number in Lieu’s tweet is an overestimate of the number of Americans who are in jail because they can’t afford to pay bail. In addition, the statistic Lieu is referring to is not one that is kept nationally. In other words, no accurate count exists of the amount of people in jail in America who are too poor to pay bail, so there’s no way to fully verify Lieu’s claim. We reached out to Lieu’s office and asked where they got the number of 450,000 Americans from. As evidence, Jenna Bushnell, Lieu’s communication director, cited a Marshall Project article and Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the latter of which discloses that there were 458,600 unconvicted inmates in local jails at the end of 2016. There’s just one problem: that’s not the statistic that Lieu is describing in the tweet. In his tweet, Lieu equates the Americans who ""are in jail not because they’ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail"" with the 458,600 count from the BJS report. However, the BJS statistic is a count of the total number of Americans who were detained and held in jail before their trials. That count includes those who can’t afford to pay bail, but it also includes other groups of people who are in jail before trial for different reasons. Included within that ""over 450,000"" statistic are people who are not bailable, like those being held without any bail, meaning that no amount of money paid would result in their release.   In other words, Lieu’s tweet is an overestimation of the number of Americans who are too poor to bail their way out of jail.   And there are still other groups included in the 458,600 figure. ""The unconvicted population in jails can also include mentally-ill persons awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility,"" Darren Hutchinson, a University of Florida professor, told us. Lauryn Gouldin, an Associate Professor of Law at Syracuse University, said that it’s also important to distinguish between judges who make informed, intentional decisions about setting high bails, and judges who are more careless in their decisions. ""Judges setting bail may be oblivious to the financial circumstances of those who end up detained (so is it ignorance/judicial accident that leads to detention) or judges may deliberately set high bails to assure detention for those they believe are high public safety/flight risks,"" Gouldin said. Because the BJS data only distinguishes ""convicted"" from ""unconvicted"" members of the jail population, there’s no way Lieu would know the exact number of how many people are in jail because they’re too poor to pay bail. Although the data on how many people can’t afford to pay bail is scarce, the experts we spoke to pointed to some resources that were the best data available. Gouldin cited a Vera Institute of Justice study that said nine out of 10 felony defendants are unable to afford the bail amount set by the judge. Meanwhile, Insha Rahman, a program director at the Vera Institute of Justice, pointed to two studies that locally analyzed how many people were being detained pretrial due to an inability to pay bail. In all three studies, a majority of the pretrial detainees were in jail because they could not afford to pay their bail. However, both Gouldin and Rahman cautioned against generalizing the results of these studies to the national unconvicted jail population. ""I think the tweet is about as accurate as our scandalous lack of attention to what we are doing in the criminal system allows,"" Alec Karakatsanis, the founder and Executive Director of Civil Rights Corps, said. Gouldin concurred, saying ""It would be great if we had more information about exactly how many of the (458,600 unconvicted Americans)...spend time in jail because they can’t afford bail. I think there is more attention being paid to the fact that we don’t have this information we should have."" Lieu tweeted, ""Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they’ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don’t have high powered attorneys."" The 450,000 number counts how many people are detained before their trials each year in America. However, Lieu uses it incorrectly here: included in that number are not only unconvicted inmates who are too poor to pay bail, but also unconvicted inmates who are being detained preventively and held without any bail. Experts confirmed that there is no national figure keeping track of how many unconvicted inmates are unable to pay bail. That said, the point of Lieu’s tweet—that some Americans languish in jail without ever being proven guilty—is largely accurate.   We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8AF740>],/factchecks/2018/jun/29/ted-lieu/do-more-450000-americans-sit-jail-because-they-are/
"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Rachel Maddow']","
Rachel Maddow is right. There was no plan for reuniting families split at border
","Following the initial uproar over President Donald Trump’s zero tolerance border policy, the focus shifted from the administration’s separation of families, to questions about what it was doing to put families back together. Media reports highlighting immigrants’ often fruitless attempts to reunite with relatives depicted a federal government ill-prepared to put thousands of parents back in touch with their children. ""There isn’t a system,"" Rachel Maddow said June 21. ""There isn’t a database … connecting the parent from whom the kid was separated, and the kid from whom the parent is separated."" We wanted to see if this was true. As it turns out, immigration experts, multiple government officials, a Republican-appointed federal judge and countless reports of immigrants struggling to find loved ones all point to the absence of a federal government system for reuniting families separated under Trump’s border policy. First, let’s recap the Trump border policy that set things in motion. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution. A good number of these people have been adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. As a result, under Trump’s policy, more than 2,000 kids have been placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter pending release to a legal guardian. Facing intense political pressure, Trump issued an executive order on June 20 that instructed immigration authorities to keep families together during their legal proceedings, within existing legal and resource constraints. It was not clear how or if the order would affect children already separated from their families. We reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security to ask about what system was in place, if any. We heard no response.  Immigration experts we spoke to highlighted crucial disconnects among federal agencies tasked with carrying out Trump’s family separation policy. Any workable system for family reunification, experts said, requires coordination between three offices: Customs and Border Protection, which apprehended and separated families, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which received children, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which detained parents. ""While we don’t know what conversations were occurring internally,"" said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, ""there is just not evidence of planning and coordination to address how parents would know where their children were, how they could communicate, and how reunifications would occur."" Louis Desipio, a political science professor at UC Irvine who specializes in immigration, said it’s likely that senior civil servants anticipated the problem, but lacked authority to pump the brakes on Trump’s aggressive policy shift to put an administrative structure in place. ""I don't believe there was a system in place when zero tolerance was implemented,"" Desipio told PolitiFact June 27. ""I haven't seen any evidence that they have improved the system in the past week or so."" Trump administration officials acknowledged that reunifying families was being done on the fly, months after the zero tolerance policy was announced. As Steven Wagner, a Trump appointee at Health and Human Services told the Washington Post June 19, ""This policy is relatively new, and we’re still working through the experience of reunifying parents with their kids after adjudication."" David FitzGerald, who co-directs the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, put it this way: ""The ‘zero tolerance’ policy was implemented with zero planning for putting families back together again."" Amid an international outcry over Trump’s border policy, a lawsuit against the administration brought by a separated family percolated through a federal court in San Diego. During a hearing, Judge Dana Sabraw of the Southern District of California repeatedly pressed the government’s lawyer on whether there was any system in place for keeping separated parents and children in contact. According to Politico, the judge ""sounded skeptical about the government’s stance,"" citing an apparent lack of communication among key agencies on how to reunite families. On June 26, Sabraw, a George W. Bush appointee, issued a blistering ruling against Trump’s family separation policy. Sabraw found ""there was no reunification plan in place,"" and ordered a preliminary injunction requiring the federal government to reunite children younger than 5 with their parents within two weeks, and return older children to their parents within 30 days. ""The government has no system in place to keep track of, provide effective communication with, and promptly produce alien children,"" Sabraw wrote. ""The unfortunate reality is that under the present system migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property."" Hours before the federal court order, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar appeared before the Senate Finance Committee. The hearing was ostensibly about prescription drug pricing, but quickly veered toward Trump’s border policy, with Azar playing down concerns about the administration’s handling of separated families. ""There is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located,"" Azar told the committee. ""I've sat on the (Office of Refugee Resettlement) portal with just basic keystrokes, within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent."" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the Trump administration was giving deceptively ""rosy answers"" and told Azar, ""Suffice it to say, portals are not part of the daily existence for these people."" Azar countered that the Office of Refugee Resettlement has an 800 number to connect family members. A Health and Human Services spokesman told us that unaccompanied children are also assigned case managers to help located families. Yet reporting from the Washington Post, New York Times, New Yorker and other firsthand accounts showed the shortcomings of the existing infrastructure. Attorneys described cases where clients were never told about the 800 number, calls rang with no answer, and instances where officials on the other end ""refused to offer details of where children had been taken."" Adults in detention claimed wait times of a half-hour, and no ability to provide a call-back number. Parents who were already deported discovered the 800 number often doesn’t work abroad, or is prohibitively expensive. When children were located, the federal government would not provide transportation, even if the child has been relocated to a shelter or foster home on the other side of the country. In the absence of a federal system, an ad hoc network of attorneys and aid workers is scrambling to reunite families. Maddow, in her June 21 broadcast, cited a New York Times article that quoted Anthony Enriquez, the director of the unaccompanied minors program for Catholic Charities. (Maddow did not respond to our request for comment.) ""There is no system whatsoever to track these family separations, no efforts systematically to reunite these families,"" Enriquez said. ""There is no supervisor, there is no database saying, ‘child here, parent there,’ so they can come back together."" During the Senate hearing, Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow said the more than 60 migrant children in Michigan foster homes have been unable to connect with their parents. ""As of my last contact with the agencies, they did not know, they were not given any information up to this point about where the parents are,"" the senator said. ""And there was not communication going on in terms of what's happening for these children."" The Trump administration has ushered in a partial fix, of sorts. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it would temporarily stop detaining adults who arrive with children, citing workload burdens, and two key agencies said on June 23 they would increase coordination. But the joint policy announcement makes clear the federal government’s beefed-up approach to family reunification applies only for the purpose of deportation. ""There is still no commitment to reunification for all families,"" said Greenberg, of the Migration Policy Institute. Maddow said, ""There isn't a system"" for reuniting families separated under Trump’s zero tolerance border policy. Crucial disconnects exist among key agencies tasked with implementing Trump’s family separation policy. Administration officials have acknowledged the lack of preparation. A Republican-appointed federal judge who ordered the government to reunite families found there was no reunification plan in place. Media reports have documented the government’s limited existing infrastructure, as a grassroots network of immigration attorneys and aid workers struggle to reunite families. We rate Maddow’s claim True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8F90C0>],/factchecks/2018/jun/29/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-right-there-was-no-plan-reuniting-fa/

Ohio GOP miscasts Sherrod Brown's longstanding policy on voter registration
","U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown criticized a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Ohio’s procedure to purge infrequent voters from the registration rolls. ""Ohio should be working to make voting easier, not harder,"" Brown, a Democrat, tweeted June 11. ""Instead, today’s decision empowers Ohio to further strip away the right to vote for thousands of Ohioans, threatening the integrity of our state’s election process."" The Ohio Republican Party called Brown a hypocrite because of a law he voted for that called for removing inactive voters. ""Here's a real fact you need to know: @ohdems were for this legal process of removing inactive voters before they were against it. As a State Rep in 1978, @SherrodBrown voted for stricter removal standards and then enforced them as Secretary of State! #Hypocrites,"" the Ohio GOP tweeted June 12. Brown faces a re-election challenge from U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci. We found that Brown did vote for the law cited by the Ohio GOP, but the tweet miscasts Brown’s longstanding policy on voter registration and takes the 1978 vote out of context. In 1977, Democrats, including Brown, passed Senate Bill 125, which set rules for voter registration statewide. At the time, many counties had no registration requirements. This bill specifically eliminated ""failure to vote as a reason for the cancellation of registration."" That same year, Republicans got a constitutional amendment on the ballot that ended same-day registration and also stated if a person failed to vote at least once in four years, then the person must re-register. Voters passed the amendment. The next year, the state took up the topic of voter registration again in HB 1209. The bill stated that each year, voter registrations would be canceled if the person hadn’t voted at least once in four years.The bill directed officials to send notices to voters stating their registration had been cancelled and a form to re-register. Brown voted in favor of this bill. Two years later, the Legislature passed HB 1062, which said elections officials must send out a notice 30 days prior to cancellation. Again, Brown voted in favor of this bill. We didn’t find any evidence from 40 years ago explaining Brown’s rationale at the time for voting for these bills. Republicans argue now that if Brown objected to purging voters he could have voted against the bills, but these bills were not establishing a new policy -- they were implementing what voters approved in the constitutional amendment. Brown couldn’t undo the constitutional amendment, but he could vote for bills that added requirements to notify voters. ""Brown voted for two bills to protect the rights of voters at risk of being purged,"" Brown spokesman Preston Maddock said. We didn’t want to just take the Brown campaign’s word for it, so we asked some long-time experts of Ohio politics about the backdrop of the 1978 bill that Brown supported. Bob Taft, who was a Republican in the General Assembly at the time, said the Democrats had to defer to the will of the voters as reflected in the amendment to the Constitution. ""They controlled the Legislature, so they nibbled around the edges of the amendment to provide for notice,"" Taft said. Taft later defeated Brown to become Ohio's secretary of state office and went on to serve as governor. Two retired long-time journalists in Ohio told us that the idea of purging voters from the rolls in the 1970s wasn’t the controversial idea that it is today. ""This whole thing about when we should cleanse voter rolls of people who haven’t voted only become an issue in this hyperpartisan age we live in now,"" said Mike Curtin, a former reporter and an associate publisher of the Columbus Dispatch who later became a Democratic state house member. The Ohio GOP said that Brown enforced the stricter removal standards when he served as secretary of state from 1982 to 1991. Maddock said that Brown had to follow state law. But he did have the power to try to grow the voter rolls, so he circulated voter registration forms just about everywhere, which included convincing McDonald’s to print voter registration forms on tray liners. Brown convinced other businesses, including banks, utilities and a telephone company, to mail out the registration forms. The state also distributed registration forms at welfare offices, lottery outlets and homeless shelters, in addition to public schools and government offices. ""If government can find you to make you pay taxes, if government can find you to draft you under the Selective Service System, then government can work a little harder to find you to register to vote,"" Brown said in 1988. The Washington Post wrote in 1985 that Ohio’s registration activity was ""probably the most intensive and wide-ranging in the nation."" The Republicans said that Brown enforced removal standards as secretary of state. He would have been obligated to follow the law, but he did warn voters about it. In 1990, Brown cautioned that having an outdated voter registration form would prohibit a voter from casting a ballot. ""Ohioans who have not voted for more than four years have had their registration canceled, because the Ohio Constitution requires it,"" he said in 1990, according to the Richwood Gazette. Two months later Brown lost re-election. In 1992, Brown was elected to Congress. The next year, he was one of dozens of co-sponsors of the National Voter Registration Act,which included provisions to make it harder for states to purge voters. Taft, Ohio’s secretary of state at the time, revised the state’s removal policy to comply with the NVRA. He created a six-year process for removals. If voters skip one federal election, they are sent a notice by a county board of elections. If the voter doesn’t respond and doesn’t vote over the next four years, their name is purged from the roll. In comparison, under the 1978 law, it only took four years. Also the 1978 law only notified voters after they had been removed while the current process sends a notice to voters before they are removed. Ohio Republicans said in 1978, Brown ""voted for stricter removal standards (for voter registration) and then enforced them as Secretary of State."" Brown did vote for a bill in 1978 that removed voters after four years, which is more strict that the six-year process upheld this year by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the GOP’s tweet ignores the context of that 1978 bill and what led to it. The bill implemented a policy approved by voters in a Constitutional amendment. Brown couldn’t undo the amendment. The Ohio GOP also ignores Brown’s full record on voter registration. In 1977, Brown voted for a bill that eliminated ""failure to vote as a reason for the cancellation of registration."" The Republicans also omit Brown’s efforts to increase the voter registration rolls while he was Secretary of State. During that time, he warned voters that they could have their registrations cancelled for not voting. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFE68C0>],/factchecks/2018/jun/29/ohio-republican-party/ohio-gop-miscasts-sherrod-browns-longstanding-poli/

Did Bill Nelson write the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast?
","A new ad in Florida’s hotly contested Senate race portrays a clear distinction between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican opponent Gov. Rick Scott when it comes to their record on offshore oil drilling. The ad accuses the term-limited governor of supporting offshore drilling even after the BP oil spill and claims that Scott’s January meeting about drilling with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was nothing more than a ""political stunt."" Then the ad by Nelson shifts to his record. ""Bill Nelson actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast,"" the text on the screen says. We’ve already taken a close look at Scott’s record on oil drilling when we gave him Full Flop in January. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. But that changed around the time of the meeting with Zinke. This time, we wanted to hone in on Nelson’s legislative record. Did Nelson actually write the law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast?   Environmental experts said Nelson deserves credit for protecting Florida’s Gulf Coast, but the legislation that actually was signed into law didn’t have Nelson’s name on it. Still, based on news reporting at that time, it was clear that Nelson’s bill (and the Republican who co-sponsored it) was the inspiration for the law that enacted a moratorium on drilling on the Gulf Coast. In 2006, Nelson teamed up with former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez to cosponsor a piece of legislation known as the Permanent Protection for Florida Act of 2006 (S.2239). That bill aimed to prohibit offshore drilling on the outer Continental Shelf near Florida. Specifically, the bill put a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral off much of the coast of Florida until June 30, 2020. Frank Jackalone, the director of Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, praised Nelson and Martinez when the bill was introduced. (The Sierra Club endorsed Nelson). ""Last week our Florida senators introduced legislation that would head off these threats by providing permanent protection for Florida’s coasts and extended protection for the remaining moratoria areas,"" Jackalone said in a speech he gave at the time ""... He and Senator Nelson have given us a wonderful example of bipartisan leadership that puts Florida’s economy and environment first.""   That bill was introduced in the Senate but did not get a hearing and never made it to law. So can Nelson really take credit for signing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast? Although Nelson and Martinez’s legislation was not signed into law, similar ideas were included in a section of another bill known as the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (S.3711), which was sponsored by former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. That bill enacted a moratorium on drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle until June 2022, among other things. It was signed into law Dec. 20, 2006. The bill didn’t have Nelson’s name on it, but each bill aimed to protect Florida’s Gulf Coast for oil drilling by placing a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral. Alyson Flournoy, a law professor at the University of Florida, said that if the language of Nelson’s bill was included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, we would treat Nelson as the author of that part of the law. We compared the text of Nelson and Martinez’s bill with the text from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to get a better look at the similarities between the two measures. The language in the 2006 Energy Act is not a carbon copy of Nelson’s bill, but conveys very similar ideas, especially about where drilling would be prohibited. For example, Nelson and Martinez’s bill defined the area off limits as the Florida exclusion zone. That area included: 25 miles west of the Military Mission Line, 150 miles off the Florida Panhandle, including the area commonly known as the ""Stovepipe’"" in the Gulf of Mexico, and 150 miles off the Florida east coast. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 enacted the moratorium on any area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico; any area in the Eastern Planning Area that is within 125 miles of the coastline of the State of Florida and part of the Central Planning Area that is in middle of the Gulf of Mexico.  So, Nelson’s bill isn’t the exact same language, but newspaper outlets at the time said that Nelson and Martinez worked together to make sure the Gulf of Mexico was protected from oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. ""Florida's U.S. senators, Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Mel Martinez, had helped craft the bill, and both voted for it this morning,"" the St. Petersburg Times wrote in 2006. ""Martinez, who negotiated the measure with input from Nelson, rebuffed suggestions that the delegation could successfully maintain its 'no drilling' stance,"" the Miami Herald wrote after the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act passed the House. Days before the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 was signed in to law. Martinez attended a press conference to speak about it. ""Nelson and I, both from Florida, have had longstanding concerns about protections we felt were necessary for Florida's fragile environment and also because of our very strong economies derived from tourism, that our coastal waters and beaches be protected,"" Martinez said. ""For that reason, the features of this bill that are attractive to us is the zone of protection that it creates for Florida along the Gulf Coast while at the same time permitting this very important additional exploration to take place."" Environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast. ""Nelson out of anybody has the right to brag about being the gatekeeper on the Eastern Gulf,"" said Julie Wraithmell, the executive director of Audubon Florida. ""If it wasn’t for him, we really would have struggled."" A campaign ad paid for by Nelson said he ""actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast."" The ad writers should be more careful with their language. Nelson co-sponsored legislation in 2006 that would have banned drilling off Florida’s coast. That measure was never signed in to law, but similar ideas were included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which, among other things, enacted a moratorium on drilling 125 miles of the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico until June 2022. According to news reports at that time, Nelson and Martinez negotiated and worked to make sure Florida’s Gulf Coast was protected under with the 2006 act. And even though the law was not an exact copy, environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast.

Tammy Baldwin opponent errs claiming 'billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes' went to Iran
","A prime attack Kevin Nicholson makes against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin concerns the Iran deal that President Donald Trump recently withdrew from. The deal, Nicholson declared, had ""handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.""
  Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are running in the August 2018 Republican primary for the right to challenge Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the November 2018 general election. The Delafield businessman made the statement on May 30, 2018, to conservative Green Bay radio talk show host John Muir. It is one he has made repeatedly. He mostly misses. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The backdrop About three weeks before Nicholson made the radio claim, Trump announced the United States would pull out of the nuclear pact with Iran and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, saying the deal failed to contain the regime’s nuclear ambitions and regional meddling. The easy part of Nicholson’s claim to check is Iran’s connection to terrorism. Iran has been on the U.S. State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. Those countries (Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea) have been determined to have ""repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism."" But let’s get to the thrust of Nicholson’s claim -- that the deal merely ""handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes"" to Iran and that Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it. The cash The deal, struck in July 2015 under President Barack Obama, was with Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. The deal restricted certain Iranian nuclear activities for periods between 10 to 25 years, and allowed for more intrusive, permanent monitoring. It also prohibited Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future. So, it wasn’t just merely turning over cash to Iran.   Latest Kevin Nicholson fact checks: ""Tammy Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence."" Mostly True. 
Says conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein is a Wisconsin resident. False. 
""There are more guns in this country than there are people."" Half True. As part of the deal, Iran did get access to tens of billions of dollars in assets  — but the vast majority of those assets are Iran’s own money. And what cash was delivered on a plane was far less than billions. As our PolitiFact colleagues have reported: The deal released Iranian assets frozen under a variety of sanctions. The assets, cash in the bank, real estate or something else, belonged to Iran in the first place. The total value  — worldwide — of freed Iranian assets was about $56 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. According to the U.S. State Department, Iran received about $1.7 billion from the United States  — $400 million plus interest. The payment was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered. Many news organizations reported the delivery of the $400 million in an unmarked cargo plane after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran. As for Baldwin’s backing of the Iran deal, she wasn’t among the first. Her campaign cited reports showing that Baldwin announced her support on Aug. 7, 2015  — after 13 other senators had done so. Our rating Nicholson says the Iran deal ""handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that."" Iran is on the United States’ list of state sponsors of terrorism. As part of a 2015 deal aimed making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, Iran got access to tens of billions of dollars of its own assets that had been frozen  — there weren’t billions of dollars sent on a plane. The United States, in a transaction indirectly linked to the Iran deal, did send on a plane $400 million in cash to Iran. Iran was owed the money because it had paid the United States for military hardware in 1979 that was never delivered. Finally, Baldwin was not among the first senators to support the Iran nuclear deal. Thirteen other senators had announced their support before she did. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Nicholson a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFE7580>],/factchecks/2018/jun/29/kevin-nicholson/tammy-baldwin-opponent-errs-claiming-billions-doll/

Website falsely claimed Twitter caught leaking private Trump messages to the Justice Department
","An old headline making new waves on social media falsely claimed Twitter was caught leaking President Donald Trump’s private messages to the Justice Department as part of an undercover sting operation. ""Twitter caught leaking Donald Trump’s private messages in undercover sting,"" said a Jan. 11, 2018, headline from Neon Nettle, an online news site created to provide an ""educational and thought provoking"" alternative to the mainstream news media, according to its about page. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""One of Twitter's senior engineers has admitted to hacking the president's private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice,"" the Neon Nettle story said. The headline is based on comments made by a Twitter engineer, but the engineer never said he had leaked information to the Justice Department. The story cited a video from Project Veritas, an investigative outlet run by conservative activist James O’Keefe, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count in 2010 for using a fake identity to enter a federal building and was sued for $1 million in 2017. Project Veritas has a proven history of using undercover reporting, hidden cameras and selectively-edited video recordings to serve a predetermined narrative. In 2017, the organization sent a woman posing as a sexual assault victim of Roy Moore — a candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama — to the Washington Post in an apparent effort to discredit the paper’s investigation into Moore’s predatory behavior. For this particular sting video, Project Veritas used hidden cameras to surreptitiously record two separate conversations between undercover journalists and Clay Haynes, a senior network security engineer at Twitter, according to LinkedIn. The journalists, dressed in disguises, asked leading questions in a clear effort to elicit certain responses from Haynes. ""We’re more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation (into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election),"" Haynes, who also expressed his personal disdain for Trump, said at one point. ""Basically, giving them every single tweet that he’s posted. Even the ones he’s deleted, any direct messages, any mentions."" In the second interview, Haynes said of the possibility of turning over Trump’s messages, ""We have a subpoena process for that very reason."" When asked whether Twitter was working with the Justice Department, he declined to comment. Both interviews occurred in January 2018, and Twitter issued a statement after Project Veritas published its video. ""The individual depicted in this video was speaking in a personal capacity and does not represent or speak for Twitter,"" a company spokesperson said. ""Twitter only responds to valid legal requests, and does not share any user information with law enforcement without such a request."" ""We deplore the deceptive and underhanded tactics by which this footage was obtained and selectively edited to fit a predetermined narrative,"" the spokesperson said. ""Twitter is committed to enforcing our rules without bias and empowering every voice on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules."" It is unclear from the video whether Haynes knew he was being recorded, though he does not seem to be aware. It is illegal to record a private conversation without the consent of both parties in California, where the video was taken. As Snopes previously noted, Project Veritas’ videos are ""virtually impossible to fact check without complete clips of the involved conversations"" because they use ""stitched-together, out-of-context remarks with no indication of what occurred or what was discussed just before and after the included portions."" According to Twitter’s Help Center, legal processes are required to trigger the release of private messages. ""Non-public information about Twitter users will not be released to law enforcement except in response to appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal process,"" the company policy said. ""Requests for the contents of communications … require a valid search warrant or equivalent from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Twitter."" Haynes did not say that Twitter leaked private messages from Trump. He said only that the company would be ""more than happy to help the DOJ"" were such help ever triggered by a legal process. We searched Google and Nexis and did not find any reports that Twitter was cooperating in this fashion with special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into the 2016 election, although the company did meet with the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss Russian bot accounts on its site. But even if we were to take Project Veritas’ video at face value, the Neon Nettle headline was misleading. The video showed Twitter to be capable of granting access to Trump’s private messages — a capability that most technology companies maintain — but the company was not caught leaking them. Neon Nettle did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this statement False.

No, a Trump supporter did not try to murder Rep. Maxine Waters following Trump 'threat'
","A headline buzzing on social media falsely said one of President Donald Trump’s supporters was charged with attempting to murder U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the same day Trump targeted her on Twitter. ""A Trump fan was just charged with trying to murder Maxine Waters on same day Trump threatened her,"" said a June 26, 2018, headline from The Washington Press, an online news website. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This story is false. According to the inaccurate report, Trump’s attack on Waters was a ""barely veiled threat"" based on a misunderstanding of Waters’ comments about the public’s treatment of officials in the Trump administration. The tweet came in response to video footage that showed Waters, at a rally outside a federal office building in Los Angeles, encouraging Trump opponents to boo or harass Trump administrators in public spaces. ""Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!,"" Trump wrote. The false story said Trump’s tweet coincided with a California man’s guilty plea in relation to a murder threat delivered to Waters. The plea — entered by Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, of San Pedro, California — proved that ""the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences,"" the story said.   The story erred in getting details and timing of real incidents wrong. A man by the name of Anthony Scott Lloyd did, in fact, plead guilty to threatening a United States official. Lloyd phoned Waters’ office on Oct. 22, 2017, and left a voicemail riddled with derogatory language, including racial epithets and expletives. The message used the words ""dead"" and ""kill"" a total of four times, according to a press release from the Department of Justice. ""If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you,"" Lloyd said, according to court documents. ""If you do it again, you’re dead."" (We obtained a digital copy of the plea agreement, which included a full transcript of the voicemail, from Thom Mrozek, spokesperson for the United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California.) But Lloyd plead guilty on April 16, 2018, and Trump tweeted at Waters more than two months later on June 25, 2018. So it is not true that the two events occurred on the same day, as the false headline suggested. The headline is likely not the result of confusion, either, because no reports related to Lloyd’s case were released on the day of Trump’s tweet. Lloyd’s sentencing date is set for July 16, 2018, and Mrozek said there have not been any new developments in the case since the guilty plea. Plus, Lloyd only plead guilty to threatening Waters. He was not charged with ""trying to murder"" the congresswoman. Mrozek said prosecutors have not made any allegations related to an actual attempt at murder. The Washington Press did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this statement False.

Is claim that Austin soccer plan is a $1 billion giveaway on target or worth a red card?
","It’s an alarming contention: The Austin City Council is poised to ""give"" more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return as it seeks to lure a Major League Soccer team. The anti-stadium political action committee making the claim of a ""$1 billion giveaway"" — called Austin for a Better Future — drives home the enormity of the sum in an internet video by conjuring a wish list of alternative uses for the money. By Wednesday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 20,000 times. ""Imagine what else we could do with another billion dollars to make our city even better,"" intones the video’s youthful-looking narrator. He raises the prospect of using the money to instead fund annual pay raises for Austin school teachers, ""full-ride scholarships"" to the University of Texas for every local high school graduate, or newly built homes ""for every single homeless person in the city of Austin."" Setting aside that no formal proposals exist to spend $1 billion on any of those items, we were curious whether it’s accurate to say the City Council will be handing such an amount to a private company and getting nothing in return if it approves the agreement for the soccer stadium as it currently is formulated? A representative of the anti-stadium group contacted by PolitiFact Texas said the $1 billion figure is based on simple math and actually is conservative. But two professors who study publicly funded economic incentives said the group’s analysis is off base, with one calling the $1 billion amount that the group came up with ""crazy"" and the other saying it ""doesn’t pass the sniff test."" Under the stadium proposal — on which the City Council is slated to take some key initial votes Thursday — the city-owned McKalla Place tract near the Domain in North Austin would be leased to Precourt Sports Ventures for $1 a year. Precourt, a Major League Soccer team owner, would then privately finance and build what it has estimated would be a $200 million stadium at the site. The city would own the land and the stadium, so Precourt wouldn’t pay any property taxes on the facility. The initial lease would last for 20 years, with three options for Precourt to renew it under the same terms. The anti-stadium group, which initially answered questions from PolitiFact Texas through e-mail but didn’t respond to a follow-up request for a phone interview, said it arrived at the ""$1 billion giveaway"" figure by first calculating the estimated property taxes that would be owed by Precourt if it owned the land, instead of leasing it from the city, and also made $250 million worth of improvements on it, which the anti-stadium group pegged as the value of the soccer stadium. The group then took that figure, based on 2017 property tax rates, and multiplied it by 80 years — the maximum term of the proposed lease, assuming all options were exercised. It also assumed 2.5 percent annual growth in local property values, arriving at its $1 billion-plus total. But Clint Peinhardt, a University of Texas at Dallas political science professor, said such an analysis has many holes, not the least of which is that 80 years is simply too long a time period to forecast accurately. Who knows, for instance, if soccer will even be played in 80 years, or if it will become so huge in the United States that it tops football in terms of a loyal fan base. What’s more, the anti-stadium group’s analysis doesn’t factor in depreciation, which would have a major impact on the value of the facility and the tax calculation. Or the possibility that the lease would not be renewed by the soccer team’s ownership. Or the potential for something even more outlandish — such as a meteor destroying the site and rendering the entire exercise moot. ""Anything that far out in the future — 80 years — is a pretty crazy thing to try to guess,"" Peinhardt said. ""In general, that is just a huge time frame."" As a result, Peinhardt and Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas at Austin professor of government, said it’s too much of a leap of logic to simply add up the value of property taxes that wouldn’t be due for decades and then contend city leaders are ""giving them away"" in the present if they approve the stadium plan. They said the ""time value of money"" — whereby a dollar today is worth much more than a theoretical dollar in the future — just doesn’t work that way. The pair also noted that the anti-stadium group’s analysis assumes no benefits to the city — in terms of jobs, tourism or nearby development — to offset the purported $1 billion cost to taxpayers. While taxpayer incentives for a soccer stadium might not be the most ""revenue-maximizing"" path for the city to choose for the McKalla site — particularly since other plans recently have been proposed for the tract — they said the potential positives should be considered along with the negatives. There is also the detail that, as currently proposed, the city would still own the stadium outright if the team’s ownership didn’t renew the deal. Jensen described himself as a critic of the current stadium plan, but he nonetheless dismissed the anti-stadium group’s number, saying it isn’t ""a credible calculation"" or a serious fiscal analysis. Our ruling A video by an anti-stadium group claims the Austin City Council is poised to give more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return. While the City Council could potentially provide incentives worth millions of dollars as part of the soccer stadium deal, the scary ""$1 billion giveaway"" language of the video simply doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny. The lengthy time frame invoked and the countless unknown events that could impact the deal make the math used in the video meaningless. Factor in that the video also doesn’t account for any return on the city’s investment, and it is clear that the contentions are off base  — and ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

No, Red Hen owner didn't threaten Sarah Huckabee Sanders
","Editor’s note: After our fact-check appeared, some readers emailed us to ask about a comment by Sanders’ father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, about the Red Hen restaurant owner. He told Laura Ingraham on her radio show that that after Sanders and her husband left, the rest of her family went to another restaurant, and the Red Hen owner ""followed them across the street, called people, and organized a protest yelling and screaming at them from outside the other restaurant and creating this scene."" Huckabee made a similar statement to Trish Regan on Fox.  Snopes, a fact-checking website, rated the claim Mostly False after interviewing businesses near the restaurant. Snopes found that Sanders’ inlaws went to another nearby restaurant, the Southern Inn, and at some point in the evening members of the group encountered Wilkinson outside on the street, but it’s not clear whether Wilkinson followed them there or simply happened to be passing by.  PolitiFact contacted the Lexington, Va. police to ask if they had any reports of a threat against Sanders and did not get a reply. The Red Hen’s request for President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave the restaurant has fueled some exaggerations on social media. ""Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders after biz was destroyed by booting her,"" said a June 26 headline by The Houston Post, a pro-Trump website which has the same name as a now defunct newspaper. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Although the Red Hen owner’s decision to ask Sanders to leave led to a firestorm of both criticism and support, we found no evidence that she threatened Sanders. The Houston Post story doesn’t contain any information about a threat. Here’s what happened at the Lexington, Va., restaurant: on June 22, Stephanie Wilkinson asked Sanders to leave her restaurant after staff members raised concerns. Wilkinson told the Washington Post that Sanders works in an ""inhumane and unethical"" administration. ""I'm not a huge fan of confrontation,"" Wilkinson said. But ""this feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals."" Sanders left without incident and later tweeted: ""Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so."" While we found no evidence that Wilkinson threatened anyone, The Roanoke Times reported that a man was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after he tossed a bucket of chicken manure on the sidewalk beside the restaurant and shouted, ""Make America great again,"" Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan. We found no contact information on the Houston Post’s website. We sent an email to The Red Hen and did not get a reply. The Houston Post wrote that ""Red Hen owner just issued sick threat to Sarah Sanders."" Wilkinson, the owner of the Red Hen, asked Sanders to leave her restaurant June 22.

Story takes actor Kurt Russell's comments about politics out of context
","A story on Facebook said that actor Kurt Russell ""falls into the rare category of celebrities who isn’t crying over Hillary Clinton’s loss"" and doesn’t feel a need to announce his political opinions. Russell said that ""the last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political,"" according to an article on Twentyeightmay, a pro-Donald Trump website.

Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

I’m a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways."" The story said that Russell made those comments in response to Meryl Streep’s comments at the Golden Globes. But Streep’s criticism of Trump for imitating a disabled reporter occurred at the awards ceremony in January 2017 while that quote by Russell was published in September 2016 in an interview with Stephen Whitty, a freelance critic at the time for The New Jersey Star-Ledger. Whitty told PolitiFact that Russell ""was talking, very generally, about being a libertarian or conservative in Hollywood"" and that he didn’t recall him ever mentioning any candidate by name. The twentyeightmay story also said that Russell recently said: ""The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political."" Russell did make that statement, but that was on The View in December 2015 when Whoopi Goldberg asked him about his recent comments that he believed gun control laws wouldn’t deter terrorists. At the time he made statements about gun control, he was discussing his upcoming movie The Hateful Eight, directed by Quentin Tarantino. ""The last thing I like to watch is entertainers or actors get political. It's just something I can't stand watching. So having said that, no, I was asked, I was asked to put it in context somehow with this movie. You know, my personal feeling is that there's a big difference between fantasyland and reality. Fantasyland is what we do. You're either writing something, writing a song, writing a book, doing a movie, doing a television show. That's fantasyland. And that’s where that stuff belongs."" Russell continued, saying that people have different opinions about how to deal with terrorism and he talked about his views on why the Founding Fathers included the Second Amendment. We were unable to find any contact information on the twentyeightmay website. A story by the Twentyeightmay website said that actor Kurt Russell said that celebrities shouldn't ""get political"" when it comes to Donald Trump.

Did Hillary Clinton support a border wall with Mexico?
","As President Donald Trump continues to press an aggressive border enforcement policy, some conservatives have said Democrats’ expression of sympathy for children separated from their parents is a more about political expediency than sincere concern. As evidence of Democrats’ calculating approach to immigration, syndicated conservative columnist Cal Thomas argued Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton supported a border wall prior to her 2016 White House bid, when ""build the wall"" became a Trump rallying cry. ""Need proof that the current controversy over children of undocumented immigrants is more political than humanitarian?"" Thomas wrote June 20. ""Hillary Clinton said she was ‘adamantly against illegal immigrants’ and supported a border wall until she ran for president in 2016."" We decided to revisit Clinton’s record to see if she once backed a wall along the lines of what Trump proposed during the election. We found that while Clinton supported more border security, the plans back then were not the kind of wall Trump has proposed, and Trump himself said that what Clinton supported was inadequate. Thomas’ column linked to a video clip of Clinton discussing her voting record on immigration while a senator. ""I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in,"" Clinton told an audience at a campaign stop Nov. 9, 2015. ""And I do think you have to control your borders."" Clinton voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which President George W. Bush signed after the measure cleared the Republican-held Congress. It authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Then-Sen. Clinton voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. (Notably, then-Sen. Barack Obama and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer voted for it, too.) Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. So how does the fence-building measure Clinton supported compare to Trump’s wall? For her part, Clinton sought to distinguish the two after TV news anchor Jorge Ramos put the question to her at a campaign event. ""What is the difference between your idea and Donald Trump’s idea on building a wall with Mexico?"" Ramos asked at the Jan. 11, 2016 Iowa Black and Brown Forum. ""So we do need to have secure borders and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier,"" Clinton said. ""You want a wall then,"" Ramos interjected.   ""No, we’ve —"" she said. ""You said that,"" he said. ""Well, I voted for border security, and some of it was a fence,"" Clinton said. ""I don’t think we ever called it a wall. Maybe in some places it was a wall."" On one hand, the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence may not seem too significant because both block people. However, there are significant differences between the fence Clinton voted for, and the wall Trump pitched during the campaign, which he promised would be an impenetrable, physical, tall and ""beautiful"" wall that Mexico would pay for. The plans Trump articulated for the wall during the campaign were somewhat vague and inconsistent. He said the wall didn't need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher.   In any case, Trump himself criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 election. ""Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,"" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn’t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.) Thomas said that Clinton ""supported a border wall until she ran for president in 2016."" Clinton did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. But the fence she voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump proposed. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a ""nothing wall.""
