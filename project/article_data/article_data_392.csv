Do two Milwaukee Public Schools rank among Wisconsin's top three high schools?
","In Madison, debates about education often paint a grim picture for public schools, especially Milwaukee Public Schools. In an effort to show public schools can provide quality education, state Rep. David Bowen (D-Milwaukee) hailed two MPS high schools as being rated among the top three in the state. Bowen’s statement was in response to a Republican proposal to turn low-performing schools in MPS over to operators of public charter or private voucher schools. On the most recent state-issued report cards, 55 of the 157 MPS schools received ""fails to meet expectations"" rating, the threshold that would make them eligible for the potential takeover. In a May 11, 2015 news release, Bowen called the proposal misguided. ""Charter and voucher schools are not a magic bullet that will solve the problems faced by struggling schools in the Milwaukee Public Schools system,"" he said. ""Two of the top three public high schools in Wisconsin — Ronald Reagan College Prep and Rufus King International — are MPS schools."" Reagan and King are known as two of the best schools in the Milwaukee area, but do they really fare so well in a statewide ranking? About the ratings  When asked for back up, Bowen’s team directed us to the 2014 U.S. News and World Report list of the nation’s best high schools. In the Wisconsin ranking, Reagan and King held the second and thirds spots in the state after Middleton High School. But U.S. News’ algorithm isn’t the only way to rank schools. Many other news organizations — most notably Newsweek and the Washington Post — generate similar lists. Newsweek releases an annual list of the 500 best schools in the country, focusing on participation in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate tests. King and Reagan weren’t mentioned on Newsweek’s 2014 list, though 22 other Wisconsin schools received the distinction. The Washington Post’s Most Challenging Schools list also bases its ranking on the number of college-level tests given at a school and the number of graduates that year. King was ranked third on the Post’s list of Wisconsin schools, while Reagan filled the number 10 spot. U.S. News’ rating system is more thorough than other media-created ""best high schools"" lists. So how does the magazine decide which schools are best? U.S. News says its methodology seeks to recognize schools that serve all its students well --not just the college bound -- and produce measurable outcomes across its student body. First, reading and math test results from schools across the country are analyzed. Students at a school need to exceed expectations for students in their state to move on to the next round. For 2014, a school’s students needed to be at least in the top third. The second step looks at the performance of disadvantaged students — black, Hispanic and low-income students — in each school. To make it to the next step, this group within a school must outperform statewide results for the same group. The final step examines how well students from a school are prepared for college. Participation and performance on Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate tests are used to calculate a college readiness index for each school. To be numerically ranked, a school needs to pass steps one and two and then have a college readiness index above the benchmark. The same basic formula is used to create the rating each year, but the exact methodology to judge schools changes. Schools bounce around the ratings due to small tweaks in methodology, which makes year-to-year comparisons difficult. For example, on the 2015 ratings released by U.S. News just one day after Bowen made his statement, both schools dropped out of the top three for the state ranking. Reagan fell six places and King fell nine to be ranked 8th and 12th in the state, respectively. Andy Rotherham, co-founder and partner at Bellwether Education Partners and a contributing editor to U.S. News and World Report, said he feels the magazine’s multi-step process makes the list more valid than other measures. ""Having a politician say a school is good or bad based on these ratings is not egregious,"" he said. The ranking is useful, he said, but added it is just one measurement. ""There’s so many ways to judge schools,"" Rotherham said. ""You have to say, ‘It’s the best school based on these criteria.’ "" Other views Other experts guide against putting too much stock in any such ratings. Matthew Di Carlo, research fellow at the Albert Shanker Institute, which focuses on public education issues, said school ratings require nuanced interpretation. ""Due to the measures they use and how they use them, (the rankings) tend to conflate student performance with school performance,"" Di Carlo said. It’s more fitting, he said, to describe schools featured on such these lists as ones with the highest performing students, rather than the best schools. Di Carlo said growth-oriented measures can give a better sense of a school’s contribution to student success than the data used to create these lists. ""Any attempt to portray these rankings as identifying ‘the best schools’ requires serious caution,"" Di Carlo said. The state-issued school report cards in Wisconsin do assess some schools using growth-oriented measures, though not high schools. Just one year of test results is available for high school students, and multiple points of assessment are needed to show growth. This means the state’s high school report cards use the same student performance measures as the media-generated rankings. So you can’t easily tell what impact a school is having on a student’s test scores. King and Reagan both received ""meets expectations"" rating for overall accountability from the Department of Public Instruction. The highest rating -- ""exceeds expectations""-- was given to 176 high schools. Our rating  Bowen said Rufus King International and Ronald Reagan College Prep are two of the top three public high schools in the state. That corresponds to the U.S. News ranking for 2014, which was the most recent at the time he made the claim. But, other ratings painted a different picture and experts are wary about the validity of the methodology to measure school success. We rate Bowen’s claim Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280978A0B40>],/factchecks/2015/jun/04/david-bowen/do-two-milwaukee-public-schools-rank-among-wiscons/

A scarlet 'S'? Al Sharpton said Texas lawmakers added subsidy designation for Obamacare users
","MSNBC host Al Sharpton accused Texas Republicans of trying to slap a ""scarlet letter"" on people who use private health insurance under Obamacare. ""The Texas Senate just approved a bill to put a special label on the insurance cards of anyone who bought a plan through Obamacare,"" Sharpton said on PoliticsNation on May 29. ""But if those labels weren't absurd enough, anyone who receives financial assistance for insurance would have a letter 'S' on the cards, too. 'S' for subsidy."" Sharpton said critics of the move worry that it might lead hospitals and doctors to turn away patients who use tax credits to make their insurance more affordable. We wondered: Did the Texas Senate approve a new ID card that includes an ""S"" for subsidized Obamacare plans? The missing 'S' The bill in question, HB 1514, started in the Texas House. The original language indeed included reference to the letter ""S."" Here’s that text: An identification card or other similar document issued by a qualified health plan issuer to an enrollee of a qualified health plan in this state must ,... display on the card or document in a location of the issuer’s choice: (1) The acronym ""QHP""; or (2) If the enrollee receives advance payment of the premium tax credit, the acronym ""QHP-S"". The bill’s language is in government-speak, but basically any enrollee in a qualified health plan (more on that in a bit) who gets a premium tax credit through the federal health care exchange would receive a card that includes the letter ""S."" That would be a clear cue to a doctor or hospital that a person’s health insurance is being subsidized by the federal government. But before the bill passed the House (by a vote of 129 to 8 margin) on May 11, that language was amended. The revised bill dropped the letter S. Here’s the text the Senate passed on May 26, 2015: An identification card or other similar document issued by a qualified health plan issuer to an enrollee of a qualified health plan purchased through an exchange must... display on the card or document in a location of the issuer’s choice the acronym ""QHP."" So Sharpton was more than two weeks out of date. The Texas bill requires that insurance through the online exchange be labeled as such, but the precise identification of those who use the federal tax credits is not part of the bill. An MSNBC spokeswoman said Sharpton would address this issue on his June 3 show. What the QHP label tells providers So all plans purchased through the federal exchange -- whether they include a subsidy or not -- would have ID cards marked QHP. Why is that? Hospitals and doctors say the issue is that people who buy their insurance through the federal government’s exchange have 90 days to stay current with their premiums. That’s two months longer than the industry standard. If a patient goes to the hospital during the first month that they have failed to pay, even if they never pay another dime of their premium, the insurance company will cover the cost. But for care given in the second and third months, federal law allows the insurance companies to make the providers pick up the tab retroactively. That’s what the providers want to avoid. The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Hospital Association, the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, and other trade groups supported the bill. Neurologist Sara Austin, a medical association member, testified that seeing the QHP designation would create a teachable moment with such patients. It would be an ""opportunity to stress the importance of continuing to pay their portion of the premium that is not subsidized by the federal government,"" she said. Austin said the change would reduce the number of times that providers have to go after patients to collect on a bill. But it’s unclear how much the current bill will accomplish. Sabrina Corlette, director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, thinks it won’t do much. ""That label wouldn't tell a provider whether the patient is actually in the grace period,"" Corlette said. ""It also doesn't tell the provider whether the patient is subsidy eligible. So I wouldn't think it provides much in the way of useful information."" However, Corlette said there is a possibility that the QHP label might prompt providers to call insurance companies before they provide care, rather than afterward. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 85 percent of plans purchased through the federal exchange in Texas receive a tax subsidy. There’s also room for a tug-of-war between the providers and insurers. Federal regulations require the insurance companies to put hospitals and doctors on notice when there is a possibility that claims might be denied because the patient is in the second or third month of the grace period. In other words, under existing law, the providers have another option to seeking collection from the patient who fails to pay his premiums. They can go after the insurance companies. Our ruling Sharpton said that the Texas bill would add a label to insurance cards for coverage purchased through the federal exchanges and that people receiving a subsidy would see the letter ""S"" on their insurance card. That provision was dropped more than two weeks before Sharpton said it. The bill that passed the Legislature and has been sent to the governor would add the letters QHP to any insurance card tied to a health care plan on the federal exchange. But it wouldn’t differentiate between those purchased with or without a federal tax credit. Special label? Yes. Scarlet ""S""? No. Sharpton’s claim rates Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CC800>],/factchecks/2015/jun/03/al-sharpton/sharpton-texas-lawmakers-want-insurance-cards-carr/

Rick Perry says 1 in 5 U.S. children live in a family 'on food stamps'
","Addressing Iowans, expected Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry said he’s optimistic about the country’s future once there’s a leadership change, even though Americans remain unemployed and children continue to be hungry. ""Now I understand there’s pessimism out there and there’s good reason for it,"" the former Texas governor said May 16, 2015. ""One out of 10 Americans are out of a job or underemployed or just completely quit looking for a job. One out of five of our children live in a family that’s on food stamps. What did we have, 0.2 (percent) growth last month? That may be good enough for Barack Obama, it may be good enough for the Democrats, but it’s not good enough for me. I know America can do better."" Perry’s first couple of figures didn’t seem new to us. In April 2015, the federal government announced the economy had grown 0.2 percent in the year’s first quarter. And according to the government, 10.8 percent of the American workforce in April 2015 were unemployed, underemployed or wanting a job but not lately looking--compared to 12.3 percent a year before. For this fact check, we wondered if one child in five lives in a family on food stamps, meaning government aid for buying groceries. A note: paper food stamps have not existed for nearly a decade since Congress in 2008 required states to shift to plastic cards, like credit cards, that may be presented at checkout stands. The one-time Food Stamps Program is now the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (In January 2010, the Smithsonian acquired ye olden food stamps for possible exhibits, J.C. Dwyer, a Texas anti-hunger activist, pointed out to us.) Perry’s backup To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry reached his statement based on a February 2015 U.S. Census Bureau press release stating the number of children receiving SNAP benefits remains higher than it was before the start of the Great Recession in 2007. In 2014, the release said, an estimated 16 million children, or about one in five, received the assistance compared with the roughly 9 million children, or one in eight, getting such help before the recession. The bureau said the declared 2014 ratio was based on responses to a supplemental part of its 2014 Current Population Survey. Confirmation We followed up with the Census Bureau, where demographer Jonathan Vespa said by email that Perry got it right. We wondered about comparable Texas figures and didn’t get perfectly comparable numbers. Results of the Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey indicated nearly 1.3 million of the state’s 9.1 million households, or 14 percent, reported receiving SNAP aid sometime in the previous 12 months. The Texas households where respondents said they got the benefits included more than 842,000 with children under the age of 18, 9 percent of all Texas households, according to the survey. We also asked Feeding Texas, a nonprofit whose mission is a hunger-free state, to assess Perry’s claim. Celia Cole, the group’s CEO, said by email: ""Perry is right."" And how does Texas stack up? By email, Dwyer, a Feeding Texas official, pointed out data posted online by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission indicating that in April 2015, 2 million Texas children received SNAP benefits. Given that the state demographer estimates that 6.9 million to 7.3 million children live in the state, Dwyer suggested, it looks like up to 30 percent of the children received SNAP benefits--similar to the rate the previous four Aprils based on Dwyer’s methodology. Nationally, Dwyer pointed out, previous bureau reports indicate that as few as 1 in 6 children received SNAP benefits in the past four years. ""Texas generally has a higher percentage of its population receiving SNAP compared to the nation,"" Dwyer said. ""This is because the primary factor in determining eligibility for SNAP is low-income, and Texas has a significantly higher percentage of families with low income / living in poverty."" In January 2015, we found Half True a Democratic claim that since Perry became governor in late 2000, ""poverty rates in Texas increased from 15.1% to 17.5% — which is higher than the national average."" Those figures were supported by federal surveys, but they did not tell the full story. Texas’ poverty rate went down and then up again over Perry’s decade-plus as governor, and the gap between the nation and Texas ultimately narrowed. We also suggested it’s unreasonable to lay all blame for a state’s poverty rate on its governor; national economic factors dominate. Our ruling Perry said: ""One out of five of our children live in a family that’s on food stamps."" To be precise, the latest federal estimate is that in 2014, 1 in 5 children received SNAP benefits.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Florida', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says 1.3 million jobs were created in Florida during his tenure -- more than Texas
","At an event in Orlando attended by several GOP presidential contenders, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a likely Republican candidate, touted his state’s record on job creation during his tenure. ""In Florida, during my eight years, we grew at 4.4 percent per year, and we created, together, many of the people in this room, by creating a better environment, we created 1.3 million net new jobs -- more jobs created than Texas, more jobs created than any state in country other than California, a state 2 1/2 times our size,"" Bush said. That’s a direct knock at one of his likely rivals in the presidential race -- former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who also spoke at the summit and is expected to announce his candidacy for president later this week. We decided to look at the number of jobs created in Florida and Texas, respectively, and how much credit Bush deserves for that. Bush was governor from January 1999 through January 2007; Perry was governor from late 2000 to early 2015. Net jobs in Florida vs. Texas Bush’s term in office was bookended by two periods of robust job growth -- 1998-2000 and 2004-06. The 2007 recession hit after he left office. Bush’s spokesman pointed to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for total, nonfarm, seasonally adjusted jobs. In Florida, there were about 6.7 million such jobs in December 1998 and 8 million in December 2006. That works out to about 1.3 million net new jobs. By comparison, in Texas, there were about 9.1 million jobs in December 1998 and 10.2 million jobs in December 2006. That works out to 1.1 million net new jobs. So during Bush’s two terms in office -- which, we’ll note, includes a period before Perry was governor -- the number of net new jobs in Florida was 186,800 higher than in Texas. Does Bush get credit for the job growth? Bush took a measure of credit during his speech. And on his PAC’s website, Bush also took credit for growth saying that ""his limited-government approach helped unleash one of the most robust and dynamic economies in the nation, creating 1.3 million net new jobs ... ."" Is that justified? We started by asking his spokesman if he could point to anything that Bush did to fuel that job growth. ""Creating 1.3 million new jobs and leading the nation in job creation over your final five years in office doesn’t just happen by riding an economic wave,"" Matt Gorman said. ""That takes strong, pro-growth economic policies like those put in place by Gov. Bush. He consistently improved Florida's business climate, including cutting taxes every year he was in office."" PolitiFact has frequently noted that when it comes to the economy and jobs, assigning credit (or blame) for a given statistical accomplishment isn’t as clear cut as politicians would like voters to believe. Much has to do with timing: Bush was fortunate to have governed during some economically robust years. ""It is very hard to measure how much credit Gov. Bush should get for the job creation in Florida during his eight years, since so many different factors affect a state's job creation,"" George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair said. Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness, compared the state’s economy to an omelet with many ingredients going into the final product. Snaith said it’s ""difficult to point to one specific ingredient as being responsible for the omelet itself. Florida’s economy performed very well during this time period, the economic omelet was quite tasty. Not all of the ingredients, however, originated in Tallahassee’s kitchen. Low interest rates and a global thirst for oil impacted these state’s economies but neither had any control of these important ingredients."" Moody’s economist Kwame Donaldson added that in the early 2000s, Nevada and Arizona  experienced a similar growth trajectory as Florida, suggesting that Bush’s policies were not singularly responsible for his state’s growth. (Arizona, for instance, had a Democratic governor for the second half of the period in question.) Construction fueled Florida’s job growth -- and then bust The experts added that it’s worth looking at what happened after Bush left office. Texas’ job growth during that time frame was also relatively strong – a 19.6 percent increase in Florida vs. a 12.5 percent increase in Texas. Both states were higher than the 7.6 percent for the country as a whole over that period, said David Cooper, an expert on state labor markets at the Economic Policy Institute. Construction employment in Florida grew by 46.6 percent over that time frame -- more than double the growth in Texas and the nation. Then, when the recession hit, the construction job market in Florida nosedived. As a result, ""Florida’s job losses were much more severe than in Texas,"" Cooper said. ""I am not sure that the job growth during Jeb Bush administration should be celebrated, because it was primarily fueled by a housing bubble that burst as Bush’s term was ending,"" said Donaldson of Moody’s. ""Florida is still struggling to recover from this housing bust."" Sinclair concurred. ""Although it makes more sense for a governor to compare across states in order to somewhat control for national level events, it would also be fair for him to take some of the blame for the worse performance of Florida so soon after he left office if he wants to take credit for the good times,"" she said. Texas, by contrast, was not as hard hit because it had stronger bank regulation, meaning it didn’t have as many bad loans as Florida, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. As The Economist explained in 2010, ""Texas has strict rules on home-equity lending, relative to other states, and this has helped to prevent ratios of loan size to home value from rising as high as they have elsewhere."" Residential construction fell by about two thirds in Texas, but it collapsed by even more -- 85 percent -- in Florida, said Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis. ""I certainly wouldn’t blame only Gov. Bush for Florida’s recession — there were many culpable parties that overlooked and underestimated the effect of horrific lending standards and bad mortgages — but Gov. Bush certainly didn’t prevent or mitigate the recession either,"" he said. ""Vermont is an example where state policy restricted the housing boom but prevented the housing bust."" It’s also worth noting that the sheer number of new jobs doesn’t say much about how well they paid, said Harry Holzer, a Georgetown University economist who is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Texas and Florida are both places that get a big influx of migrants either from other states or immigrants from other countries and I think they drive a lot of job creation in both places, often low-wage job creation,"" Holzer said. Our ruling Bush said that during his eight years in office, ""we created 1.3 million net new jobs, more jobs created than Texas."" He got his numbers right, but it’s worth noting that no governor is solely, or even mostly, responsible for economic growth in their state -- and if he wants to take credit for the expansion on his watch, then he also needs to shoulder some of the blame for the bust that followed his departure from office. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A13C0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/03/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-13-million-jobs-were-created-florida/

Barack Obama says U.S. today 'is the most respected country on Earth'
","President Barack Obama expressed pride in how the global image of the United States has improved on his watch during a White House event with fellows of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. ""People don’t remember -- when I came into office, the United States in world opinion ranked below China and just barely above Russia,"" Obama said. ""And today, once again, the United States is the most respected country on Earth."" We wondered whether it was true that the United States today is ""the most respected"" country on Earth, so we took a closer look. The evidence we found is something of a mixed bag. When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, they pointed us to a periodic survey by Gallup. The most recent Gallup poll, covering 2014 and released April 21, 2015, is based on face-to-face and telephone interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, age 15 and older, in each of more than 130 countries. The Gallup poll asks respondents whether they approve of the leadership of the United States, Germany, the European Union, China and Russia. In 2014, the United States finished first among this group. The median approval rating for the United States was 45 percent. That contrasts with 2008, President George W. Bush’s last year in office, when the U.S. scored 34 percent, trailing Germany, the European Union and China. That year, Russia was a bit lower at 30 percent.  The White House added that the Pew Research Center backs up the notion that the country’s image has improved under Obama. ""America’s image began to rally in some nations and to soar by the end of the decade following the election of Barack Obama, at least in Europe and parts of Asia and Latin America,"" Pew wrote in 2014. ""After slipping a bit again in the first years of this decade, brand U.S. has stabilized and even recovered in a few nations in 2014."" But a different survey we found showed that the United States trailed other countries. Every year, the BBC publishes a survey that asks people for their opinions about a variety of countries’ ""influence on the world."" The most recent survey was conducted between December 2013 and April 2014. A total of 24,542 people were asked to rate 16 countries and the European Union on whether their influence in the world was ""mostly positive"" or ""mostly negative."" The results of the BBC poll placed the United States in the middle of the pack, with a slightly larger number of respondents answering ""mostly positive"" than ""mostly negative."" This result ranked the United States behind Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, the European Union and Brazil in positivity, and ahead of China, South Africa, South Korea, India, Russia, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and Iran.  Our ruling Obama said that today, ""the United States is the most respected country on Earth."" International polling by Gallup has found that, in a reversal from the Bush era, the United States now finishes first compared to a limited group of countries -- Germany, China, Russia and the European Union.

"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Andy Craig']","
Ballot laws mean only half of Assembly races are contested, Libertarian says
","When state Assembly seats are on the ballot, Wisconsin voters have far fewer candidates to choose from than residents of neighboring Minnesota and Michigan, a group called Competitive Elections Wisconsin claims. In a May 11, 2015 letter to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), a leader of the group who is also an official with the Libertarian Party of Wisconsin took the claim a step further. ""The problem is simple. For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high,"" Andy Craig wrote in the letter, which was released publicly. ""These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it."" The result, Craig contends, is that nearly half of the candidates elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in November 2014 were alone on the general-election ballot. By contrast, he continued, ""just 9 out of 134 Representatives ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties."" ""It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are,"" Craig wrote. Craig’s letter caught our attention. Wisconsin historically has high voter turnout. Can our legislative races be so uncompetitive -- and is it due to unusually high hurdles to candidacy? The evidence When we asked Craig, a 2014 Libertarian candidate for secretary of state, to back up his claim, he pointed to the Ballotpedia and Ballot Access News websites. The websites include tallies of contested races and state-by-state comparisons of candidacy requirements. Regarding the contention that lower ballot access hurdles result in more candidates and fewer uncontested elections, Craig told us, ""that seems self-evident, primarily in the comparison to other states that make it easier."" He also cited his experiences recruiting and assisting candidate, some of whom missed making the ballot because they couldn't get enough signatures in time. We checked with election experts and compiled our own tallies of contested races from state election websites. Here’s what we found: Michigan and Minnesota did have at least two candidates facing off in the 2014 general elections in virtually all cases cited. And Wisconsin’s Assembly candidates were unopposed in nearly half the races. (It should be noted that in 17 state Senate races, Wisconsin had only two without multiple candidates. But the group’s claim focused on Assembly races, and even when including both senators and representatives there are still far more uncontested races in Wisconsin than in the other two states.) That gap between those states is longstanding, according to research by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. And mirroring a national trend, Wisconsin has seen the number of uncontested Assembly races double since the mid-1970s, Ballotpedia reported. Why is there a gap? Now to the ""why"" part. Craig points out, correctly, that Michigan and Minnesota allow candidates to pay $100 filing fees to secure a ballot spot if they don’t want to collect signatures from residents. Wisconsin does not allow the filing fee option. Elsewhere in the Midwest, two others states with a lot of uncontested 2014 races -- neighboring Illinois and Iowa -- similarly have no option to forgo signature collection. Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said he thinks relatively more difficult ballot access rules explain the differences in those states. ""Asking strangers for signatures is somewhat like hitch-hiking,"" Winger said. ""It is psychologically difficult for most people to ask for favors from strangers."" Winger is a widely quoted expert on ballot access laws and advocates for fairness in allowing minor party candidates on ballots. We heard a more skeptical view from Barry Burden, an expert in election administration at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As parties, the Democrats and Republicans quality for ballot lines pretty easily in all three states, and there is little doubt that any of them would lose their status as major parties, Burden said. He added that it can be harder for minor party candidates to get on ballots. But the claim rests on what individuals have to do to get on ballots. The fee option might attract more candidates, Burden said, because it is low and, since it can be paid at the last moment, requires little organization or planning. But the signature requirements are also low, he said. That requirement is lower in Wisconsin (200 for Assembly candidates) than Minnesota (500) for major party candidates. In Michigan, the rule is 200 for major party candidates and 600 for independents. ""Any candidate who has at least a skeletal organization or a little free time should be able to scoop up a couple hundred signatures without much trouble,"" Burden said. Burden and others suggest that other factors are at play. For the last two election cycles in Wisconsin, the redrawing of legislative district lines has helped to squelch competition, Burden said. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert reported in ""Dividing Lines"", that redistricting and the ultra-polarized geography of southeastern Wisconsin mean that ""there are practically no competitive seats in the most populous part of this competitive swing state."" Burden said party strategy differences can determine whether parties field candidates in ""lost causes"" areas. In Minnesota, Burden noted, public funding of elections there is more likely to enhance competition by luring in candidates who might otherwise believe they would be unable to compete financially. In Michigan, some have suggested that the state’s term limits enhance competition. Burden disagreed, saying that by creating automatic openings every six to eight years, term limits actually reduce competition in other years.

Ann Coulter wrongly claims that U.S. 'has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population'
","Ann Coulter’s new book Adios America argues that immigration is undermining the country, and she was delighted to give a full-throated defense of her stance in an interview with Univision and Fusion TV journalist Jorge Ramos. The two agreed on virtually nothing, including the most basic statistics. Ramos opened the segment of his show America with Jorge Ramos by telling Coulter that her facts on the number of undocumented immigrants were wrong. In her book, she claimed there are 30 million. The consensus figure is about 11 million. Coulter was unfased. ""You’re wrong,"" Coulter told Ramos. ""The number we keep hearing is 11 million, 11 million, 11 million. That’s so weird. It’s been 11 million for a decade. But as I explain in the book, they are all using the Census figures. If the Census figures are wrong, then everybody’s numbers are wrong."" Coulter said there is ""absolutely no question"" that the number is at least 30 million. She said the work of two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and a 2006 analysis by two Bear Stearns financial analysts supported her belief. We’ll touch on those items in a bit. But arguably Coulter’s biggest numerical claim was that ""America has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population."" She said it during her interview with Ramos and included it as a bullet point on her website. Several readers asked us to dig into that claim. We tried to reach Coulter through her publisher and other channels and did not hear back. However, she gives the source of her figure in her new book. Coulter’s math Coulter zeros in on Mexico to undercut the argument that immigration promotes diversity. ""Diversity in immigration ought to mean every country on earth sends the same percentage of immigrants,"" she writes. In contrast, Mexico provides about a third of all immigrants, and that became her target. In a sub-section titled ""Doesn’t Mexico want any Mexicans?"" Coulter grounds her statement about America taking in one-quarter of Mexico’s population on a Pew Research Center analysis of census data. The top line number in that study finds that about 33.5 million people of Mexican origin lived in the United States in 2011. Coulter argues that since Mexico has about 120 million people, and one-quarter of that is 30 million, therefore, America has ""taken in"" one-quarter of the total. Misreading the data In reality, the immigration data from Pew is not nearly as neat and tidy as Coulter concludes. The Pew report attempted to count the number of people who trace their roots back to Mexico, not people who came directly from that country. Why does that make such a difference? Well, about two-thirds of Americans with Mexican ancestry were born in the United States. By definition, they were never part of Mexico’s population. If they weren’t Mexican, they could not be ""taken in."" The Pew definition is important, and if the numbers about Mexico don’t make it clear, let’s look at another country. We picked Ireland. In 2014, the Census Bureau said there were 34.1 million Americans with Irish roots. That’s nearly seven times Ireland’s current population. One could argue that if the parents hadn’t moved to the United States, the children wouldn’t have been born here. But Coulter offers no analysis and no data on that front. In her framework, a person whose family came from Mexico 70 years ago is just as much a Mexican as someone who arrived yesterday. According to the Census Bureau, about 10.5 million people of Mexican heritage come from families in which both parents were born in the United States. This group is at least second-generation American born. The Pew report found that about 11.6 million people of the 33.5 million total had been born in Mexico, including both authorized and unauthorized immigrants. Estimating the undocumented Tangentially related to this fact-check is Coulter’s suggestion that groups are severely undercounting the number of unauthorized illegal immigrants based on census data. Coulter’s starting point is a 2005 article from two Bear Stearns financial advisors. They set census data aside and looked at things like the rise in money sent back to Mexico and housing permits in three New Jersey communities with growing immigrant populations. The article said the increases were much larger than the official rise in population. The authors did not show how they reached their estimate of 20 million illegal immigrants, but they, and Coulter, emphasized that ""the assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of."" The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration much as Coulter does, disagrees with that last point. In a recent report, the center wrote ""It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey."" ""For illegals, we estimate 11 to 12 million with 50 to 60 percent from Mexico,"" said Steven Camarota, the center’s director of research. Jennifer Van Hook, who directs the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University, said she believes the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants living in the United States is 6.3 million-8.3 million. No matter how you slice it, Coulter’s claim doesn’t get any closer to true, she said. ""There is no way it is as high as 30 million,"" Van Hook said. The Migration Policy Institute estimates the total unauthorized population at 11 million. Director of research for American programs Randy Capps said figures produced by the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey are just the starting point in determining that figure (the Census Bureau itself doesn't create a count). The final estimate reflects a hike of ""20 to 25 percent to address the undercount of unauthorized immigrants in the ACS."" Capps emphasized that his group, the Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center and the Center for Immigration Studies generally reach the same results because they all tweak the census data. ""All four of these sources incorporate an undercount of unauthorized immigrants ranging from 10 to 25 percent,"" Capps said. Capp’s counterpart at the Pew Research Center, Jeffrey Passel, rejected Coulter’s claim on both methodological and common sense grounds. ""It is simply not possible for there to be in excess of 30 million Mexican immigrants in the United States,"" Passel said. ""There are not enough houses available in the country for the 20 or so million more additional Mexicans. Moreover, the Mexican censuses, and surveys are completely inconsistent with such figures."" Our ruling Coulter said that America has taken in one-quarter of the entire population of Mexico. Coulter based this on a study that counted all people of Mexican origin in the United States. But Coulter ignored that 65 percent of those were born in America and about a third came from families in which both parents were born in America. Their immigrant status lay at least two-generations in the past, and America couldn’t ""take them in"" because they were already here. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Note: This claim was fact-checked as one of the donor-benefits tied to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

"['National', 'Financial Regulation', ""Martin O'Malley""]","
Had the Goldman Sachs CEO said his picks are Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush?
","A Jeb Bush-Hillary Clinton contest would be a win-win scenario for Wall Street, says former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. In his presidential campaign announcement on May 30, 2015, O’Malley attacked Bush and Clinton for their supposed mutual backer, Goldman Sachs, the poster child of big, bad Wall Street. ""Recently, the CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he’d be just fine with either Bush or Clinton,"" O’Malley said. ""Well, I’ve got news for the bullies of Wall Street: The presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth by you between two royal families."" We were curious about O’Malley’s claim on whether Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein would sign off on both the presumed Republican and Democratic frontrunners, especially in front of the firm's 34,400 employees. Goldman Sachs spokesperson Andrew Williams told us, ""We’ve looked high and low and found no such statement by Mr. Blankfein.""  One side of the aisle is clear: Blankfein has fundraised for Clinton. It’s actually his support for Bush where the evidence in lacking. An O’Malley spokesperson pointed us to an article published in March 2015 in Politico magazine. In it, economic reporter Ben White detailed Blankfein’s close relationship with the Clintons and wrote,""Blankfein has indicated he would be fine with either a Bush or Clinton presidency."" White told us in an email that to his knowledge, Blankfein has never stated this publicly, though he’s suggested it privately, according to anonymous sources close to the CEO. His long-time support for Clinton, however, is out in the open. Blankfein, a self-described Democrat, personally contributed $4,600 to her last presidential campaign (and thousands to past Democratic presidential candidates). He told Politico magazine in 2014, ""I very much was supportive of Hillary Clinton the last go-round,"" he said. ""I held fundraisers for her."" Past comments from the Goldman executive do indicate some political fluidity. In 2013, Blankfein said he likes both Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie, ""people who are moderated and see the other side,"" according to BuzzFeed. That’s the attitude on Wall Street in general, experts say. Goldman and its peers tend to play the middle, said economic historian and former banker Charles Geisst. Centrists like Clinton or Bush would maintain the financial status quo, while candidates like Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, ""people on the fringes, make them nervous,"" said journalist William Cohan, who wrote a book on the firm. And even if Blankfein personally favors Clinton, he and Wall Street are in it to win it. ""It’s about access, access, access...Goldman wants to back the winner. They’re traders who’ll hedge their bets,"" said Cohan. As for Goldman and Wall Street’s opinion of Martin O’Malley? ""I suspect anyone to the right of Elizabeth Warren or Sanders would get the same sort of hedged support,"" said Geisst.    Our ruling O’Malley said, ""The CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he’d be just fine with either Bush or Clinton."" The O’Malley campaign referred us a Politico article that stated a much more ambiguous version of the claim. The article’s author told us CEO Lloyd Blankfein has never stated this publicly, much less to the company's 34,400 employees. Blankfein has thrown his weight and money behind Clinton publicly, but he hasn't done the same for Bush. Overall, we rate O’Malley’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2B400>],/factchecks/2015/jun/02/martin-omalley/had-goldman-sachs-ceo-said-his-picks-are-hillary-c/

Martin O'Malley says it's first time since WWII that 70% of us earn same or less as 12 years ago
","Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore, threw himself into the Democratic presidential contest on May 30, 2015. He begins the race well behind frontrunner Hillary Clinton, but in his announcement speech, he hit some populist notes that sought to separate himself from the political and economic status quo. ""Today in America,"" he said, ""70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II. Today in America, family-owned businesses and farms are struggling to compete with ever larger concentrations of corporate power. … The American dream seems for so many of us to be hanging by a thread."" We wondered whether it was true that ""70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago,"" and if that’s happening for the first time since World War II. When we checked with O’Malley’s staff, they initially pointed to data from the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. The group looked at the increase or decrease for hourly wages by percentile. That is, it grouped all wage earners into 10 equal categories -- the bottom 10 percent of earners, the next 10 percent, and so on. Using that data, it’s possible to calculate the percentage increase or decrease in adjusted wages over a given 12-year period. If you look at the EPI data from 2002 to 2014, then each grouping up to and including the 70th percentile saw its inflation-adjusted income decline. That supports the first part of O’Malley’s claim. The second part of his claim -- that ""this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II"" -- is less clear. EPI sent us data going as far back as 1973, and just using that more limited data period, we found two separate 12-year periods during which the bottom 70 percentile groups all lost ground or saw no change -- from 1973 to 1985, and from 1979 to 1991. So, using the EPI data set at least, it’s not unprecedented since World War II for the bottom 70 percent to see incomes universally flat or declining. The O’Malley campaign also pointed to raw data from the Census Bureau. This data breaks the income spectrum into five categories (rather than 10, as EPI did) and it begins in 1947 and runs through 2013. This data set supports O’Malley’s general point: For only three 12-year periods does the bottom 80 percent of the income scale experience a decline or no change in inflation-adjusted income, and they’re the three most recent periods. Those are 1999 to 2011, 2000 to 2012, and 2001 to 2013. However, this data set does not appear to be the source of O’Malley’s original ""70 percent"" claim, since the Census Bureau didn’t break down the data to the 70th percentile level, only to the 60th or the 80th percentile. One additional note: O’Malley hasn’t described the data in the most accurate way. Saying that ""70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago"" suggests that the data looks at whether specific individuals have seen their wages go up or down. This is known as ""longitudinal data,"" and such data exists (though, due to the complexity of tracking individuals for years on end, it tends to be more limited). Why does this matter? From one year to the next, it’s common for people to jump around from one percentile group to another. The EPI data and the census data miss the income changes these people experience -- the data doesn’t show how specific individuals did over time, but rather how entire percentile groups did from year to year. As a result, we simply don’t know how specific individuals saw their income rise or fall over that period. Maybe this would push O’Malley’s figure higher or lower; the important thing is, we simply don’t know. Our ruling O’Malley said that ""today in America, 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and this is the first time that that has happened this side of World War II."" His overall point is valid -- wages did go down or stay the same for the bottom 70 percent between 2002 and 2014. However, using the same data set that makes this part correct, there are at least two earlier 12-year periods that show the same pattern going back to 1973. This undercuts O’Malley’s claim that this is unprecedented going back to World War II. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AEFB80>],/factchecks/2015/jun/02/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-says-70-us-are-earning-same-or-less/

Marco Rubio says for first time in 35 years, 'we have more businesses dying than we do starting'
","At the economic summit for Republican presidential candidates convened by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., expressed concern about entrepreneurialism in the United States. ""For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting,"" Rubio said at the June 2, 2015, event. Is that correct? We took a closer look. We located a May 2014 report by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, titled, ""Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros."" In that report, coauthors Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway published data that supports Rubio’s claim. Their calculations come from a collection of U.S. Census Bureau data called Business Dynamics Statistics. ""Recent evidence points to a U.S. economy that has steadily become less dynamic over time,"" they wrote. They found that the rate of business failures held steady, except for an uptick during the Great Recession -- but they also found that the entry rate of new firms declined by nearly half between 1978 and 2011. ""The precipitous drop since 2006 is both noteworthy and disturbing,"" the authors wrote. Here’s the kicker from the report: ""Business deaths now exceed business births for the first time in the 30-plus-year history of our data,"" the authors wrote. Here’s a graph showing the trend line: Technically, the crossover point occurred in 2008, so it’s not as if this happened in the past year or two. Still, we checked with Litan to make sure Rubio wasn’t twisting the statistic in any way, and Litan responded that Rubio’s claim is accurate. ""It’s true,"" Litan told PolitiFact, adding, ""We haven’t reversed this yet."" As for the causes, the authors of the Brookings report acknowledged being uncertain themselves. However, the report added, ""it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones."" Our ruling Rubio said that ""for the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than we do starting."" The change didn’t happen in the past year or two -- it occurred in 2008 -- but in general, Rubio has accurately cited a statistic from a respected think tank’s report.

Russell Brand misinforms fans about the U.S. murder rate on 'The Trews'
","In 2014, eccentric British comedian Russell Brand launched an Internet video show called The Trews, short for ""true news."" True news! Something PunditFact can get behind. The show usually features Brand offering his opinion on the topics of the day, often about his native England but also sometimes about the United States. In the 327th episode of The Trews, Brand criticizes Fox News pundit Greg Gutfeld for cheering the death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured scores more. Brand said Gutfeld and other Fox News pundits ignore the prevalence of gun violence in the United States that kills a lot more people, throwing out a slew of statistics to capture his point. ""In a country that has more guns per person than any other country in the world, where the American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation, where women are estimated to be 11 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than women in any other developed country, why does the focus fall on this particular story?"" Brand said. ""Because it’s a story that helps to maintain the order."" Brand’s soliloquy continued after his round of fact-dropping, but the show being called The Trews and all, we were struck by the claim that the U.S. murder rate ""is 50 times that of any other developed nation."" Unfortunately, it’s not Trews. ""Fifty times is ridiculous,"" said James Alan Fox, Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy. ""Fifty times the homicide rate is much too high,"" said David Hemenway, a Harvard School of Public Health professor of health policy who studies gun-homicide rates. ""Maybe it just was hyperbole."" The FBI-estimated homicide rate for the United States in 2013 was 4.6 deaths per 100,000 population. The World Health Organization estimate is a bit higher at 5.4. For our calculations, we’ll use the official and most recent FBI rate of 4.6, though it doesn’t matter either way to debunk Brand’s point. While either estimate is considerably higher than the homicide rate of other Western, high-income countries, it is not remotely as much as Brand suggests. Canada, for example, had a WHO-estimated homicide rate of 1.8 deaths per 100,000 population. So the U.S. rate is a little less than three times higher. The homicide rate in the U.S. was three times higher than the United Kingdom (1.5 per 100,000) and about eight times that of Switzerland (0.6 per 100,000). Compared to Japan (0.9 per 100,000), the U.S. rate is five times higher. We put together a table of of all the developed nations, using the World Bank definition of high-income countries. The reason the United States has such a high homicide rate compared to those countries is tied to the fact that it has more firearms per capita and more permissive gun control laws. A 2003 analysis, while more than a decade old, concluded the U.S. firearm homicide rate was more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. (See a related fact-check.) The findings, published in the Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care, also found that the firearm homicide rate was strikingly larger among American 15-24-year-olds compared to peer countries — 42.7 times bigger, as a matter of fact. That’s closer to the number Brand presented, but it’s not how he presented it. Regardless, experts cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions about murder rates from country to country. Every nation presents a new set of societal differences, and developing countries in particular have various definitions and methods of counting homicides, said Alan Lizotte, University at Albany professor and dean of the School of Criminal Justice. ""It’s not really good to compare countries to each other without considering the culture,"" he said. The turbulent history of the United States partially explains today’s violent American society, he said, from Western settlers’ hostile encounters with the indigenous population to the haphazard move out west and the underlying history of defending oneself and one’s property. The Canadians, by contrast, were more peaceful as they settled their western territories, sending out mounties to look for new land to inhabit and making peace with the native population first, Lizotte said. ""The main point is when you’re comparing countries, you’re comparing things that don’t compare very well,"" he said. Emails to Brand’s representatives were not returned. Our ruling Brand said, ""The American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation."" Yes, the American homicide rate is pretty bad, at least compared to most of its high-income peers. But it’s not even close to being as bad as Brand suggests. For instance, the homicide rate in the United States is just three times higher than that in the United Kingdom. Brand considerably overstated things. We rate his claim False. Update (6:30 p.m. June 2) -- After we published our fact-check, a producer for The Trews said Brand meant to say 15, not 50.

Would Milwaukee's maximum forfeiture for marijuana be lower than for bicycle violations?
","On June 2, 2015, the Milwaukee Common Council is scheduled to decide whether to reduce the maximum city portion of the fine for possession of a sandwich-size bag of marijuana. That portion of the total fine -- known formally as a forfeiture -- would be a maximum of $50, down from the current limit of $500. When the council debated the proposed ordinance change on May 12, 2015, it was opposed by Ald. Robert Puente, who served for 27 years on the Milwaukee police force. ""We have 23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture than this,"" said Puente, before adding: ""I just think this is really disproportionate."" Is that right? If the council approves reducing the maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession, would it be lower than the forfeiture for 23 bicycle violations? Marijuana When you get a ticket, think of the amount shown on the ticket as the fine. The total fine is composed of various parts. Those parts include the forfeiture, the part cited by Puente, which is paid to the city’s general fund. Added to that are various city, county and state fees and surcharges. In Milwaukee, the Common Council sets not only the range of forfeiture amounts for a given violation, but also a standard forfeiture amount that should be imposed in most cases. Those standard forfeiture amounts are reviewed regularly and can be adjusted within the range. Let’s start with marijuana as an example. The city ordinance applies to possession of 25 grams or less of marijuana. Twenty-five grams is slightly less than 1 ounce (0.88), or roughly a sandwich bag full of marijuana. Currently, the minimum forfeiture for marijuana possession is $250 and the maximum is $500. The standard forfeiture amount is $265.87. In other words, the forfeiture amount of the fine you’re given for marijuana possession typically would be $265.87. But the judge in your case could reduce the forfeiture portion to $250 -- or, in rare circumstances, increase the forfeiture. Ald. Nik Kovac has led the effort to reduce the marijuana possession forfeitures. He has said African-Americans in Milwaukee are cited for marijuana possession much more often than other people. And he has argued that the disproportionate jailing of black men is due in part to those who are ticketed for marijuana possession and end up in jail because they can’t pay the forfeiture and fees. Kovac’s initial proposal, in September 2014, was to reduce the forfeiture range dramatically. The minimum would have been $1 and the maximum $5. But his proposed range was later amended to zero to $50 -- which is what the council is being asked to approve. The Milwaukee Municipal Court, in a May 26, 2015 memo signed by the three municipal judges, opposes lowering the $500 maximum. But it suggests reducing the minimum from $250 to zero. That way, the judges would have more flexibility, being able to impose forfeitures anywhere from zero to $500. The memo also made two other points: 1. Since 2012, municipal judges have issued only 12 orders for incarceration for marijuana possession and only eight of those individuals actually served time in jail. 2. Setting a maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession that is lower than that for many other violations ""that are arguably less serious"" would ""send the wrong message to our community."" Bicycles As for the 23 bicycle violations cited by Puente, they include abandonment of a bicycle, failure to comply with a traffic signal and brakes not in good working condition. Nine of the violations carry a maximum forfeiture of $500 -- much higher than the $50 maximum for marijuana, should the marijuana ordinance be changed. But as a practical matter, the standard forfeiture for all 23 bike violations is only $20. Our rating Puente said if Milwaukee approves reducing its maximum forfeiture for marijuana possession to $50, the city would have ""23 different bicycle violations that have a higher forfeiture."" In practice, the actual forfeiture that is imposed for the 23 bicycle violations is only $20. However, the maximum forfeiture for nine of those violations is $500.

George Will: We spend more on lobbying than on campaigns
","The indictment of former House Speaker Dennis Hastert is more striking for what was left out than for the charges themselves. Hastert allegedly paid a man about $1.7 million since 2010. According to press reports, the goal was to hide a sexual encounter that took place decades ago when Hastert was a high school wrestling coach. But the indictment said nothing about a potential act of blackmail. Instead, federal officials charged Hastert with scheming to skirt banking laws and lying to FBI agents about his cash withdrawals. The missing details have spurred a lot of speculation, but conservative pundit George Will stepped back and focused on how Hastert, who never made much money as a teacher or a congressman, could cover the payments. On Fox News Sunday, Will said it was all about Hastert’s post-congressional career as a lobbyist. ""Big government becomes big by being deeply involved in the allocation of wealth and opportunity,"" Will said on May 31, 2015. ""Lobbyists are important. That's why we spend more money on lobbying than we do on campaigns. They become important precisely because they know how complicated the government is, where the levers and pulleys and widgets are, to make it work. And he made the most of that value."" Will pointed no fingers but said this was ""an unfortunate glimpse of how hard government is."" We were intrigued with Will’s comparison of lobbying and campaigns and decided to look into the numbers. We reached out to Will, and while we didn’t hear back, we suspect he based his statement on federal expenditure data. According to government figures on the Center for Responsive Politics website, Will is correct. Spending on lobbyists exceeds all the money that flows during elections. And the political scientists we reached said on top of that, a lot of lobbying never makes it into the official tallies. The numbers In every election cycle since 2008, more money has gone into lobbying at the federal level than into political campaigns. The campaign totals include money tied to candidates, the parties, Super PACs and so-called dark money that largely goes unreported. As this table shows, the pattern holds even in presidential election years. The dollar amounts are in billions. 2-Year Cycle Lobbying  Campaigns 2008 $6.17 $5.286 2010 $7.02 $3.632 2012 $6.64 $6.286 2014 $6.48 $3.769 Source: Center for Responsive Politics: Campaigns - Lobbyists This data only covers federal spending. A lot of money goes into lobbying and elections at the state and local levels, too. But while there are some numbers on campaign activities in the states, there is little reporting on lobbying. So we’re limited to comparing the dollars at the federal level. Hidden lobbying We contacted several political scientists, and they all said that Will is even more correct than the official numbers show. James Thurber is director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. ""The official count of federal level lobbyists is only the tip of the iceberg,"" Thurber said. ""The number of shadow lobbyists is much greater."" Thurber points to people like former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle who offers his services as a strategic adviser and doesn’t show up as a registered lobbyist. But Daschle’s advice can be worth a lot to outfits that do business with the government. Thurber said the focus on lobbying Congress is important, but it misses efforts to shape what happens in the executive branch. ""I say there’s more lobbying going on in the executive branch in terms of procurement and writing regulations,"" Thurber said. Tim LaPira, a political scientist at James Madison University, estimates that the actual amount of lobbying is double the official count. Political scientist Jeffrey Berry at Tufts University said lobbying firms only have to disclose legislative lobbying and even that doesn't necessarily include everything in a firm's contract with a client. Berry said a lot of activity flies beneath the radar. ""What goes on at corporate headquarters to support the Washington lobbying office is generally unreported,"" Berry said. ""For trade associations, what’s reported typically does not include what member firms do on instructions from the staff of the trade group. And the list goes on."" Hastert and lobbying dollars Will noted that Hastert made his real money after he left Congress. While we can’t know Haster’s exact income in his work for the firm of Dickstein Shapiro, he’s listed as a lobbyist on contracts worth many millions of dollars. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2009, Hastert lobbied for three groups with a total contract value of $260,000. By 2013, the total was over $4.5 million. While it dipped the next year, it was still over $1.7 million. Some of the biggest contracts were for the tobacco company Lorillard and the mining company Peabody Energy. Thurber at American University said Hastert didn’t need to have any particular expertise with tobacco or energy. ""He knew the process inside government, and he knew what role particular people played in that process,"" Thurber said. Frank Baumgartner at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said only the highest ranking former members of Congress command top dollar from private interests. ""Either these lobbyists are hoodwinking their clients, or they really are able to open doors that people with lesser experience at the highest levels of Congress cannot open,"" Baumgartner said. Our ruling Will said that more money is spent on lobbying than on campaigns. In terms of the expenditures reported at the federal level, that is correct. In every election cycle since 2008, more money has gone toward lobbying than elections. The experts we reached said the official lobbying numbers fail to capture a lot of activity.

No evidence to support claim that Will Smith, Chris Rock conflict was staged to detract from Ukraine
","On March 27, during a live broadcast of the Academy Awards, actor Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock. While some people have claimed that the moment was staged, others have gone a step further and connected it to global affairs.  ""will smith slapping chris rock was planned as a distraction to take the attention away from ukraine WAKE UP!!!!,"" one tweet said.  But there’s no evidence to support this claim.  Here’s what happened.  Rock said that actors Javier Bardem and his wife Penelope Cruz were both nominated for Oscars, and joked that if she lost, Bardem couldn’t win.  ""He is praying that Will Smith wins, like ‘Please, lord!’"" Rock said. Smith, who was nominated for Best Actor for his role in the movie ""King Richard"" laughed along.  Then Rock turned his attention to Smith’s wife, actress Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia, which causes hair loss.  ""Jada, I love you, ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it,"" he said, apparently referring to Pinkett Smith’s shaved head. (Starring in the 1997 production of ""G.I. Jane,"" actress Demi Moore sported a shaved head.) Smith continued to laugh while Pinkett Smith’s smile faded and she rolled her eyes. Smith then strode on stage and slapped Rock in the face.  ""Wow, wow,"" Rock said, as Smith returned to his seat. ""Will Smith just smacked the s--- out of me."" Smith then shouted angrily at Rock, ""Keep my wife’s name out your f------ mouth!"" ""Wow, dude,"" Rock said. ""It was a G.I. Jane joke.""  ""Keep my wife’s name out your f------ mouth!"" Smith shouted again, louder this time.  Rock appeared uncharacteristically rattled and then proceeded to present the award for Best Documentary.  When Smith later accepted the Oscar for Best Actor, he apologized to the Academy and to his fellow nominees, and through tears, said, ""I am being called on in my life to love people, and to protect people, and to be a river to my people. I know to do what we do you got to be able to take abuse, you got to be able to have people talk crazy about you. In this business you got to have people disrespecting you, and you got to smile and you got to pretend like that’s okay."" He compared himself to Richard Williams, who he portrayed in ""King Richard,"" and said, ""Love’ll make you do crazy things.""  He ended his acceptance speech laughing, and said, ""I hope the Academy invites me back.""  The Los Angeles Police Department told reporters in a statement that it was aware ""of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards"" but that ""the individual involved has declined to file a police report.""  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences initially tweeted that it ""does not condone violence of any form"" and later said it was conducting a formal review of Smith’s conduct.  ""The Academy condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night’s show,"" the Academy said. ""We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law.""  The Los Angeles Times reported that the Academy also called an emergency meeting Monday morning to address the incident.  While what happened between Rock and Smith at the Oscars drew widespread media attention, tweets, hot takes and texts between family and friends at a moment when Ukraine is fighting against a Russian invasion, claims that the incident was staged to detract from an overseas war are unfounded.  We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809782E840>],/factchecks/2022/mar/29/tweets/no-evidence-support-claim-will-smith-chris-rock-co/

No, Democrats aren’t responsible for rising gas prices
","Across the country, gas prices are climbing to record-setting numbers, putting consumers in a bit of a pinch when it comes to their daily commute.  As prices have crept up, politicians have been quick to point fingers.  Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, in a March 18, 2022 tweet about the burden the high prices were placing on truck drivers, blamed the ""astronomical gas prices"" on the ""Democrats’ war on fossil fuels.""  But is that true? Have policies instituted by Democrats in recent years caused gas prices to skyrocket? Or is there another reason?  Let’s take a look. 
  When we reached out to Johnson’s office, aides sent a host of information about the senator’s claim, arguing that President Joe Biden’s policies regarding American oil production and transportation are to blame for the hike in prices.  Alexa Henning, Johnson’s deputy chief of staff for communications, cited suspension of drilling and mining on Bureau of Land Management property, the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline and signing an executive order barring federal funding from being used to subsidize fossil fuels.  So let’s take a look there first: Were gas prices forced upward because of policies like these, enacted by the Biden Administration?  In short, no.  Gas prices have been rising since the initial wave of the coronavirus hit the United States in early 2020. According to a March 9, 2022 piece from PolitiFact National, gas prices were the lowest in May 2020 at $1.87 per gallon, but since then have experienced upward growth.  In January 2021, when Biden was inaugurated, gas prices were already at $2.33 per gallon, ahead of any policies put into place by the new administration. As of March 2022, prices were around $4 a gallon, on average, according to PolitiFact.  Aside from that, the halt of the Keystone XL pipeline, which many Republicans have pointed to as a cause for rising prices, would have likely had a very miniscule impact on the global oil trade, said Gregory Nemet, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs.  ""There are 95 million (barrels) per day of global oil production, and only 0.5 million barrels per day from the Keystone XL so it would have a very small effect, when it would come online,"" Nemet said in an email.  What’s more, the action did not shut down any existing supply. The Keystone XL was not projected to be finished until the first quarter of 2023.  RELATED VIDEO But there have been other factors as well. One of the biggest: The coronavirus pandemic. According to a March 9, 2022 report from the New York Times, gas prices have risen largely in response to the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the disruptions it caused to global supply and demand.  The report notes that during the early months of the pandemic, when people were largely confined to their homes in hopes of limiting the spread of the virus, gas prices plummeted. There was more gasoline available than consumers looking to buy it. So producers of gasoline started decreasing output.  As those restrictions have loosened and life has returned to normal, demand for gas has gone up, the report said, with demand now outpacing the limited supply of gas.  Supply and demand are largely out of Biden’s control, but the administration hasn’t exactly been sending positive signals to the oil and gas industry by pushing for reduced emissions and other forms of cleaner energy, the Times report noted.  But, as the Times article said, that stance has played only a ""very, very small role in pushing gas prices up.""  Another factor linked to rising gas prices: The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the economy-choking sanctions placed upon Russia by the United States and other countries. According to the PolitiFact National report, Russian oil accounts for about 4% of America’s supply. Europe is far more reliant on Russia’s oil, and has far less ability to compensate to make up for the lack of oil it’s getting, forcing gas prices up.  ""In a global market, those price pressures will be felt in the U.S.,"" the PolitiFact report said. ""If American producers can get a higher price on the global market, that’s where some of their production will go, raising prices back at home.""  In short, there are a lot of factors that influence the rising cost of oil and gasoline in the United States and abroad, but policies put into place by Democrats and the Biden Administration likely aren’t the root cause.  ""The bottom line is that these two global forces: economic recovery and disruption from Russia are what has made gasoline prices rise,"" Nemet said. ""U.S. oil production has doubled the past 15 years and yet we still have these high prices. This to me is evidence that expanding supply in the U.S. can only have modest impacts for U.S. gasoline consumers."" Johnson claimed that the ""astronomical gas prices"" are ""due to the Democrats’ war on fossil fuels."" He noted, among other things, halting subsidies for oil companies, ending fossil fuel company drilling on public lands and ending the Keystone XL pipeline.  Experts say those things could have had a small impact, but it’s more likely that the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the supply and demand for oil, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent  sanctions are having a much larger impact.  We rate this claim Mostly False, meaning the statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AE2300>],/factchecks/2022/mar/29/ron-johnson/no-democrats-arent-responsible-rising-gas-prices/

Claim that the UN told staff not to use ‘war,’ ‘invasion’ to describe Ukraine conflict needs context

""The United Nations has sent out an email instructing U.N. staff not to use the words ‘invasion’ or ‘war,’ when describing the big red flashes that are causing buildings to fall down with dead people inside them…"" one March 17 Facebook post said.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The online claims started after The Irish Times newspaper on March 8 reported that the U.N. had banned its staff from using ""war"" or ""invasion"" when referring to Ukraine. The publication soon revised its story, removing the word ""ban"" from its headline and first paragraph and instead wrote that the organization in an email had instead ""advised"" its staff to avoid the words.  The U.N. confirmed to PolitiFact that the email cited is legitimate, but social media posts that claim the message represents official instructions need more context. A regional U.N. office did send out an email to staff members on March 7 instructing them to refrain from using ""invasion"" or ""war"" when describing Russia’s attack, but U.N. representatives later said the message went to a small number of people and doesn’t represent the organization’s official policy. They also pointed out instances of various U.N. leaders using the words on social media after the email was sent.  On March 8, Naomi O’Leary, the reporter of the Irish Times story, shared screenshots of the email on Twitter. UN staff were instructed not to use ""war"" or ""invasion"" and to use ""conflict"" or ""military offensive"" instead, according to an internal email seen by the Irish Times.It comes as the Kremlin cracks down on the use of the same words within Russia https://t.co/o3tseMf6Mh pic.twitter.com/rylBseiKo8 The message, sent by an official with the U.N. Regional Information Center for Western Europe, gives staff ""specific examples of language to use/not use at the moment,"" including choosing ""conflict"" and ""military offensive"" over ""war"" and ""invasion."" It also recommended that staff not add the Ukrainian flag to any official or personal social media accounts.  A follow-up email sent a day later, which O’Leary also shared on Twitter, suggests that the instructions were reversed to allow use of the words. ""Sharing today’s updated Ukraine messaging from the U.N. system. Please note the change from guidance sent by [the] U.N. system just yesterday (below) concerning key messaging language re: ‘conflict’ and/or ‘military offensive’ as today’s approved key messages now refer to ‘war’ and/or ‘invasion,’"" the email says.  Shortly after the Irish Times story was published, Melissa Fleming, the U.N.’s under-secretary general for global communications, tweeted that no ""official communication has gone out to global staff to refrain from using certain words."" Fleming, as well as the official U.N. spokesperson account, pointed to a March 7 tweet by Rosemary DiCarlo, the organization’s under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, in which she used both ""invasion"" and ""war."" Nearly two weeks on, it is painfully clear that those suffering the most after Russia's invasion of #Ukraine are civilians - killed, wounded, displaced. This war is senseless. We are ready to support all good-faith efforts at negotiation to end the bloodshed. In a subsequent tweet, Fleming wrote that the email was sent by a ""local office"" without clearance and ""does not represent the official position of the organization."" O’Leary, the Irish Times reporter, obtained an earlier email from Feb. 25, one day after Russia launched its attack. This time it was from New York’s United Nations Development Programme. It said that U.N. Secretary General António Guterres had decided to use the phrase ""military operations"" in lieu of ""invasion"" or ""incursion.""  Guterres’ preference does not extend to the word ""war,"" which he has used several times to refer to the conflict in Ukraine. Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for Guterres, told PolitiFact that it was a ""mistaken impression"" that U.N. staff were told to avoid using certain words to describe the situation in Ukraine. He also pointed to DiCarlo’s tweet and others as evidence of top U.N. officials using the words.  ""It is simply not the case that there was some sort of global instruction to all U.N. staff not to use words like ‘war’ or ‘invasion’ to describe the situation,"" Dujarric said. He said that the March 7 email went out to about 25 people and he reiterated that it was ""not an official edict"" to staff around the world.  A Facebook post claims that the U.N. sent an email instructing staff not to use the words ""invasion"" or ""war"" when referring to Ukraine. The email is real and instructed some U.N. staff members not to use the terms. But it came from a regional U.N. office and officials say that it did not reflect the organization’s official policy.

A GOP Senate candidate’s muddled claim about windmills and greenhouse gas emissions
","Eli Bremer is one of seven Colorado Republicans vying to be the party’s nominee to face Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in the midterm elections. Bremer, a former  pentathlon Olympian, criticized Democrats’ emphasis on renewable energy, saying that it isn’t as green as Democrats make it out to be. ""If you look at windmills, there’s a lot of greenhouse gas emission cost that we gloss over,"" Bremer said in a Fox News interview March 23. ""We extract the raw materials from the ground, process them, assemble them, maintain them for the lifespan of the windmill, then we decommission them. Virtually every expert that I’ve talked to believes that the overall return is negative."" Is it true that in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the lifetime return on wind turbines is negative? We reached out to Bremer’s campaign to see what experts he relied on, and we didn’t hear back. But what he said runs counter to every major study of this issue.  While Bremer was singling out windmills, the fact is that no matter what the fuel — natural gas, wind, solar, coal, etc. — you have to build whatever it is you’re going to use to generate electricity.  ""Industrial infrastructure requires energy inputs and in that way, windmills or power plants, or for that matter, football stadiums, are the same,"" said Carey King, assistant director at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. The energy used in construction emits greenhouse gases. Once you’ve emitted those greenhouse gases, you can’t undo them. But that doesn’t mean all sources of electricity are equal. The key question, King said, is how does wind compare to other ways of making power? Unlike a plant powered by natural gas or coal, where you have to burn fuel and release more greenhouse gases every day to make electricity, a wind turbine requires a tiny amount of energy once it’s up. The longer it stays in service, the lower its lifetime carbon footprint per kilowatt hour, because the initial greenhouse gas emissions tied to construction (and end-of-life decommissioning) get spread out over more years and electrical output. There are two ways to look at the emissions of windmills, and we’ll consider both. There’s the energy payback time and lifetime carbon footprint. For decades, researchers have been assessing how long a windmill must generate power before it creates more energy than it took to build it. This work folds in all the steps that go into turning wind into electricity. Study after study has found that when all is said and done, a properly placed turbine nets out positive fairly quickly. A 2016 study from Danish engineers looked at onshore and offshore turbines and found that the ""energy payback time"" for all technologies was less than one year. A group of engineers in Texas did similar work and reported in 2016 that ""the payback times for CO2 and energy consumption range from 6 to 14 and 6 to 17 months,"" with on-shore facilities having a shorter payback. The longest payback period we found came from a 2019 study from engineers at the University of Texas at Arlington who factored in the wind speeds from a working wind farm in Texas with 200 turbines. By their calculations, a turbine at that wind farm that lasts 20 years will reach a full energy payback in less than six years. They examined in detail the energy it took to move the turbine components from where they were made in Spain to the Lone Star Wind Farm near Abilene, Texas. They also measured the energy it took to get raw materials to the factories in Spain where manufacturing took place. The wind at the Lone Star Wind Farm varies and the researchers used that data to find the actual average wind speed through the year.  Across all studies that compare the energy that goes into the wind power system to the energy it produces, whether it takes one year or six, a wind turbine lands in positive territory. There’s not an exact mapping of energy inputs to greenhouse gas emissions. But ""a faster energy payback period should translate into a lower carbon emissions per kilowatt hour,"" said King with the Energy Institute. Another way to compare different sources of electricity is to look at how much carbon dioxide, and its equivalents, it takes to produce a certain amount of power — often measured in kilowatt hours. In 2021, natural gas and coal produced about two-thirds of America’s electricity. Wind accounted for about 9%, hydropower for about 6% and solar about 3%.   In 2021, a team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reviewed the findings from about 350 studies of the carbon footprints of all major energy sources. The higher the grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per kilowatt hour, the greater the carbon footprint.  Here’s what they found in terms of median grams of CO2 equivalents per kilowatt hour:  Wind: 13  Nuclear: 13 Hydropower: 21 Solar: 43 Natural gas: 486 Coal: 1,001   The high numbers for fossil fuels stem from the ongoing need to burn fuel to make power. A windmill emits about one fourtieth as much greenhouse gases as a natural gas-fired power plant. Bremer said once you factor in the emissions that come from building and putting up a windmill, you end up with a net negative. This is not correct, based on the most comprehensive assessments that compare the carbon footprint of all sources of electricity across their lifetimes. Wind power comes out far ahead of fossil fuels like natural gas and coal, because it doesn’t require the constant release of greenhouse gases to produce electricity.  It takes between one to six years for a wind turbine to produce more power than is used to build, install, maintain and retire it. In terms of carbon footprint, a wind turbine produces about 40 times less greenhouse gases than a natural gas-fired plant. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809789DA40>],/factchecks/2022/mar/28/eli-bremer/gop-senate-candidates-muddled-claim-about-windmill/

She was considered a potential contender to replace the first woman on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O’Connor, when O’Connor retired in 2006.  Biden, then a U.S. senator, said on a July 3, 2005, episode of ""Face the Nation"" that if Bush nominated Brown, ""I can assure you that would be a very, very, very difficult fight and she probably would be filibustered.""  But that moment never came to pass because then-President George W. Bush initially nominated Judge John Roberts to succeed O’Connor. Following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Bush said he wanted Roberts to be confirmed as Rehnquist’s replacement instead. Bush then nominated White House counsel Harriet Miers for O’Connor’s spot, but after Miers requested that the president withdraw her nomination amid criticism that she was unqualified to serve on the highest court, Bush nominated Judge Samuel Alito, who was confirmed in 2006.  A few years earlier, on July 25, 2003, Bush nominated Brown, then an associate justice on the California Supreme Court, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  At the time, Republicans held a 51-48 majority in the Senate but they struggled to get the 60 votes needed to end debate and vote on judicial nominees.  Democrats were filibustering several of Bush’s nominees to prevent them from joining a federal bench, and in November 2003, Democrats signaled they would do the same to Brown, reported the Chicago Tribune, which called the judicial filibusters ""unprecedented in Senate history.""  Biden was among the 43 senators to vote against ending debate on Brown’s nomination, and that filibuster ultimately lasted for two years until a group of senators reached a bipartisan agreement that cleared the way for her confirmation. Biden again voted against ending debate on the nomination but the motion passed, and Brown was confirmed on June 8, 2005, with a vote of 56-43. Biden also voted against her nomination.  A Facebook post says ""Republicans nominated the 1st Black woman to the SCOTUS & she was BLOCKED and filibustered by Joe Biden."" The post gives the misleading impression that Biden filibustered Brown’s Supreme Court nomination, and that’s wrong. Brown was never nominated to the Supreme Court. She was considered enough of a candidate that Biden said she would probably be filibustered if Bush did tap her for the court. Biden was also among Senate Democrats who filibustered Brown’s nomination to a federal appeals court. But there was no Supreme Court nomination to filibuster.

No, these trees don’t prove White House tweeted an old photo of Joe Biden
","On the morning of March 23, President Joe Biden’s verified Twitter account tweeted an image of him saluting as he boarded a helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House, which looms behind him, flanked by green bushy trees and a scrum of reporters photographing him.  ""I’m on my way to Europe to rally the international community in support of Ukraine and ensure Putin pays a severe economic cost for his war of choice,"" Biden tweeted from @POTUS. But some social media users have alleged that the photo is old, pointing to the trees as evidence.
""This picture, tweeted by the White House yesterday, was clearly not taken yesterday,"" one image being shared on Instagram says.

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The evidence for this claim, according to other social media posts, is that other trees at the White House don’t have leaves on their branches.  Biden was boarding the helicopter on the south side, where southern magnolia trees abut the White House. According to Yale University, the tree is relatively hardy, growing in cold climates like Washington, and ""because it can maintain its beautiful leaves year round, it is often planted as an ornamental flowering tree.""  Photos of Biden before he left for Europe that day that were taken by news organizations including Getty and Reuters show the trees full of leaves.

Fact-checking false claim about Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record on immigration
","During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, Republican senators excoriated her as weak on law enforcement, sometimes by making misleading statements about her sentencing of child pornography offenders and the release of jail inmates. None of the senators accused Jackson of wanting to defund the police or to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But that was the attack made by Mick McGuire, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Arizona. In an ad posted on Facebook and Instagram on March 24, the final day of the hearings, McGuire shared excerpts of an interview he did two days earlier on Fox Business. McGuire claimed that Jackson has ""a weak record — defund police, abolish ICE and now a completely open border policy.""  That line of attack is one that we’ve fact-checked several times, usually deployed by Republican candidates for public office against their Democratic contenders.  McGuire, the former head of the Arizona National Guard also called Jackson part of the ""radical left,"" a common theme in campaign ads on social media and among Republicans.  We found no evidence that Jackson has a record on defunding the police, abolishing ICE or supporting a completely open border — positions that undoubtedly would have drawn sharp criticism during the hearings. McGuire’s campaign did not respond by our deadline to our requests for evidence for the claim. After we published this fact-check, a campaign spokesperson said McGuire was ""referencing the movement of the Left, not a specific reference to Ms. Brown Jackson."" That contradicts McGuire’s own comments, which were directly about Jackson. Calls to ""defund the police"" emerged following the 2020 murder by a white Minneapolis police officer of George Floyd, a Black man. Some activists called for eliminating police departments entirely, while others wanted to reexamine the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding to other services. Jackson has several family members, including a brother, who have served as police officers. The International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police have endorsed her nomination. Jackson has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 2021, having been nominated to that court by President Joe Biden, who also nominated her to the Supreme Court. Before that, she was a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013. She also worked as a federal public defender, and would be the first Supreme Court justice to do so. There is no mention of defunding police in a 78-page review of Jackson’s record by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The Republican National Committee made no mention of police in its news release entitled, ""Biden’s Pick Is A Radical, Left-Wing Activist Who Will Rubberstamp His Failed Agenda."" And we found no other statements by the committee related to McGuire’s claim.  After searching on Google and Nexis, a research database, we found no statements by Jackson showing support for defunding the police. Jackson has written three legal opinions considering challenges to the Department of Homeland Security’s expedited removal of immigrants illegally in the United States. In two of them, she ruled in favor of the challenges, according to the Congressional Research Service report. ICE is part of the department. But that ""sample size is too small to support firm predictions about how she might approach immigration law matters more generally,"" the report said. In any case, those rulings were on a specific immigration policy. We found no statements by Jackson indicating she wanted ICE abolished, or open borders. It’s unclear what’s McGuire’s interpretation of ""open border."" Some regard the term as no enforcement of immigration laws at U.S. borders, others apply it to lax immigration policies. We’ve done several fact-checks debunking claims that Democrats want to abolish ICE or eliminate border enforcement. The Senate Judiciary Committee, divided 11-11 between Democrats and Republicans, is expected to vote on Jackson’s nomination on April 4. A final vote would then come from the full Senate, which is divided 50-50, but Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, could break a tie vote. McGuire is running in the Aug. 2 primary against several other major Republican candidates: Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Blake Masters, businessman Jim Lamon and Justin Olson, a member of the state utility commission. The winner will take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. He won the seat in a 2020 special election that was held to replace the late John McCain, a Republican.  The 2022 race is rated by campaign watchers as a toss-up and as ""battleground Democratic."" It’s one of the Nov. 8 contests that could determine which party controls the Senate. McGuire said Jackson has ""a weak record — defund police, abolish ICE and now a completely open border policy.""  There is no evidence that Jackson has stated support for any of those measures. The baseless statement is false and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire! PolitiFact staff researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

Viral tweet distorts Ketanji Brown Jackson’s answer on report about child porn sentencing
","Some Republican senators lobbed misleading attacks on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings, accusing the nominee of going easy on child pornography offenders throughout her career.  During the second day of the hearings on March 22, right-wing commentators furthered those attacks by sharing a shortened, out-of-context clip of Jackson speaking. The clip, they falsely claimed, showed Jackson defending her record and advocating for light sentences for child pornography offenders who view the content online. ""Jackson says she gave pedophiles lighter sentences bc its different when they use computers vs mail to get volumes of child porn,"" said Jack Posobiec, a former One America News Network personality now affiliated with Turning Point USA, in a March 22 tweet. ""This makes ‘total sense’ according to Jackson.""  The tweet was shared more than 2,000 times, including by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who also posted screenshots of it on Facebook and Instagram.  Other commentators also shared the text and video from the tweet, and right-wing websites like LifeNews.com published entire articles with dubious headlines such as, ""Ketanji Brown Jackson Defends Light Sentences for Child Pornographers, Not as Bad if They Just Use a Computer."" The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But Posobiec’s viral tweet omitted context about what she said and changed her words. Jackson was summarizing a 2012 report concerning federal sentencing guidelines for child pornography, the Associated Press reported. She was not arguing that child pornography isn’t as bad if it’s viewed online, or saying she gives offenders who use the internet lighter sentences. The 2012 report, she explained, discussed how the amount of child pornography a defendant accesses is not as indicative of the seriousness of the offense as it used to be; the internet has made such content more widely available. The guidelines ""made total sense before, when we didn’t have the internet,"" she said, but now they were outdated. Jackson was formerly the vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the independent and bipartisan agency created by Congress to create sentencing guidelines aimed at helping judges hand down sentences that are proportional to the crime committed and the circumstances of it.  The 2012 report by the commission found that the sentences in two-thirds of child pornography cases in 2011 that did not involve production came in below the sentencing guidelines. It also said that the existing sentencing scheme ""no longer adequately distinguishes among offenders based on their degrees of culpability"" in the age of the internet.  Several sentencing ""enhancements"" that trigger harsher punishments based, for example, on the use of a computer or the volume of images possessed, ""now apply to most offenders and, thus, fail to differentiate among offenders in terms of their culpability,"" the report said. ""These enhancements originally were promulgated in an earlier technological era, when such factors better served to distinguish among offenders. Indeed, most of the enhancements … were promulgated when the typical offender obtained child pornography in printed form in the mail."" During the March 22 hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., brought up that report and Jackson’s work as the vice chair of the sentencing commission. He asked: ""What we are dealing with here is an issue, which even this committee and members of this committee have not loathed to address again: the original law was written at least nine or 10, maybe longer, years ago, and the quantity of material was relevant to the sentencing. But now that we have computer access to voluminous amounts of material, it has raised the question, has it not, within the judiciary as to the appropriate sentencing in today’s circumstances. This was a question that was raised before the sentencing commission, was it not?"" The video shared by Posobiec and others left out Durbin’s question, along with the opening portion of Jackson’s response. Here’s how Jackson answered in full: ""It was, senator. The Sentencing Commission has written at least one report — it did when I was there — looking at the operation of this guideline. As you said, the guideline was based originally on a statutory scheme and on directives, specific directives by Congress at a time in which more serious child pornography offenders were identified based on the volume, based on the number of photographs that they received in the mail. That made total sense before, when we didn’t have the internet, when we didn’t have distribution. But the way that the guideline is now structured, based on that set of circumstances, is leading to extreme disparities in the system because it’s so easy for people to get volumes of this kind of material now, by computers. So it’s not doing the work of differentiating who is a more serious offender in the way that it used to. So the commission has taken that into account, and perhaps even more importantly, courts are adjusting their sentences in order to account for the changed circumstances. But it says nothing about the court’s view of the seriousness of this offense.""  Posobiec said, ""Jackson says she gave pedophiles lighter sentences bc it’s different when they use computers vs mail to get volumes of child porn. This makes ‘total sense’ according to Jackson.""  Jackson did not say this.  The full context of the clip presented in Posobiec’s tweet shows that Jackson was discussing the findings of a 2012 report from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, not explaining her own rulings or defending child pornography offenders who commit their crimes via the internet. The report detailed how the federal sentencing guidelines had fallen behind the times as the internet changed the way most child pornography offenders were accessing the content.

Lars Larson leaves out context on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s article on sex offender registries
","Critics of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson have portrayed her as too lenient on sex offenders, drawing in part of a law review article she wrote decades ago as a student. ""All 50 states have sex offender registries but Judge Jackson doesn’t think perverts should have to register. She says it ‘stigmatizes’ THEM,"" Lars Larson, a conservative radio host, said in a Facebook post on March 21.  President Joe Biden nominated Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court, to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. Jackson currently serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Larson directed us to a tweet by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who wrote that ""as far back as her time in law school, Jackson has questioned making convicts register as sex offenders."" The Facebook post by Larson went further than Hawley’s remarks.  While Hawley said Jackson ""questioned"" making offenders register, Larson said Jackson ""doesn’t think perverts should have to register."" And Larson did not provide any indication that Jackson made the comment about sex offender registries decades ago. The claim stems from an 18-page article Jackson wrote for the Harvard Law review in 1996. Though the article is unsigned, Jackson listed the work as being among her published writings in response to a previous questionnaire for judicial nominees.  During her Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, referenced the article and said Jackson argued that ""civil commitment for sexual predators is unconstitutional."" Civil commitment laws enable states to retain custody of individuals convicted of a sex crime and who are deemed likely to re-offend.  Jackson pushed back against that characterization. ""Senator, my note wasn't advocating for the striking down of those laws,"" Jackson said during the March 22 hearing. ""My note was trying to identify criteria that I thought could be applied consistently to determine whether the laws were punitive or preventative."" When Jackson’s article published, sex offender registration and notification systems were still a relatively new construct. The practice was largely adopted throughout the U.S. between 1984 and 1996, with each system varying by state. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, enacted by Congress in 1994, served to establish a baseline standard for existing state programs and to encourage remaining states to implement registries. States had three years to do so or face a reduction of federal funding. Jackson’s Harvard Law article examined whether directing released sex offenders to register with local law enforcement (and other measures, like DNA testing and community notifications) would serve as punishment or as a measure to prevent more crimes. Her primary argument rested on the intent of the registry. If the sole objective of such requirements were to ""make an example"" out of the offender, Jackson argued that it would be punitive and therefore in violation of the Constitution.  ""In 1996, while most challenges to the registries had been rejected, it was still not settled whether registries were legal in the first place,"" Melissa Hamilton, professor of law and criminal justice at the University of Surrey in England, told PolitiFact. The excerpt that inspired Hawley’s tweet derived from a section of Jackson’s article titled, ""The Critics."" Jackson at the time noted that opponents of sex offender registries argue that ""community notification subjects ex-convicts to stigmatization and ostracism, and puts them at the mercy of a public that is outraged by sex crimes."" Jackson did not directly come out against the registries, but suggested that courts establish a framework to evaluate such requirements. Jackson wrote: ""In the current climate of fear, hatred, and revenge associated with the release of convicted sex criminals, courts must be especially attentive to legislative enactments that ‘use public health and safety rhetoric to justify procedures that are, in essence, punishment and detention.’"" Hamilton told PolitiFact that it was not unusual for people to question the constitutionality of the registries and that such discussion does not necessarily indicate a relaxed attitude toward the offender. Debate on the issues Jackson raised in 1996 is ongoing. ""Arguing against registries is not akin to being an apologist for sexual offenders,"" Hamilton said. ""It can be a pragmatic argument that other laws, policies, and cultural changes are needed to better protect children."" Larson said Jackson ""doesn’t think perverts should have to register (as sex offenders). She says it ‘stigmatizes’ THEM."" This is misleading. Larson’s claim is based on an article Jackson wrote decades ago  — in 1996 as a law student. He did not provide recent evidence of Jackson’s stance on this issue. Larson also conflated Jackson’s questioning of the legality and intent of sex offender registries with a relaxed attitude toward sex offenders. Jackson did not explicitly advocate against them, rather questioned whether they were punitive and therefore in violation of the Constitution. In her article, she mentioned that opponents of sex offender registries argue that ""community notification subjects ex-convicts to stigmatization."" Larson’s claim contains an element of truth but is missing important details and ultimately takes Jackson’s article out of context.
