George Allen calls health care law a government takeover
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen has been a relentless critic of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, calling it ""a government takeover of health care.""

He used that phrase in a radio commercial that ran just before his victory in the June 12 Republican Primary, during a June 15 speech in Washington to the Faith and Freedom Coalition and in a June 16 speech at the GOP state convention in Richmond. In each instance, he criticized his Democratic opponent, Tim Kaine, for supporting the health care law and being an ally of the president.

The Weekly Standard, in a June 25 article, wrote that Allen’s stump speech ""always includes a dig at Obamacare -- which Allen describes as a ’government takeover of health care.’""   

We asked Allen’s campaign for the rationale behind the candidate’s ""takeover"" claim but did not receive an explanation.

But the refrain has been used by Republicans and debunked by fact-checkers. Since Allen is using the claim regularly, we decided to review it again.

There’s no question the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act expands government regulation of health care. The law mandates that most Americans have health care insurance or pay a tax penalty. The U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld that provision on June 28 in a 5-4 opinion. 
The law prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage based on a person’s pre-existing health conditions and from imposing lifetime caps on an individual’s benefits. It increases eligibility for Medicaid, although the high court struck down the federal government’s ability to withhold funds from states that refuse to take part in the expansion. The act provides credits for people who can’t afford to purchase insurance.

But the law does not create a ""government takeover"" of health care. Here’s why:

*The government will not seize control of hospitals and other privately-run health care businesses. Doctors will not become government employees, as they are in Britain.

*The law continues to rely on the private sector to provide health insurance for consumers. In fact, its coverage mandate will expand the number of people who buy private insurance policies. The act sets up exchanges where private companies will compete to insure people who don’t have policies.  

*Employer-based coverage through private insurance companies will continue.

*The law does not contain a ""public option"" allowing the government to compete for business with private insurers.

*It does not create a single-payer system, like in Canada, where medical payments are funded by a single insurance pool controlled by the government.

PolitiFact has ruled past claims that the law is a government takeover as either False or Pants on Fire. In 2010, PolitiFact’s national team named the takeover claim the ""Lie of the Year,"" saying it conjured images of socialized medical care.

The Associated Press has also said the law ""does not add up to a government takeover."" The Washington Post Fact Checker column said the ""government takeover"" label is ""simply not true."" And FactCheck.org has said that the law will not lead to ""government-run"" health care.

Drew Altman, president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation, came to the same conclusion in an August 2011 column entitled ""Are we headed for a government takeover of Health Care?""

Altman wrote that actuarial figures released that month from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services show that the state and federal government share of health care spending was 45 percent in 2010 -- the year the law was signed. By 2020, that is expected to rise to 49 percent.

""In other words, government’s share of national health spending, while unquestionably large, is not growing much at all, and even in 10 years it will be less than half of our country’s total health spending,"" Altman wrote. ""Measured by the government’s share of health care spending, there is no sign of a government takeover of the health care system.""

The report, Altman said, demonstrated the nation’s health care system has been and will remain ""a mixed public-private one.""

Our ruling

Allen says that the health care reform law is a ""government takeover of health care.""

Yes, the law increases regulation. But it greatly relies on the private sector to provide health care. Hospitals will not be taken over by the government, doctors will not become federal employees. The act relies on private insurers to compete and provide health care coverage to an expanded customer base. Employer-based coverage through private companies continues.

The ""government takeover of health care"" is a potent political charge that does not hold up under examination.

"['Environment', 'Rhode Island', 'State Budget', 'Water', 'Taxes', 'Helio Melo']","
R.I. State Rep. Helio Melo says washing a car at home uses 80 percent more water than a car wash would use
","
In the closing hours of the state budget debate last month, as talk on the House floor turned to a new sales tax on select businesses, Rep. Helio Melo, D-East Providence, suggested a reprieve for one targeted retail group.

Melo, chairman of the House Finance Committee, advocated exempting the state’s car washes from the 7-percent sales tax increase.

With car wash supporters in the gallery holding signs reading ""Save Our Jobs,"" Rep. Karen L. MacBeth, D-Cumberland, wanted to know: ""Why car washes? Why not taxis and charter buses?"" which were also subject to the tax increase.

Melo replied: ""We noticed there was an environmental impact to it that was brought to us by environmentalists. People who wash cars at home will use approximately 80 percent more water than they do in a car wash.""

Ultimately, the car washes won out and were saved from the tax. The taxi and charter bus businesses weren’t so lucky.

But we were left wondering: Eighty percent more water used for a driveway wash?  Was there a shortage of hose nozzles and two-gallon buckets out there? The statement cried out for a PolitiFact scrubbing.

In a phone interview, Melo said the information supporting his statement came from literature he received from the carwash industry, as well as earlier testimony before the House Finance Committee by car wash owners.

Daniel E. Paisner, former president of the New England Carwash Association and owner of a ScrubaDub car wash in Warwick, spoke passionately at that March 7, 2012, hearing. In a video Paisner is seen and heard saying that the sales tax increase would ""create an environmental concern"" if it kept customers away.

Car washes ""are water conservationists,"" Paisner said. ""At the professional car wash, we recycle water. We’re very, very careful with it. We use about 28 or 30 gallons a car. When you wash your car in the driveway, you can use as much as 140 gallons."" (If you accept Paisner’s statement that would mean homeowners use 400 percent more water than a professional car wash.)

Further, said Paisner, car washes trap the oil, chemicals and grime that comes off a car, whereas those pollutants drain into storm drains during driveway washes and sometimes flow directly into nearby watersheds.

While most research on water use at car washes comes from the industry, regional offices of the federal Environmental Protection Agency have in the last decade honored carwash associations for efforts to curb pollution and conserve water.

David A. Nickerson, spokesman for the Providence Water Supply Board, says professional car washes do prevent pollutants from entering waterways and, ""It’s generally assumed more water can be saved at a carwash than by doing it yourself.""

But the numbers of just how much water is used during a home care wash versus a professional job seem, well, fluid.

Nickerson says he’s seen industry figures showing a car wash uses between 37 and 40 gallons of water per car, whereas the homeowner will use between 80 and 100 gallons in the driveway. In that scenario, the car wash uses 50 to 60 percent less water.

That’s about what the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection says on its website:  ""the average driveway car wash uses a total of 116  gallons of water! Most commercial car washes use 60 percent less water...""  Apparently, the Massachusetts DEP is using industry numbers as its source; its website refers readers to the New England Carwash Association for more information.

The website for the ScrubaDub Auto Wash Centers, a chain of New England car washes, boasts that  professional car washes use ""about 25 gallons"" while a driveway wash can use between 60 and 120 gallons. That’s as much as a 400 percent difference.

Here at PolitiFact we’re not afraid of using a little elbow grease in search of the truth. And so, rather than rely on the varying findings of published reports, we turned to a dirty midsize pickup in need of its annual bath.

First, we filled a bucket with two gallons of water and marked the waterline. Two gallons, plus detergent, seemed more than enough to wash the truck. (Following the father-knows-best principle, we would wash the truck in sections, working top to bottom.)

Then we took our hose, set the nozzle on soak and measured how long it took to wet and rinse each section of the truck after each soaping. Total time: 153 seconds (including hubcaps). We took our time, but we didn’t go out of our way to waste water either.

Finally we timed how long it took to fill the bucket to the two-gallon mark, making sure to use the same nozzle setting to match the water flow used during the washing. It took 34 seconds.
That's 17 seconds per gallon.

Dividing 153 seconds by 17 seconds per gallon revealed that we had used 9 gallons of water to wet and rinse the truck. Add the original two gallons in the bucket to soap the pickup, and you have a Dakota Sport that has come clean using just 11 gallons of water.

Even if we had taken twice as long to wet and rinse (and used 18 gallons), that's a total of 20 gallons used -- nowhere near the 60 gallons, 80 gallons, 116 gallons, or 140 gallons, that car wash industry representatives claim people can use washing their cars at home.

In other words we used half the amount of water a professional car wash might use  -- not almost twice as much, as Melo claimed.

Our ruling

This is a claim that's easy to check with a stopwatch, a bucket of suds, a hose, and that all-important spray nozzle most people use.

Professional car washes do provide an environmental service by keeping pollutants out of watersheds. But Melo’s comparison between the water used during a driveway wash versus a professional car wash is all wet.

If Melo doesn't believe us, we'd be glad to demonstrate by washing his car. And he can use the water we save to douse his Pants On Fire!

"['Environment', 'Tennessee', 'Energy', 'Ron Ramsey']","
Ramsey says all coal in Tennessee above 2,000 feet
","
For years now, state legislators have been arguing over whether to prohibit ""mountaintop coal mining"" in Tennessee and the debate is likely to continue next year since the bill failed again in the 2012 session. In the Legislature's off season, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey spoke at a rally for coal mining supporters and criticized a central provision of the bill.

""(Environmentalists) said ‘We’re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.’ ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet,"" said Ramsey, as quoted by the Kingsport Times-News at the Abingdon, Va., rally in early June.

The Senate speaker has made similar comments in other discussions of the bill (SB577), which prohibits that state Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) from issuing any surface coal mining permits on a site above 2,000 feet in elevation.

Where did that figure come from?

Dawn Coppick, an attorney, who as legislative director of the Lindquist Appalachian Environmental Fellowship (LEAF), helped draft the bill and lobby for passage, says the 2,000-foot level is based on the U.S. Forest Service's classification of ""ecological subregions."" That amounts to a distinct area, in effect counting as a mountain in Tennessee.

Basically, everything above 2,000 feet on the Cumberland Plateau is deemed within such a subregion by the Forest Service and, thus, provides a ""scientifically sound rational basis"" for drawing a line, said Coppick. If the law were passed and challenged in court, judges would look to whether there is a ""rational basis"" for distinguishing one coal-bearing area from another, she said, and the ""ecological subregion"" would meet the legal criteria.

The Ramsey remark suggests that the legislation, if passed, would effectively block coal mining in Tennessee because all coal is above 2,000 feet in elevation. Is that accurate?

Well, no.

Supporters of the bill, opponents of the bill and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation uniformly say there is lots of coal in Tennessee below the 2,000-foot elevation level. And there are maps that show it..

A TDEC map of the state's coal-mining areas with the 2,000-foot elevation marked shows relatively small portions of the overall coal reserves would be included in the proposed ban. LEAF has a map on its website that is more generalized while making the point more clearly to the viewer.

But Chuck Laine, president of the Tennessee Mining Association, says there's an underlying basis for Ramsey's comment in that the only marketable coal that can be gathered by surface mining is above 2,000 feet. A ban on mining above 2,000 feet, he contends, would have the practical effect of prohibiting surface mining in Tennessee.

Coal is classified in different grades based on BTUs generated when it is burned, sulfur content, PH balance and moisture content.Currently, Laine said, the only marketable coal is that in the higher grades, known as ""thermal coal,"" which meets Environmental Protection Agency specifications for generating electricity in steam plants such as those operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.

""We couldn't sell our lower-grade coal,"" he said. ""It's just not usable... For higher-grade coal, you have to go above 2,000 feet in Tennessee.""

Coppick, on the other hand, says she knows of no evidence to back up that assertion.

Without getting into the merits of the legislation, it still may be appropriate to note the regulatory environment for coal mining in Tennessee. TDEC spokeswoman Meg Lockhart gave this explanation in an email:

""TDEC’s authority at mine sites is limited to regulation of discharges and other impacts to waters, which the department controls through the use of permits issued under Tennessee’s water quality law.
The United States Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining (OSM) issues the permits for the actual coal mining operation. The federal SMCRA permit authorizes the mining of coal as well as the method or type of mining used.

""While OSM does allow mining companies to remove earth to reach coal seams, Tennessee does not allow mine spoil to be deposited in Tennessee streams as some other states do -- regardless of the ridge line elevation. Therefore, mountaintop removal mining is not permitted or practiced in Tennessee as it is in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia.

""Again, Tennessee water quality laws do not allow mining companies to fill valleys with the spoil as it would impair streams. Instead, this waste rock must be stored and returned to its approximate original contour. This mining method is called cross-ridge mining and the correct term for the activity allowed in Tennessee. Additionally, the spoil must be stored while the coal is removed, then replaced and re-vegetated once mining is complete. During this process, ponds must be engineered to capture runoff and control sedimentation.""

At present, TDEC has issued 30 permits for coal mining in the state but about half of them are apparently not in use with coal prices down from levels a few years back. The Knoxville office of OSM, in its annual report last year, listed 15 active Tennessee coal mines – five underground and 10 surface.

While no breakdown of mine locations by elevation was available from TDEC, Laine says that all of the surface operations are above 2,000 feet.

We invited Ramsey and his staff to defend or elaborate on his statement after explaining that it appears to be mistaken. There was no response.

It appears the lieutenant governor has erroneously extrapolated from the coal industry's assertion that there is no marketable coal below the 2,000-foot  elevation to declare there is no coal, marketable or otherwise, below that level in our state. We rate the statement False.","[('\nKingsport Times-News article on pro-coal rally\n\nTennessee Department of Environment and Conservation map of coal areas and elevation\n\nLindquist Appalachian Environmental Fellowship map of coal areas above and below 2,000 feet\n\nOffice of Surface Mining, Knoxville division, annual report for 2011\n\nInterview with Chuck Laine, president of Tennessee Mining Association, June 26, 2012.\n\nInterview with Dawn Coppick, legislative director for Lindquist Appalachian Environment Fellowship.

Republican U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says decision to uphold Obama health plan will add trillions of dollars in debt
","
After the Supreme Court issued its June 28, 2012, ruling upholding key provisions of President Obama's health-care legislation, Barry Hinckley, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., issued a fundraising letter warning that the decision was bad news for the national debt, which is now approaching $16 trillion.

""Our country did not want or approve of ObamaCare when it was introduced and they still do not now. Americans oppose it because it will decrease the quality of care, raise taxes, cut Medicare, and add trillions of dollars in debt.""

Health care is certainly expensive; we wondered if the plan for mandating coverage and expanding insurance would really add that much to the debt.

We contacted Hinckley's office seeking the source of their information and received no response.

It turns out that PolitiFact National has examined this claim a few times, most recently when Mitt Romney made the same statement in response to the Supreme Court ruling.

Here's the bottom line: according to the PolitiFact analysis, it's not going to add to the debt because the legislation also raises money to pay for the costs.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected back in 2010 that the health-care law would lower the deficit by about $124 billion over 10 years. In 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health-care law, the CBO estimated that wiping out the law, which Romney is promising to do, would actually increase the deficit by about $210 billion over 10 years.

The budget office acknowledges circumstances can change, the CBO isn't infallible, and the issues that come up in making an analysis can be contentious, as PolitiFact found when it looked at a statement from U.S. Rep Paul Ryan, R-Wis., judged Mostly False, that the law was ""accelerating our country toward bankruptcy.""

How much would the new health-care law actually raise? As PolitiFact reported when it gave Rush Limbaugh a Pants On Fire for declaring that ""Obamacare is . . . the largest tax increase in the history of the world,"" the CBO estimates the additional revenues coming into the government will be $525 billion between now and 2019. In addition, the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, estimates the health law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019.

As an aside, Obama claimed in his 2010 State of the Union speech that health-care reform ""would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades."" PolitiFact rated that statement as Half True.

But for Hinckley's claim, congressional budget experts say he is wrong, so we will give it the same rating that Romney received: False.

Ann Kuster distorts Bass' record on Social Security
","
Social Security may not be in the news as much as it has in past elections, but congressional candidate Ann McLane Kuster wasted no time this month making it one of the first talking points in her 2012 election bid.

Just minutes after filing her election papers, Kuster, a Concord Democrat, accused her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Charles Bass, of supporting the privatization of Social Security.

""Unfortunately for New Hampshire, my opponent is part of the problem,"" Kuster told supporters during a June 7 rally outside the Statehouse.

""He supports privatizing Social Security, risking trillions more on Wall Street,"" she said. ""Our country and our state cannot support more of the same from Congressman Bass.""

Kuster and Bass know each other well. In the 2010 race, Bass defeated Kuster by a tight 2 percent margin. But, how well does Kuster know the Congressman’ stance on Social Security? We decided to check the records.

To support Kuster’s claim, her campaign staff pointed us first to a series of votes and statements Bass has made on the matter over his years in office.

Bass, a Peterborough Republican, served six terms in Congress between 1994-2006 before returning to office in 2010, and the matter of Social Security came up several times during his first years in office.

In 2001, President George W. Bush launched the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security to look into the future of the institution. In December of that year, the 16-member panel issued its final report, which urged Congress to incorporate a system of private accounts for personal investment.

Opposed by Democrats, the commission’s recommendations never reached the floor of Congress for a vote. But, the House did consider a number of proposed resolutions and amendments on both sides of the issue.

Bass joined each of his Republican colleagues in voting against H.AMDT.245, a Democrat sponsored amendment that would have prohibited any funding of the commission’s recommendations. Kuster’s staff pointed to the amendment, which failed 188-238, as evidence of Bass’ support for privatization. But, according to analysts, the amendment was more of a partisan pre-emptive strike than a true endorsement of privatization.

""He may have (supported privatization),"" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute. ""Republicans generally did at that point, but this vote was certainly not a vote that could be read that way.""

Over the years to follow, several efforts to push a privatization bill fell short at the committee level. But, Bush brought the issue to the forefront once again when he included it in his 2005 State of the Union address.

In the Feb. 2, 2005 speech, the president outlined a plan for partial privatization, which he pledged to make a key part of his second term agenda.

Immediately following the speech, Bass issued a written statement supporting the President’s plan, which reflected one of the recommendations of the 2001 commission.

""I am an advocate of the President's call for Social Security reform and will work with him in the next two years to save and protect this important program,"" Bass wrote, according to the National Journal and Project Vote Smart.

Six weeks later, Bass further endorsed Bush’s plan during stops in Claremont and Lebanon, N.H.

""I support the establishment of private savings accounts because it allows low- and middle-income workers the chance to get ahead,"" Bass said, according to the Eagle Times, of Claremont.

President Bush’s plan, to allow workers under 55 the option of directing up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into private accounts, came as close as political discourse has reached in recent years to a debate over privatization.

""Virtually no one has proposed replacing all of Social Security with private accounts,"" said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Given the way the debate has evolved, being for ... privatization doesn't mean you’re for privatizing the whole darn thing.""

In past rulings, PolitiFact has determined that the private accounts proposal does not meet the definition of full privatization.

In August of 2010, President Barack Obama earned a Mostly False ruling on a similar claim about Congressional Republicans, and later that month, Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln earned the same rating on a claim about her opponent, Rep. John Boozman.

Bass’ position on Social Security, like those of other Republicans addressed in these past PolitiFact pieces, is in support of giving taxpayers the option of investing in private Social Security accounts, according to campaign spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne.

""To address this financial crisis facing the Social Security program, one such idea Congressman Bass has supported would create a program that would allow individuals to voluntarily place a portion of their money that they currently pay as part of the payroll tax and place it into a personal account,"" Tranchemontagne wrote in an email to The Telegraph. ""Saying that (he) supports ‘privatizing Social Security’ is pure political rhetoric devised by Democrat spin doctors to frighten seniors.""

Our ruling:

Bass, like most other Congressional Republicans at the time, supported President Bush’s plan to introduce the option of private savings account into the Social Security equation. This partial privatization plan would have brought change to the system, but, as PolitiFact has ruled in the past, it would not affect people older than 55 and it does not meet the criteria for full privatization, as Kuster claims.

Ron Wyden says food served in Oregon schools comes from 'almost anywhere but Oregon'
","
When the Senate was debating the farm bill recently, Sen. Ron Wyden highlighted the haphazard nature of the way food is purchased and provided to the school lunch program under a program known as USDA Foods.

His point was simple: A lot of the food from one program in particular that ends up in school kitchens comes from points far away from the schools serving it. Using local sources of food might be cheaper, he argued, and it certainly would be more nutritious.

Wyden offered an amendment that would establish pilot programs at five locations nationwide to see if using local food could be both cheaper and better. Wyden’s amendment, which passed the Senate, would give school officials in five ""pilot"" areas far more flexibility in deciding where they purchase food.

Right now, schools that agree to take part in the program, USDA Foods, are locked into a system that almost always forces them to purchase food from outside Oregon. That program is small, supplying only 20 percent of the food used in school nutrition programs but Wyden said the $11 million a year spent on it for Oregon schools should be used for food produced in Oregon.

So he offered an amendment for give states and local districts more flexibility in navigating the USDA Foods system. The program offers a list of mostly bulk items that states purchase and then supply to local districts.

According to a USDA description, ""Schools are ordering more bulk products that can be processed into kid-friendly items. … Decisions about what products schools order are not based just on the item’s popularity but on its overall usefulness in meeting nutritional standards.""

Wyden’s amendment would allow local officials, working in collaboration with state purchasing agents, more flexibility in where they can buy the food to overcome a system that brings most of the food to Oregon from other states.

While small and limited, Wyden said it’s important nonetheless and changing the program would bring extra dollars to the local economy while also providing more nutritious food.

After it passed, the Oregon Democrat drove home the point in a news release: ""Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon.""

That is the kind of statement PolitiFact Oregon can really chew on.

There’s no doubt that the federal government spends ""millions of dollars"" to pay for school meals in Oregon. That part of Wyden’s statement isn’t in doubt.

But the second part made us wonder. Is it really true that most of the food purchased for Oregon schools under USDA Foods ended up with food from ""almost anywhere but Oregon?""

To answer, you have to dive into federal rules governing USDA Foods and some of the department’s school food programs. It is a dense and complicated business that is as close as government gets to an extreme sport. Even the experts admit they don’t always understand all the rules and requirements.

Here's just one section:

""At the beginning of each school year, State agencies shall establish the per meal rates of reimbursement for school food authorities participating in the Program. These rates of reimbursement may be assigned at levels based on financial need; except that, the rates are not to exceed the maximum rates of reimbursement established by the Secretary under §210.4(b) and are to permit reimbursement for the total number of lunches in the State from funds available under §210.4. Within each school food authority, the State agency shall assign the same rate of reimbursement from general cash assistance funds for all lunches served to children under the Program.""

Had enough? There’s plenty more, but we’ll spare you. The regulations run 65 pages.

Wyden’s spokeswoman Jennifer Hoelzer admitted her boss’s statement was based on piles of ""anecdotal evidence"" derived from talks with school officials as well as those at the Agriculture Department because detailed records are hard to find.

But we found some.

The best is a spreadsheet compiled by David Jones at the Oregon Department of Education that was also shared with Wyden. It reveals that only seven food purchases out of 166 during the 2011-12 school year came from Oregon from the USDA Foods program. That’s 4 percent for those of you who need help with the math.

Cheese came from Missouri and Minnesota as well as other states. Oregon schools used meatless spaghetti sauce bought in Indiana, applesauce from Michigan and peanut butter from New Mexico. And then there was California, a true category killer that supplied Oregon schools with everything from peaches to salsa to something called ""Burrito, Beef & Bean Bulk"" and frozen strawberries.

Forget Oregon cheese and strawberries, foodies. The only products bought from Oregon vendors were green beans, chicken fajita strips and frozen potato rounds.

Are the schools ""required"" to buy out-of-state food if they choose to take part in USDA Foods?

No. USDA Foods is voluntary. But most schools take part which means, as a practical matter, the answer is yes. Schools that take federal money for the nutrition must purchase their food through the USDA’s program. And the rules governing the program almost guarantee the sale will be made out of state.

So we conclude with records that all point in the same direction. Following federal procurement rules, which schools have to do to get federal money, leaves them little choice about what to buy and where to buy it, at least for USDA Foods.

It’s unknown whether the portion of out-of-state food is similarly lopsided for the entire school nutrition effort in Oregon. But for USDA Foods, the one definitive document we found shows unambiguous results -- 96 percent of food served in Oregon schools and purchased with federal dollars came from another state. That fits within any definition of ""almost anywhere but Oregon,"" which is why we rate this claim: True.","[('\nInterview, Jennifer Hoelzer, communications director, Sen.

"['New Hampshire', 'Debt', 'Charles Bass']","
Charlie Bass goes on the attack and distorts opponent's statement on debt limit
","
Since there’s no Miranda warning when running for office, politicians never know if something they say on the campaign trail will be used against them by an opponent.

New Hampshire Democrat Ann McLane Kuster found that out during the earliest stages of her rematch for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District against Rep. Charles Bass, R-NH. He narrowly beat Kuster in 2010, 48.3 to 46.7 percent.

The day after Kuster filed papers in the Secretary of State’s office, Bass criticized her remarks and said she was out of touch.

""After filing to run … Democrat Annie Kuster stated that debate over America’s debt limit is not an important issue of the day,""  Bass said in an email to the press.

That seemed like a curious thing to say, so PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to tune in to Kuster’s statement to find out if Bass was right.

Bass cited a video recorded by a Patch reporter that captured the filing.

""I think the voters are just fired up,"" Kuster said in the video. ""They realize Congress is broken and we need a new approach and honestly, we need a voice for hardworking New Hampshire families in Washington and people realize that their needs are not being met, that Congress is bickering over the debt limits and they’re off on arguing about things that aren't even the issues of the day. We need to create good jobs right here at home and so I’m going down to Washington to work hard for New Hampshire families and let’s bring some good jobs and let’s give people opportunity, that’s all they’re looking for.""

We contacted Bass’ campaign to get his reasoning behind the claim. Bass’ ""Victory Committee"" spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne pointed to the video, quoting Kuster as saying, ""Congress is bickering over the debt limits, they're off on arguing about things that aren't even issues of the day.""

""It is fair therefore by her own statement that she believes that ‘bickering’ over the debt limit and ‘…arguing about things that aren't even issues of the day.’ It’s apparent from her own words that she does not believe the deficit is an important issue of the day,"" Tranchemontagne said in an email.

Not quite. For one, Tranchemontagne left out the word ""and"" when quoting Kuster. It’s a small word, but words matter. And his selective quote ignored the full context of her claim.

Tranchemontagne went on to give ""debt-limit"" definitions from the United States Treasury Department, pointed to the last budget resolution passed in the Senate was on April 29, 2009, and that Bass was one of the cosponsors of the Cooper-LaTourette alternative budget, a bipartisan plan that got only 38 votes in the House.

When we talked to Kuster’s people, they said Bass missed key parts of Kuster’s statement in his characterization.

""I guess I could creatively edit this to say that she says that,"" Kuster Campaign Manager Garrick Delzell said.""I don’t even think they’re taking something out of context, they’re trying to make something be there that isn’t there.""

Indeed, a careful reading of Kuster's statement shows that Bass’ news release left out two parts. It skipped over the introductory part that says people’s ""needs are not being met,"" and they omitted the ""and,"" which separates her two statements about bickering over debt limits and arguing over unimportant issues.

""Clearly, anything that affects our economy at such a fragile time is a very important issue and the debt limit is one of those things,"" Delzell said. ""Annie believes that representatives in Congress did a terrible job by holding our economy hostage when we were negotiating on whether to increase the debt limit.""

In other words, Kuster backed up a statement about unmet needs with a statement about debt limit bickering. She ended with another statement about Congress’ focus on other subjects that aren’t ""issues of the day"" -- however Kuster does not say the debt limit is one of them.

Our ruling:

Bass said that Kuster said the debate over America’s debt limit is not an important issue of the day.

But a review of Kuster's full remarks show that's not what she said . As part of a longer comment about how Congress is dysfunctional, she complains that lawmakers are ""bickering over the debt limits and they’re off on arguing about things that aren't even the issues of the day.""

Her comments indicate she is unhappy with ""bickering"" over the debt, but she doesn't go so far as to say the debt is not an important issue.

"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Becky Moeller']","
Becky Moeller says over 4,000 Texas lives have improved or been saved due to federal health care law
","
Celebrating the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the 2010 federal health care overhaul, a Texas labor leader said thousands of Texans have already benefited from it.

In a June 28, 2012, statement, Becky Moeller, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said of the new health care law: ""It has improved or saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans who otherwise would have run afoul of ‘pre-existing condition’ clauses preventing them from obtaining insurance.""

The law has helped that many Texans with pre-existing conditions?

Refresher: The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act bars insurers, starting in 2014, from denying coverage to individuals due to pre-existing conditions. Until then, the act also provides for pre-existing condition insurance plans to be available to individuals who have been uninsured for at least six months because of a pre-existing condition, according to a timeline for the law posted online by the federal government. As the act was under debate, advocates said that without such provisions, coverage for people living with certain conditions including diabetes, cancer and HIV/AIDS would remain financially out of reach.

By email, AFL-CIO spokesman Ed Sills told us Moeller’s figure traces to the White House, which has a web page showing a map of the United States under this headline: ""What Health Reform Means to Your State."" Clicking on Texas delivers a pop-up stating ways that the law is benefiting Texas, including: ""4,029 people who were uninsured because of a pre-existing condition now have coverage.""

But those pop-out statistics are not sourced.

As we mulled Moeller’s figure, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, aired the same count in a statement lauding the court decision. Van de Putte’s spokesman, Lee Nichols, told us she drew the number from a document on the impact of the federal health law prepared by the Progressive States Network, a liberal-leaning public policy group.

By email, the group pointed us to a February 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that 27 states operate their own Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, while 23 states (including Texas) chose to depend on federally run plans. It says, too, that the plans are helping 50,000 Americans who were previously unable to afford health coverage. And the report’s Appendix A says the Texas plan, which started in August 2010, had 4,029 individuals enrolled for coverage extending through December 2011. Through that month, Texas had the third-highest number of plan members, behind California, at 5,599, and Pennsylvania, at 4,567.

We recognized this figure was not up to date. Fortunately, spokesman John Greeley of the Texas Department of Insurance alerted us to a June 15, 2012, posting on a website managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Through April 2012, according to the post, 5,684 individuals were enrolled in the Texas plan.

We paused, finally, over whether it’s fair to assume that each Texan in the program saw their lives improved or even saved, as Moeller puts it.

Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO conceded by telephone that it’s possible some of the newly insured individuals subsequently experienced worsened conditions or died. Still, he said, it’s a reasonable inference that somebody who has insurance who didn’t previously have it has an improved life. ""Even if they did die,"" Sill said, ""it’s perfectly conceivable that they received treatment that made the rest of their lives better.""

Our ruling

Moeller’s count of the Texans benefiting from newly having insurance despite pre-existing conditions is a bit understated. And while there’s no certainty that every beneficiary saw their lives improved or saved, we agree that's a reasonable supposition.

We rate the claim True.","[('\nPress release, ""Texas AFL-CIO Applauds Sup. Ct.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says that under his health care law, those who have health insurance will keep it
","
After the Supreme Court upheld the health care bill he’d signed into law, President Barack Obama applauded the decision in a speech at the White House. In that speech, Obama responded to critics, including Mitt Romney, who say the law could force many Americans off their health care plans.

""If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance,"" Obama said. ""This law will only make it more secure and more affordable.""

This is a variation on a line Obama has used before, and which we have rated in the past.

For instance, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, Obama said, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan."" We found that overly optimistic given the bill’s details at the time, so we rated it Half True. 
Later, Obama spoke more specifically. In a speech to a joint session of Congress in September 2009, Obama said, ""If you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."" We concluded that nothing in Obama’s proposal proactively forced such changes, and the bills clearly intended to leave much of the current health care system in place. So we rated the claim True. 
The claim Obama made after the Supreme Court decision on June 28, 2012, was a broader statement, and as a result, it’s less accurate.

First, a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projected that 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people would obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies enlarges that decline by an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans.

CBO’s estimate is broadly in line with a number of other independent estimates. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016.

Why are these changes occurring? Some will be made voluntarily by Americans seeking better health care options outside of their employer’s plan, but we think it’s reasonable for Obama to ignore these changes in his calculation.

Other switches will be involuntary. As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan.
   
How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population ""switched"" health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesn’t count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company.

The latter scenario is common. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third.

The number becomes substantial if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out. And knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans provides a different impression than what Obama is suggesting.

Our ruling

Obama has a reasonable point: His health care law does take pains to allow Americans to keep their health plan if they want to remain on it. But Obama suggests that keeping the insurance you like is guaranteed. 
In reality, Americans are not simply able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. Even before the law has taken effect, the rate of forced plan-switching among policyholders every year is substantial, and the CBO figures suggest that the law could increase that rate, at least modestly, even if Americans on balance benefit from the law’s provisions. We rate Obama’s claim Half True.","[('\nWhite House, remarks by the president on the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act, June 28, 2012\n\nPolitiFact, ""Barack Obama promises you can keep your health insurance, but there\'s no guarantee,"" Aug. 11, 2009\n\nPolitiFact, ""Health insurance stays in place under reform proposals,"" Sept. 9, 2009\n\nMitt Romney, remarks after Supreme Court decision on the Obama health care law, June 28, 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nCongressional Budget Office, ""CBO and JCT’s Estimates of the Effects of the Affordable Care Act on the Number of People Obtaining Employment-Based Health Insurance,"" March 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary, ""Estimated Financial Effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as Amended,"" April 22, 2010\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nUrban Institute, ""America Under the Affordable Care Act,"" December 2010\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nRAND, ""The Effect of the Affordable Care Act on Enrollment and Premiums, With and Without the Individual Mandate,"" 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nLewin Group, ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA): Long Term Costs for Governments, Employers, Families and Providers,"" June 8, 2010\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nU.S. Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation, ""Dynamics of Economic Well-Being: Health Insurance 1996-1999,"" August 2003\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nBureau of Labor Statistics, ""Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey"" (main search page), accessed Feb. 2, 2011\n\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nPolitiFact, ""Reince Priebus says health care law could mean \'as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance,\'"" March 23, 2012\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\nPolitiFact, ""Rep.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says ""Obamacare"" means up to 20 million Americans will lose insurance they like and want
","
Following the Supreme Court’s decision upholding President Barack Obama’s health care law, Mitt Romney claimed in a speech that ""Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep.""

When we checked with the Romney campaign, a spokesman confirmed that the source of Romney’s claim was a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. In March 2012, we checked a similar statement by Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus.

While PolitiFact does not put predictions to the Truth-O-Meter, we do fact-check whether politicians or pundits accurately portray the predictions made by others. So that’s what we’ll do here.

Cherry-picking the CBO report

The CBO study was undertaken to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. CBO came up with a ""baseline"" estimate -- its best guess. CBO settled on a range of 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies means a decline of an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans.

That’s nothing to sneeze at, but it’s quite a bit lower than 20 million. So where did 20 million come from?
   
CBO supplemented its ""baseline"" estimate with four alternative, and wildly divergent, estimates. One resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The other scenarios resulted in a decline of 10 million, a decline of 12 million, and -- here it is -- a decline of 20 million.
   
A number of other estimates by groups other than CBO have tracked with CBO’s baseline estimate, rather than with Romney’s figure. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016.

So the 20 million number Romney cited does come from CBO, and he hedged by saying ""up to."" But it’s the most extreme outcome of the five presented, and it’s not the primary estimate.
   
Some who ""lose"" coverage will do so because they find better options
   
Even beyond the cherry-picking, Romney is wrong to say that 20 million Americans will lose the insurance ""that they like and they want to keep.""

According to CBO’s ""baseline"" estimates, 3 million people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance ""exchanges"" created under the Obama health care law. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. For these people, it’s a stretch to say they will ""lose"" coverage that they ""like,"" since they are leaving of their own volition for something that suits them better.

Romney also ignores 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before the Obama law, but who will get employer coverage after passage of the law, perhaps because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers.

Even people who lose employer insurance involuntarily won’t, for the most part, be left without insurance options. They should have access to coverage on the exchanges, perhaps with subsidies. And depending on their income level, they may have access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan, which were expanded as part of the law.
   
Indeed, health care experts say that a big reason why companies may drop coverage is specifically because their employees will have a fallback option on the exchanges that offers guaranteed, subsidized coverage.

It’s also important to remember the big picture. CBO projects that, overall, the number of uninsured Americans will drop by 29 million to 31 million due to the law.

Romney acts as if no one ever loses coverage today

As we have previously noted, many Americans lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law, though figuring out exactly how many is surprisingly tricky.

Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month. But you don’t have to change jobs to see your plan change. Your employer may change insurance carriers, or the insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan.
   
How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population ""switched"" health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesn’t count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company.

It’s also common for employers and their insurance carriers to unilaterally change their plans. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third.

All told, this churn -- which, to reiterate, is happening because of forces beyond the Obama health care law -- almost certainly dwarfs the scale of the changes Romney is talking about.

Even Romney’s cherry-picked number of 20 million amounts to 7 percent of the 270 million non-elderly people in the U.S. CBO’s preferred figure represents an even smaller share -- 1 percent to 2 percent.

But the rate of plan-changing is almost certainly much higher if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that either change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out.

Why does this matter? Because knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans -- even if they like them -- would provide a different impression of the statistics that Romney cites.

Our ruling

Romney said that ""Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep.""

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Austin Fund for Quality Healthcare']","
Austin group says Austin is the biggest city in America with a Tier One university that lacks a medical school
","
A group that wants the University of Texas to have an Austin-based medical school floated a three-part claim in a mailer we spotted June 20, 2012: ""Austin is the biggest city in America with a Tier One research university (UT-Austin) but without a medical school.""

We know UT is a premier research university. And Austin lacks a medical school within its city limits. We also know that the Texas A&M University Health Science Center College of Medicine provides clinical training to third- and fourth-year medical students out of Round Rock, just north of Austin.

We asked the Austin Fund for Quality Healthcare to flesh out its claim.

Spokeswoman Monica Walters Crowley pointed us to results from the 2010 U.S. census indicating that among the nation’s ""most populous"" places that year, Austin, with 790,390 residents, ranked 14th. By email, Crowley said that among the 13 more populous places -- including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, Indianapolis and San Francisco -- only San Jose, Calif., and Jacksonville, Fla., lacked medical schools, and neither city is home to a ""Tier One"" university.

We checked all the bigger cities against information posted online by the Association of American Medical Colleges, which lists 137 accredited U.S. medical schools. And per the association’s list, San Jose and Jacksonville are the only cities more populous than Austin and lacking a medical school.

By our count, 11 of 13 cities more populous than Austin account for more than 20 medical schools.

Crowley said that neither San Jose nor Jacksonville is home to a ""Tier One"" research university.

And what defines a ""Tier One"" research university?

In her email, Crowley pointed out the 61 member schools of the Association of American Universities, which says it chooses members ""based on the high quality of programs of academic research and scholarship and undergraduate, graduate, and professional education in a number of fields, as well as general recognition that a university is outstanding by reason of the excellence of its research and education programs.""

From Texas, AAU members include UT, Texas A&M University and Rice University. In a telephone interview, though, AAU spokesman Barry Toiv said that in exploring how to define ""Tier One"" universities, he would defer to a list of 108 doctorate-granting universities with ""very high research"" activity as designated by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which traces its classification of colleges and universities to work by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education.

No universities in Jacksonville or San Jose showed up either among the AAU’s members or on the Carnegie list, which also revealed no cities bigger than Austin with a high-research university and lacking a medical school. (From Texas, UT, Texas A&M, Rice and the University of Houston are among the high-research institutions.)

Finally, we wondered if this uniquely Austin claim holds up if we go beyond the city limits and compare the greater Austin area to similar, more sprawling areas, taking into account institutions in bedroom communities just outside each city’s immediate boundaries.

Drawing from the Census Bureau website, we pulled down 2011 population rankings of the country’s biggest metropolitan statistical areas. By this measure, the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area ranked 34th that year, with nearly 1.8 million residents.

When we asked Crowley about this broader comparison, she replied that the punch line remains the same. The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area is ""still the largest that has an AAU-listed, Tier 1 research university and that lacks a four-year medical school,"" she said by email. ""The  only MSAs larger than us without four-year medical schools are Las Vegas and Charlotte, and neither has a Tier 1 research university designation.""

That checked out — so long as the Texas A&M program at Round Rock is overlooked. It is not a ""four-year medical school"" as Crowley said, and instead serves 80 third- and fourth-year medical students. According to a May 20, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, A&M officials hope to expand its offerings on that campus to students in all four years of medical school, though how soon that happens remains unclear. If those hopes gel, there will stands to be a full-fledged medical school in the greater Austin area.

Crowley agreed Texas A&M would like to eventually have a stand-alone medical school. She noted too by email that third- and fourth-year students enrolled at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston are receiving clinical training at Austin’s University Medical Center Brackenridge, ""but that does not mean that there is a medical school in Austin."" By telephone, Adrienne Lallo, spokeswoman for the Seton Health Care Family, which operates Brackenridge and other Central Texas hospitals, said students from UTMB and residents from UT Southwestern Medical School in Dallas train in Austin.

Our ruling

The claim that Austin is the biggest U.S. city home to a top-flight research university but lacking a medical school holds up. Still, Texas A&M hopes to make its nearby medical college into a full-fledged medical school. That information is missing from the statement, which we rate Mostly True.","[('\nEmails (excerpted), responses to PolitiFact Texas, Monica Walters Crowley, program director, Austin Fund for Quality Healthcare, June 26, 2012\n\nCharts, ""Most Populous Places,"" and 2011 populations of MSAs, ranked, U.S. Census Bureau (accessed and downloaded June 26, 2012)\n\nWeb page, ""AAU Membership: Public and Private"" (accessed June 26, 2012)\n\nList, Very High Research Universities (Downloaded from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, June 26, 2012)\n\nTelephone interview, Barry Toiv, vice president for public affairs, Association of American Universities, June 26, 2012\n\nList, U.S. medical schools, Association of American Medical Schools (accessed June 26, 2012)', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pHUIBwdxs3eomhFxDvItNSFaVHZV8Gf02SoYz0bwBc/edit')]",/factchecks/2012/jun/29/austin-fund-quality-healthcare/austin-group-says-austin-biggest-city-america-tier/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Health Care', 'Government Regulation', 'Religion', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Neumann']","
Obama and team 'socialists,"" Wisconsin GOP Senate candidate Mark Neumann claims
","
Discussing a hotly contested provision of federal health care reform, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mark Neumann resorted to fiery rhetoric to brand President Barack Obama and his entire administration.

Neumann was interviewed June 20, 2012, by conservative talk show host Jay Weber on WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee. He criticized the part of Obama's reform law that requires what he called ""abortion-inducing drugs"" be included in insurance plans offered by religious institutions.

As The New York Times explains, the Obama administration announced in January 2012 that as part of the rollout of the reform law most health insurance plans will be required to cover contraceptives for women free of charge. The announcement set off a political firestorm among religious and conservative groups, who denounced it as a threat to religious freedom, the newspaper said. The rule does not apply to church organizations themselves, but instead to affiliated nonprofit corporations, like hospitals, that do not rely primarily on members of the faith as employees.

Back to the interview.

Weber said:

""You always have to look at motive. Don't you think that one big reason that (U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen) Sebelius and Obama even imposed this mandate is that they want to get anyone other than government out of the health care business? I think that they're hoping the Catholic Church says we have no choice other than to close our hospitals.""

Neumann replied:

""Well, I think that's true. I think Barack Obama and his team believe that the federal government is best prepared to handle virtually everything in our lives. I mean, they're socialists in every respect of the word and I think they'd like to take over everything in our lives if they could, including health care.""

So, Neumann, a former House member, is claiming Obama and his team are ""socialists in every respect of the word."" Having cast himself as the most conservative candidate in the GOP primary, he goes to the opposite end of the spectrum by using socialist.

While Milwaukee had a socialist mayor (Frank Zeidler) as recently as 1960, these days those are fighting words.

So let's see what this is all about.

Twice before, our colleagues have rated statements calling Obama a socialist -- and both times issued ratings of Pants on Fire.

1. Texas Gov. Rick Perry

At a January 2012 debate for Republican presidential candidates, GOP Texas Gov. Rick Perry called Obama a socialist. Two months earlier, when Perry told Fox News he thought Obama was a socialist, he explained his claim by saying: ""When you talk about printing money and spending government money, and trying to spend it out … kind of redistribute the wealth -- the best I can tell, that's socialism.""

PolitiFact National pointed out in rating Perry’s debate claim that Obama's tax policy ""relies on the same progressive approach that has been the cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863, an approach embraced by Republicans and Democrats.""

Our colleagues continued:

""To the extent the government then gives some of the money to the less-wealthy through various programs, you could say the income is being redistributed. But that concept has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats for well over a century. That's a far cry from true socialism, which is defined as support for ""governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.""

2. Texas congressional candidate Roger Williams

Two weeks before Neumann’s claim, Texas Republican Roger Williams vowed that if elected to Congress he would ""fight a president who's, quite frankly, a socialist.""

PolitiFact Texas concluded in rating Williams’ statement that ""certain Obama policies may have expanded government"" and that ""some perceive the health care law as government asserting more control over health care.""

But that's not even equivalent to the dictionary definition of socialism that Williams’ own campaign provided: ""any of various social systems based on shared or government ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of good.""

Now back to the statement at hand.

Neumann went even further than the two Texans, claiming that not only Obama but ""his team"" are socialists.

Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander also offered a definition of socialism, saying in an email it is ""economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of means of production and distribution of goods.""

Obama, through his votes as a U.S. senator or in his time as president, ""has used government money to buy some of the largest companies in the United States and took an active role in the management of the companies,"" Englander said, citing General Motors, Chrysler and AIG.

But that argument doesn't go far.

In the Perry item, conservative economist Bruce Bartlett told PolitiFact National that ""although it is true that the federal government did come to own some private businesses as a consequence of bailout policies initiated by the George W. Bush administration such as TARP, the Obama administration sold many of them -- such as its shares in GM -- as quickly as feasible. A true socialist would have held onto them.""

Englander also argued that with health care reform, Obama ""advocates the government distributing $1.7 trillion worth of health care services. Presumably he has an economic policy that is going to collect this $1.7 trillion from one group of people and/or businesses and redistribute it to another.""

But our national colleagues addressed this, as well, saying:

""The health care law relies largely on the free enterprise system, an economic approach that Perry usually speaks about fondly. To increase health care coverage for the uninsured and people in small business, the law sets up exchanges to encourage private health insurance companies to compete. (In 2010, we chose the Republican claim that the law was a ‘government takeover’ as our Lie of the Year.)""

When we asked for a response to Neumann's claim, Obama Wisconsin campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris simply cited the two Pants on Fire items.

Our rating

We share our colleagues' view that while Obama's policies may have expanded government, they don't justify this ""ridiculous hyperbole.""

Words matter, and Neumann’s statement takes the hyperbole even further, branding not only Obama but also his entire team as socialists.

Neumann’s statement is false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire. ","[('\nWISN-AM, Jay Weber interview (at 3:20) of Mark Neumann, June 20, 2012\n\nPolitiFact Texas, ""Roger Williams says Obama is a socialist,"" June 8, 2012\n\nPolitiFact.com, ""Rick Perry says Barack Obama is a socialist,"" Jan. 8, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Mark Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander, June 21, 2012\n\nMark Neumann campaign, news release on Obama health law and abortion-inducing drugs, June 20, 2012\n\nEmail interview, President Barack Obama Wisconsin campaign press secretary Gillian Morris, June 21, 2012', 'http://www.newstalk1130.com/player/?station=WISN-AM&program_name=podcast&program_id=thejaywebershow.xml&mid=22195517')]",/factchecks/2012/jun/29/mark-neumann/obama-and-team-socialists-wisconsin-gop-senate-can/
"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Jon Runyan']","
Jon Runyan claims Affordable Care Act cuts Medicare program by $500 billion
","
A discredited claim is making a comeback following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding most of the national health care reform law.

U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said in a press release on Thursday that the law, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, makes cuts to Medicare.

""My constituents simply cannot afford the $500 billion in new tax increases and $500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation, nor can our economy sustain the job-killing mandates and regulations it imposes,"" Runyan, a Republican representing parts of southern New Jersey, said in a press release.

Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, repeated the claim in his statement about the high court’s ruling, saying ""Obamacare cuts Medicare - cuts Medicare by approximately $500 billion dollars.""  

Both claims distort the truth, as our PolitiFact colleagues have found many times.

The law aims to slow future growth in Medicare spending. It does not cut from the Medicare program.

The health care law made several changes to Medicare, which provides health insurance for millions of seniors and people under 65 receiving Social Security disability payments.

Some of the changes will increase Medicare spending to help cover prevention services and to fill the so-called doughnut hole, a gap in prescription drug coverage for some enrollees, according to a tutorial by Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project for the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent group that analyzes the health care system.

Other changes aim to reduce growth in Medicare spending, by more than $500 billion over 10 years, though estimates of the future savings vary.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have both released reports since the health care law passed showing that the Affordable Care Act will reduce future spending growth on Medicare by more than $500 billion.

The Affordable Care Act ""contains numerous provisions that, on balance, will reduce federal spending on Medicare,"" the CBO said in a June 2012 report.

The biggest portion of that savings, according to Neuman’s tutorial, will come from reducing annual increases in payments to medical providers.      

But the health care law does not cut $500 billion from Medicare. It just reduces future growth.

With the law, Medicare spending will still increase.

It’s important to note, as PolitiFact has found, that the savings from the reduction in Medicare spending will help offset spending on other provisions of the health care law, a point that Runyan noted in a statement to PolitiFact New Jersey.

""The CBO projects Medicare savings of approximately $500 Billion and instead of using that money to shore up the program, the savings are diverted from Medicare and used to fund other provisions of ObamaCare.  Even worse, this piece of legislation is hitting individuals, working families and small businesses with a massive tax increase that will further cripple the economy and slow job creation,"" Runyan said.  

Our ruling

Runyan, repeating a Republican talking point about Obama’s health care law, said there are ""$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation.""

The legislation aims to slow projected spending on Medicare by more than $500 billion over a 10-year period, but it does not cut that money from the program. Medicare spending will increase over that time frame.

Still, a sliver of truth exists in this claim, because the difference in the spending will help offset costs of other provisions in the law.

We rate this claim Mostly False.

Lipinski revives GOP talking point on ACA Medicare change
","In his campaign to hold onto the 3rd District congressional seat, U.S. Rep. Daniel Lipinski frequently faces criticism from opponents about his vote against the Affordable Care Act. The only Democratic member of Congress from Illinois to oppose former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare overhaul, Lipinski later came out against Republican plans to repeal the law. But during an interview with Fox 32’s Mike Flannery, Lipinski repeated his rationale for opposing the legislation back when it came through the House. ""The cost was not going to be sustainable, was going to blow a big hole in the deficit,"" Lipinski said. ""It did nothing about controlling costs — and those are the big issues. It took money out of the Medicare trust fund."" PolitiFact has checked claims about the Affordable Care Act siphoning dollars away from Medicare — usually leveled by Republican opponents of the plan — more than 30 times since it was first introduced in 2009, consistently finding them to take things out of context or ignore critical details. So we wanted to see if Lipinski’s statement held up any better. In a phone interview, Lipinski said he was not suggesting the ACA reduced funding for Medicare beneficiaries. During his nine-minute Feb. 14 appearance, however, Lipinski said nothing to make that distinction clear. And in previous fact-checks, we’ve contested more than just assertions that the ACA cut Medicare. When Mitt Romney — then a Republican presidential contender — said in 2012 that ""under the president’s plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare,"" PolitiFact clarified that while savings from changes the law made to rein in future Medicare spending were used to offset costs associated with expanding coverage under the ACA, money was not being taken out of one account and moved to another. FactCheck.org made a similar point the same year, noting the president could not ""actually take money out of the trust fund."" Instead, the ACA instituted changes aimed at reducing the growth of Medicare payments to insurance companies and hospitals. Spending was still projected to grow, just at a slower rate. The law also raised taxes on wealthier Americans. Those changes significantly improved the outlook of Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund, its trustees reported at the time, extending its solvency by more than a decade. The law also helped reduce the federal deficit, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. When we spoke with Lipinski, he agreed the ACA had neither taken money already allocated to Medicare nor weakened the fund’s financial condition. Instead, he raised a different issue. ""In order to make the claim that the ACA was balanced or, you know, the CBO in the end came out saying that it actually decreased the deficit, you had to double count that money,"" Lipinski said. ""If you’re going to raise the Medicare tax, if you’re going to make cuts to providers, you shouldn’t be doing that for the purpose of spending it somewhere else."" Paul Van de Water, a former assistant director for budget analysis at CBO and current senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, made the case that the office did not double count anything. ""If a batter hits a home run, on the one hand, it adds to his home run total,"" Van de Water said. ""The team also scores an additional run. That’s not double counting, it’s just that the same action has more than one effect. And in this case, the act of both reducing projected Medicare spending and increasing Medicare payroll taxes had two different effects."" Lipinski cited a 2009 CBO letter reporting that ""to describe the full amount"" of trust fund savings ""as both improving the government’s ability to pay future Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of Medicare would essentially double-count a large share of those savings and thus overstate the improvement in the government’s fiscal position."" However, Van de Water pointed out, this was a response to a hypothetical — not how CBO calculated the improvements it reported in the government’s overall fiscal position. Indeed, CBO clarified this on multiple occasions, including in a 2010 response to a question from then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions. ""Only the additional savings by the government as a whole truly increase the government’s ability to pay for future Medicare benefits or other programs,"" the CBO wrote in that letter, noting that those savings, while smaller than those within the fund itself, still decreased the deficit. Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy who served as chief economist of the Council of Economic Advisors during the implementation of the ACA’s health insurance expansions, told us Lipinski’s second point about the way the savings were allocated under the law is a ""more defensible"" position. ""Were the tax increases and cuts in Medicare provider payments worth the things they paid for? That's a completely legitimate thing to debate,"" Fiedler said. However, that was not the issue Lipinski raised on Fox 32. Speaking about the costs behind the ACA as one of his reasons for voting against it, Lipinski said the law ""took money out of the Medicare trust fund."" The law did reduce future growth in Medicare spending to help fund Obama’s expansion of health care coverage, but it did not do so by taking existing dollars away. While Lipinski did not directly state that the ACA resulted in a cut to Medicare, his remarks nevertheless suggested it siphoned money already in the fund away from the program.

Viral post criticizes Bernie Sanders' ‘math’ on health care, taxes. It's wrong
","On Facebook, several conservative pages are trying to use math to discredit Sen. Bernie Sanders’ plan to raise the minimum wage and provide universal health care to all Americans.  But they need to double-check their work. One Feb. 20 post published in a Bill O’Reilly fan page shows some calculations of Sanders’ plans. It cites a proposed $15 federal minimum wage that Sanders, I-Vt., brought up during the Feb. 19 Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas. It also cites Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States.  The Facebook post claims the plan would put an undue tax burden on minimum-wage workers, making Sanders’ proposed pay increase pointless. ""Bernie Sanders wants free health care for all and was asked how he would pay for it. His answer was raise taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 per year,"" the image reads. ""Math. It’s fascinating."" Sanders has never suggested placing a 52% tax on earnings over $29,000. (Screenshot from Facebook) The math, the post claims, works out like this: A person making Sanders’ $15 an hour minimum wage would earn $31,200 a year. But because of Sanders’ 52% tax to pay for Medicare for All, they’d pay $16,224 right back in a new health care tax. The upshot: The worker is only actually earning $7.20 an hour, or $14,976 a year after taxes The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 15,000 times and copied by several popular pro-Trump Facebook pages. We reached out to the user who originally posted the image, but we haven’t heard back — probably for good reason: The post makes some pretty fundamental errors both understanding Sanders’ plans, and the U.S. tax system. Sanders first introduced Medicare for All, which would cover every American’s medical bills completely, in April 2019. According to the Urban Institute, the health care plan would increase federal spending by $2.8 trillion in 2020, and $34 trillion over 10 years. To pay the health care proposal, Sanders has proposed a variety of different options to help cover the cost — including tax rate increases for the wealthy. RELATED: What you need to know about Medicare for All Under one of those options, the marginal income tax rate would increase for Americans making more than $250,000 per year. Incomes above $10 million would be taxed at 52%. The tax rate would be lower for people who earn less money. For single minimum-wage workers, the marginal income tax rate would stay at 12%, assuming current federal tax brackets remained the same if Congress passed a $15 minimum wage. The rate for married couples that jointly file taxes would increase from 10% to 12%, assuming their total household income is $31,200. Another one of Sanders’ proposed ways to pay for Medicare for All is a 4% income-based premium paid by households. A single person making minimum wage would pay $752, nowhere near the $16,224 that the post said.  In short, Sanders doesn’t propose a 52% tax rate for any income close to what people make at a minimum wage job. In addition, tax filers are entitled to a standard deduction ranging from $12,400 for a single filer to $24,800 for a married couple. That means people would only pay tax on income earned over that amount. Other deductions or tax credits could lower someone’s tax liability further.  The Facebook post is inaccurate.

Elizabeth Warren wrong to say Amy Klobuchar’s health plan is just two paragraphs long
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren loves to tout her plans for any and all policy questions, including climate change, child care and especially health care. This became a point of contention during the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas on Feb. 19, where she criticized her rivals over a lack of specificity in their health plans. Warren said a proposal from Pete Buttigieg is ""not a plan. It's a PowerPoint."" Then she turned to Senate colleague Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""And Amy's plan is even less,"" Warren said. ""It's like a Post-It note, 'Insert Plan Here.'"" After some additional digs and discussion, Warren and Klobuchar had this exchange: Warren: ""So I actually took a look at the plans that are posted. … Amy, I looked online at your plan. It's two paragraphs. Families are suffering, and they need …"" Klobuchar: ""OK, that's it."" Warren: ""You can't simply stand here and trash an idea to give health care coverage to everyone without having a realistic plan of your own. And if you're not going to own up to the fact either that you don't have a plan or that your plan is going to leave people without health care coverage, full coverage, then you need to say so."" Warren’s campaign told PolitiFact that she was referring specifically to Klobuchar’s plan for ""universal health care."" Her campaign pointed to the two paragraphs at the end of a Klobuchar campaign web page that specifically follow the heading ""Propose legislation to get us to universal health care.""  However, this is a selective reading of the health care policy pages that Klobuchar posted on her website. Klobuchar supports building on the Affordable Care Act and adding a public option that expands Medicare and Medicaid. By contrast, Warren initially joined rival candidate Bernie Sanders in supporting a wholesale switch to a single-player plan — a more aggressive approach than Klobuchar’s — then later eased off. Warren currently backs two bills, one for a public option and another for a single-payer plan. The problem with Warren’s attack is that it focuses on two paragraphs, which ignores most of her rival’s health care plan. There is quite a bit of detail in Klobuchar’s plan. Klobuchar’s website has no fewer than four different web pages that address the topic — a main health care policy page, a more detailed sub-page, a sub-page on prescription drugs and a sub-page on mental health.  Some of Klobuchar’s bullet-pointed priorities include: • ""Immediately suspend the Trump Administration’s efforts to eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions."" • ""Develop best models of care to address disparities in maternal and infant mortality and address the shortage of maternity care health professionals in underserved rural and urban areas."" • ""Expand Medicaid reimbursement for people receiving mental health or substance use treatment."" • ""Expand the open enrollment period for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act so more people can get insurance coverage."" • ""Stop Trump sabotage of the ACA by ending workarounds that allow states to raise premiums for sicker people and shift ACA premium subsidies away from lower-income enrollees."" All told, the four Klobuchar web pages by our count have 64 paragraphs, not counting overlap — far more than two. Warren said, ""Amy, I looked online at your (health care) plan. It’s two paragraphs."" Warren’s campaign said she was referring to just the paragraphs that specifically addressed universal health care. That wasn't clear on stage, where she dismissed Klobuchar's health policy ideas as small enough to fit on a Post-It. Klobuchar's two paragraphs on universal health care are just one part of a four-webpage policy statement that collectively runs 64 paragraphs long.

Does Bernie Sanders have “strong support” in rural and red Vermont?
","Electability is at the front of the minds of Democratic voters as they mull who to support in the primary contest. People in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and the now fast-approaching Super Tuesday states have been deciding whether the self-described democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., can win over moderate Democrats  and go on to defeat President Donald Trump in a general election. In the runup to the Iowa caucuses, where the Vermont senator finished in the top two — bunched with former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — Jane O’Meara Sanders, senior adviser and the wife of Bernie Sanders, claimed on Twitter that her husband has a track record of support in the Republican pockets of Vermont. ""@BernieSanders receives strong support from the conservative & most rural part of Vermont. Even if they don’t agree with him on everything, they appreciate his honesty, hard work & that he’s fighting for workers,"" Jane Sanders tweeted. Sanders is immensely popular in Vermont, consistently ranking among the top U.S. senators for favorability in the country, but does the progressive politician have ""strong"" support in the state’s most conservative and rural area? The campaign highlighted the large number of towns and counties which Sanders carried in the Senate race, but which also voted for incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Scott in the gubernatorial election. While it is true that many counties voted for both Scott and Sanders during the 2018 election, this does not address the portion of Jane Sanders’ claim that the conservative and ""most rural"" area in Vermont supports the senator. The most strongly Republican areas in the state are the counties that make up the Northeast Kingdom — Essex, Orleans and Caledonia — along with Franklin and Rutland counties. VTDigger analyzed general election data from the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office for these five counties since 1990 — the year Vermont first sent Sanders to Congress — to see how the Vermont senator has fared against Republicans in the most conservative areas of the state. Since 1990, Sanders has dropped below the 50% threshold in Essex County just four times — 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2018, once in Caledonia County — in 1994, and has never dipped below 50% support in Orleans County. In that same time period, 1994 was the only election he did not receive 50% of the vote in Rutland and Franklin counties. The 1994 race was a competitive contest between the incumbent Sanders and Republican John Carroll. Sanders received 49.9% while Carroll finished 3 points behind with 46.6%. While Sanders received fewer votes than Carroll in several of the towns in the Northeast Kingdom, it was by small margins demonstrating competitiveness in the region. Interestingly, during that contest, Sanders did not carry Shelburne or South Burlington but did receive more support than Carroll in Rutland City. Between 1998 and 2006, Sanders never dipped below 56% support in Essex County and in his 2012 reelection bid he got more than 60% of the vote in the county. The last election, in 2018, was the first time since 1996 that he received less than 60% of the vote in Caledonia County. Because Vermont does not require voters to register with a party to vote in elections, there’s no data on how many Republican voters crossed over in these elections to vote for Sanders.  ""It is true that Bernie has done well in the smaller towns in Vermont for a very long time,"" said Eric Davis, professor emeritus of political science at Middlebury College.  ""Is it conservative voters in those towns or is it more progressive voters in those towns? We don't know,"" Davis added. ""What we do know is, he has done well among the rural areas of the state. We do not know if he has done well among conservative voters."" On Jan. 26, Jane O’Meara Sanders tweeted that her husband, Bernie Sanders, ""receives strong support from the conservative & most rural part of Vermont"" as an argument why he is electable. In general election contests since 1990, Sanders has demonstrated he has been able to receive the majority of the votes in both the most rural and conservative areas of the state — even if Vermont Republicans may not agree with all of his policies.

Gavin Newsom Claimed California’s Homeless Population Has Dropped By 35,000 Since 2005. Is He Right?
","Gov. Gavin Newsom dedicated his second State of the State address almost entirely to California’s deepening homelessness crisis. He said the problem today requires ""a coordinated crisis-level response,"" one that gets ""the mentally ill out of tents and into treatment"" and produces affordable housing to ensure no Californian is homeless.  But Newsom also said the crisis ""has persisted for decades"" and made a claim that suggests it was worse 15 years ago.  ""Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. … That’s 35,000 more than we have today,"" Newsom said during his address, held at the state Capitol. Those figures caught our attention.  Has the state’s homeless population really dropped by 35,000 over the past decade and a half? We set out on a fact check.  ‘Apples To Oranges’ Comparison?   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development tracks homeless figures for each state based on point-in-time counts conducted every two years by local agencies. For 2005, HUD listed California’s homeless population at 188,299, matching Newsom’s figure.  Last month, HUD released its 2019 report showing California had 151,278 homeless people, or about 37,000 fewer than in 2005. That also generally lines up with the governor’s statement.  But we found there’s been a major change in how homeless people are counted since 2005. At that time, some communities, including Los Angeles County, would count the ""the hidden homeless,"" or those who were temporarily living in a motel or on someone’s couch, in addition to those who lived on the streets, in cars, shelters or abandoned buildings.  HUD stopped allowing the practice of counting the hidden homeless several years ago.  That makes comparing past data to today’s ""apples to oranges,"" said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento Regional Coalition to End Homelessness. ""It’s not even close.""  Sharron Rapport, director of the California Policy Corporation for Supportive Housing, said a significant number of people who were counted as homeless residents in the past are no longer tallied.  ""There may not be an actual decrease of 35,000 people experiencing homeless. It could just be that we counted them differently before,"" said Rapport, who serves on the governor’s homelessness task force.  Advocates for homeless people have criticized HUD’s methodology for not counting these less-visible individuals. They have said point-in-time counts, which are conducted on a single night at the end of January and largely by volunteers, tally only a fraction of the total homeless population. ""We know there’s an epidemic, right? You would have to be blind to not understand the nature of the epidemic,"" Margaretta Lin, executive director of the Dellums Institute for Social Justice said in a CityLab news article in 2019. ""But HUD defines homelessness as people who are literally homeless. People who are in a motel for that night or couch surfing for that night, under the HUD definitions, they are not considered homeless."" While the change in HUD’s methodology partially explains the lower homeless population, Rapport said California is also doing a better job housing people without a permanent home than it did in the past.  Los Angeles County, for example, is now housing 133 homeless people per day, a significant increase from the past, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at a forum last week on homelessness. The mayor noted, however, that an estimated 150 people per day are becoming homeless in the county.  A More Visible Crisis Setting the numbers aside, Rapport said there are several reasons homelessness is more visible now compared with 15 years ago. For one, it’s in more communities. ""It used to be more concentrated in specific areas. Now it is more dispersed,"" Rapport said. ""We see homelessness in every part of our state. … It’s not just in our urban centers, it’s in our suburban areas, it’s in our rural areas. People notice it more, I think, because of that.""  The high-profile Hepatitis A outbreaks that spread in homeless communities in San Diego and Los Angeles, along with more media coverage of the topic have also raised awareness, she said.  When we asked about Newsom’s statement, the governor’s office told us it’s ""not a perfect"" comparison. But, they said, the federal reports are the only comprehensive source available.  They added that Newsom was not trying to suggest that the crisis has improved, just the opposite. Our Ruling Newsom claimed: ""Back in 2005, when we did that first point-in-time count, there were over 188,000 thousand people that were deemed homeless in the state of California. … That’s 35,000 more than we have today."" His figures are technically right based on homelessness reports issued every two years by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  But his statement ignores a key change in how the reports count homeless people. In the past, they tallied a large number of ""hidden homeless,"" those living temporarily at a friend’s home or motel. Today, those people are no longer counted, meaning Newsom’s comparison is problematic, at best.  We rated the governor’s claim Half True.  HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Checking Bloomberg in Houston on infant mortality
","At a rally in Houston, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg apologized for supporting the stop-and-frisk policy he endorsed while serving as mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. Bloomberg told the mostly black audience at the rally that he should have ""acted sooner and faster"" to stop the policy and said if he were elected, he’d use ""the power of the presidency to right the wrongs of institutional racism."" He used the rally as an opportunity to unveil a new initiative that he says will address issues specific to the black community in the United States: ""Mike for Black America."" One issue he highlighted in his address was access to health care. ""We will build a future in which we better protect the health of black mothers and their babies,"" Bloomberg said at the rally. ""You should know that black babies die at rates twice as high as white babies because of a lack of access to affordable health care and here, in the wealthiest country in the world, we cannot accept that and we will change that."" Bloomberg’s figure is accurate, but is he right in his assessment of the cause of this disparity? His team did not return a request for more information about his claim. Mortality rate higher for black infants The latest statistics on infant mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that there were 22,341 infant deaths reported in the United States in 2017, putting the mortality rate at 5.79 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Statistics on infant mortality are compiled based on birth and infant death certificates in cases where infants less than a year died during the calendar year. Generally, the infant mortality rate has trended downward since 1995 and has declined 16% since 2005, when the rate was 6.86 deaths per 1,000 live births. The CDC also analyzes the infant mortality rate by race. In 2017, infants born to black women had the highest mortality rate of 10.97 deaths per 1,000 live births. The mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers was 4.67 deaths per 1,000 live births, meaning infants born to black mothers have an infant mortality rate 2.35 times higher than infants born to white mothers, according to the CDC. Bloomberg’s claim wasn’t limited to Texas, but this trend is also visible at the state level. A 2018 report from the CDC looked at infant mortality data from 2013 to 2015 by state and race and found that, in Texas, the mortality rate for infants born to non-Hispanic white women was 5 deaths per 1,000 live births and was 10.52 for infants born to black women. Exploring causes of disparity It’s true that infants born to black mothers have died at rates twice as high as white babies in recent years, but is it true that it is due to a lack of access to affordable health care? It isn’t that simple. The five leading causes of all infant deaths in 2017 identified by the CDC were all health related: In a 2019 report, the CDC noted that infants born to black women had the highest mortality rates for disorders related to short gestation (premature birth) and low birthweight and maternal complications. Numerous academic studies and media investigations have highlighted correlations between access to health care and the disparity in infant and maternal mortality rates between black and white mothers. But access to health care is widely considered to be one of many contributing factors. One 2017 study published in the American Journal of Public Health identified other factors that contribute to the high black infant mortality rate: socioeconomic status, maternal behavior, ""exposure to protective and risk factors over the course of a woman’s life,"" and certain historical factors like segregation, limited educational opportunities, structural racism, and intergenerational poverty. This is not to say that a lack of access to health care is not a significant cause of this disparity. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2019 explored how state Medicaid expansion associated with changes in low birthweight and preterm birth across different races — which are more likely to affect black mothers and infants than white mothers and infants. The study did not explore the link between Medicaid expansion and reducing infant mortality. Researchers found that overall, Medicaid expansion was not associated with differences in rates of low birth weight or preterm births. However, they identified ""significant improvements in relative disparities for black infants compared with white infants in states that expanded Medicaid vs. those that did not."" In other words, states that expanded Medicaid saw rates of low birthweight and preterm births decline among black mothers and infants. In general, black mothers were less likely than white mothers to access prenatal care, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’s Office of Minority Health. In 2017, black mothers were 2.3 times more likely to receive no prenatal care or late prenatal care than non-Hispanic white mothers. The same year, 66.6% of black mothers received prenatal care during the first trimester, compared to 82.4% of white mothers who accessed early care. Our ruling Bloomberg said: ""Black babies die at rates twice as high as white babies because of a lack of access to affordable health care."" Bloomberg’s figures about the black infant mortality rate vs. the white infant mortality rate are accurate. Studies show that access to healthcare is a contributing factor to this disparity, but it is far from being the only issue at play. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Youtube, Mike Delivers Speech in Houston, TX, Feb. 14, 2020', 'https://youtu.be/sEuvsP7sgXk?t=4350'), (""PolitiFact, Is racial gap in infant mortality higher today than in 1850, as Beto O'Rourke says?, April 23, 2019"", 'No link'), ('National Vital Statistics Reports, Infant Mortality in the United States, 2017: Data From the Period Linked Birth/Infant Death File, August 1, 2019', 'https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/23/beto-orourke/la-di-dah/'), ('National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, State Variations in Infant Mortality by Race and Hispanic Origin of Mother, 2013-2015, January 2018', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health, Infant Mortality and African Americans, accessed Feb. 17, 2020', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_10-508.pdf'), ('Journal of the American Medical Association, Association of State Medicaid Expansion Status With Low Birth Weight and Preterm Birth, April 2019', 'No link'), ('Center for Health Journalism, How one reporter made an old statistic about black infant mortality new and urgent, June 14, 2019', 'https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db295.pdf'), ('New York Times Magazine, Why America’s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis, April 11, 2018', 'No link'), ('KPCC, Special Series: Black Infant Mortality, accessed Feb. 18, 2020', 'https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=23'), ('U.S. National Library of Medicine, State-Level Progress in Reducing the Black–White Infant Mortality Gap, United States, 1999–2013, May 2017', 'No link'), ('U.S. National Library of Medicine, The US Black–White Infant Mortality Gap: Marker of Deep Inequities, May 2017', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2731179')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/20/michael-bloomberg/checking-bloomberg-houston-infant-mortality/

Amy Klobuchar says majority of Trump voters, hunters want universal background checks. She’s right
","On the heels of a fiesty Democratic debate that touched on everything from health care to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s past comments and positions, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar joined MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" to talk about an issue that didn’t come up: Guns.  Klobuchar said she was ""sad"" that gun violence wasn’t talked about during the debate in Las Vegas, the location of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history in 2017. She also lamented the lack of progress in Congress on universal background checks. ""The majority of hunters now want universal background checks, the majority of Trump voters,"" Klobuchar said. ""There’s absolutely no reason we shouldn’t be moving on it.""  We’ve fact-checked a number of related claims from Democrats about support for universal background checks among groups such as NRA members, gun owners and Republicans. But what about hunters? And what about supporters of President Donald Trump?  Klobuchar has made the same claim a few times before, including on ABC’s ""The View,"" so we decided to check it out. We found that her statement lines up with the available polls. RELATED: Do gun background checks work? What the research shows Many Democrats have called for universal background checks, which would require background checks on nearly all gun purchases, including private sales made at events such as gun shows. The Democrat-led House passed a bill in 2019 to ban the private transfer of firearms unless a licensed gun dealer or manufacturer takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. But the GOP-led Senate has refused to take it up. Trump, meanwhile, has made inconsistent statements about background checks, often touting the need to strengthen them in the wake of mass shootings only to walk back his support later. When we examined a previous claim about GOP support for universal background checks, we found a number of polls that showed Republican approval floating between 82% and 95%. Not all registered Republicans necessarily voted or are planning to vote for Trump, whose approval rating within the party has generally held within the mid-to-high 80s. But a few polls that have narrowed the scope to Trump voters lend credence to Klobuchar’s claim. The Klobuchar campaign specifically cited an Aug. 14 Fox News poll that asked 1,013 randomly sampled registered voters if they ""favor or oppose"" proposals ""requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales.""  That poll — conducted shortly after mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas — found support for such proposals from 90% of ""Trump voters,"" with 8% signaling opposition and 2% saying they didn’t know. Similarly, a mid July Marist poll conducted in partnership with NPR and PBS NewsHour asked 1,346 respondents about ""background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales."" And 82% of ""2016 Trump supporters"" said the checks were a ""good idea."" Still, it’s worth noting that support for background checks doesn’t always line up with voting for specific pieces of legislation. The National Rifle Association has pointed to 2016 referendums in Maine and Nevada that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls. It’s also not clear how many people surveyed as part of the Fox News and Marist polls identified as Trump voters or supporters, although the Marist poll only reported results for subgroups of at least 100 people. Small sample sizes could be misleading, even if a larger number of polls shows high support for background checks among Republicans more generally. But Klobuchar claimed only that a majority of Trump voters want background checks, leaving her wiggle room to account for margins of error or changes in public opinion over time. We follow the facts and share what we learn so you can make your own decisions. Support our mission today. Membership.politifact.com As for hunters, the Klobuchar campaign cited a 2013 Politico article about a poll commissioned by Bull Moose Sportsmen’s Alliance, an advocacy group representing hunters and sportsmen.  That poll surveyed 800 hunters and found that 77% support ""requiring anyone who wants to purchase a firearm to pass a criminal background check before each potential gun purchase.""  It also found that 72% of hunters support criminal background checks that allow for exemptions for ""gun exchanges between family members, sharing guns on hunting trips and shooting ranges, or sales to those who have concealed carry permits from state government."" By now, the poll is almost seven years old. Liam Sullivan, press secretary for Brady United Against Gun Violence, a gun control advocacy group, said the organization was not aware of any other surveys measuring hunters’ support for background checks.  We couldn’t find other related polls via Google and Nexis. Neither could Everytown for Gun Safety, another gun control advocacy organization. But Sullivan noted that pollsters — including the Pew Research Center  — have found majority support for background checks among gun owners more generally. Klobuchar said, ""The majority of hunters now want universal background checks, the majority of Trump voters."" The claim about Trump voters is backed by two national polls from the summer of 2019, while the claim about hunters matches a 2013 poll commissioned by a hunting advocacy group. Polls don’t necessarily reflect support for specific pieces of legislation, however.

Bloomberg’s edited video of the Las Vegas Democratic debate, in context
","Democratic presidential candidates jumped over each other to land rhetorical punches against Mike Bloomberg at the Las Vegas debate, hitting the billionaire former mayor over redlining, stop and frisk, and his past critiques of Barack Obama. Bloomberg selected a different highlight to share on Twitter the next day. The video starts with Bloomberg on stage saying, ""I’m the only one here I think that’s ever started a business. Is that fair?""  In the video, Bloomberg’s question is met with silence and blank stares from the other Democrats on stage. The sound of crickets plays in the background. ""OK,"" he says at the end of the 25-second clip. Anyone? pic.twitter.com/xqhq5qFYVk Bloomberg’s video makes it look like he left the other presidential candidates speechless for 20 seconds. But that’s not what actually happened. In fact, there was a two-second pause between when the former mayor said ""Is that fair?"" and ""OK."" Here are Bloomberg’s full remarks, which came in response to a question about his stance on redlining: ""I've been well on the record against red-lining since I worked on Wall Street. I was against it during the financial crisis. I've been against it since. ""The financial crisis came about because the people that took the mortgages, packaged them, and other people bought them, those were — that's where all the disaster was. Red-lining is still a practice some places, and we've got to cut it out. But it's just not true. ""What I was going to say, maybe we want to talk about businesses. I'm the only one here that I think that's ever started a business. Is that fair? OK."" His last comment was met with laughter from the audience. The video was selectively edited to make Bloomberg’s debate performance look better than it was — splicing together unrelated moments of expressive faces from his rivals. RELATED: Bloomberg on the defensive, fact-checking the Las Vegas Democratic debate On Twitter, some users took it a step further, saying the clip is a ""deepfake"" and a violation of the platform’s new policy against manipulated videos.  According to Twitter’s policy on ""synthetic and manipulated media,"" the company is only likely to remove videos that have been ""significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated,"" ""shared in a deceptive manner"" and are ""likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm.""  As of now, Bloomberg’s video does not appear to meet those standards. Twitter may label clips that meet just one of the criteria, but it has not yet done so for Bloomberg’s tweet. A deepfake video is one that uses artificial intelligence to make it look like someone is doing or saying something that never occurred. In contrast, the clip that Bloomberg shared is an example of what the Washington Post calls ""splicing,"" or ""editing together disparate videos"" that ""fundamentally alters the story that is being told."" Bloomberg’s video is the latest example of deceptive video editing techniques being used in the 2020 election. On Feb. 6, President Donald Trump tweeted an edited video of his State of the Union address. The clip makes it look like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up her copy of the speech after Trump introduced each of his guests, which included military families and a young woman receiving a scholarship. In fact, Pelosi waited until the end of the address to rip up her copy. And she stood and clapped for many guests. PolitiFact reached out to Twitter and the Bloomberg campaign for comment, but we haven’t heard back. Bloomberg tweeted a video that purports to show a 20-second pause from Democratic candidates at the Las Vegas debate after he claimed he was the only one who had started a business. The video was selectively edited to splice together unrelated moments of expressive faces from his rivals. In fact, there was a two-second pause after Bloomberg brought up his business experience. Bloomberg’s video contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, the UN is not planning to implant the world with biometric IDs
","What’s more wild than science fiction’s robots, aliens and galaxies far, far away? The internet, that’s what. Word on the world wide web is that the United Nations is scheming to implant ""everyone"" with a ""biometric ID."" Say goodbye to your privacy. A story by website truthandaction claims that the United Nations is planning to have ""all humans imprinted with biometric identification cards by 2030"" as part of its ""Global Goals agenda."" No. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This conspiracy theory is an overreach of a system that the UN is using to help identify refugees through biometrics that include facial recognition, fingerprints and iris scans. The truthandaction article points to the UN’s Global Goals initiative that was released in 2015. The agenda comprises 17 goals to achieve around the world by 2030 and includes objectives like no poverty, zero hunger and quality education.  But the story zeroes in on a section of goal No. 16, which is called ""Peace, justice and strong institutions.""  The section in question, 16.9, says: ""By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration."" The idea, though, was to help refugees prove their identities when seeking asylum, and biometrics refers to many different types of identification (not just microchips). As part of the the UNs 2030 goal, companies Accenture and Microsoft unveiled a blockchain ID system prototype in 2017: It ""combines a person`s biometric information such as their fingerprint or retina scan with blockchain, the record-keeping technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, to create a legal identity. When operational, the tool will provide refugees with the ability to present their IDs via an app on their smartphones at border crossings to prove they`re coming from a refugee camp and qualify for aid. The app will also enable displaced individuals to share their identities when required to access basic services such as education and healthcare."" Since then, biometric technology has been developed to help identify refugee populations (though there have been some concerns about the practice). But the claim that the UN is planning to implant the world’s population with a microchip ID is far off. We found no mention of implanted microchips in the UN’s goals. Even if UN-backed biometric technology is aimed to expand beyond refugee and immigrant populations, this theory is based on speculation and overblows the facts. We rate it False.","[('TruthandAction, The UN Plans To Implant Everyone With A Biometric ID, Accessed Feb. 20, 2020', 'http://www.truthandaction.org/un-plans-implant-everyone-biometric-id/?fbclid=IwAR3wgGAnJysYGeuCbGZJS1EBoISDSEypayIFKf-atZ121L9dLmdTpXvFttY'), ('GlobalGoals.org, THE 17 GOALS, Accessed Feb. 20, 2020', 'No link'), ('SustainableDevelopment.UN, Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, September 2015', 'https://www.globalgoals.org/'), ('Snopes, FALSE: All Americans Will Receive a Microchip Implant in 2017, June 2, 2015', 'No link'), ('Fortune.com, Microsoft and Accenture Unveil Global ID System for Refugees, June 19, 2017', 'https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/20/blog-posting/no-un-not-planning-implant-world-biometric-ids/

Buttigieg’s bad math exaggerates the budget gap in Sanders’ big plans
","Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leading in the polls heading into the Nevada Democratic caucuses, faced more than a few attacks from his rivals on the debate stage in Nevada. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg aimed one at the fiscal realities of Sanders’ many plans. ""If you add up all his policies all together, they come to $50 trillion,"" Buttigieg said. ""He's only explained $25 trillion worth of revenue, which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States."" Estimating the future costs of huge plans — such as Medicare for All — and the future revenues from new taxes — such as a wealth tax — is fraught with problems. Buttigieg’s campaign sent us the basis for their numbers, and they are reasonable, if still subject to uncertainty and debate. Medicare for All is a good example of how estimates can vary. The Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, calculated that under Sanders’ plan, overall health spending would rise by 13%. But a new study from policy researchers at Yale, University of Maryland and University of Florida estimated overall spending would fall by 13%. So, treat all projections with caution. But there’s an issue with Buttigieg’s basic comparison of Sanders’ proposals to the U.S. economy. He might have been using a rhetorical flourish to give a sense of scale, but his words muddled the math. The flaw is that he used 10-year cost and revenue estimates for the Sanders plans and stacked them against one year of the nation’s GDP. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis put the size of the U.S. economy at $21.4 trillion in 2019. Using Buttigieg’s estimate of the revenue gap, his statement is mathematically correct, but it ignores the different time frames. For a more apples-to-apples comparison (which would come with a host of other analytic issues), you would look at the cumulative value of the economy as projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next decade. The CBO’s latest estimate amounts to nearly $300 trillion worth of GDP by 2030. In that context, a budget hole of $25 trillion adds up to about 8% of the total. Buttigieg said the budget hole in Sanders’ plans ""is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the United States.""  Buttigieg has compared proposed spending and revenues over a decade to one year’s worth of GDP. By that measure, the math works. If we use a 10-year window across the board, the revenue gap is about 8% of cumulative U.S. GDP.  Buttigieg may have taken rhetorical license, but that doesn’t change that the statement is partially accurate and leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.","[('U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Gross domestic product, Jan. 30, 2020', 'https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&select_all_years=0&nipa_table_list=5&series=a&first_year=2017&last_year=2019&scale=-9&thetable='), ('Congressional Budget Office, 10-year economic projections, Jan. 28, 2020', 'No link'), ('Urban Institute, Don’t Confuse Changes in Federal Health Spending with National Health Spending, Oct. 16, 2019', 'https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-01/51135-2020-01-economicprojections_0.xlsx'), ('The Lancet, Improving the prognosis of health care in the USA, Feb. 15, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email exchange, Sean Savett, spokesman, Buttigieg for President, Feb. 20, 2020', 'https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/dont-confuse-changes-federal-health-spending-national-health-spending')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/20/pete-buttigieg/buttigiegs-bad-math-exaggerates-budget-gap-sanders/
"['Health Check', 'Seema Verma']","
Trump’s Medicaid Chief Labels Medicaid ‘Mediocre.’ Is It?
","The Trump administration’s top Medicaid official has been increasingly critical of the entitlement program she has overseen for three years. Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has warned that the federal government and states need to better control spending and improve care to the 70 million people on Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the low-income population. She supports changes to Medicaid that would give states the option to receive capped annual federal funding for some enrollees instead of open-ended payouts based on enrollment and health costs. This would be a departure from how the program has operated since it began in 1965. In an early February speech to the American Medical Association, Verma noted how changes are needed because Medicaid is one of the top two biggest expenses for states, and its costs are expected to increase 500% by 2050. ""Yet, for all that spending, health outcomes today on Medicaid are mediocre and many patients have difficulty accessing care,"" she said. Verma’s sharp comments got us wondering if Medicaid recipients were as bad off as she said. So we asked CMS what evidence it has to back up her views. A CMS spokesperson responded by pointing us to a CMS fact sheet comparing the health status of people on Medicaid to people with private insurance and Medicare. The fact sheet, among other things, showed 43% of Medicaid enrollees report their health as excellent or very good compared with 71% of people with private insurance, 14% on Medicare and 58% who were uninsured. The spokesperson also pointed to a 2017 report by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC), a congressional advisory board, that noted: ""Medicaid enrollees have more difficulty than low-income privately insured individuals in finding a doctor who accepts their insurance and making an appointment; Medicaid enrollees also have more difficulty finding a specialist physician who will treat them."" We opted to look at those issues separately. What about health status? Several national Medicaid experts said Verma is wrong to use health status as a proxy for whether Medicaid helps improve health for people. That’s because to be eligible for Medicaid, people must fall into a low-income bracket, which can impact their health in many ways. For example, they may live in substandard housing or not get proper nutrition and exercise. In addition, lack of transportation or child care responsibilities can hamper their ability to visit doctors. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard University, said Verma’s comparison of the health status of Medicaid recipients against people with Medicare or private insurance is invalid because the populations are so different and face varied health risks. ""This wouldn’t pass muster in a first-year statistics class,"" he said. Death rates, for example, are higher among people in the Medicare program than those in private insurance or Medicaid, he said, but that’s not a knock on Medicare. It’s because Medicare primarily covers people 65 and older. By definition, Medicaid covers the most vulnerable people in the community, from newborns to the disabled and the poor, said Rachel Nuzum, a vice president with the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund. ""The Medicaid population does not look like the privately insured population."" Joe Antos, a health economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, also agreed, saying he is leery of any studies or statements that evaluate Medicaid without adjusting for risk. For a better mechanism to gauge health outcomes under Medicaid, experts point to dozens of studies that track what happened in states that chose in the past six years to pursue the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. The health law gave states the option to extend Medicaid to everyone with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $17,600 annually for an individual. Thirty-six states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion. ""Most research demonstrates that Medicaid expansion has improved access to care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, and financial security among the low-income population,"" concluded the Kaiser Family Foundation in summarizing findings from more than 300 studies. ""Studies show improved self-reported health following expansion and an association between expansion and certain positive health outcomes."" (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) Studies found the expansion of Medicaid led to lower mortality rates for people with heart disease and among end-stage renal disease patients initiating dialysis. Researchers also reported that Medicaid expansion was associated with declines in the length of stay of hospitalized patients. One study found a link between expansion and declines in mechanical ventilation rates among patients hospitalized for various conditions. Another recent study compared the health characteristics of low-income residents of Texas, which has not expanded Medicaid, and those of Arkansas and Kentucky, which did. It found that new Medicaid enrollees in the latter two states were 41 percentage points more likely to have a usual source of care and 23 percentage points more likely to say they were in excellent health than a comparable group of Texas residents. Medicaid’s benefits, though, affect far more than the millions of nondisabled adults who gained coverage as a result of the ACA. ""Medicaid coverage was associated with a range of positive health behaviors and outcomes, including increased access to care; improved self-reported health status; higher rates of preventive health screenings; lower likelihood of delaying care because of costs; decreased hospital and emergency department utilization; and decreased infant, child, and adult mortality rates,"" according to a report issued this month by the nonpartisan Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Children — who make up nearly half of Medicaid enrollees — have also benefited from the coverage, studies find. Some studies report that Medicaid contributes to improved health outcomes, including reductions in avoidable hospitalizations and lower child mortality. Research shows people on Medicaid are generally happy with the coverage. A Commonwealth Fund survey found 90% of adults with Medicaid were satisfied or very satisfied with their coverage, a slightly higher percentage than those with employer coverage. Accessible care? The evidence here is less emphatic. A 2017 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found 84% of Medicaid recipients felt they were able to get all the medical care they needed in the previous six months. Only 3% said they could not get care because of long wait times or because doctors would not accept their insurance. Verma cites a 2017 MACPAC report that noted some people on Medicaid have issues accessing care. But that report also noted: ""The body of work to date by MACPAC and others shows that Medicaid beneficiaries have much better access to care, and much higher health care utilization, than individuals without insurance, particularly when controlling for socioeconomic characteristics and health status."" It also notes that ""Medicaid beneficiaries also fare as well as or better than individuals with private insurance on some access measures."" The report said people with Medicaid are as likely as those with private insurance to have a usual source of care, a doctor visit each year and certain services such as a Pap test to detect cervical cancer. ""Medicaid is not great coverage, but it does open the door for health access to help people deal with medical problems before they become acute,"" Antos said. On the negative side, the report said Medicaid recipients are more likely than privately insured patients to experience longer waiting times to see a doctor. They also are less likely to receive mammograms, colorectal tests and dental visits than the privately insured. ""Compared to having no insurance at all, having Medicaid improves access to care and improves health,"" said Rachel Garfield, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""There is pretty strong evidence that Medicaid helps patients get the care they need."" Our ruling Verma said that ""health outcomes today on Medicaid are mediocre and many patients have difficulty accessing care.""

Ilhan Omar didn’t break the law when she used a Quran to take the oath of office
","U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim American Democrat from Minnesota, was sworn into the House of Representatives on Jan. 3, 2019, using the Quran that belonged to her grandfather. A couple weeks later, a Facebook post claimed that she and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D.-Mich. — who also used a Koran during her swearing-in ceremony — broke the law by doing so.  ""Let me say about the QURAN, if you take the Oath of Office on a book recognizing Sharia Law swearing to defend honor and uphold the United States Constitution, then you have committed treason,"" reads the text accompanying a photo of Omar during her swearing-in. ""For Sharia Law is a direct violation and conflict of the United States Constitutional Law.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  That’s because the Facebook post is wrong.  Article VI of the U.S. Constitution says that U.S. senators and representatives, among others, ""shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" Representatives usually take an oath — swearing to support and defend the Constitution — on the first day of a new Congress. First, they take the oath as a group together. Around the 2:50 mark here you can watch House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited the new members of the 116th Congress rise and raise their right hands. She reads the oath, asking if they swear to support and defend the Constitution, and after they all together say ""I do,"" she congratulates them. Ceremonial swearing-ins follow, during which members can take the oath with their hand on a religious text and be photographed with the speaker.    Historically, most members of Congress have sworn the oath on a copy of the Bible, but the Constitution doesn’t require it and, as the since-shuttered magazine Pacific Standard reported, the 116th Congress in 2019 was the most diverse Congress ever. More than 12 religious and non-religious texts were used during swearing-in ceremonies. ""Though oaths are indeed religious in origin,"" the Pacific Standard story says, ""the Constitution makes clear that the oath can be replaced with an ‘Affirmation,’ which substitutes the religious language (the ‘I swear’ and ‘So help me God’) with secular affirmation (for example: ‘I affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth’).""  In 2007, then-Rep.-elect Keith Ellison used former President Thomas Jefferson’s copy of the Koran for his swearing-in ceremony, drawing complaints from conservative Christians who claimed only a Bible could be used for the oath of office. But back in 1825, former President John Quincy Adams swore his oath on a law book. In 2013, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Hindu, swore on a copy of the Bhagavad Gita. The photos showing Ellison, Tlaib and Omar with their hands on Qurans are from ceremonial events, re-enacting their swearing-in.  ""That’s when you’ll see a hand on a religious text,"" Fred Beuttler, then the deputy historian of the House, told ABC in 2006. ""But that’s an informal ceremony for the members or the members’ own purposes. It’s not the official swearing-in ceremony of the House, when no religious text is used.""

Sanfelippo flops with claim on violent crime
","One Assembly Republican making the case for a series of tough-on-crime bills says a statewide rise in violent crime shows why the bills are needed. The bills would return more people to prison for probation violations, put more juveniles behind bars and limit early release for inmates. They illuminate a key ideological divide between Republicans seeking more time behind bars for certain offenders and a Democratic governor who has called for cutting the state's prison population in half in the coming years. In the GOP Weekly Radio Address on Feb. 13, 2020, state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-New Berlin, used a series of numbers to support bills he said would ""help keep Wisconsin communities safe."" ""FBI data shows violent crime rates increased in all but two Wisconsin cities between 2008 and 2017,"" said Sanfelippo. ""In fact, when combining Wisconsin’s 10 largest cities, the violent crime rate increased by 24% during that time, while decreasing by 14% on a national average."" It’s certainly an eye-catching claim.  Is violent crime up in all but two of the hundreds of cities across Wisconsin? We checked it out — and found a case study in how not to use data. Sanfelippo misquoted the stat he was trying to use while constructing an argument riddled with other data-related problems. Let’s see what the data actually tells us. Asked for evidence supporting his discussion of violent crime, Sanfelippo’s office pointed us to a policy brief the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum published in December 2019. Amid a discussion of police spending and staffing, the paper used FBI data to say violent crime had risen in Wisconsin from 2008 to 2017. The FBI gathers crime stats from departments around the country, and reports a ""violent crime"" tally based on the number of homicides, sexual assaults, robberies and aggravated assaults. (We should point out the Wisconsin Department of Justice also gathers crime data that in some cases varies slightly from the FBI, but we’ll limit our analysis here to the FBI data since that is what is cited by both Sanfelippo and the report he relied on.) Sanfelippo and the paper point to 2017 data. But the 2018 data, which was available at the time,  shows a noteworthy reversal, with the violent crime rate dropping after several years of steady increases. The number of violent crimes Wisconsin law enforcement reported to the FBI fell from 15,931 in 2017 to 15,263 in 2018. But that’s not necessarily a reliable number. Here’s why. The FBI crime data is difficult to compare year-to-year because it’s not comprehensive. Not every police department reports their data every year. And state and local officials regularly change their reporting practices, changing definitions or other factors in generating counts. To address this, the FBI data notes which agencies have changed reporting practices each year and warns the crime figures are now ""not comparable to previous years’ data."" This was not taken into account in Sanfelippo’s claim or the memo his office cited as backup. In the 2008 to 2017 period Sanfelippo referenced, the FBI flagged data from 46 Wisconsin municipalities as no longer being comparable to past years. That included three of the 10 largest cities — which you’ll remember Sanfelippo cited specifically as having a 24% increase in violent crime. We’ll also note that while Sanfelippo referred to cities, the FBI data includes cities, towns and villages, so we’ll refer to the group as municipalities here. Sanfelippo — like many other Republicans — is using the FBI data to say violent crime is on the rise across Wisconsin. But that's not really what the data shows. More than two-thirds of the violent crimes in Wisconsin take place in Milwaukee, so in large part the statewide trend is just a reflection of what’s happening in the state’s largest city. Violent crime in Milwaukee has edged up and down in recent years, but 2018 was the city’s lowest mark since 2013. Addressing these three data issues (age, comparability and the Milwaukee outlier) lets us bring the state’s actual violent crime trend into clearer focus. And we find there essentially is no trend. Using FBI crime data from 2008 and 2018 and removing the places that changed reporting practices in that span leaves us with 206 municipalities — still a solid sample size. Based on that group, the statewide violent crime rate rose from 4.3 to 4.7 per 1,000 residents from 2008 to 2018. But Milwaukee accounted for all of that change. Remove Milwaukee and the crime rate across the other 205 municipalities went from 1.77 per 1,000 to 1.74 per 1,000 — virtually unchanged. But all of these data mistakes pale in comparison to Sanfelippo’s dramatic misuse of the memo’s description. The memo said — again, based in part on data the FBI warned against comparing — that violent crime rates increased in all but two of the state’s 10 largest cities. Sanfelippo instead claimed the crime rate increased in ""all but two Wisconsin cities."" That’s not even close to true. Using the 206 municipalities referenced above — those that have data for both 2008 and 2018 and haven’t changed reporting practices — we find the crime rate rose in 98 municipalities, fell in 88 and was unchanged in 20. Sanfelippo acknowledged using the stat incorrectly when questioned by PolitiFact Wisconsin. The reference, which was wrong in both the recorded and written versions of the radio address, came from a script that Sanfelippo said wasn’t written by him or his office. ""It wasn’t intentionally done, it was just a mistake,"" he said. ""I should have picked up on that for as much as I have been talking about crime these last few months."" Arguing for a series of tough-on-crime bills, Sanfelippo said in a statewide radio address that violent crime ""increased in all but two Wisconsin cities between 2008 and 2017."" Almost every word of that is wrong. Any comparison should have factored in the 2018 data, which was available at the time. The comparisons shouldn’t include the many places where reporting practices changed. And even the use of the word cities is wrong since the dataset includes towns and villages. Most importantly, Sanfelippo misstated the claim he was trying to repeat. In actuality, there are more than 100 Wisconsin municipalities where the crime rate did not rise — more than half the communities included in the best available FBI data. That makes Sanfelippo’s claim not only false, but ridiculous. We rate this Pants on Fire.","[('Joe Sanfelippo,\xa0weekly radio address, Feb. 13, 2020', 'https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/200213GOPRADIO.pdf'), ('Wisconsin Policy Forum,\xa0Police Spending Rises, Staffing Levels Fall, Dec. 13, 2019', 'No link'), ('FBI,\xa0Crime in the U.S., 2008 to 2018, accessed Feb. 17, 2020', 'https://wispolicyforum.org/focus/police-spending-rises-staffing-levels-fall/'), ('Email exchange with Joe Sanfelippo’s legislative staff, Feb. 18, 2020', 'No link'), ('Email exchange and interview with Joe Sanfelippo, Feb. 18-23, 2020', 'https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s')]",/factchecks/2020/feb/20/joe-sanfelippo/sanfelippo-flops-claim-violent-crime/
