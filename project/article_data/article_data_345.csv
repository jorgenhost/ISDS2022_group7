Planned Parenthood spends millions to elect Democrats to Congress, GOP U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy says
","During debate on a bill to defund Planned Parenthood, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., alluded to secretly recorded videos that prompted the legislation, then he made a claim about the group’s political activity. ""If you watch this debate, you have to ask: How could anybody defend the practices at Planned Parenthood?"" Duffy said on the House floor on Sept. 18, 2015, the day the House approved the one-year defunding. ""Harvesting body parts. How could anybody defend that? It’s an easy answer. Look in (the) political season. Millions of dollars, millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and to the Senate. This isn’t about babies; this is about money."" A reader asked us to check Duffy’s claim. The videos, the funding The videos, first released in July 2015, show Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress, which recorded the videos, alleges Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. But Planned Parenthood says it has done nothing illegal, and that the videos were edited in a misleading way. The defunding bill, which has yet to be taken up by the U.S. Senate, would end federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, diverting the money to thousands of community health centers. Republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced Planned Parenthood patients, but Democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes in remote locations. Planned Parenthood gets around $450 million each year  in federal payments, mostly Medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients. That's around one-third of the organization's $1.3 billion annual budget. As for Planned Parenthood’s political activity, some of this ground was covered when Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina made a similar claim. She said Planned Parenthood ""funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates."" PolitiFact National rated the statement Mostly True. Millions have been spent. But the caveat is that the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics -- separate entities that are affiliated with Planned Parenthood can. Duffy’s claim Duffy’s claim was a little different -- that Planned Parenthood spent millions to elect Democrats to the House and Senate. We found, using figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, that that was this case. In the 2014 election cycle alone, Planned Parenthood-affiliated groups that can't give directly to candidates or coordinate with them, such as Planned Parenthood Votes, a Super PAC, made over $6 million in independent expenditures. That included $1.85 million spent in support of Democrats and $2.87 million spent against Republicans. ""In addition, Planned Parenthood's PAC gave nearly $590,000 to congressional candidates, all of them Democrats."" The numbers would be higher, of course, if previous cycles were included. Our rating Duffy said: ""Millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and the Senate."" By law, the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics. But separate entities that are affiliated with Planned Parenthood can, and they spent millions just in the 2014 election cycle to elect Democrats. We rate Duffy’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/08/sean-duffy/planned-parenthood-spends-millions-elect-democrats/

Tweets say Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' hats are made in China
","Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was forced to address a widespread allegation of hypocrisy this week, and it had nothing to do with his former liberal ways or his company’s overseas investments. Much worse. Social media posts claimed his unmistakable, sometimes ironically worn ""Make America Great Again"" hats are not made in the USA. Here’s an example from Twitter, which was picked up by Occupy Democrats on Facebook:  Made in China?! Say it ain’t so, Donald. Hold onto your plastic snap enclosure. It’s not true. The hat that launched a barrage of snarky social media posts after its July debut at a Texas campaign event has also launched a host of imitations. ""The image you shared is not an official campaign product,"" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PunditFact  in an email. ""All product for sale on DonaldJTrump.com is made in the USA."" Hicks confirmed a couple of other facts about the authentic Trump campaign hat, sold for $25-$30 in patriotic and camouflage shades at the campaign store. The hats are made by Cali Fame of Los Angeles, which makes the Cali Headwear brand. Trump’s hat is based on the Patriot 5 model, and no surprise, it’s been a bestseller this year, though not a bestseller of all time. Cali Headwear co-owner Brian Kennedy told us that hats his company made for Von Dutch and Ed Hardy sold better. Oh, and they are made in the USA. Kennedy’s company, which his family has owned since 1977, has been making this style since the 1970s. Trump has been wearing it and selling it on his golf courses for years, but it’s been big with the hipster market since the summer (well, so has the ""dad hat,"" he said). ""It’s just the same old story that what goes around comes around,"" Kennedy told us by phone from inside his factory, machines whirring in the background. ""But there’s news every day on the hat,"" he added. From there, the hats are distributed by Ace Specialties LLC, a Lafayette, La., company that normally deals with gear for the oil and gas industry. Ace Specialties president and owner Christl Mahfouz said she had seen a similar meme on Facebook, ""and that’s not even his hat."" ""Definitely everything on our side is made in the USA,"" said Mahfouz, who is also on the board of the Eric Trump Foundation, the philanthropy started by one of Trump’s sons for children with terminal illness. A few years back, before he entered politics as a candidate, there was more truth to claims that Trump gear was not made in America. Former Late Show host David Letterman brought out a number of buttoned shirts and slick ties from the Trump brand clothing line for Macy’s (which dumped him after his fiery statements about Mexicans in July) in a 2011 interview. Letterman pointed out that his ties and shirts were made in China, according to the label. At the time, Trump was supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president and had been accusing China of taking American manufacturing jobs. Trump smirked as the crowd cheered before he defended himself, saying ""it’s very hard to get product that’s not made in China"" because of the country’s currency manipulation. Our ruling Tweets aim to paint Trump as a hypocrite for hawking ""Make America Great Again"" hats with ""Made in China"" labels from his campaign store. Those hats are knockoffs. Trump has even trademarked the phrase ""Make America Great Again."" Trump’s hats are made by a California company that says they are, indeed, American made.

Trump supports eminent domain 'abuse,' says conservative Club for Growth
","Slinging any pebbles they can find at the larger-than-life Donald Trump, some Republicans are taking the real estate mogul to task over his support for a legal concept called eminent domain. Eminent domain is the government’s power to seize private property in order to make way for public development projects, such as highways or schools. Some conservatives oppose eminent domain because they see it as a breach of property rights. A recent ad by Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, attacks Trump for his support of the practice and a related 2005 Supreme Court decision. ""The Supreme Court’s Kelo decision gave the government massive new power to take private property and give it to corporations,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Conservatives have fought this disaster. What’s Donald Trump say about the decision?"" The narration cuts to audio of Trump giving an interview to Fox News. ""I happen to agree with it 100 percent,"" Trump said. The narration picks back up: ""Trump supports eminent domain abuse because he can make millions while we lose our property rights."" Is Trump an eminent domain supporter, and does he agree with the Kelo vs. New London, Conn. decision that many conservatives deride? Club for Growth described it as ""eminent domain abuse"" -- but whether the practice counts as abuse is a matter of opinion. Trump and Kelo The 2005 Kelo case concerned the government of New London, Conn., which wanted to seize several privately owned homes in order to open up the area for a major commercial development project intended to revitalize the struggling city. Several residents who didn’t want to lose their homes, including a nurse named Susette Kelo, sued and argued that this proposal went beyond the government’s eminent domain powers. In a liberal majority 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court found in New London’s favor. While eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a public -- as in government-run -- work, this decision said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The idea was that the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area. At the time, Trump said he agreed with the decision, even though it was controversial. We found the July 19, 2005, transcript of the interview quoted in Club for Growth’s ad. Here’s an excerpt of the conversation between Trump and Fox’s Neil Cavuto: Cavuto: ""What did you think of that decision? Was the court overdoing it with that decision?"" Trump: ""Well, it's sort of not a good one for me to say, because I noticed every article written about it said, ‘Will Donald Trump take over your home?’ sort of using me as the example, Neil. And it's sort of -- it's an interesting situation to be in. ""But I happen to agree with it 100 percent, not that I would want to use it. But the fact is, if you have a person living in an area that's not even necessarily a good area, and government, whether it's local or whatever, government wants to build a tremendous economic development, where a lot of people are going to be put to work and make an area that's not good into a good area, and move the person that's living there into a better place -- now, I know it might not be their choice -- but move the person to a better place and yet create thousands upon thousands of jobs and beautification and lots of other things, I think it happens to be good."" As Trump acknowledges, he is somewhat of a poster boy for the pitfalls of eminent domain because of a high-profile case involving his property. In the late 1990s, Trump wanted to build a limousine garage to service one of his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., but several pieces of private property were in the way -- including a home owned by a woman named Vera Coking. When Coking refused to give her property up for Trump, New Jersey’s casino reinvestment authority tried to seize the house instead. The dispute ended up in front of a New Jersey court, which ruled against Trump and the government. Media regularly cited the case as an example of failed eminent domain during coverage of the Kelo case a few years later. So Trump supported eminent domain back in the mid 2000s, but what does he think of it now? His current views It appears Trump holds the same position as he did back then. On Oct. 6, 2015, Fox’s Bret Baier asked Trump, ""What do you think of eminent domain?"" ""I think eminent domain is wonderful,"" Trump responded, adding that as a builder, he knows ""better than anybody"" how frustrating it can be when you’re building a project, and one property holds out and refuses to sell. ""And you need a house in a certain location because you're going to build this massive development that's going to employ thousands of people. Or you're going to build a factory that without this little house, you can't build the factory,"" he said. ""I think eminent domain is fine."" Baier pushed Trump specifically on whether he still supports the Kelo decision. Trump did not respond directly to that question, though he reinforced his support for eminent domain in general and acknowledged that his position differs from that of many conservatives. ""I think it's a great subject -- it's a very interesting subject,"" Trump said. ""I fully understand the conservative approach, but I don't think it was explained to most conservatives."" Our ruling Club for Growth said ""Trump supports eminent domain"" and the Supreme Court’s Kelo decision. As recently as this week Trump has expressed support for eminent domain, and he has in the past said he agrees with the Kelo decision, which expanded the power, ""100 percent.""

Planned Parenthood has been found to 'illegally sell baby parts,' activist says
","An Orlando-based conservative Christian group has called on Gov. Rick Scott to choke off all forms of state funding for Planned Parenthood, saying the organization has broken the law and doesn’t deserve taxpayer money. In a letter dated Sept. 22, 2015, Florida Family Policy Council President John Stemberger thanked Scott for investigating state Planned Parenthood affiliates after videos showing officials discussing fetal tissue were released by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress this summer. But Stemberger wanted Scott to go further. Stemberger said because of what the videos show, the group should not get money through the state’s Medicaid program and Title X, a federal grant program for family planning and preventive health services. ""No organization with a record of illegal activity and abuse, now found to also illegally sell baby parts and likely altering abortion practices to do so, should receive taxpayer dollars,"" Stemberger wrote. (GOP presidential candidate and former Gov. Jeb Bush ended direct state subsidies for the group in 2001.) Planned Parenthood has been subject to hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives because of the videos, but has it been proven the organization broke the law with their fetal tissue donations? The short answer is no, but there’s no shortage of accusations. State investigation To get up to speed, part of a Center for Medical Progress video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling undercover activists that fetal tissue can be obtained for fees in the $30 to $100 range. Activists against abortion rights say this is proof the group has a history of trying to ""illegally sell baby parts,"" as Stemberger’s letter said. Many critics have argued Planned Parenthood has broken the law. But there has been no legal ruling against the group. The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 allows a woman to consent to donating fetal tissue after an abortion. This tissue then can be donated to researchers, but allows providers to charge vaguely defined ""reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue."" Planned Parenthood said discussions of payments were only about recouping costs, not making a profit. Experts largely agree that the fees Nucatola describes are within the scope of the law. The videos led to several congressional hearings on how Planned Parenthood uses federal funding. Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated nonprofit organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Funding comes from a wide range of sources, including private donations, grants, health center revenue and Medicaid. State and federal money cannot be used for abortion services. Scott ordered the investigation into 16 Planned Parenthood health centers that provide abortion services and are operated by Florida’s two affiliated chapters. None of the state locations participate in a fetal tissue donation program. The state Agency for Health Care Administration, which ensures health centers comply with state guidelines, cited three clinics for allegedly providing second-trimester abortions without a license, violations Planned Parenthood has denied. A fourth was cited for improper recordkeeping. (Planned Parenthood has sued Florida over the investigation.) None were cited for how they handled fetal tissue. Other allegations Stemberger’s letter makes reference to the result of the Florida investigation, and also mentions a 2008 incident in which Planned Parenthood ended its affiliation with four clinics in Broward County and one in Boca Raton. The chapter running those clinics, formerly known as Planned Parenthood of South Palm Beach and Broward Counties, was mired in harassment complaints and the possible misuse of nearly $450,000, which was just less than the $500,000 it received in taxpayer funding. Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates Executive Director Laura Goodhue said the organization ended its affiliation with that chapter over the mismanagement. The Alliance Defending Freedom, another conservative Christian group that Stemberger said does legal research for the Florida Family Policy Council, included this incident in a report on potential fraud. It’s the only mention of Florida in the report. But Stemberger’s letter goes on to say, ""This is merely a short list of the abuses committed by Planned Parenthood in Florida, not including its stunning failure to report sexual abuse of minors, waste, abuse, and potential fraud of taxpayer dollars."" Stemberger told PolitiFact Florida that he was referring in part to accusations that clinics in other states had failed to report sexual abuse. Alliance Defending Freedom tracks abuse accusations in Arizona, Colorado, Ohio and other places. Accusations of not reporting sexual abuse also are a subject of sting videos by another group called Live Action. Planned Parenthood maintains its policy is to report all suspected instances of sexual abuse. While we found no concrete evidence of similar accusations in Florida, Stemberger said Planned Parenthood as a whole was still culpable. ""If none of these violations occurred in Florida, it still holds true,"" he said. ""There’s a commonality of practice here that ties the two together."" Both Scott’s office and Planned Parenthood have disagreed with Stemberger’s assertion that the governor could end state funding through Medicaid and Title X, saying it would be a violation of federal law. The state said about $45,000 in matching funds goes to Planned Parenthood through Medicaid, and three clinics have contracts for newborn health screening and other services. The clinics have to comply with state and federal laws. Stemberger maintained funding can be pulled if Planned Parenthood no longer qualifies as a provider. Scott’s response to Stemberger’s letter reiterated his disdain for Planned Parenthood, but didn’t offer more detail. ""We took aggressive, immediate action to investigate Planned Parenthood offices in Florida when the horrific videos were released,"" Scott said in a statement in response to the letter. ""When we found that some of their facilities were not complying with state law, we held them accountable."" As for Stemberger’s assertion of other wrongdoing, Goodhue said she didn’t have records of any other investigations besides inquiries this summer. ""We’re heavily regulated. AHCA can investigate us at any time,"" she said. Our ruling Stemberger said Planned Parenthood has ""now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts."" Videos from the Center for Medical Progress have led to lots of debate among activists and politicians, but federal law allows for fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating those donations. At any rate, the Florida affiliates are not participating in these types of transactions. Stemberger’s letter makes it sound as if Planned Parenthood had been proven guilty of a crime, which is not accurate. He also made a host of other accusations against the Florida organization for which we can’t find evidence. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/07/john-stemberger/planned-parenthood-has-been-found-illegally-sell-b/

Wisconsin couldn't fire state employee for watching hours of pornography at work, Scott Walker says
","When Gov. Scott Walker announced his support of a proposed overhaul of Wisconsin’s civil service system, he cited several examples of state worker misdeeds that he said help prove the need for reform. In comments to reporters the next day, Sept. 25, 2015, he repeated one of the examples, saying: ""In one of our state agencies, where an employee on average was spending more than four hours a day watching pornographic things on their website. That's something that, even though the agency wanted to terminate that person, the employment commission reinstated the person."" The porn-watching employee did get his job back -- but because of the decision of a private arbitrator, not a state commission. Department of Corrections case Here’s how the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in January 2006 about the case of Robert DeLeon, a state probation and parole agent from Shawano: DeLeon was fired in 2004 for accessing Internet pornography and other inappropriate sites for hours a day over a period of at least five months. A computer technician at the Department of Corrections found that DeLeon was logging on to the Internet during the work day for long periods and visiting inappropriate sites, including some with pornography. Computer logs showed DeLeon had spent an average of 4.2 hours a day on the Web in the fall of 2004. During the time he was viewing pornography at work, he had been being paid for more than 10 hours of overtime a week. DeLeon maintained that the logs did not accurately reflect his behavior at work because much of the time he minimized the windows on his computer screen while he worked. DeLeon’s union appealed the termination, which put the case before attorney A. Henry Hempe, a Madison arbitrator. In November 2005, Hempe ruled that instead of being fired, DeLeon should have received a one-day suspension. Part of Hempe’s rationale was that the Department of Corrections had a ""relatively light discipline for first-offense misuse of state computers."" He cited 10 other recent cases in which corrections employees viewed pornography on state computers, in some cases repeatedly, and none of those employees was fired. Hempe also said DeLeon had a previously unblemished personnel record and had not fallen behind on his work. DeLeon was reinstated to his job and ordered not to use the Internet. The arbitrator also ordered he receive $45,000 in back pay. The state could not appeal the arbitrator’s ruling. Walker has said one reason the civil service system should be overhauled is to enable the state to fire such employees. One change that would be made by the bill, which is expected to pass, would better define the ""just cause"" definition of fireable offense such as stealing from the state or showing up to work drunk. (The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s state employees database shows DeLeon still works as a probation and parole agent in Shawano, earning nearly $53,000 per year.) We checked with Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission chairman James Scott on this case and for an update on how such cases are handled. Scott told us that at the time of the DeLeon case, collective bargaining agreements controlled how cases such as an appeal of a termination were handled. The cases were heard not by the state commission, but by a private arbitrator who was chosen jointly by the employee’s union and the state department that was involved. The arbitrator's decision on a termination was final, and neither party could take the case to court. Since Act 10, Walker’s 2011 collective bargaining reform law, there are no union contracts in place for state employees that permit arbitration of disputes -- other than for the State Patrol, as public safety employees are excluded from the law. State employees covered by Act 10 who want to challenge a termination or other discipline can file a grievance and can appeal that result to the state commission, Scott said. Our rating Walker said a state agency wanted to fire an employee who spent four hours per day watching pornography, but the state ""employment commission reinstated the person."" The Department of Corrections in 2005 did terminate a state probation and parole agent who had been watching pornography on his computer for hours a day. The employee was given his job back not by a state commission, but by a private arbitrator, who was chosen jointly by the department and the employee’s union per a collective bargaining contract. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True. . More on public employees State Sen. Jon Erpenbach says Scott Walker ""said he wouldn't touch"" the state civil service system but now supports overhauling it. Mostly False. Mayor Tom Barrett says every general City of Milwaukee employee ""pays toward his or her pension, but approximately 88 percent of our police officers and firefighters do not."" Mostly True. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga says the University of Wisconsin System  ""is larger than any business in the state of Wisconsin.""

Pope, Creflo Dollar and their rides
","The image that showed up the PolitiFact Georgia inbox had already pinged wildly around social media. The top part showed the Pope waving from the back seat of the small four-door Fiat 500L. Below it was a photo of a driver purported to be College Park megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar, tooling in a shiny silver roadster with an EU license plate. The reader wondered, could that actually be the lead pastor of World Changers Church International behind those sunglasses, zipping along somewhere in Europe? We wondered too, and decided to do some digging. Breaking down the rides That the top part of the meme was accurate was clear from news coverage, and the social media response, during Pope Francis’ recent visit to the United States. The Pope made news for what he said but also for his use of the Italian-made subcompact car. News reports said Vatican police, not the Holy See, selected the car, which has a starting list price of $19,935. But they did so on Francis’ specific request of modesty and simplicity for his ride. Determining who was behind the wheel in the roadster proved more of a challenge. Dollar is a recognizable face who has made his own headlines, most recently from a fundraising video to help his ministry buy a $65 million Gulfstream G650 luxury jet. Though the church removed the video after a backlash, the church’s board of directors later said it still intended to replace Dollar’s jet with the Holy Grail of luxury jets. ""We plan to acquire a Gulfstream G650 because it is the best, and it is a reflection of the level of excellence at which this organization chooses to operate,"" the directors said in a prepared statement. So, the idea of Dollar photographed in a sports car didn’t seem all that outlandish. But with the shades covering much of the driver’s face, it was hard to tell just who was behind the wheel. Focusing on the car, though, brought the navigator into much clearer view. We sent the image to Jim Donnelly and Tom Comerro, the senior editor and editorial assistant, respectively at Hemmings Motor News. The official word from the bible for car collectors: the silver roadster is a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Stirling Moss edition. Only 75 of the vehicles were produced, with a starting list price in 2009 of 750,000 Euros, or north of $1 million for a supercharged ride that could reach 217 miles per hour with no windshield. Searching for who has access to that ride led us to a similar picture, of a different angle and a driver with the sunglasses off. That’s not a reverend driving the $1 million car. The driver is rapper Kanye West, whose nickname Yeezus is a clear play on the name for the son of God, arriving at a gala in Cannes, France. (You can see a more clear photo of Kanye as the driver here). Modesty and prosperity Simply put, the image itself is flat-out wrong. And what about the context of those 1,000 words the picture is trying to say? Much has been made of the ""simplicity"" sought by Pope Francis ever since he took a vow of poverty as a Jesuit priest. He took the subway as a cardinal in Argentina and news reports say he humbles himself in either a Ford Focus or a 1984 Renault when getting around the Vatican. Dollar, meanwhile, is well-known for preaching the ""prosperity gospel,"" which says that God wants all believers to do well in all aspects of their lives, including finances. Dollar listed two Rolls Royces – one paid for by his congregation and another by members of his ministerial association of those pastors he has trained – in a 2007 congressional inquiry into the tax-exempt status of a handful of such megachurches. World Changers spokesman Vic Bolton said Dollar no longer uses those $250,000 automobiles and instead drivers a regular Mercedes Benz S-Class sedan (which new lists for $96,000) that’s about 8-10 years old (in the $65,000 range). ""It’s a nice car, but it’s no Aston Martin,"" Bolton said. ""I don’t think he drives a Mercedes to send a message. He drives a nice car because that’s what he wants. True prosperity is having options."" The same could be said about Pope Francis. The Catholic Church, too, is mum about its wealth. But a 2014 report found hundreds of millions of Euros tucked away, off the official church balance sheet. And the Vatican bank manages $7.3 billion in assets and keeps $20 million in gold reserves in the U.S. Federal Reserve. That is enough to buy and sell more than a few of those fancy roadsters. So the real difference – beyond the scale of wealth – is between the ideologies of those Christian faiths, said Kate Bowler, a professor of American Christianity at Duke Divinity School in North Carolina. The Catholic Church is heavily collective, with a focus on the church’s responsibility as a group. In the prosperity gospel, responsibility falls entirely to the right-believing individual. Often, the proof of that belief shows up in flashy cars or extravagant churches, such as the 8,500-seat World Changers dome that has become a landmark in College Park. But Bowler said the faith encourages family connections and community connections as truly prosperous, as well as focusing on sharing the gospel so that others may find that success. ""It doesn’t really matter if it’s not true,"" Bowler said of the meme, ""because it does capture the essence of a faith that requires proof of wealth to be true."" That means Kanye West being confused for Creflo Dollar adds to, not diminishes, his message, she added. ""I don’t think Creflo would mind at all,"" she said. ""He’s a victor and that language of triumph and the wealthy car demonstrates to believers that God is with them."" Our ruling A viral image making its way around social media purports to show Pope Francis getting around town in a small compact sedan, while Georgia’s megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar zips along in a stylish two-seater sports car. The roadster driver is actually rapper Kanye West, making the image clearly false. Even the context – trying to draw distinction between a supposedly humble servant of God with an apparently audacious one – ignores that both the Pope and Dollar have ready access to lavish luxuries.

Barack Obama says deficit is now below its 40-year average
","During an Oct. 2 press conference dominated by discussion of a mass shooting in Oregon and the ongoing civil war in Syria, President Barack Obama took time out for a victory lap on the federal budget. ""I want to repeat this because the public apparently never believes it,"" Obama said. ""Since I took office, we’ve cut our deficits by two-thirds. The deficit has not been going up; it has been coming down -- precipitously. We’ve cut our deficits by two-thirds. They’re below the average deficits over the past 40 years."" We have previously rated Obama’s claim that ""we've cut the deficit by two-thirds"" as Mostly True. But we hadn’t heard the other claim -- that today, the deficit is ""below the average deficits over the past 40 years."" So we took a closer look. Economists tend to make long-term comparisons using a measurement of the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. (The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the overall size of the U.S. economy.) Looking at the deficit as a percentage of GDP takes account of the economy’s dramatic growth since 1975. A larger economy can sustain a larger budget, and thus a larger deficit. Using that yardstick, Obama’s claim is on target. We calculated the current deficit as a percentage of GDP by dividing the Congressional Budget Office’s $426 billion deficit estimate (which was released in September) by the nearly $18 trillion estimate for GDP in 2015 (which was released in August). That works out to a deficit that’s 2.4 percent of GDP. So how does that figure compare? We looked at historical data for the deficit as a percentage of GDP going back to 1975, as published by the Office of Management and Budget. When we averaged those annual percentages, the average worked out to be a little under 3.2 percent. That would make Obama’s claim correct. Indeed, the percentage has fallen from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 2.4 percent today. This may be easier to visualize through the graph below. The blue line shows the deficit as a percentage of GDP, year by year, for the last 40 years, with the red line denoting the 40-year average. Though the percentage has been quite a bit above-average for most of Obama’s tenure, it has fallen significantly and has now fallen below the 40-year average, at least based on current-year estimates.  And even if you keep unusually high percentages during the Obama years out of the calculation and limit the comparison to 1975 to 2008, the current level (a deficit that’s 2.4 percent of GDP) is still slightly lower than the average going back to 1975 (2.5 percent). In our previous fact-checks of Obama’s claims on the deficit, we’ve noted that Obama has glossed over the long-term outlook, which is not as rosy. Programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will become increasingly expensive as the Baby Boom generation ages. This can be seen in the following graph from the Congressional Budget Office. Over the next decade, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is set to push closer and closer to 4 percent, which is above the average level for the past 40 years. (In this graph, deficit percentage figures are shown as negative, rather than as positive in the graph above.)  Our ruling Obama said today’s deficit is ""below the average deficits over the past 40 years."" He’s correct when measuring the deficit as a percentage of GDP, which is the yardstick most economists tend to use when making deficit comparisons over long periods of time. Still, Obama didn’t specify that he was talking about deficits as a percentage of GDP, and the comparison’s accuracy depends on the absence of major budgetary and economic changes between now and time the fiscal 2015 data are finalized. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-deficit-now-below-its-40-year-av/

Obama: More gun laws means fewer gun deaths
","In the wake of a Oct. 1 shooting spree in Oregon that killed 10, many -- including President Barack Obama -- are calling for more gun control laws. ""There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America,"" Obama said in remarks the day of the shooting. ""So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens, and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence."" There is plenty of debate over the effectiveness of gun control laws, so we decided to dig into Obama’s sweeping claim: that ""states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths."" We ran this claim past several experts and found that the statistic generally holds up, but the implications are less clear. Cause and effect The meat of the claim comes from a 2015 National Journal investigation, which concluded that ""the states with the most gun laws see the fewest gun-related deaths."" The report considered seven types of gun control: handgun permits, background checks, handgun registries, ""stand your ground"" laws, concealed carry permits, open carry permits and gun purchase waiting period. It found that states that had generally more restrictive laws within these categories generally had fewer annual gun deaths. Here’s a chart by National Journal showing the states with the fewest and most gun deaths per 100,000 people, compared to each state’s’ gun laws (more blue = more restrictive laws). You should look at the chart that shows all 50 states.  There are some limitations to this kind of research, notably that they do not determine cause-and-effect: whether a state has fewer gun deaths because of the law, said Adam Winkler, a University of California Los Angeles law professor and second amendment expert. Other demographic characteristics -- such as education level, marital stability, rural or urban -- might explain the fewer gun deaths in a particular state. Setting that caveat aside, Winkler said Obama’s statement is true. There are also a couple of outliers to National Journal’s report. For example, New Hampshire has some of the least restrictive gun laws but also the seventh-lowest gun death rate. An academic study published by the American Medical Association in 2013 found similar results: ""A higher number of firearm laws in a state was associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state."" In a commentary on the 2013 study, Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, pointed out that the correlation between restrictive laws and fewer deaths ""essentially disappeared"" when firearm ownership rates were taken into account. ""Perhaps these laws decrease mortality by decreasing firearm ownership, in which case firearm ownership mediates the association,"" Wintemute wrote. ""But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low — there will be less opposition to them — and firearm ownership confounds the association."" While wary of making such a general claim, Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said Obama’s claim is generally accurate. In many states, individual gun laws have shown to be associated with fewer gun-related deaths. He linked us to some of his own research showing, for example, a reduction in murders committed with firearms followed a handgun purchase permit law in Connecticut. In contrast, the repeal of a permit law in Missouri preceded a rise in firearm-caused murders. We looked for evidence to contradict Obama’s statement, and found several complaints from those who favor gun rights. James Agresti, a gun control expert for the conservative-leaning think tank Just Facts, wrote in an email to reporters that statements like Obama’s are ""meaningless"" and ""subjective and ill-defined,"" linking to a Just Facts article that said classification systems that evaluate gun laws state-by-state can be ""haphazard."" Agresti added that the claim ignores the number of lives saved by defensive gun use, and the fact that some states with highest gun-ownership rates also have low homicide rates. Overall, though, we found nothing that offered an outright contradiction to the National Journal analysis. States with laws that restrict guns do tend to have lower death rates, as Obama said. Suicide vs. homicide A notable critique of Obama’s claim is that these gun deaths include suicides -- which account for more than half of all gun deaths -- and Obama was delivering remarks in the context of how to prevent future mass shootings. While research does show that gun laws correlate with fewer firearm-caused suicides, there’s not universal agreement on the effect of gun laws on murders. In his commentary on the 2013 study, Wintemute noted that the vast majority of the observed decrease in gun deaths were suicides. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did a calculation of their own and found that when suicides are taken out of the picture, there’s not as clear a correlation between more gun laws and fewer non-suicide gun deaths. (They rated Obama’s statement as two out of four Pinocchios.) Obama’s use of this factoid is deceptive because he was selling gun control as a way to stymie murders, not suicide by gun, said David Kopel, a gun rights advocate and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver. He likened it to a car salesman telling a family a car is ""safe, according to government studies."" The family takes this to mean the car will protect them in an accident, but the salesman was actually referring to the fact that studies have found the car to be safe for the environment. Experts do, though, see reason to believe that stronger gun laws will reduce homicides, as well, even if the research isn’t conclusive yet. One survey of about 150 researchers actively publishing work on guns found that 71 percent believe that strong gun laws reduce the number of homicides, compared with12 percent who disagree. While there are always exceptions, ""the research on the whole shows that if you make it more difficult for individuals -- especially individuals with a criminal background -- to obtain firearms you will prevent some gun-related criminal offenses,"" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida who studies homicide and violent crime. Our ruling Obama said, ""States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths."" Research shows that the more gun laws a state has, the fewer gun deaths there are. Obama gets some wiggle room because he said ""tend to"" as opposed to making a definitive statement. The problem is, however, that this is an overly general statement. The research doesn’t prove a universal cause-and-effect relationship between gun laws and fewer gun deaths; it might just be a correlation. Some laws are more effective than others, and other cultural, demographic or socioeconomic factors might be the driving force behind the number of gun deaths in different states. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

Dan Patrick says all crime, in estimate, committed by about 15 percent of population
","Urging a positive view of law officers ""that you and your family depend on every day,"" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went on to say the vast majority of citizens are law-abiding. He put precise numbers on that. ""You know,""  Patrick said during a Sept. 2, 2015, interview with David Brown of the Texas Standard, a statewide news affairs program based at KUT, the NPR affiliate in Austin, ""100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population."" (We have regularly talked about our fact checks on the program.) A curious listener emailed us. Could Patrick's 100/15 statement be so? Patrick’s backup Asked how Patrick reached his figures, his spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by email that Patrick ""uses 15% as the number of citizens that commit 100% of crime as an indicator of the number of criminals in the total population to make the point that most citizens are law-abiding. That is higher than statistics would indicate,"" Garcia said, writing that according to law enforcement data, ""we have approximately 2.2 million people in jail in America and another 5 million on probation and parole. That is roughly 2.5% of the total population that has been convicted of a crime including non-violent drug offenses."" Garcia declined to elaborate on how that 2.5 percent justified Patrick’s 15 percent figure. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, part of the Justice Department, said in a December 2014 report that in 2013, 2.2 million people were incarcerated and more than 4.7 million people were under community supervision (on probation or parole). The report further says those counts (which roll in some people not convicted of crimes) equate to 2,830 people per 100,000 U.S. adults, meaning 2.8 percent of U.S. adults were under correctional supervision. That ratio was the lowest since at least 2005, when there were 3,160 people per 100,000 U.S. adults in the ""correctional population,"" the report said. A pair of criminologists told us the numbers offered by Patrick didn’t make a case for the unfamiliar 100/15 formulation. ""Gibberish,"" Candace McCoy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, commented by email, elaborating that the attempt to account for U.S. residents behind bars doesn’t necessarily support what Patrick declared on the air. ""I don't know how the two statistics supposedly relate to each other, if at all,"" McCoy said. Robert Brame, a University of South Carolina professor who has led research into young Americans arrested for non-traffic offenses, said by phone he didn’t see how the backup offered by Patrick ""addresses the fraction of the population that’s responsible for the crime problem in the United States.That’s not clear to me."" Broadly, Brame and other criminologists we reached said they weren’t aware of a factual way to get to an accurate statement that ‘x’ percent of the population commits all the crime. But there have been studies suggesting a subset of residents commit about half of crimes. Alex Piquero, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Dallas, said by email: ""A routine finding in the criminological literature is that about half of the crime is committed by a very small fraction of the population, around 5-8 percent depending on the sample and methodology used. This finding has been replicated in many different studies around the world. The bottom line is that a small fraction of the offending population is responsible for a great majority of crime."" Piquero said most of the studies tracked residents only into late adolescence or early adulthood. The Philadelphia studies and others Since the 1960s, researchers have probed how often youths come into police contact, consistently finding that a subset of people account for around half of the crimes reported to police. In the seminal ""Crime in a Birth Cohort"" and a followup study, a team led by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Marvin Wolfgang tracked nearly 10,000 boys born in 1945 and living in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17; they ultimately gauged how often each boy came in contact with police for an offense. One upshot: 627 boys, 6 percent of the group, each accounted for five or more offenses, according to police reports. Those boys, Wolfgang wrote, were collectively identified as responsible for 52 percent of all the offenses recorded in the study and, he said, about two-thirds of all violent crimes believed to have been committed by the juveniles. In Patrick-speak, Wolfgang found that 6 percent of juvenile boys accounted for about half of alleged juvenile crimes. The follow-up study, presented in progress in 1982, tracked more than 28,000 boys and girls born in 1958 who lived in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17. Among males, the study found, 61 percent of reported  offenses  were committed by 1,030 ""chronic recidivists,"" comprising 7 percent of males in the study. That is, 7 percent of the boys accounted for 61 percent of the juvenile offenses. David Farrington, a University of Cambridge professor of psychological criminology reported in 2006 on criminal offenses by 411 South London boys occasionally interviewed by the team starting when the subjects were 8 years old in 1961. The researchers, who also checked criminal records, found that a ""small proportion of the study males (7%) were defined as ‘chronic offenders’ because they accounted for about half of all officially recorded offenses"" in the study. The most common offenses, they wrote, included thefts, burglaries and car thefts followed by violence, vandalism, fraud and drug abuse. In 2014, Swedish researchers drawing on records accounting for the experiences of 2.5 million people born in that country from 1958 to 1980 reported that from 1973 to 2004, some 1 percent of the population accounted for 63 percent of all violent crime convictions. Researcher  Örjan Falk added: ""Psychotic disorders are twice as common among repeat offenders as in the general population, but despite this fact they constitute a very small proportion of the repeat offenders."" In the United States, Brame in 2011 reported that based on interviews of a representative sample of residents aged 12 to 16 at the end of 1996, some 25 percent to 41 percent of participants had been arrested by the time they turned 23. Brame told us a widely quoted takeaway from the study was that by age 23, around 1 in 3 of people in that age group would have been arrested for a non-traffic offense at least once. Then again, it’s not a good idea, Brame told us, to assume the same figure would apply to young residents nowadays because teen crime and arrest rates were higher in the mid-1990s. Brame said another vital consideration in mulling how much of the population is responsible for all crime is that many crimes go unreported to police. In 2014, according to the 2014 National Crime Victimization Survey, only 37 percent of U.S. property victimizations and only 46 percent of violent victimizations were reported to police. To our inquiry, William Kelly, director of the University of Texas Center for Criminology and Criminal Justice Research, noted that according to the U.S. Sentencing Project, as many as 100 million U.S. residents, which in 2014 would have been equal to 41 percent of the adult population, had a criminal conviction. Our ruling Patrick said: ""100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population."" Sure, not all of us commit crimes, a point that’s patently obvious. When it comes to the specifics of this ""15 percent"" declaration, however, we found nothing to back it up — including the statistics offered by Patrick’s office.

Nicholas Kristof: Gun deaths more numerous for preschoolers than police
","The Oregon shootings raise the question of what can be done to reduce the frequency of gun violence. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argued in favor of smaller steps that might enjoy public support, such as requiring safe storage at home and a 10-year ban for anyone convicted of domestic violence or assault. Kristof said the country would do well to tackle this problem as a matter of public health. To drive home that point, he made a grim comparison. ""In America, more preschoolers are shot dead each year (82 in 2013) than police officers are in the line of duty (27 in 2013), according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI,"" Kristof wrote in an Oct. 3, 2015 op-ed. A reader asked us to see if that was accurate. We found that it was, and for more years than the one he cited. We also stress-tested his comparison by defining preschoolers more narrowly than he did and for the most part, the comparison still holds up. The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks the deaths of law enforcement officers, whether they serve in the smallest sheriff’s department or a large federal agency. In 2013, 26 officers died in shootings. (Kristof was off by one because he included a non-shooting death.) Counting the deaths of preschoolers is a bit more complicated. You have to decide the age range that defines a preschooler, and whether to include both accidental and intentional killings. We learned from Kristof that he took preschoolers to mean every child from a newborn to 4-years-old, and he included gun deaths under all circumstances. Since public health routinely focuses on accidents, that is consistent with Kristof’s approach and gun violence normally includes homicide. Kristof said he picked his age group based on the definition used by the U.S. Education Department. The agency’s guide to Title 1 services (aid for lower income children) leaves the range rather open-ended. It says ""For the purpose of Title I, children from birth to the age that the LEA (Local Education Agency) provides a free public elementary education may receive preschool services."" Some school districts might take children at age 5, in others, it might be 6. Kristof’s 0 to 4 seems defensible. However, we also found that the CDC often considers preschoolers to be children from the ages of 3 to 5. We used both age groups when we pulled death statistics from the CDC’s WISQAR fatal injury database. This table using FBI and CDC data shows the results.  For the age range Kristof used, firearm deaths of preschoolers exceeded those of law enforcement officers in every year back to 2008. For the more restricted CDC age range, his statement held up in four out of the past six years.  Our ruling Kristof said that more preschoolers are shot dead each year than are on-duty police officers. For children aged 0-4, that is accurate for the past six years. For children aged 3-5, the statement is true in most years, but not in every year.

Jeremy Bird says 90 percent of Americans want mandatory background checks for all gun purchases
","An adviser to a group focused on turning Texas Democratic-blue suggested after the fatal shootings in Oregon that there’s a huge consensus nationally in favor of mandating a background check before any gun purchase. Jeremy Bird, a Chicago-based senior adviser to Battleground Texas, said in an Oct. 2, 2015, tweet: ""90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes. 9-0. Won't solve whole problem but is a start."" He posted that comment the day after a man opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., killing nine. According to news accounts, authorities subsequently collected 14 guns owned by the man, who killed himself at the scene. Hours before Bird tweeted, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Celinez Nunez said at a news conference that all of the weapons were purchased legally, seven of them by the shooter or his family members in the last three years. And was Bird right about sweeping support for universal background checks? A previous ‘True’ Bird’s claim rang a bell. In April 2013, we found True a claim by Lee Leffingwell, then Austin’s mayor, that 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members supported background checks of gun purchasers. Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 supported both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell’s comment indicated support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent. Currently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. But President Barack Obama and others have called for requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales. In 2013, the National Rifle Association suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals. A January 2013 Pew Research Center poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points. Several 2015 polls By email to our inquiry about Bird’s statement, Pew spokesman Brian Mahl pointed out a center survey of 2,002 adults taken from July 14-20, 2015, that found (again) 85 percent of respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks. Pew said in its August 2015 results summary: ""While there is broad support for several specific gun policy proposals – and opinion on these measures has not changed significantly since 2013 – the public continues to be more evenly divided in fundamental attitudes about whether it is more important to control gun ownership or to protect the right of Americans to own guns. Currently, 50% say it is more important to control gun ownership, while 47% say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns."" Our own web search turned up a survey of 1,326 adults, intended to be a representative national sample, taken Jan. 2-16, 2015 by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Some 84 percent of respondents favored requiring background checks for all gun sales, compared to 89 percent in a similar survey taken two years before, a ""slight erosion,"" the authors wrote. We noted before a January 2013 CBS/New York Times poll indicating 92 percent of all the respondents at that time favoring background checks for all potential gun buyers. The poll had an overall margin of error of three percentage points. A more recent CBS News poll, taken of 1,047 registered voters July 29-Aug. 2, 2015,  showed 88 percent of respondents favoring background checks for all gun purchases including, CBS News said, ""large majorities of Republicans (81 percent), Democrats (93 percent), and independents (89 percent)."" Quinnipiac University polls National voter surveys by Quinnipiac University continue to show widespread support for universal background checks. We noted in our Leffingwell check that a national Quinnipiac University survey of 772 registered voters, taken Jan. 30 through Feb. 4, 2013, found 92 percent supporting background checks for all gun buyers. That survey had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. A subsequent Quinnipiac University survey, taken of 1,944 registered voters from Feb. 27, 2013 through March 4, 2013, found 88 percent in favor of background checks for all gun buyers. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. By email, Battleground Texas replied to our inquiry by pointing out a news story in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, stating that a June 2014 Quinnipiac University poll found 92 percent of surveyed voters in favor of universal background checks for gun purchases. The survey reached 1,446 registered voters from June 24-30, 2014 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. More recently, a Quinnipiac University survey of 1,574 registered voters, taken Sept. 17-21, 2015, found 93 percent of respondents in favor of requiring background checks for all gun buyers. Similarly, 93 percent of respondents with a legally acquired gun in the household indicated support for such checks. The poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. Quinnipiac University Survey (Sept. 17-21, 2015)  SOURCE: Press release,  ""Don't Shut Down Government, U.S. Voters Say 3-1, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Voters Oppose Admitting Syrian Refugees,"" Quinnipiac University Poll, Sept. 28, 2015 Texas poll shows less support there And in Texas? A February 2013 University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of 1,200 Texas voters found 78 percent of respondents somewhat or strongly supporting criminal and mental health background checks for all U.S. gun purchases, including at gun shows and for private sales. Those results had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. A June 2013 follow-up survey found 74 percent of the 1,200 respondents somewhat or strongly supporting such background checks. Our ruling Bird said: ""90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes."" Polls continue to show a strong tilt in favor of background checks prior to all gun purchases; the latest available poll before Bird spoke found 93 percent of adults in favor.

"['Abortion', 'New Hampshire', 'Ben Carson']","
Did Margaret Sanger believe African-Americans ""should be eliminated""?
","Despite being dead for 49 years, Margaret Sanger, founder of the organization that became Planned Parenthood, has a way of turning up in the news. Her latest appearance came during  remarks by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson at a retirement center in Exeter, N.H. Answering a question at RiverWoods Retirement Community, Carson said that ""Planned Parenthood, as you know, was founded by Margaret Sanger. . . . Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist. She believed that people like me should be eliminated, or kept under control."" At a press conference later, he specified what he meant by ""people like me.""  He said he was ""talking about the black race."" Claims like this have been examined by PolitiFact before. Back in March, New Hampshire Rep. William O’Brien claimed Sanger was an ""an active participant in the Ku Klux Klan."" That claim was rated false. And in 2011, businessman and GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain said Planned Parenthood’s early mission was to ""help kill black babies before they came into the world."" That statement was rated Pants on Fire. Carson’s statement pulls on the same threads. Sanger was indeed a believer in eugenics, but the basic concept that humanity could be improved by selective breeding was an article of faith for many in the years before World War II. Winston Churchill, Herbert Hoover, Theodore Roosevelt, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells all supported the movement. African-American leader W. E. B. Du Bois backed many of its principles as well. Although the eugenics movement included some who had racist ideas, wanting to create some sort of master race, ""only a minority of eugenicists"" ever believed this, according to Ruth Engs, professor emerita at the Indiana University School of Public Health and an expert in the movement. At the time that Sanger was active, Engs wrote, ""the purpose of eugenics was to improve the human race by having people be more healthy through exercise, recreation in parks, marriage to someone free from sexually transmitted diseases, well-baby clinics, immunizations, clean food and water, proper nutrition, non-smoking and drinking."" It’s a far cry to equate eugenics with advocating the elimination of black people. For Sanger, her ideas were a matter a public health. As late as 1957, she put her views this way in an interview with Mike Wallace: ""I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world -- that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically. Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they're born. That to me is the greatest sin -- that people can -- can commit."" Sanger was indeed a birth control activist, which means that she wanted women to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancies. She worked for women of all classes and races to have that choice, which she believed to be a right. Quoted in an article about the false accusation that Sanger supported the Ku Klux Klan (she merely addressed a women’s auxiliary and later compared them to children because of their mental simplicity), Jean H. Baker, author of Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion, said Sanger actually opposed prejudice. Sanger ""was far ahead of her times in terms of opposing racial segregation,"" wrote Baker, a history professor at Goucher College, in an email. She worked closely with black leaders to open birth control clinics in Harlem and elsewhere."" Even authors who treat Sanger critically don’t believe she held negative views about African-Americans. Edwin Black wrote a comprehensive history of the eugenics movement, War Against the Weak, and is no fan of the activist’s beliefs. Ultimately, though, he writes, ""Sanger was no racist. Nor was she anti-Semitic."" It’s also worth noting that Sanger died in 1966, six years before the Supreme Court established a nationwide right to abortion services in Roe v. Wade. Those who point a finger at Sanger as a racist often cite a particular statement in claiming she harbored ill will toward black people. In a Dec. 10, 1939, letter, she wrote that ""We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs."" But PolitFact Georgia debunked those who would read the statement as something sinister. ""Sanger’s correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears,"" the article says. She attracted an impressive roster of supporters, including DuBois; Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of National Council of Negro Women; and the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. Eleanor Roosevelt also backed the effort. ""For Sanger to launch a genocidal plot behind their backs and leave no true evidence in her numerous writings would require powers just shy of witchcraft,"" the PolitiFact piece notes. Finally, in 1966 Planned Parenthood gave its Margaret Sanger award to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader accepted, and sent his wife, Coretta, to accept. The speech he wrote for the occasion stated that """"There is a striking kinship between our movement and Margaret Sanger's early efforts."" Sanger was still alive at that point, and her history and statements were well known (she had published an autobiography in 1938 and was never shy about sharing her opinions). If she had, in fact, been a supporter of eliminating black people, it’s doubtful King would have accepted that award. Our ruling Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said that birth control activist Margaret Sanger ""believed that people like me should be eliminated."" He later clarified that he meant African-Americans. While Sanger indeed supported the eugenics movement, substantial evidence shows that she was not racist and in fact worked closely with black leaders and health care professionals. Carson’s statement bears no relation to historical reality. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/05/ben-carson/did-margaret-sanger-believe-african-americans-shou/

Conservative pundit says Planned Parenthood CEO 'forced to concede' abortions make up 86% of revenue
","Conservative talk radio host Dana Loesch got Twitter fired up recently by tossing out another statistic in the ongoing debate over Planned Parenthood and abortion. In her post, Loesch claimed that Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards was ""forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s revenue is from abortion."" Loesch’s post was retweeted more than 1,500 times and served as a foil to somewhat misleading claims that 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is preventative health. But is it right? Did Planned Parenthood’s chief executive admit that 86 percent of its revenues come from abortions? Both the figure and Loesch’s description of the events surrounding it are flawed. We’ll explain why. The House hearing Loesch is describing the Sept. 29 meeting of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which included some tough questioning of Richards. At one point, Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., asked Richards a series of questions about the number of Planned Parenthood’s clinics, whether it conducts mammograms (Planned Parenthood typically refers women to outside clinics for those), and the claim that just 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services are abortion-related. Lummis asked Roberts about Planned Parenthood’s 2013-14 annual report, which she said included statistics that abortions ""would have been over 86 percent of your non-government revenue."" ""How do you explain this massive disparity between the amount of revenue you collect from abortion, and the fact that you only report 3 percent of your services being abortion?"" Lummis asked. We have to stop and make clear that Lummis asked about non-government revenue, which is not what Loesch tweeted. (Loesch could have made that distinction and kept within her 140-character limit, in case you were wondering.) Dropping the words ""non-government"" make a major difference, which we will discuss in a moment. But first back to Richards’ answer. Richards at first responded by saying those numbers are not connected because federal money doesn’t cover abortions. (That’s correct, except in cases of Medicaid funds in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother). Lummis then pressed for how many Planned Parenthood affiliates receive the majority of their revenue from abortion, and Richards said she didn’t know but would talk to her team about getting the answer. Then Richards went back to Lummis’ original question and said, ""But I do think it's important to understand that abortion procedures are probably more expensive than some other procedures that we — that we provide, which might, you know, might explain what you're trying to get at."" You can read the complete transcript here. But what’s clear in our reading is that Richards conceded nothing other than that abortions are relatively expensive procedures compared to Planned Parenthood’s other works. A different line of inquiry came up on this point in the third hour of the hearing. Rep. Steve Russell, R-Okla., tried to ask Richards how much revenue comes from abortion services, but she said she couldn’t give him a ballpark. Then Russell walked through an estimate for how he extrapolated the revenue that abortion brings in. He used Planned Parenthood’s own estimates for a surgical abortion (up to $1,500) and the abortion pill (up to $800), and then multiplied each by the number of reported abortions (over 327,000) to get a range of $261 million to $491 million in ballpark revenue from those procedures. Depending on the cost used, the ballpark abortion revenues ""would come to 40 percent or 22 percent"" of total revenue reported by Planned Parenthood affiliates of $1.145 billion in 2013-14, Russell said. (This method has been used by anti-abortion groups over the years.) Now we’re from 86 percent to 40 or 22 percent. Either way, Richards interrupted, saying that was inaccurate. ""What was inaccurate is, I think, what you reported in terms of what the cost of an abortion,"" Richards said. ""Obviously, it varies state to state. So I can't say. But I think your, I think your number was high."" Unpacking the 86 percent The major problem with all the figures and statistics about what Planned Parenthood does and doesn’t do is that Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide much detail for fact-checkers and observers to analyze. That gets critics in trouble when they exaggerate the available data, as in this case with Loesch. Here’s how Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s 2013-14 annual report presents its revenues: Revenue Affiliates Non-Government Health Services Revenue $305.3 million Government Health Services Grants & Reimbursements $528.4 million Private Contributions and Bequests $257.4 million Other Operating Revenue $54.7 million Total Revenue $1.15 billion This doesn’t tell us much, specifically if you’re trying to answer how much revenue is generated by abortion services. The first column of numbers represents money brought in from Planned Parenthood’s network of affiliates around the country. The top line is for non-government health services revenue, $305.3 million (which would include abortions, as well as STD testing, pregnancy tests, etc.). Of course, there are more sources of revenue than that. The lines below describe $528.4 million in federal reimbursements for services from low-income patients on Medicaid, as well as $257.4 million raised in private contributions and bequests. The only possible way to get to 86 percent is to ignore those other sources of revenues, which account for more than 70 percent of everything Planned Parenthood takes in. The figure Lummis quoted is based on the assumption that of the $305 million in non-government health services revenue, $262.1 million comes from abortion procedures (Planned Parenthood’s $800 top-end estimate for an abortion pill multiplied by 327,653 abortions performed). That’s not a precise way of measuring things because abortion costs vary by state and provider. Average costs reported to members of the National Abortion Federation, the professional association of abortion providers which counts some Planned Parenthood affiliates among its members, put the costs of an abortion lower, in some cases, at $500 for pregnancies 12 weeks and earlier (a mix of medication and in-clinic abortions at that stage), $1,000 between 16-18 weeks, and $2,000 after 20 weeks. As we pointed out, Loesch’s dropping of the words ""non-government"" makes some of this analysis academic. Loesch significantly overplays any validity to Lummis’ estimate by simply referring to revenue. A Florida legislator in 2011 made the same mistake. Applying Lummis’ estimate of $262.1 million from abortions to Planned Parenthood’s total $1.3 billion in revenue shows a lower estimated figure for the share of profits from abortions at 20 percent. (Even Russell’s statement in the hearing, which Richards said was wrong without saying why, put the share of abortion services toward revenue at 22-40 percent.) We’d be remiss if we didn’t note that the people who could shed the most light on these figures, Planned Parenthood, haven’t provided any clarifying information. Loesch provided no additional evidence to support her claim. Our ruling Loesch said Richards was ""forced to concede that 86 percent of Planned Parenthood’s revenue is from abortion."" At a U.S. House hearing, Richards said abortions are expensive compared to other health services offered by Planned Parenthood. But we found no evidence of her saying, or conceding, that 86 percent of revenue is from abortion. At one point in the same meeting, she said an even lower estimate for abortion revenues was ""too high."" On top of that, Loesch describes the reported statistic incorrectly by dropping ""non-government.""  That phrase makes all the difference.

GOP lawmaker claims Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin would force doctors to ask patients about sexual orientation
","
State Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, is among Wisconsin’s most blunt and outspoken lawmakers.

So, when he weighed in on the U.S. Senate race -- claiming the federal government would force doctors to ask patients about their sexual orientation -- we decided to take a look.

In a Sept. 28, 2012, news release, Grothman attacked the Democratic candidate, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison, stating:

""In 2010, Tammy Baldwin introduced H.R. 6109, which would require healthcare workers, including doctors, to ask patients at government-funded clinics, including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.""

He pledged to sponsor state legislation to exempt Wisconsin minors from such a bill.

Baldwin and her view

In the news release, Grothman called Baldwin ""obsessed with radical left-wing social causes"" -- which dovetails with attacks made by Baldwin’s Republican opponent, former governor Tommy Thompson.

Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said Baldwin’s bill would have given the U.S. secretary of health and human services discretion on how to collect information about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Questions would be added to surveys already being conducted and minors would not be questioned without parental consent, he said. ""These are not doctors asking their patients questions,"" he said.

So, those are the views of Grothman and Baldwin. Let’s take a closer look.

The bill

Baldwin introduced House Resolution 6109, the Health Data Collection Improvement Act, in September in 2010.

The bill got little news coverage at the time, although a reader of the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram newspaper raised it in an online discussion after the first Thompson-Baldwin Senate debate in September 2012.

Baldwin explained the reason for her bill in a statement when the bill was introduced, according to Washington Blade, a gay news publication:

""Currently, the federal government does not collect any information about the health and well-being of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Americans. Consequently, our knowledge of the health of the LGBT community is drastically insufficient and our current health care system fails LGBT individuals on many levels.""

The bill was sent to the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The subcommittee approved an amendment by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill., prohibiting the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity from minors without the consent of a parent or guardian.

The subcommittee then voted, 12-10, to send the amended bill to the full committee, where it died.

What would it have done?

According to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, Baldwin’s measure would have required the health and human services secretary ""to ensure that each HHS health service program or HHS health survey provides, to the extent the secretary determines appropriate and practicable, for the voluntary collection of data on the sexual orientation and gender identity of individuals who apply for or receive health services through such program, or who respond to such survey.""

That’s a mouthful.

To break it down:
  

We discussed the bill with health policy experts from two Washington, D.C. research organizations: Kellan Baker of the liberal Center for American Progress, and Edmund Haislmaier of the conservative Heritage Foundation.

They agreed that since Baldwin’s bill gave discretion to the health and human services secretary, it’s possible that doctors and other health care workers in certain clinics or other settings could have been required to ask patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity -- although that could have been through routine intake questionnaires rather than being asked to face to face.

The experts also agreed that Baldwin’s bill would not have required doctors or other health care workers to ask patients about sexual orientation. Again, it would have been left to the HHS secretary to decide how to collect the data, and that might have been largely done through means such as anonymous telephone surveys that the agency already does.

Grothman himself agreed, when we asked about his claim, that while the bill was written to be applied broadly, it would have been up to HHS to write regulations on how to collect the data.

A final note:

While Baldwin’s bill did not become law, the federal government is moving to collect such data in connection with President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known to critics as ""Obamacare.""

In June 2011, the Health and Human Services Department announced it would add questions on sexual orientation to its national data collection efforts by 2013. The department also announced it would begin a process to collect information on gender identity.

Baker, of the Center for American Progress, said HHS is working on adding sexual orientation to its National Health Interview Survey, which is done randomly by telephone.

Our rating

Grothman said Baldwin introduced a bill to require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, ""including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.""

There’s an element of truth in Grothman’s claim, in that the bill would have required a federal agency to collect such data. But there was no requirement that doctors or other health care workers question their patients.

Barack Obama touts his record on improving employment for veterans
","
During the third and final presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Barack Obama touted his accomplishments on getting unemployed veterans back to work.

""What I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it’s time to do some nation building here at home,"" Obama said. ""And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans -- rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.

""You know, I was having lunch with a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances,"" Obama continued. ""When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch. And what we’ve said is let’s change those certifications. The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work. And as a consequence, veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower than general population. It was higher when I came into office.""

We wondered if Obama had his statistics correct.

We looked at data on veterans’ employment compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We focused on two categories of veterans -- all veterans, as well as those who have specifically served in the post-Sept. 11, 2011, armed forces. While Obama didn’t specify what type of veterans he was referring to, the context suggests he was referring to post-9/11 veterans.

The statistics for all veterans

Unemployment rate for all veterans, January 2009: 7.4 percent
Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent

Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he’s wrong.

Unemployment rate for all veterans, September 2012: 6.7 percent
Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent

Obama had said veteran unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he’s right.

The statistics for post-9/11 veterans only

Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, January 2009: 8.9 percent
Unemployment rate for the general population, January 2009: 7.8 percent

Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the general population when he came into office, so by this measurement, he’s right.

Unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans, September 2012: 9.7 percent
Unemployment rate for the general population, September 2012: 7.8 percent

Obama had said veterans unemployment is now lower than the general population, so on this measurement, he’s wrong.

Tallying the results

So, whichever measure you use, Obama’s formulation was half-right.

We should also note, as we have in the past, that presidents do not necessarily have a large impact on either rising or falling unemployment, since the nation’s labor market is sufficiently big and dynamic to be shaped by multiple factors beyond just presidential policies. However, presidential policies may have a bigger impact on employment among veterans than on other types of workers, since the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies have specific policies aimed at boosting veterans’ employment.

Our ruling

Obama said, ""Veterans’ unemployment is actually now lower than (the) general population. It was higher when I came into office."" Whether you’re talking about all veterans or just those who served after 9/11, Obama gets one number right but one number wrong. So we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/23/barack-obama/barack-obama-touts-his-record-improving-employment/

Mitt Romney says he balanced the budget of the Salt Lake City Olympics
","
The London Games may be only a memory now, but the Olympics remain an issue in the presidential campaign. During the third and final presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Mitt Romney once again cited his experience running the 2002 Winter Olympics as a credential in his bid for the White House.

""I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets,"" he said. ""I was in the world of business for 25 years. If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business. I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there.""

Is Romney’s claim about the finances of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics accurate?

First, some background. Romney left Bain Capital in early 1999 to take over leadership of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in the aftermath of a bribery scandal that ultimately exposed widespread corruption in the bidding process used to award the games.

The scandal forced several of Salt Lake City’s Olympic officials to quit and the mayor to step down, and the committee was reorganized. With two years until the games were set to begin, officials needed someone who help restore credibility to the organization, and they tapped Romney, a Mormon whose family has deep roots in the state and who attended Brigham Young University.
   
The Salt Lake City assignment launched Romney into the national spotlight and helped reboot his political career, catapulting to a successful 2002 gubernatorial campaign in Massachusetts.

As we analyze Romney’s claim, it’s important to understand that there is not one budget for the Olympic Games -- there are two.

One is handled by a privately run committee -- in the case of the 2002 Winter Games, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. The committee collects money from such sources as television rights, ticket sales and sponsorships. Under the rules at the time, this revenue funded the operational costs of the Olympics as well as the costs of building the necessary sports venues.

The other pot of money comes from government funding -- primarily to cover transportation upgrades and security costs.

The budget Romney is talking about is the first one, covering Olympic operations. He’s correct that under his stewardship, this budget was balanced -- in fact, more than balanced. According to Fraser Bullock -- a former Bain Capital colleague of Romney’s who joined him at the committee as chief operating officer -- the committee spent $1.3 billion and ended up with a surplus of about $100 million.

Romney is widely credited with creating a sponsorship juggernaut, reeling in such corporations as Allstate, General Mills, Sears Roebuck, certified Angus beef, and Monster.com to sponsor the Games. According to the Washington Post, committee secured 53 deals, more than double the number for the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. The sponsorships that rolled in after Romney arrived exceeded more than $300 million, perhaps a third of which consisted of local Utah sponsors who had never sponsored the Olympics before, Bullock told the New York Times in 2007.

On the spending side, Romney disdained the lavish patterns typical of Olympic committees, charging employees a dollar a slice for pizza (served on paper plates) and 25 cents for sodas.

""When Mitt joined (the committee), there was a budget deficit of $400 million,"" Bullock told PolitiFact. ""So for (the committee), Mitt not only balanced the budget, he produced a surplus, which is remarkable. Only Los Angeles in 1984 also had a surplus. All other Olympics lose money--a lot.""

These figures, however, don’t include the second budget. Bullock counts the second budget as reaching $400 million -- $240 million for security (the games came shortly after 9/11, heightening costs) and $160 million for core transportation upgrades, such as interstate interchanges. Bullock says that in many cases the dollars spent on transportation projects were already in the pipeline, but were accelerated to meet the Olympic timetable.

Other observers, however, say the true amount of this second budget was larger than $400 million. On top of this base amount, at least $400 million was spent on a light-rail system. Bullock says local politicians used the Olympics as an opportunity to push through funding for the light rail project, and that he doesn’t consider it spending that was required by the Games. ""I would not for any reason include light rail"" in the calculations, Bullock said. ""We didn’t need it.""

Investigative journalists Donald Barlett and James Steele calculated in a 2001 Sports Illustrated article that Congress was spending $1.5 billion in taxpayer dollars on the Salt Lake City Olympics -- ""1.5 times the amount spent by lawmakers to support all seven Olympic Games held in the U.S. since 1904—combined."" (These figures were adjusted for inflation.)

We weren’t able to independently verify the $1.5 billion figure, but even the number Bullock accepts -- $400 million -- isn’t a trivial amount of extra dollars. And Kenneth Bullock, a former executive committee member of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee who now directs the of Utah League of Cities and Towns, added that various Utah localities chipped in an unknown number of additional dollars. ""Some of them managed to negotiate reimbursements from (the committee), but even that never would have been enough to pay all of their costs,"" said Kenneth Bullock, who is no relation to Fraser Bullock.

Officially, Romney had no control over this second budget. But he does appear to have taken an aggressive role in advocating for additional spending. In Romney’s 2004 book, Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games, he wrote that he asked his lobbyist ""to bring in more federal funding than had ever been appropriated for any Olympics, summer or winter."" The committee employed five federal lobbying firms beyond his in-house lobbying office, spending $3.5 million in all, NBC News reported earlier this year. And the Games ended up getting support from at least 18 federal agencies, according to a 2001 Government Accountability Office report.

""I was successful in organizing the Olympics, got record funds from the federal government,"" Romney said in 2002 as he was running for governor of Massachusetts.

We asked a number of Olympics experts whether they thought Romney was being accurate when he said he ""balanced the budget"" of the Salt Lake City Olympics. Most agreed that it’s not a simple question.

""The entire issue of accounting"" for Olympics finances ""is difficult, as it very difficult to know what to count as an Olympic-related cost and what is an infrastructural improvement to the host city,"" said Bill Mallon, co-founder of the International Society of Olympic Historians. ""It can get very complex.""

Still, most of the experts we asked concluded that Romney was right, but with what David Wallechinsky, the author of several histories of the Olympics, said was ""a major asterisk.""

""Romney is right on a technicality that misses the major issue about financing any Olympics,"" said Roger G. Noll, a Stanford University economist who has studied large public infrastructure projects, including stadiums. ""Romney saved the Salt Lake City Olympics by regaining political support. One way he did this was to reduce costs below the plan, but the main reason is that Romney succeeded in getting a huge subsidy from the federal government.""

Our ruling

It’s correct that Romney more than balanced the the Salt Lake Organizing Committee’s budget. But that doesn’t tell the whole story, since he helped secure at least $400 million -- and possibly up to $1.5 billion -- in government funding to make the Olympics function that is not included in the balance sheet he’s touting. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Romney says Obama wants ‘daylight’ in U.S.-Israel relationship
","
Mitt Romney frequently criticizes President Barack Obama’s stance on Israel, saying the president doesn’t hold the Jewish state in a tight enough embrace.

""The president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel,"" Romney said in a foreign policy-focused debate, the final one of the presidential election.

We decided to dig into the origin of that statement and check whether Romney’s characterization is accurate.

What Obama (reportedly) said

The ""daylight"" comment stems from a July 15, 2012, story in the Washington Post about a meeting Obama held in 2009 with several Jewish leaders. The meeting was closed to the press, and there is no transcript of what was said. The Post story was based on interviews with people in the meeting.

Here’s the relevant excerpt:
  
""If you want Israel to take risks, then its leaders must know that the United States is right next to them,"" Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, told the president. 
Obama politely but firmly disagreed. 
""Look at the past eight years,"" he said, referring to the George W. Bush administration's relationship with Israel. ""During those eight years, there was no space between us and Israel, and what did we get from that? When there is no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility with the Arab states."" 

The White House does not confirm that Obama said those words. There also has been no explicit denial.

What he meant

Further into the Post story, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes explained Obama’s purpose in the meeting, in which he explained to the Jewish leaders his thinking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how he differed from Bush’s approach.

""The case he was trying to make was that the United States will be a better partner to Israel if it has more credibility with the Arab states, that we will be a better, more useful friend to Israel if we have more friends in the Arab world,"" Rhodes said, according to the story.

The White House pointed us to several examples of how Obama is not distancing his administration from Israel. He and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have met nine times and spoken on the phone dozens of times. In July, Obama signed the Israel Security Act, a bill designed to increase security ties with the Jewish state, and boosted U.S. funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system by $70 million.

The White House also pointed to statements from Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on the two countries’ relationship.

Netanyahu, at the AIPAC conference in May 2011: ""Yesterday President Obama spoke about his ironclad commitment to Israel's security. He rightly said that our security cooperation is unprecedented. He spoke of that commitment not just in front of AIPAC. He spoke about it in two speeches heard throughout the Arab world. And he has backed those words with deeds.""

Barak, to CNN in July: ""This administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can remember in the past.""

Some interpretations

We talked to Danielle Pletka, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who said Romney’s take was a ""fair paraphrase"" of Obama’s reported words.

""It is the widespread perception that the president has in fact worked fairly assiduously to put daylight between the U.S. and Israel,"" she said, mentioning Obama’s more hard-line stance on Israeli settlements and his comment to French President Nicolas Sarkozy about Netanyahu, saying, ""You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day.""

""I think it’s a world view. I think that President Obama’s world view is not one in which Israel plays a special role -- Israel is a country like any other, it causes us too much trouble in the Middle East, and the time has come to distance ourselves,"" Pletka said, adding that most Americans don’t share that view.

Aaron David Miller, in a first-person piece for Foreign Policy magazine, wrote that when it comes to Israel, ""Obama really is different. Unlike (President Bill) Clinton and George W. Bush, Obama isn't in love with the idea of Israel. As a result, he has a harder time making allowances for Israeli behavior he doesn't like. Obama relates to the Jewish state not on a values continuum but through a national security and interest filter.""

Referring to the Post story, Miller wrote: ""Obama doesn't believe the ‘no daylight’ argument -- that is, to get Israel to move, you need to make the Israelis feel that America will stand by it no matter what. Quite the opposite: Obama appears to believe that Israel needs to understand that if it doesn't move, the United States will be hard pressed to continue to give it complete support.""

On the other side of the argument, Natan Sachs, a scholar with the centrist Brookings Institution, said it’s somewhat misleading for Romney to say that daylight is Obama’s goal.

""It is true that President Obama, early in his tenure, tried to carve out a role for the United States as a broker for negotiations, airing differences in policy between the United States and Israel, especially on settlements. It is also true that this coincided with his attempt to regain U.S credibility in the Arab and Muslim world... But two important caveats should be made: once the attempt to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians failed, the Obama administration has in fact stopped putting much pressure on the Israeli government on settlements. ... Second, the point of the policy was not to put ‘daylight’ per se, but rather to be forward about policy disagreements between Israel and the United States -- disagreements that the Bush administration shared, to some degree -- rather than attempting to hide this disagreements,"" Sachs wrote in an email.

Our ruling

Romney said that Obama said he would create daylight between the United States and Israel.

It’s not as simple in this case as going to the tape to see what Obama said. The comment was reported secondhand by the Washington Post, based on anonymous interviews.

Obama: Romney called Russia our top geopolitical threat
","
Correction: At PolitiFact, we say words matter. So when we get the words wrong, it stings. At Monday’s presidential debate, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama got into a back-and-forth over whether Romney called Russia America’s No. 1 ""geopolitical threat."" But we fact-checked something different, whether Romney said Russia was America’s No. 1 ""geopolitical foe."" We mischaracterized the president’s remarks, which affected our ruling. We have updated the item with the exact quote and changed our ruling accordingly.

In the final debate of the presidential campaign, President Barack Obama tried to portray challenger Mitt Romney as a novice who lacks understanding of complex world issues.

""Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaida. You said Russia ... the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years,"" Obama said.

We’ve heard the president make that charge about Russia before, using similar words. Here’s what we found.

The hot mic
   
In March 2012, at a summit in South Korea, Obama was caught in a ""hot mic"" incident. Without realizing he could be overheard, Obama told Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more ability to negotiate with the Russians about missile defense after the November election.
   
""On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it’s important for him to give me space,"" Obama was heard telling Medvedev, apparently referring to incoming Russian president Vladi­mir Putin.
   
""Yeah, I understand,"" Medvedev replied.
   
Obama interjected, saying, ""This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility.""

The exchange drew swift rebuke from Republicans, who accused Obama of caving on an important security issue. Romney quickly joined the chorus of critics.

In a March 26 interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, he said the president seemed to be willing to negotiate with Russians on matters he was hiding from the American people.
   
Said Romney: ""This is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that he has more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling indeed.""
   
Blitzer asked Romney if he thought Russia is a bigger foe than Iran, China or North Korea.
   
""I'm saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent, the nation that lines up with the world's worst actors,"" Romney said. ""Of course the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear Iran, and a nuclear North Korea is already troubling enough. But when these terrible actors pursue their course in the world and we go to the United Nations looking for ways to stop them ... who is it that always stands up with the world's worst actors? It's always Russia, typically with China alongside. And so in terms of a geopolitical foe, a nation that's on the Security Council that has the heft of the Security Council, and is of course is a massive nuclear power, Russia is the geopolitical foe.""

The op-ed
   
Romney followed that interview a day later with an op-ed in Foreign Policy magazine.
   
In that piece, he never used the word ""enemy"" or ""foe"" to describe Russia. But he did depict it as an adversary and referred to its ""intransigence.""
   
""Without extracting meaningful concessions from Russia, (Obama) abandoned our missile defense sites in Poland. He granted Russia new limits on our nuclear arsenal. He capitulated to Russia's demand that a United Nations resolution on the Iranian nuclear-weapons program exclude crippling sanctions,"" Romney wrote. ""Moscow has rewarded these gifts with nothing but obstructionism at the United Nations on a whole raft of issues. It has continued to arm the regime of Syria's vicious dictator and blocked multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing carnage there. Across the board, it has been a thorn in our side on questions vital to America's national security. For three years, the sum total of President Obama's policy toward Russia has been: ‘We give, Russia gets.’""
   
Later, on a multi-nation trip in July designed to beef up his foreign policy credentials, Romney condemned Russia as a ""country where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression.""
   
The second interview
   
Romney spoke again to CNN’s Blitzer in July. Romney’s campaign previously pointed us to this exchange:

Blitzer: ""The last time you and I spoke in an interview, you told me that Russia was America’s No. 1 geostrategic foe. Do you still believe that?""

Romney: ""There's no question but that in terms of geopolitics -- I’m talking about votes at the United Nations and actions of a geopolitical nature -- Russia is the No. 1 adversary in that regard. That doesn't make them an enemy. It doesn’t make them a combatant. They don't represent the No. 1 national security threat. The No. 1 national security threat, of course, to our nation is a nuclear Iran. Time continues to pass. They continue to move towards nuclearization. This is more and more disconcerting and dangerous to the world. But Russia -- particularly look at a place like Syria. Russia has supported the Assad regime even as it has been attacking its own people. Russia likewise has been slow to move to the kinds of sanctions that have been called for in Iran. Russia is a geopolitical adversary, but it's not an enemy with, you know, missiles being fired at one another or things of that nature.""

So in this interview, as he would do later in the debate, Romney emphasized the difference between Russia, his No. 1 foe or enemy for the United States, and Iran, his No. 1 threat because of its effort to build nuclear weapons.

Romney responds in the debate

After a few minutes of back and forth, Romney had a chance to respond to Obama’s charge about Russia:

""I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe. Not ... Excuse me. It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin. And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.

So Romney revised his own remarks, this time calling Russia ""a"" geopolitical foe, when to CNN he said ""our No. 1 geopolitical foe."" But he’s right that in the same interview he called Iran the top national security threat.

Our ruling
   
In the debate, Obama said Romney called Russia ""the biggest geopolitical threat facing America.""

Actually, Romney has twice drawn the distinction between his concerns about Iran and Russia. He has called Russia the biggest geopolitical foe or enemy for the U.S., but he has said the biggest threat is Iran.

We rate Obama’s statement Half True.

Romney says a survey found Massachusetts 'had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state'
","
A day after the second presidential debate, ""binders full of women"" had hit full meme status, spawning Web games and Halloween costumes.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney said that he used ""binders full of women"" from women’s groups to help staff his administration, resulting in a Cabinet and senior staff with ""more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.""

He cited a survey from the University at Albany-SUNY.

Chatter quickly swirled over whether those ""binders"" — full of resumes, you Twitter fiends, as opposed to actual women — came at Romney’s request or were the result of a concerted effort by activists that predated his administration.

We wondered about the result: Was Romney right that a survey concluded his Cabinet and senior staff ""had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America""?

 What Romney said

According to Romney at the debate, the study showed he was a leader in getting women on his top staff.

""As I was serving as governor of my state ... I had the chance to pull together a Cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.

""I went to my staff, and I said, ‘How come all the people for these jobs are all men?’ They said, ‘Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.’ And I said, ‘Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?’

""So we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks,’ and they brought us whole binders full of women.

""I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.""

 The Albany report

Romney took office in January 2003.

The report he cited, published in 2004, focused on a snapshot of policy leaders by gender in 2003. And indeed, it ranked Massachusetts No. 1 in the nation, up from No. 5 in the previous surveys in 1999 and 2001.

Of 20 top policy leaders in the state, half were women, according to self-reported statistics from the administration.

The report ranked states by a ""representativeness ratio"" — how closely the proportion of women in appointed leadership positions matched the proportion of women in the state.

We talked with Judith Saidel, the researcher who directed the University at Albany project, which tracked appointees in state government.

She found the wording of Romney’s claim in the debate ""not entirely precise.""

Romney said the state ""had more women,"" but it more accurately had the highest percentage of women in senior leadership positions tracked by the study.

Twenty-one states appointed more women to top positions, she said.

""If Gov. Romney had said that Massachusetts ranked No. 1 among the states … he would have been completely precise and accurate,"" she said.

Still, she told the New York Times, ""his record, as we measured it, looks darned good.""

 What happened next

We don't know if Massachusetts remained at the top for percentage of women in the administration. Because of a loss of grant funding, the survey was not conducted again, so there’s no snapshot of Romney’s appointments compared with other states for the rest of his term.

But a group of women in Massachusetts who got Romney and his Democratic opponent for governor to agree to make appointing women a priority collaborated with a Boston university to track his progress.

The work by researchers and MassGAP, the Massachusetts Government Appointments Project, isn’t comparative with the rest of the country — but does take Romney’s entire term into account.

Rather than 20 senior leadership positions, it tracked 135 executive-level positions in the state.

And like the Albany study, it found admirable parity in Romney’s first round of appointments: 42 percent of his first 33 hires to senior-level positions were women.

""He does deserve credit for that first wave of appointments,"" said Carol Hardy-Fanta, senior scholar for the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at University of Massachusetts at Boston who co-authored the report.

But the durability of Romney’s early effort was fleeting.

From 2004 to 2006, two years removed from the spotlight of the campaign, just a quarter of Romney’s appointments were women.

Upshot: By the time Romney left office, the percentage of women in those 135 positions was slightly lower than when he arrived, falling from 30 percent to just under 28 percent.

""Though he can justifiably take pride that 42 percent of his initial appointments were women, he didn't really move the needle,"" Hardy-Fanta said.

The Romney campaign pointed us to comments in the Washington Post from Elizabeth Levine, who chaired the Massachusetts Women’s Political Caucus when Romney was elected.

She ""said this type of fluctuation is the norm,"" the Post reported, because ""administrations often appoint internal candidates to fill short-term positions near the end of a term and that women have a natural disadvantage in those situations.""

""If you don’t have a lot of new people in the pipeline, it’s harder to fill those positions with women,"" she told the Post.

Hardy-Fanta, who was part of the original MassGAP initiative as co-chair of its team recommending women for appointments in higher education, said the group expected better.

""I think there was an expectation that once you said this was important — and this group kind of made them aware that this was important — that it wouldn't disappear,"" she said.

 Our ruling

Romney said a survey by the University at Albany after he staffed his Cabinet and senior staff concluded his Massachusetts administration ""had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.""

Twenty-one states actually employed more women in senior roles in 2003. Rather, Massachusetts had the best percentage in the country, something that earned the state positive recognition. But that’s a small clarification.

Meanwhile, that narrow Albany survey reflected the number of female appointees shortly after Romney took office. A broader study that looked at all of Romney’s appointments and the percentage of women before and after his term found that his effort flagged halfway through his administration — and that the overall percentage of women in executive positions actually dropped.

Still, Romney fairly accurately characterized a survey that ranked his state No. 1. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/22/mitt-romney/romney-says-survey-found-massachusetts-had-more-wo/

Paul Hirschbiel says newspapers called Scott Rigell's campaign ""Mostly False""
","
Democrat Paul Hirschbiel, challenging U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell, R-2nd , is airing a TV ad that portrays Rigell as a below-the-belt campaigner.

The commercial says ""Virginia papers called Rigell’s campaign ‘Mostly False,’"" and the screen flashes a PolitiFact logo.  

Since Hirschbiel campaign chose to invoke our name, we decided to examine his claim.

Hirschbiel’s ad cites a PolitiFact Virginia article from the 2010 election, when Rigell defeated one-term incumbent Democrat Glenn Nye. The article examined a Rigell ad claim that Nye voted ""in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi"" 83 percent of the time.

In fact, Nye voted with the Democratic Party about 83 percent of the time, but with Pelosi -- who was House speaker back then -- only 66 percent of the time. Nye actually had one of the most independent records in Congress and Pelosi rarely voted in 2009 and 2010, a standard for House speakers.  

Rigell’s statement was rated Mostly False and the Republican also earned a False for another claim during his 2010 run. We should also note that last year, we rated a claim he made about U.S. borrowing as True.

This year, we have not rated any campaign statements by Rigell.

Our ruling

Hirschbiel said Rigell’s campaign had been labeled ""Mostly False"" and attributed his statement to PolitiFact.

PolitiFact Virginia rated a single 2010 election claim by Rigell as Mostly False, but we never passed judgment on the overall veracity of the candidate or his campaign.

Charlie Bass accuses Ann McLane Kuster of having extreme partisan agenda
","
On the campaign trail, U.S. Rep. Charles Bass has often targeted his opponent Ann McLane Kuster for her support of the Affordable Care Act. But, last month, he took the attack one step further in an ad broadcast on New Hampshire airwaves.

Kuster ""is for a government takeover of health care more radical than Obamacare,"" Bass charges in the ad, ""Dancing,"" released September 26.

""And she supports a $700 billion cut to Medicare for current retirees,"" the ad declares. ""Annie Kuster: so far left, she’ll never be right for us.""

We’ve heard this line of attack before. Last month, we gave Bass a False ruling on his charge that Kuster supports a government takeover of health care.

But, this claim goes further, accusing Kuster of supporting a plan more extreme than the health care law. So, we decided to take another look.

In this ad, Bass cites a Concord Monitor article from 2010, in which Kuster both lauded President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and offered her support for a government-run insurance option to better control costs.

""I support the public insurance option to increase competition and bring down costs,"" she told the paper. ""We can't print enough money to have access to healthcare for everyone without addressing costs.""

In past rulings, including the prior Kuster claim, PolitiFact has disagreed strongly with the classification of the Affordable Care Act as a government takeover of healthcare. A ‘government takeover’ conjures images of the European approach to health care, where the government owns the hospitals and doctors are public employees. In 2010, PolitiFact named the claim its Lie of the Year.

Under the Affordable Care Act, employers will continue to provide health insurance to most patients through private insurance companies. This would continue to prove true, even if lawmakers passed a public insurance option, like the one Kuster is talking about, according Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.

In that case, private providers would still supply the majority of medical services. But, patients could choose to go with a government-run insurance plan to cover the costs, Oberlander said.

""You would still have private physicians and private hospitals, and the government would reimburse them,"" he said. ""But the government would not take over the medical system.""

Let’s look now at the $700 billion figure Bass mentions in the ad. As in the September claim, Bass is referencing money reportedly taken from Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act.

Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office revised its estimates to show that the health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $716 billion between 2013-2022.

As noted in prior PolitiFact rulings, the reductions do not come in the form of direct cuts, but through changes to Medicare intended to reduce costs. These changes, targeted mainly at insurance companies and hospitals rather than beneficiaries, will not result in immediate cuts to Medicare, but are intended instead to reduce future Medicare spending and to free up savings that will then offset the costs of the health care law.

Our ruling:

Last month, we chided Bass for referring to the Medicare reductions as a robbery. This time, the Congressman changed his language, speaking instead to a ""$700 trillion cut,"" a claim we deem more accurate. But, he still did not accurately characterize the nature of the cuts, which will be realized over time. Similar statements have been ruled Half True in the past for failing to make these distinctions.

Moreover, little has changed that makes Bass’ claim about the ""government takeover of healthcare"" more true today than it was a month ago.

Introducing a public option might welcome the government further into the insurance game. But, it would not bring the U.S. medical system any closer to the European model of government-run hospitals and clinics. This part of the statement remains False.

On balance, we rate Bass’ claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/22/charles-bass/charlie-bass-accuses-ann-mclane-kuster-having-extr/

Ann McLane Kuster accused Charlie Bass of wanting to privatize Social Security
","
From the day she officially entered the race, Congressional candidate Ann McLane Kuster has accused her opponent, U.S. Rep. Charles Bass of wanting to privatize Social Security. But, in a recent TV ad, she let a supporter do her talking for her.

""I think Congressman Bass’ idea to privatize Social Security is a devastating idea,"" one voter, Janice Kelble, of Franklin, N.H., says in the ad, ""Janice,"" which first aired on Sept. 6 on New Hampshire airwaves.

""Bass just wants to risk Social Security on the stock market,"" Kelble suggests. ""Charlie Bass just plain does not understand the middle class.’

PolitiFact has heard these claims before. The attack has been a rallying cry of sorts for Democrats since George W. Bush was in office, and candidates are pulling the card once again this election season.

In fact, we checked the same claim from Kuster this summer, rating it Mostly False. But, with the charge receiving renewed airtime with the ad, we decided to see if anything has changed.

Back in June, the Kuster campaign cited a 2001 House vote on then-President Bush’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security as evidence of Bass’ support for privatization.

In December 2001, the 16-member commission issued its final report, which urged Congress to incorporate a system of private accounts for personal investment.

With strong opposition from Democrats, the commission’s recommendations never reached the floor of Congress. But, the House did consider a number of resolutions and amendments at the time, including H.AMDT.245, a Democratic-sponsored amendment that would have prohibited any funding of the commission’s recommendations.

Bass joined each of his Republican colleagues at the time in voting against the amendment, which failed 188-238. But, analysts determined both then and now that the vote was more of a pre-emptive strike than a true endorsement of privatization.

""He may have (supported privatization),"" Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute, said back in June. ""Republicans generally did at that point, but this vote was certainly not a vote that could be read that way.""

In both the current ad and in past claims, Kuster cites a 2005 news article as further evidence of Bass’ support for privatization. In this story, printed in the Eagle Times of Claremont, N.H., Bass offered support for then-President Bush’s plan to introduce a private accounts option for Social Security beneficiaries.

""I support the establishment of private savings accounts because it allows low- and middle-income workers the chance to get ahead,"" Bass said, according to the Eagle Times.

As noted in the prior ruling, Bass further clarified his stance that year with a statement issued the night Bush outlined his plan in his State of the Union address.

""I am an advocate of the President's call for Social Security reform and will work with him in the next two years to save and protect this important program,"" Bass wrote at the time, according to the National Journal and Project Vote Smart.

Some analysts argue that Bush’s plan, to allow workers under 55 the option of directing up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into private accounts, is as close to privatization as the debate has reached in recent years.

""Virtually no one has proposed replacing all of Social Security with private accounts, Paul Van de Water, a seniors fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in the initial Kuster piece. ""Given the way the debate has evolved, being for … privatization doesn’t mean you’re for privatizing the whole darn thing.""

But, PolitiFact has determined in past rulings that the private accounts option does not meet the standards of full privatization. First, it would be fully optional, and secondly, beneficiaries could opt to place only a portion of their payroll taxes into private accounts, qualifying as a partial privatization plan at best.

""To address this financial crisis facing the Social Security program, one such idea Congressman Bass has supported would create a program that would allow individuals to voluntarily place a portion of their money that they currently pay as part of the payroll tax and place it into a personal account,"" Bass spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne wrote in a June email to the Telegraph. ""Saying that (Bass) supports ‘privatizing Social Security is pure political rhetoric devised by Democratic spin doctors to frighten seniors.""

Our ruling:

Little if anything has changed since our past ruling on Kuster’s claims about Bass’ support for privatization. The statements and votes that the Democrat references in support of her claim suggest Bass supported a move toward partial privatization, not full privatization as the claim suggests.

Kuster’s claim was Mostly Falsethen, and it continues to be now.",/factchecks/2012/oct/22/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-mclane-kuster-accused-charlie-bass-wanting-pri/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says property taxes jumped 70 percent in decade before he took office as governor
","
Whether on the national stage or back home in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie often peppers the crowd with statistics while describing the fiscal woes of New Jersey before he took office.

Among his arsenal of numbers is the rate of increase in the state’s property tax bills. At an Oct. 16 town hall meeting in West Milford, Christie unsheathed that figure as he said his reforms are constraining property taxes.

""We're announcing $116 million dollars today in additional savings to local governments statewide. Here's why. The savings are possible because of the reforms we put in place: 2 percent cap on property taxes. The property tax rates are starting to come in from across the state. They came in from Burlington County the other day, 1.7 percent increase countywide in property taxes. The cap's working,"" he said. ""Now remember, property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor. So you’re having [a] 7 percent a year average.""

Did New Jersey’s property taxes -- the nation’s highest -- jump by 70 percent in a decade? Homeowners may not be surprised to learn that the increase was actually slightly more. Though, when property tax rebates are factored in, the increase is roughly 50 percent.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail that the governor’s statement is ""unequivocally true and a glaring illustration of the uncontrolled rise in property taxes in the decade before we arrived in Trenton -- caused by unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level.""

The average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs.

By 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280.

That’s a more than 71 percent increase.

But there’s also another chapter to the story of New Jersey’s property taxes: rebates.

In previous fact-checks, experts told us reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they’re intended to reduce the property tax burden of homeowners.

In 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111.

By 2009, the average rebate was $1,037.

When you deduct those rebates from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office is less than 70 percent.

In 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent.

It’s worth noting Christie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebates came as a credit deducted off property tax bills.

In 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519.

Our ruling

Christie said: ""property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor.""

In the decade before Christie took office, the average property tax bill climbed more than 70 percent, from roughly $4,240 to about $7,280.

But when property tax rebates are taken into account, the increase is less, jumping roughly 50 percent in a decade.

Either way, Christie is on point that property taxes increased significantly from 1999 to 2009.

We rate this statement Mostly True.

Betty Sutton says Jim Renacci tried to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million
","
The congressional contest between Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton and Republican Rep. Jim Renacci is among the nation’s most costly and hard-fought races, and has also devolved into one of the nastiest.

After Renacci placed ads accusing Sutton of ""voting to raise taxes on just about everyone,"" Sutton fired back with an ad that claims Renacci supports tax breaks for millionaires like himself and ""tried to avoid paying taxes on nearly $14 million that he made.""

""We play by the rules but Renacci thinks he’s above them,"" says a male blue collar worker shown in Sutton’s ad.

On the same day that Sutton unveiled the ad that accuses Renacci of avoiding taxes, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made a similar assertion in a different ad, which says: ""Renacci tried to skip out on paying over a million in taxes."".

The tax avoidance claims in Sutton’s new ad echo charges that were raised against Renacci in 2010, when he first ran for Congress and defeated Democratic Rep. John Boccieri. They stem from a dispute Renacci had with the Ohio Department of Taxation, which accused him and his wife, Tina, of misreporting their income in 2000 and assessed them nearly $1.4 million in back taxes, interest and penalties.

The Renaccis filed state tax returns that claimed they had a loss of $247,336 that year, but auditors determined they actually made $13,730,440. The couple filed a tax appeal when the state dinged them for $954,650 in back taxes, $146,938 in interest and $293,876 in penalties.

The quarrel was over Renacci's trust income from an ""S"" corporation, which wasn’t taxable for several years before Ohio's tax commissioner changed the state’s policy. S corporations permit income to be taxed at an individual rate for federal tax purposes, and avoid double taxation on corporate income. Renacci was among a group of taxpayers who fought the state decision. He contended the trust income should have been tax-free and that he had ""reasonable cause"" to exclude it on his tax return, tax department and court documents say.

Others dropped their appeals, but Renacci continued to fight, even after a 2006 Ohio Supreme Court ruling in a similar case in which the court said the trust income was subject to taxation. In that case, the taxpayers reported their S Corporation income on their 2000 tax return and then unsuccessfully asked for a refund.

A 2007 legal brief the state of Ohio filed in Renacci’s case observed that nearly all other litigants ""who created grantor trusts in an attempt to shelter, i.e., exclude their S corporation income from Ohio income taxation"" gave up their appeals, and that the Renaccis were ""almost alone in their persistence."" Court records show the Renaccis eventually sent the state more than $1.3 million, but they continue to argue that $359,822 that they paid in penalties and interest were improper.

""He was proud of his fight, and to have fought till the end, along with many other Ohioans for tax fairness,"" Renacci spokesman James Slepian told the Plain Dealer in 2010.

When asked about Sutton’s new ad,  Slepian this month called her ""a desperate politician who knows she’s losing and has no record to run on,"" and said she’s  engaging in ""the bogus, gutter politics of recycled personal attacks that have defined her sad career in Congress.""

Indeed, the charges against Renacci are somewhat recycled. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union placed a television ad in 2010 that contained a more extreme version of the charges that Sutton is making.

That ad said he ""cheated on his income taxes,"" that he ""hid"" more than $13 million and was forced to pay $1.4 million in back taxes and penalties.  Renacci filed a defamation suit against the union after the ads began to air. Court records show he dropped the case on Feb. 3, 2011, shortly after he took office in Congress.

PolitiFact Ohio found a claim in that ad to be Mostly True because Renacci could have disclosed the trust income on his state tax return, as the state warned he should, but he didn’t. He also could have paid the taxes and contested the amount, but didn’t. And he didn’t amend his return, despite an explicit 2002 warning from Ohio’s tax Department that he could face penalties for fraud and failure to pay if he didn’t. But Renacci ultimately worked within the system to resolve the case, paid the full amount that was due, and was not ever charged with tax fraud.

The claim in this ad is an easier call. Reams of legal documents show that Renacci battled with the state over trust income from an S corporation, trying to avoid paying taxes on the $13.7 million at issue in the case.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Sutton’s claim rates True. ",/factchecks/2012/oct/22/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-jim-renacci-tried-avoid-paying-t/
"['Abortion', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Wisconsin', 'Greater Wisconsin Committee']","
Women who miscarry could face investigation under legislation supported by Gudex, Greater Wisconsin Political Fund says
","
A  television ad in the 18th state Senate district race jars viewers with a chilling scene: A police officer knocks at a door and confronts a distraught couple sitting on a sofa.

""Women who have miscarriages could be investigated by police,"" the narrator says, and the words ""Miscarriages investigated"" appear on the screen.

The ad is from the liberal Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and targets Republican state Senate candidate Rick Gudex of Fond du Lac who is challenging incumbent Democrat Jessica King of Oshkosh, who was elected in 2011 in a recall election. The seat is important for both parties and for control of the state Senate.

The ad focuses on what it calls Gudex’s extreme views on abortion.

But miscarriages investigated by police?

That caught our attention.

When asked for backup, Michelle McGrorty, executive director of the Greater Wisconsin fund, cited Gudex’s endorsement by Pro-Life Wisconsin and a questionnaire candidates must answer before getting it.

The questionnaire includes this statement: ""Would you vote in favor of a state constitutional amendment that extends the inalienable right to life already found in the Wisconsin Constitution to all preborn children from conception?""

That refers to what is called a ""personhood amendment."" And Pro-Life Wisconsin says it endorses only candidates who answer ""yes"" to all questions on the survey.

Such an amendment was introduced in the state Assembly a year ago, but it was not acted on.

Here’s what Pro-Life says about that amendment:

""Put simply, a ‘person’ is a human being who is fully protected under the law; and we use the legal term ‘personhood’ to describe this condition. Once a human being is declared a person that individual is guaranteed certain legal rights, such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In other words, to be a person is to be fully protected by a series of God­ given and constitutionally protected rights.""

McGrorty argues such an amendment could lead to investigations of women who suffered a miscarriage.

""It basically extends the rights of a human being to a fertilized egg,"" she said. ""If someone had a miscarriage and if someone believed someone did something wrong, they could be investigated.""

But here’s where some trouble arises. The same argument could be used the other way: The language, at least in the 2011 bill, doesn’t direct authorities to investigate miscarriages. It’s silent on them. And it doesn’t prevent authorities from enforcing other laws where pregnant women have engaged in drug abuse or other behavior that could injure or kill a fetus.

We called Gudex several times, but he didn’t respond.

However, since the ad started airing, he has responded in a couple of different ways.

-- ""I would never advocate for what King and her friends are suggesting and voters of all persuasions should be outraged at the fabricated content of this ad,"" he told the Fond du Lac Reporter. He didn’t say what part of the ad he considered  fabricated.

-- Gudex told the Journal Sentinel that he does not support the personhood amendment ""in its current form."" He said he does not support bans on birth control or investigations of miscarriages.

Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin director of legislation, who wrote the endorsement survey, said the personhood question was not meant to tie a candidate to a specific bill. The information sheet referring to Joint Resolution 77 was meant to provide background information, Sande said.

""That’s an example of what a personhood amendment is,"" Sande said. ""It was a generic question.""

The group does not object to Gudex saying he would seek changes in the proposed amendment.

""That’s fine with us,"" as long as he remains in favor of the idea of a personhood amendment, Sande said. ""He’s certainly not backing off.""

Other states

The miscarriage argument against personhood amendments has been used elsewhere. For instance, under a bill in Georgia, women who miscarried could be found guilty of a felony, according to a Feb. 23, 2011 blog item in the liberal Mother Jones magazine.

PolitiFact Georgia on March 2, 2011 rated the Mother Jones statement Mostly True. In that state, the lawmaker who wrote the bill said it was not his intention to have police investigate miscarriages. PolitiFact Georgia said the blogger’s statement was correct but needed additional context, and noted that the bill’s language ""is so broad it does open the door for women to face felony charges if they abuse drugs, fall off a bicycle, fail to wear a seat belt, or opt for cancer treatment while pregnant.""

The item concluded: ""Women who miscarry might not be handled as felons. It depends on how prosecutors and judges decide to handle the law.""

A Nov. 7, 2011, Slate article about a proposed Mississippi personhood bill noted: ""A woman who suffers a miscarriage would be prosecuted not because she had a miscarriage, but because police and prosecutors suspect she might have had an abortion. You would certainly be investigated if your born child disappeared and you said it had died in an accident.""

Sande said that common sense would ensure that women who suffered a miscarriage would not be investigated under a personhood amendment in Wisconsin.

""This gross exaggeration is being brought up in all of those states"" considering personhood bills, Sande said.

""A miscarriage is not intentional. It’s a natural act, a natural occurrence,"" he said. ""The idea that she would be culpable -- it just doesn’t make any sense.""

Our rating

The Greater Wisconsin Political Fund says in a television ad that legislation supported by a state Senate candidate could lead to police investigations of miscarriages. The claim stems from an endorsement from Pro-Life Wisconsin and relates to Gudex’s support of all its positions, including supporting a ""personhood amendment.""

Gudex has said he wants changes to the personhood amendment that was introduced in the last session, but hasn’t said what alternative he would support.

But that language did not mandate investigation of miscarriages, as the ad suggests. The claim is based on an extrapolation of what could happen, but even the group’s director said such an investigation would be because ""someone believed someone did something wrong,"" not simply because a miscarriage occurred.

We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/22/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/women-who-miscarry-could-face-investigation-under-/

George Allen says women's poverty rate is highest in 17 years
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen recently lamented the financial hardships facing women and said they would benefit from his general formula for fixing the economy: cut government spending, regulation and taxes.

""The poverty rate amongst women is the worst it’s been in 17 years and the extreme poverty rate is the worst it’s ever been,"" he said.

We asked the Allen campaign to back up its statistics.

In a response on its website, the campaign cited a number of articles about the difficulties women encounter in seeking work and making ends meet. Among them was a story from The Daily Beast that details how women, single women and female-headed households were worse off in the Census Bureau’s 2010 survey of households than in the previous year.

Women in Poverty

The story, written in September 2011, accurately notes that the 2010 census survey found that 46.3 million of all Americans -- 15.1 percent -- lived in poverty. It found that 25.5 million women -- 16.3 percent -- lived in poverty. In 2010, the Census Bureau standard for poverty was $22,113 in earnings for a family of four with two children or $11,139 for an individual.

The bureau has data reaching back to 1966. As the article claimed and Allen correctly repeated, the poverty rate for women in 2010 was the highest since 1993, or 17 years, when it reached 16.9 percent. The rate fell to 12.6 percent in 2001 and has been trending up every since. 
The census bureau, which releases its poverty report every September, has updated its data since the story Allen cited was published. In 2011, the poverty rate for women continued at 16.3 percent, while for all Americans, it fell slightly to 15 percent.

Women in Extreme Poverty

Extreme poverty is defined as living at half the poverty rate. In 2011, that meant earnings of $5,742 or less for an individual and $11,405 for a family of four with two children. In 2011, 6.6 percent of Americans and 7.2 percent of women fell into that category. That’s the highest figure since the Census Bureau started tracking extreme poverty in 1988. So Allen is right.

Why are there more women in poverty than men?

Much of the reason is related to a wage gap, said Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at The  National Women’s Law Center. A large reason in the difference between poverty among men and women is primarily related to the wage gap, she said.

As we’ve previously written, full-time employed women make 77 cents to every dollar full-time employed men make. Several studies have concluded that only a small portion of the difference is caused by sexism. Women generally choose occupations that have relatively low wages and take more time off than men for childbirth and child care.

""Women remain disproportionately in traditionally female occupations, which pay low- and very-low wages, certainly as compared to more integrated and traditionally male occupations,"" said Wendy Pollack, director of the Women’s Law & Policy Project at the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, a nonprofit in Chicago that develops programs and advocates for policies to help the poor.

Entmacher said cuts in public spending during recent years have particularly hurt women. ""Teachers were the largest group of public sector employees affected and teacher jobs are held at a rate of about 70 percent by women,"" she said. ""So public-sector job losses have been a real drag on the recovery for women.""

Our ruling

Allen said, ""The poverty rate amongst women is the worst it’s been in 17 years and the extreme poverty rate is the worst it’s ever been.""

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Voting Record', 'Larry Sabato']","
Georgia, Virginia’s education levels under microscope
","With less than three weeks to go before the presidential election, the voting trends of Georgia’s residents took center stage last week in a story by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The article explored why Georgia’s white voters cast ballots for GOP candidates. The story is similar to a fact check completed earlier this election season by PolitiFact Georgia on which party has more supporters. Election results and the recent makeup of the state Legislature suggested that more Georgians consider themselves Republican.

But why is that?

Political analysts in the story cited several factors, including culture, organization and demographics, specifically educational achievement. In other states such as Virginia and North Carolina -- both of which went for President Barack Obama in the 2008 election -- large groups of highly educated non-Hispanic white voters tend to be more liberal and vote Democratic.

But in Georgia the educational achievement level and voting persuasion of white voters is different.

""I’m pretty sure, despite Atlanta, that Virginia’s educational level among whites is higher than Georgia,"" Larry Sabato, a national political expert at the University of Virginia, said in the AJC story.

From a previous fact check, we knew that more voters in the state identified as Republicans. And an AJC poll released last week showed that Obama had the support of just 22 percent of Georgia’s likely white voters.

But is Sabato correct? Does Virginia have a more highly educated white voting population than Georgia?

Georgia’s secretary of state does not keep statistics on voters’ education or income levels.

Through his political analyst and media relations coordinator, Sabato told us his statement was based on 2008 exit polls conducted by CNN.

Reviewing the exit poll of 1,973 Georgia respondents, 31 percent of those polled were white college graduates, compared with the 40 percent of white college graduates among Virginia’s 2,466 respondents.

Drilling down further into the numbers, of Georgia’s white college graduate respondents, 73 percent voted for then-Republican presidential nominee John McCain, compared with 25 percent for Obama. Among the same demographic in Virginia, the gap between those voting for McCain and Obama was much smaller than in Georgia. Fifty-five percent of Virginia’s white college graduates voted for McCain and 44 percent voted for Obama.

At the postgraduate level, the numbers are even closer. Eleven percent of Georgia’s exit poll respondents identified as postgraduate. Half of those postgraduate voters cast ballots for McCain; 49 percent voted for Obama. Virginia had more postgraduate respondents: 23 percent. Of those, 52 percent voted for Obama, 47 percent for McCain. (That poll did not break down those statistics by race.)

This pattern of voters in Georgia and the Deep South of voting for Republicans has been steady despite the education level, said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University.

""In a state like Virginia where you have a lot of Northern migrants and people coming in from outside the state, things may be different,"" he said.

Looking at the 2008 exit polls, the highest number of McCain votes came from voters with lower education levels, but the main point is that McCain won at every education level, Black said.

Using just the exit poll data, Sabato’s statement has merit, but exit polls are one source. Voter data from the secretary of state and census data are probably more reliable, said Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.

And as far as education and voting, ""the traditional finding from the research is that college graduates are more likely to vote Republican, possibly due to higher incomes, but those with advanced degrees (master’s level and higher) tend to go in the other direction and vote Democrat.""

Three-year estimates of census data from 2008 through 2010 published in April by the Southern Regional Education Board showed that Virginia (36.5 percent) had a higher percentage of whites over age 25 with bachelor’s degrees than Georgia (30.3 percent).

Three-year averages of census data from 2007 through 2009, reported by the National Center for Education Statistics, of whites over age 25 with high school completion and a bachelor’s or higher degree also showed a larger percentage of Virginia residents in that category (37.1 percent) than Georgia residents (31.3 percent).

In a news story about Georgia’s white voters and the tendency to cast ballots for GOP candidates, Sabato described the differences in Virginia and Georgia. ""Despite Atlanta, Virginia’s educational level among whites is higher than Georgia,"" he said. Based on exit polls and census data, Sabato’s statement is correct. Examining the data further shows that Georgia’s white voters at any education level are more likely to vote Republican.

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says the U.S. has more oil rigs in operation than all other countries combined
","
Are we doing enough to produce energy in the United States? That was one of the issues on the table when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat, and former state police Col. Brendan Doherty, a Republican, squared off in a WPRI - Providence Journal debate Oct. 16.

Doherty talked about a bill he supports that would raise revenue for infrastructure by allowing more oil and gas drilling on federally-owned lands.

Cicilline called it ""a big, big giveaway to big oil . . . when we already know, according to the best available data as of February of this year, there are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined.""

More oil rigs in operation than everyone else in the world? That's quite a statistic. We wondered if it is true.

This is a talking point that has been used in the past by the Obama administration. In fact, when we asked the Cicilline campaign for the source of the factoid, they sent us to a blog entry at the White House website that stated it without giving a source or offering any numbers.

PolitiFact Florida looked at the claim (and a related claim) this winter, when President Obama offered it in February during speeches in Miami and earlier in New Hampshire.

They found that the answer wasn't quite so simple.

 The U.S. Energy Information Administration recommended that PolitiFact get the latest count from Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company.

We checked the numbers from two weeks ago. (For even more recent numbers, go here.)

As of Oct. 12, 2012, the company had tallied 1,835 oil and gas drilling rigs in the United States and 1,615 in other countries. (That U.S. number is 188 lower than the 2011 total. The international number is 71 rigs higher.)

However, the Baker Hughes data do not include rigs drilling in Russia or onshore China because those statistics are difficult to get.

Richard Mason, who works for the publication Hart Energy Digital, told PolitiFact in February that ""the last numbers I saw out of Russia, which are 18 months old, had more than 1,000 rigs active.""

Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, another energy publication, cited a report from a Chinese state-owned company that manufactures rigs and rig equipment that showed more than 1,000 land rigs.

As Cicilline’s statement stood, only 221 more international rigs were need to make it False. And the Baker Hughes count is probably missing the approximately 2,000 rigs in Russia and China. And all that was applicable in February.

Our ruling

David Cicilline said, ""There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined."" He said that information comes from ""the best available data"" in February.

He's relying on a count that excludes some of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, calling that the ""best available data.""

It's not.

The best available data would take into account reliable evidence that two thousand rigs are in operation in China and Russia, a number that would allow the world total to overwhelm the U.S. total.

Just because you haven't counted something, doesn't mean it's not there.

For that reason, we rate Cicilline's claim False.

"['Abortion', 'Tennessee', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Tennessee Republican Party']","
Tennessee GOP claims “tax dollars for abortions” supported by Democrats
","Animosity between Planned Parenthood and anti-abortion activists has spilled over into Tennessee politics for years during an ongoing dispute over the use of federal funds, distributed by the state Department of Health, to pay for providing women's health services in the state's two largest counties.

In the current campaign season, the Tennessee Republican Party has reached back to a 2009 state House vote on the so-called ""defunding"" of Planned Parenthood, targeting Democrats who voted against Republican-sponsored measure, in direct-mail advertising attacks.

A mailer directed at former state Rep. Eddie Yokley, D-Greeneville, provides perhaps the strongest example.

""Did you know Eddie Yokley voted to use your tax dollars for abortions?"" the mailer asks in a large headline. The question is answered with another line saying the Democrat ""supported taxpayer funded abortions"" and an arrow pointing to a copy of a House roll call vote June 17, 2009, on HB1756 with Yokley's name circled on the list of 'no' votes.

The state Democratic Party cried foul over this, declaring the mailer claim ""shameless."" Brandon Puttbrese, the Democrats' communication director, pointed out that state law forbids use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions and that the funds in question are not used for abortions.

A Republican rejoinder came from Adam Nickas, executive director of the state GOP:
""Eddie Yokley had an opportunity to vote to defund Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of abortions, but chose not to,"" Nickas said in an email. ""We're not surprised Eddie Yokley is trying to squirm his way out of this one. We stand by our statement.""

The bill in question, HB1756, deals with what are known as federal ""Title X"" funds, distributed to states for ""family planning services,"" including contraception, annual exams, Pap tests, screening for sexually transmitted disease and the like. As amended before passage, the bill did not go as far as anti-abortion activists wanted and basically called for the commissioner of health to give preference to county health departments as recipients of the funds over contracting the services out, which is how Planned Parenthood received the money in Shelby and Davidson counties.

The Title X funds, then, do not go directly to fund abortions. There's no real dispute about that. The argument comes with contentions that the money indirectly supports Planned Parenthood's abortion services, which the organization contends are completely separate.

Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, for example, has called the funding ""a pro-abortion shell game."" He and others say putting money into one Planned Parenthood program, women's health services, frees up money for other services.

It's worth nothing that the wording is toned down somewhat in other GOP mailings. For example, a mailer attacking Rep. Charles Curtiss, D-Sparta, puts it this way: ""Charlie Curtiss voted to send our tax dollars to the largest abortion provider in America.""

Further, a follow-up Republican attack mailer aimed at Yokley, has this wording: ""Eddie Yokley supported Planned Parenthood and opposed a measure that would have prevented them from receiving your tax dollars.""

In any case, the bill, which was in a milder form than subsequent years’ versions and had no real impact on funding of Planned Parenthood, did not involve funding of abortions – certainly not any direct taxpayer payments for them.

Without getting into all the developments on this issue since that 2009 vote, we would note the distinction between Planned Parenthood's many services not related to abortion and its well-known role as an abortion provider was a key part of a 2011 battle in Shelby County over Title X funding. The Shelby County Commission ultimately voted – in accord with the 2011 version of defunding legislation – to take funding away from Planned Parenthood and instead have Christ Community Health Services provide family-planning services to low-income citizens.

In the process, abortion opponents also argued that giving Planned Parenthood money for any purpose frees up other funds and indirectly supports abortions.

Our ruling

A Tennessee Republican Party mailer claims that by voting against a 2009 bill aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood, Democrats were in effect allowing tax dollars to be used directly for abortions. That goes further than even current mainstream Republican dogma that allowing any funding of Planned Parenthood’s family-planning and women’s health initiatives helps indirectly fund abortions.

Voting against the 2009 bill did not, in fact, allow for taxpayer funds to be used for abortions, and we therefore rule the claim False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/21/tennessee-republican-party/tennessee-gop-claims-tax-dollars-abortions-support/

Barack Obama broke promise to cut annual deficit in half by the end of his first term, Rep. Leonard Lance says
","
President Barack Obama hasn’t kept his promise to cut the nation’s annual deficit in half by the end of his first term, according to Rep. Leonard Lance.

The Republican congressman pointed to the president’s broken promise during an Oct. 11 debate against Democratic state Assemblyman Upendra Chivukula. The two will face off in the Nov. 6 election to represent the 7th Congressional District.

""President said when he was running for office four years ago that he would halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term,"" Lance said. ""That simply has not happened, ladies and gentlemen, and it is greatly disturbing.""

Lance’s claim is correct: Obama vowed to cut the annual deficit in half by the end of his first term and, nearly four years later, he hasn’t done so. The federal deficit represents how much the government's spending exceeds its revenues in a given fiscal year. 
Lance claimed Obama offered that promise ""when he was running for office,"" but actually the president made the pledge soon after taking office. Obama made those remarks on Feb. 23, 2009 at an event called the ""Fiscal Responsibility Summit.""

Here’s what he said:

""And that's why today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay -- and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""

The president repeated the pledge the following day during a joint session of Congress: ""And yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office.""

But as the deficit figures show, that bold promise has gone unfulfilled. 
Obama took office in the middle of fiscal year 2009. At the time of his initial pledge, the president said his administration inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit, but the deficit for that fiscal year ultimately reached about $1.4 trillion. 
In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the annual deficits were roughly $1.3 trillion.

For fiscal year 2012, which ended Sept. 30, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated an annual deficit of about $1.1 trillion. That is the last full fiscal year during Obama’s first term.

So, the annual deficit has dropped during Obama’s time in office, but not by half.

In a February 2012 interview on Atlanta’s WAGA-TV, Obama said he wasn’t able to keep that promise because ""this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized.""

Obama added, ""So, the die had been cast, but a lot of us didn't understand at that point how bad it was going to get. That increases the deficit because less tax revenues come in, and it means that more people are getting unemployment insurance, we're helping states more so they don't lay off teachers, etc.

""The key, though, is we're setting ourselves on a path where we can get our debt under control. The most important thing we can do, though, to reduce our debt is to make sure that we continue growing this economy.""

Our ruling

In a debate against his Democratic challenger, Lance claimed that Obama ""said when he was running for office four years ago that he would halve the annual deficit by the end of his first term. That simply has not happened, ladies and gentlemen, and it is greatly disturbing.""

Lance should have said Obama made that pledge soon after he took office, but the congressman’s overall point is solid. The president vowed in February 2009 to cut the annual deficit in half by the end of his first term, and he hasn’t done it.

We rate the statement True.
