Mitt Romney says we're in ""the slowest job recovery since Hoover""
","
During a visit to the Buddy Brew Coffee shop in Tampa on June 16, 2011, presidential candidate Mitt Romney became the latest Republican to invoke the Great Depression while discussing today’s economy.

Taking a shot at the economic record of President Barack Obama, Romney said, ""It's been a failure in the last several years to get America back on track again. It's taken longer to get Americans back to work than it took during the Great Depression. This is the slowest job recovery since Hoover. It breaks my heart. I want to get us back to work."" (By Hoover, Romney meant President Herbert Hoover, who held office from 1929 to early 1933 and presided over the early years of the Great Depression.)

We thought we’d check Romney’s history.

We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment figures. We believe there are two ways to analyze his claim, either by judging the number of jobs created or by tracking how much the unemployment rate decreased. The former is a pretty straightforward number, while the latter is shaped in part by how many people are looking for a job rather than dropping out of the labor market. But while the two statistics aren’t exactly parallel, either one can serve as a reasonable measure of a job recovery.

We also decided to compare recessions by looking at the first 23 months after a given recession officially ended (which is when the recovery officially begins). We chose that period because the last recession ended 23 months ago. Doing it this way provides an equal baseline for comparing all recessions.

The question of when to start counting jobs in a recovery is a point of some debate among economists. The issue came up in an earlier PolitiFact item. However, we’re taking Romney at his literal word, and he said ""the slowest job recovery,"" which is the period after the recession has ended and the recovery has begun.

We used the quasi-official arbiter of recessions -- the National Bureau of Economic Research -- to determine the start and end dates for recessions. We weren’t able to go further back than World War II, since that’s how far back monthly BLS data goes.

Viewers can see how our numbers stacked up for each recovery here. But here’s the gist:

Job creation. We compared the number of employed Americans at the start of the recovery to the number employed at the end of the 23-month period. Then we calculated the percentage increase (or decrease) in employment over that time period.

By this measure, there were two recoveries weaker than the one we’re currently experiencing -- the one from November 2001 to October 2003, under President George W. Bush, and the one from July 1980 to June 1982, under presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. The George W. Bush recovery is especially striking, since the economy actually lost more than 700,000 jobs during the first 23 months after the recession ended.

So by this measure, Romney’s claim that ""this is the slowest job recovery since Hoover"" is incorrect. It’s the third slowest.

Unemployment rate. We compared the unemployment rate at the end of the 23-month period to what it was at the beginning of the period.

By this measure, too, the current recovery is not the weakest. Three recoveries actually saw an increase in the unemployment rate after 23 months (ones under George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Carter/Reagan), while another (under President Richard Nixon) produced a smaller decline in the unemployment rate than the current recovery has. (Because a budding recovery can entice discouraged workers back into the labor force, it’s not unusual for the unemployment rate to rise in a recovery.)

So, depending on the measure you use, there are either two or four recoveries since Hoover that were weaker than the current one.

None of this is to suggest that the current recovery is robust. It isn’t. Measured by jobs created, it has been exceeded on a percentage basis by 10 out of the 12 recessions we looked at. Part of this likely stems from the severity of the recession (which most experts agree is the worst since the Great Depression) and part stems from a long-term trend toward relatively jobless recoveries. The first seven recoveries on our list averaged a jobs bounceback of more than 8 percent; the final five averaged 2 percent. And the latter figure would have been even lower -- half a percent -- had it not been for the unusually strong recovery that started under Reagan in November 1982.

We asked the Romney campaign for a comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Where does this leave us? Romney has a point that the current recovery is relatively weak by historical standards. But it’s inaccurate to say that ""it’s the slowest job recovery since Hoover."" Depending on what yardstick you use, it’s either the third worst or the fifth worst recovery since World War II. That’s not a great accomplishment for the Obama Administration, but we’re checking Romney here, and he chose to make his point in a way that isn’t accurate. So we rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2011/jun/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-were-slowest-job-recovery-hoover/

Wisconsin Rep. Robin Vos says Milwaukee’s police chief can fire officers for no reason
","
In Madison, plenty of familiar fights are being fought as Republicans who control the Legislature seek to undo changes approved when Democrats were in charge.

An unexpected issue -- pay for fired Milwaukee police officers -- joined the list when Republicans introduced a budget amendment that would require city taxpayers to pay wages and benefits for some fired cops while they appealed their dismissals.

That had long been the practice in Milwaukee.

In some cases, dismissed officers collected pay for years while their appeals dragged on. They kept it even if their firing ultimately was upheld by the Fire and Police Commission.

That changed in the wake of the Frank Jude beating case.

In 2004, Jude was attacked by off-duty Milwaukee police officers after he left a party on the south side. Nine officers were fired for their role in incident, and public outrage mounted as officers received pay while they fought their dismissals.

In 2008, the Legislature cut off pay immediately for officers who were fired for behavior that resulted in serious charges. At that time, city officials said taxpayers had paid fired officers $4.4 million in pay and benefits since 1990, including $400,000 alone for the officers involved in the Jude case.

In 2009, the law was expanded, cutting off pay for officers fired for other reasons, such as department rule violations. That covers nearly all fired officers, because rule violations such as lying are the most common reason for firing.

The new amendment, to return to the 2008 system, which focused on serious infractions, was authored by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee.

The issue is a hot button one: The union representing officers has traditionally fought to have dismissed cops kept on the payroll as long as possible. Meanwhile, the chief’s authority is diminished when a cop he fires remains on the payroll.

When the amendment was adopted at a June 2, 2011, committee meeting, Vos said the change was needed because Milwaukee is the only city that allows its police chief to fire officers ""for basically no cause.""

He continued: ""That’s an awful lot of power we don’t grant to any other police chief in the state.""

That caught our attention, especially since the earlier changes were billed as putting Milwaukee more in line with other communities.

Does the Milwaukee police chief really have such unbridled powers? Can he really fire someone for no reason?

The short answer: No.

The longer answer: State law spells out how the Milwaukee Police Department is organized and managed.

They key provision on this point: ""No member of the police force or fire department may be discharged or suspended for a term exceeding 30 days by the chief of either of the departments except for cause and after trial under this section.""

Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn put it another way: ""Maybe he’s confused between just cause and just ‘cause.""

As in, ""just because.""

State law spells out seven standards that must be met before a Milwaukee police officer can be fired. They include such things as whether the chief has ""substantial evidence"" that a rule was broken, has conducted a fair investigation and whether the officer knew that his or her actions could have serious consequences.

A fired officer has 10 days to file an appeal with the Fire and Police Commission.

Asked about the statement, Vos aide Kit Beyer said: ""He misspoke. He hasn’t said it since then.""

When Vos returned our call, he said: ""Do I understand that you have to have a reason (to fire an officer)? ""Yes.""

What is Vos trying to accomplish with the amendment?

He says fired police officers should be treated the same throughout the state. Officers elsewhere are suspended with pay by the chief and the firing is done by the local fire and police commission, he said. In Milwaukee, the chief fires an officer and then the officer could suffer months without pay and benefits while waiting for his appeal to be heard, Vos said.

But the amendment does not change the sequence in Milwaukee to match other communities. It simply requires that officers fired for rules violations be paid during appeal.

Vos argues keeping them on the payroll would encourage the fire and police commission to swiftly resolve the matter. However, city officials say when that system was in place it encouraged officers to drag out the appeals process.

The net effect of the amendment is financial, said Michael Tobin, executive director of the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission.

""It will allow most (fired) officers to remain on the payroll, because most are charged with rule violations"" rather than crimes, Tobin said.

Since taking over as chief in January 2008, Flynn has dismissed about 20 officers, almost all for rule violations.

Tobin said the amendment would allow the officers to collect at least an additional two months of pay and benefits, because the commission must wait 60 days before scheduling an appeals hearing. Those charged with more serious offenses would not receive pay.

So what’s our verdict?

Vos argued state law must be changed because the Milwaukee chief can fire officers for no cause. That’s False … even Vos acknowledged it.",/factchecks/2011/jun/16/robin-vos/wisconsin-rep-robin-vos-says-milwaukees-police-chi/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Adam Hasner']","
Adam Hasner says George LeMieux ""falsely attacked Marco Rubio""
","
In Republican circles in Florida it's hail to Marco Rubio -- the former state legislator from Miami-Dade County who beat Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek and Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent, to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2010. In 2012, Republican candidates will likely be clamoring to share the stage with the young, charismatic Rubio -- including Adam Hasner, who is running in a Republican primary for the other U.S. Senate seat now held by Bill Nelson.

Hasner will face George LeMieux, among others, in the GOP primary. LeMieux was once Crist's ""maestro"" -- serving as Crist's campaign manager and then his chief of staff when Crist was governor. Crist returned the favor and appointed LeMieux to serve out a vacancy in the U.S. Senate in 2009.

Hasner portrays LeMieux as the foe of Rubio in an Internet ad he released June 10, 2011. Set against a backdrop of a photo of Crist, here is the text of the ad:

 Defended President Obama's Stimulus As ""Helpful To Florida"" 
Fought For Taxpayer Funded Bailout Of Big Sugar

Architect of Obama-Style Cap And Trade Plan For Florida

Falsely Attacked Marco Rubio

Even Compared Marco Rubio To Barack Obama

Charlie Crist -- Right?

Wrong.

As the word ""wrong"" appears, the camera zooms out on the picture of Crist. There is LeMieux, whispering in Crist's ear. The ad finishes -- ""Get to know the Real George LeMieux.""

We're checking Hasner's claim that LeMieux compared Rubio to Obama in a separate item. In this case, we will examine whether LeMieux ""falsely attacked Marco Rubio."" The ad doesn't state the subject of the attack but attributes it to a May 9, 2009, St. Petersburg Times article. Hasner spokesman Rick Wilson sent us the article in an e-mail, and said that the false attack was that LeMieux labeled Rubio a tax raiser.

From the article: '""Marco Rubio supported the largest tax increase in Florida history when he wanted to raise the sales tax by 2 or 3 pennies,"" LeMieux said of Rubio's 2007 tax swap plan (the Democratic Party already is using that as an anti-Rubio talking point).

We've written about Rubio's tax swap plan before. The idea surfaced during Rubio's first months as speaker in early 2007, as the Legislature and Crist were looking for ways to cut property taxes for Floridians. Rubio's proposal would scratch property taxes on all primary residences. In its place, the state sales tax would be increased by 2.5 cents per dollar -- subject to voter approval.

A state House analysis originally said the swap would save taxpayers a total of $5.8 billion in the first year.

But whether you saved money or spent more money at the end of the year likely depended on your individual circumstances. Back in 2007, the Times ran calculations under Rubio's proposal for both homeowners and renters.

 The homeowners

A family of four with an annual income of $64,280. Home value: $241,100

CURRENT
Property tax bill in Tampa: $5,061.06
Sales taxes paid: $951

PROPOSED
Property tax bill in Tampa: $0
Sales taxes paid: $1,290

Under Rubio's plan, these homeowners would have paid $4,722 less in state taxes, the Times found. Contrast that with renters:

The renters

A family of two with an annual income of $46,914

CURRENT
Rent: $851
Sales taxes paid: $691

PROPOSED
Rent: $851
Sales taxes paid: $937 
Under Rubio's plan, these renters would pay an additional $246 a year in taxes. The rental property owners also would still have to pay property taxes, meaning rent wouldn't be affected.

Overall, on the micro level, some people would pay more and others would pay less. At the macro level, two different studies said Floridians would have paid less in taxes -- between $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion. As such we rated a claim by Crist that the plan was a ""massive increase"" in taxes False.

In his web ad, Hasner said LeMieux ""falsely attacked Marco Rubio."" The ad cites a newspaper article in which LeMieux said Rubio's tax swap proposal was the ""largest tax increase in Florida history."" PolitiFact Florida previously ruled that Rubio's plan was a tax decrease so there's no doubt it is a false attack.

Our only quibble is that the ad failed to explain what Hasner was talking about -- so viewers are left guessing. Our definition of Mostly True is that ""The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."" That's a good fit in this case. We rate Hasner's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/16/adam-hasner/hasner-says-lemieux-falsely-attacked-marco-rubio/

Roger Williams says he signed no-tax pledge 4 times
","
U.S. Senate hopeful Roger Williams stressed his opposition to higher taxes during a June 8 candidate forum presented by the Texas Tribune and KLRU-TV, saying: ""I've signed that pledge four times. The idea of raising taxes any time, but certainly at a time of economic slowdown, is nuts.""

Williams, a Republican, is making his first bid for elected office, so his comment seemed a head-scratcher. How many no-tax pledges can one candidate sign?

On behalf of Williams, campaign spokesman Colby Hale told us Williams has twice signed no-tax pledges from Americans for Tax Reform, has signed the American Family Business Institute no ""death tax"" pledge and, Hale said he believes, a ""few different Tea Party (no-tax) pledges at various rallies."" Hale said he thinks Williams also signed a ""No Climate Tax"" pledge for Americans for Prosperity.

We checked his list.

By email, Patrick Gleason of Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform said Williams signed its pledge Feb. 9 and once before then. The pledge says the individual will ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses"" and also will ""oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.""

The American Family Business Institute forwarded a copy of the Death Tax Repeal Pledge signed by Williams May 10. It states the signers will support the ""permanent repeal of the federal estate and gift taxes."" Spokesman Adam Nicholson said by email that Williams also signed the pledge earlier because the group asks candidates to sign for each election cycle. Last year, Williams was among candidates geared up to run for U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison’s seat when she said she was considering stepping down to run for governor.

Later, Williams’ campaign forwarded a copy of the no-climate tax pledge -- avowing opposition to any climate-change legislation that includes a net increase in government revenue -- signed by Williams on Feb. 14.

So, Williams has signed at least three anti-tax pledges--two of them twice. We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/16/roger-williams/roger-williams-says-hes-signed-no-tax-pledge-four-/
"['Ohio', 'Federal Budget', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says Senate Democrats neglected basic responsibilities by not passing a budget
","
Legislators haven't stopped using speeches, news releases and snail mail to deliver messages, but they increasingly rely on social media like Twitter and Facebook to make points quickly and constantly, if sometimes too briefly.

Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman, for example, sent this tweet on May 17: ""We’re in a fiscal crisis, yet the Democrat led Senate has not passed a budget in 748 days.""

Twitter limits statements to 140 characters, so we asked Portman's office for elaboration.

We were referred to a news release posted on his website on May 19. It quotes Portman, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, saying: ""It is a shame that while our nation is in a fiscal crisis and families and small businesses are forced to do more with less, the Democrat-led Senate has failed to pass a budget for 750 days now. By failing to pass and live within a budget, something Ohio families and small businesses do on a regular basis, Senate Democrats have neglected one of their most basic responsibilities.""

If a basic responsibility of Senate Republicans is staying ""on message,"" Portman did his duty.

We recognized his point as one that was made the same day by the National Republican Senatorial Committee -- which added a specific reference to Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat up for re-election next year.

""Every month, every Ohio family has to put together a budget and live within their means, yet Sherrod Brown and his fellow liberal Democrats apparently don't believe they should be held to that same standard in Washington,"" said NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox.  ""Passing a federal budget each year is the most basic responsibility of the Congress, but for more than four years Brown has been content to kick the can down the road and keep maxing out the government credit card.  Now here we are after 750 days, and Brown and his fellow Democrats won't even propose a budget, let alone pass one.""

Updated versions of the one-size-fits-all statement have been issuing from the NRSC since then (""760 days and counting,"" ""770 days and counting""), targeting Brown and at least seven other Senate Democrats.

We did some simple subtraction and got back to April 29, 2009 -- which was, according to the Congressional Research Service and news sources, when the Senate passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2010.

None has passed since, so the time tally in the statements from Portman and the NRSC is accurate.

But we wondered if that meant the Senate, under Democratic control, had neglected its basic responsibility.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida had the same question. Building on earlier work by our PolitiFact National colleagues, they found the claim lacks important details.

A budget resolution is a policy plan that outlines the intent of Congress, but it is not an appropriations bill, or spending bill, which actually allocates money for specific purposes. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money.

The inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority party's organizational skills and/or on the degree of partisan discord in Congress.

Since 1983 -- the first year the Senate and House stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and started passing one -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, which was under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution.

On three other occasions -- fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007 -- the Senate and House failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In those three cases, Republicans were in the majority in both chambers.

Jason Peuquet, staff analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think tank, told PolitiFact Florida that the lack of a budget resolution makes the Democrats appear irresponsible, though they have continued to allocate dollars as needed  through other spending bills

""But the larger picture is that lawmakers in Congress and the administration have so far not enacted a long-term fiscal plan to stabilize and reduce the debt,"" Peuquet said. ""That is the true metric of fiscal responsibility, and there is plenty of blame to go around for both parties as to why our fiscal outlook is so dire.""

While the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Portman have correctly stated the number of days since a budget passed the Senate, their statements are loaded with a certain amount of hyperbole.

The claim implies that the stalled budget process is the exclusive fault of Senate Democrats and not a function of partisan politics on both sides. It also fails to note that since 1983, the GOP was in control of both houses of Congress in three of the four years that a budget resolution wasn’t approved.

Those are important details to know.

On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but leaves out important details can get just one rating: Half True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/16/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-chides-senate-democrats-not-passin/

Oregon PERS: Making more millionaires than the Oregon Lottery?
","
Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, does not shy from controversy. In 2003, he took on Portland City Commissioner Randy Leonard over urban-rural school funding. Earlier this year, Ferrioli told an out-of-country wolf lover to ""go away."" And in April, he posted online a column on Oregon’s Public Employees Retirement System that generated more than 220 comments and more than 350 ""likes.""

Ferrioli swipes hard at Oregon’s public retirement system in his ""PERS makes more millionaires than the lottery,"" saying that its whacked-out generosity means fewer dollars for public schools and more money for public workers. He writes, ""The Public Employee Retirement System is making more millionaires than the Oregon state lottery"" and later, ""You'd be hard pressed to find any place in the private sector where individuals retire as millionaires but don't contribute a dime to their retirement.""

There is probably no topic in government that frosts Republicans more than PERS. What, you ask, is PERS and how is it that people can retire as millionaires without contributing ""a dime to their retirement?"" as Ferrioli says. We’ll explain.

In the op-ed, Ferrioli said there were 241 employees who had more than $500,000 in their PERS accounts as of December 2009. These employees could choose to retire under an option that gives them $1 million in one payout. Megabucks, he wrote on the other hand, had produced 227 millionaires.

However, the numbers are not accurate. PERS spokesman David Crosley said PERS goofed and the 241 should have been 214.

And the number of lottery winners is higher than indicated by Ferrioli. According to Oregon Lottery spokesman Chuck Baumann, there were 229 Megabucks millionaires, 26 Powerball millionaires, eight Lotto-America millionaires, five Wheel Spin millionaires, seven Raffle millionaires, one Keno millionaire, and eight Scratch-it  millionaires for a total of 284 Oregon Lottery millionaires.

We asked Michael Gay, Ferrioli’s spokesman, to reassess given the corrected figures. Gay expanded his boss’s argument, saying that while there are 214 accounts with at least $500,000, there are in fact, thousands more actual retirees who are collecting at least $4,500 a month, which would make their annual pay $54,000 and their eventual pay over 20 years of expected living $1.08 million. (We looked at the figures, and found there are 441 retirees as of December 2009 who are collecting at least $9,000 a month, or $108,000 a year. These people would easily hit $1 million with just 10 years of retirement.)

Still, we don’t think it’s fair to count among the ""millionaires"" people who are expected to get paid in future installments. To check that instinct, we called Brent Hamilton, president of the Financial Planning Association of Oregon and Southwest Washington. He said he doesn’t count personal assets, such as cars and homes, when screening people for investment purposes. Instead, he focuses on ""investable assets,"" like liquid money in the bank. A monthly check isn’t the same as money in the bank.

On the face of it, Ferrioli is wrong in stating that PERS has created more millionaires than the Lottery. But we get his larger point. These are people who can retire with at least $1 million under the ""double lump sum"" option -- even $2 million in a rare handful of cases. His analysis also doesn’t include retirees in previous years who may have taken the double lump sum option. These retirees most likely didn’t contribute any part of their pay into retirement, unlike people in the private sector because in Oregon, the public employer ""picks up"" most employee contributions -- 6 percent -- on behalf of workers.

Some lawmakers, including Ferrioli, have fought to make employees pay the cost of their own contribution. Public employees argue that they are paying out of their pockets, because it’s a bargained-for right they negotiated years ago as part of their compensation package.  

Just out of curiosity, we wanted to know how $1 million retirement balance ranks in size. Jack VanDerhei of the Employee Benefit Research Institute says that for people in their 60s with at least 30 years on the job, the average 401(k) balance is closer to $192,000. So $500,000 -- or $1 million under the option -- is pretty plush.

The retirement system certainly is generous for some of Oregon’s oldest public employees, with a retirement provision no longer afforded those in the private sector. That’s not the case with younger and newer Oregon employees, who may have the government pick up their contribution, but who didn’t benefit from the generous returns of the 1980s and 1990s.

In short, most state workers don’t end up as millionaires, and with PERS reforms in 2003 and possible reforms this year, the number of potential millionaires should go down. Plus, all lottery winners have to do to win is buy tickets, while the PERS ""millionaires"" have worked at least 30 years on the job.

We’re not going to get hung up over the actual numbers. We rate the claim Half True: partially accurate with some important details and context missing.",/factchecks/2011/jun/16/ted-ferrioli/oregon-pers-making-more-millionaires-oregon-lotter/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'New Jersey Assembly Democrats']","
New Jersey Democrats say Gov. Chris Christie caused a 4.1 percent increase in property taxes
","
The blame game over New Jersey’s rising property taxes has been under way in Trenton for decades, and the current debate over last year’s increases is no different.

In various public statements, Assembly Democrats have blamed Republican Gov. Chris Christie for the following statistic: property taxes increased 4.1 percent in 2010, marking the highest increase since 2007.

""New Jersey property taxes increased 4.1 percent in 2010,"" according to a May 10 press release. ""This is the highest increase since 2007.""

That number showed up in the press release as one of the examples of the ""governor’s property tax failure."" Assembly Democrats said the tax hike followed cuts made by Christie to school and municipal aid.

PolitiFact New Jersey found the Assembly Democrats’ numbers to be accurate. A report by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs shows that the average residential property tax bill increased in 2010 by 4.1 percent.

That report also points out that last year’s percentage increase was higher than the 3.3 percent and 3.7 percent increases in 2009 and 2008, respectively. (Because of budget increases, average bills went up by 5.4 percent in 2007 and 7 percent in 2006, according to the report.)

But PolitiFact New Jersey still thought some things were missing from the Democrats’ underlying argument that Christie bears responsibility for the 2010 tax hikes. It’s worth noting that Christie didn’t begin his tenure until after the previous fiscal year had started, and some policy decisions affecting the beginning of 2010 predated him.

For a clearer picture, we reached out to five experts on economic policy and taxes, and learned that although they believe Christie holds some responsibility, the property tax hikes also had to do with the recession and rising costs facing local officials.

As some experts pointed out, there’s no doubt the reduction in state aid last year contributed to property tax increases. Property taxes are determined by county, municipal and school officials, but their local budgets are influenced by the level of state aid received.

To help meet an $11 billion budget gap, Christie’s first budget as governor cut school aid by about $829 million and reduced municipal aid by nearly $446 million, according to the state’s ""Citizens’ Guide to the Budget.""

Democrats are blaming Christie for those aid reductions, but keep this in mind: the cuts were part of a budget approved by the Legislature, including both Democratic and Republican representatives.

Referring to the decision to not raise state taxes to meet the revenue shortfall, Rutgers University professor Joseph Seneca said: ""It was a shock to the way fiscal business was done in New Jersey before.""

Glen Fandl, an adjunct professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, said the aid reduction played a role in the tax hikes, but he argued a larger factor is that the number of municipal revaluations slowed in 2010 due to declining property values.

In revaluations, properties’ assessed values are revised -- meaning the amounts that taxes are based on -- and tax rates are reduced. Without as many revaluations, tax rates mostly went up in 2010, Fandl said. Fandl said another reason was a significant increase in tax appeals from commercial property owners.

Fandl said of Christie: ""The recession’s not his fault.""

Fandl noted that towns and school districts still faced contractual obligations to their employees, despite cutting expenses.

Rising utility and healthcare costs are beyond Christie’s control, but at the same time, the governor declined last year to support extending a higher tax rate on personal income over $1 million, according to Jon Shure of the Washington, DC-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center leans Democratic.

The state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services estimated the higher rate would have generated about $637 million for the property tax relief fund in the current fiscal year.

""Any time New Jersey reduces its state income tax, it has less money available for property tax relief,"" said Shure, former president of the Trenton-based New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning think tank.

David Brunori, a research professor at The George Washington University in Washington, DC, offered a few other targets to place blame for the tax hikes, including the dependence on state aid and a desire to maintain the same level of local services. New Jerseyans want a great deal of services and there are two ways of paying for them: state aid and higher property taxes, Brunori said.

Across the country, states historically cut local aid when faced with budget deficits, Brunori said. At the end of the day, towns decided to maintain services, he said.

""I’m not sure I would blame the governor,"" Brunori said.

Montclair State University assistant professor James DiGabriele said he’s not blaming anybody, including Christie. The larger problem is that government has not revised its structure for generating revenue, DiGabriele said. Towns could charge a fee for services, such as garbage collection, he said.

""In the new economy, I don’t know if we have a choice,"" DiGabriele said.

Pointing to the number of school administrators and school boards, Fandl said there is so much home rule in New Jersey that is driving up costs. That system itself is the problem, Fandl said.

""The costs are never going to go down and that’s the problem,"" Fandl said.

Now let’s go back to the blame game:

The Assembly Democrats are criticizing Christie for tax increases in 2010. They are correct taxes increased 4.1 percent.

The governor’s aid cuts contributed to the tax hikes, and Christie rejected a tax increase that would have provided more property tax relief. But some Democratic legislators also signed off on aid reductions by approving the state budget.

There also are several other factors at play here -- the recession, declining property values, tax appeals, rising costs, a local desire to maintain services and an expensive system of running school districts.

We rate the Democrats’ statement Half True.

Head of R.I. public policy group says federal law bans use of incandescent bulbs
","
You’ve heard the jokes before -- how many so-and-so’s does it take to screw in a light bulb?

While light bulbs are remarkably simple to use, new energy efficiency mandates have complicated matters. And that has some people riled up.

Appearing as a guest on WHJJ-AM’s ""Helen Glover Show,"" Mike Stenhouse, executive director of the Ocean State Policy Research Institute, complained about federal regulations that will mean lights out for the traditional incandescent light bulb.

""They’re basically telling you that the normal light bulbs that we have always used, that Thomas Edison invented, are going to be illegal, I mean, imagine that, they are going to be illegal to use and they have to be replaced,"" he said.

He continued, ""It’s just crazy that the government will make us, MAKE US, force us, make it illegal to use the old bulbs and we have to use these new ones and that is just tyranny.""

A light bulb went off here at PolitiFact and we wondered: Is it true that it will be illegal to use our old bulbs? ""

When we asked Stenhouse to shine some light on his statement, he referred us to a video of a speech on the floor of Congress by U.S. Rep.Ted Poe,  R-Texas. In it, Poe hit on several of the themes that Stenhouse echoed, namely that the government is over-reaching its proper role in setting new efficiency standards for light bulbs.

Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh and Tea Party leaders, have railed against the law.

It turns out that our colleagues at PolitiFact National looked into similar claims -- by AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates -- that old incandescents would have to be tossed out and replaced with energy efficient ones.

To begin, let’s go back to 1879 when Thomas Edison invented the forerunner of the modern-day  incandescent bulb. Its technology has changed little in the ensuing 132 years. Today, incandescent bulbs are used in an estimated 3 billion of the 4 billion light fixtures  the country.

But in recent years, with rising energy costs and growing concerns about climate change, demand for more energy-efficient lighting has gained momentum. Incandescents are terribly inefficient, with 90 percent of the energy they consume lost through heat.

Responding to those concerns, then-President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which received a measure of bipartisan support in Congress. (It passed in the House 264 to 163, with 36 Republicans voting in favor, and in the Senate, 65 to 27, with 20 Republicans voting in favor.

The act deals with a broad range of energy-consumption issues, including light bulb efficiency. Section 321  spells out the new standards, essentially requiring light bulbs to use 27 percent less energy than traditional incandescents.

The law, while setting efficiency standards for light bulbs, does not ban or favor one type of bulb over another, according to a ""backgrounder"" put out by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But it will, in effect, end production of traditional incandescent bulbs, beginning with 100-watt bulbs in 2012, then 75-watt bulbs in 2013 and ending with 40-watt bulbs in 2014.

Halogen incandescent bulbs will meet the new standards as will still-pricey LEDs and popular and more affordable compact fluorescent light bulbs, or CFLs. Prices today are $40 to $50 for an LED, $3 for fluorescent alternatives and $1.50 for halogen incandescents, compared with about 50 cents for a typical 100-watt incandescent.

We note, by the way, that Stenhouse echoed concerns about mercury in CFLs, saying, ""If you break them... your home becomes a hazardous area.""

But the EPA calls that a ""myth,"" saying that ""airing out and removing the bulb pieces from the room will quickly dissipate any mercury vapor."" The EPA also labels as myth assertions, repeated by Stenhouse, that CFLs will raise mercury levels in the environment. The agency says coal power plants are the  ""main emitter"" of mercury in the United States, PolitiFact National rated a claim that CFLs are ""toxic"" and  ""not environmentally friendly"" as Half True.

Setting aside these issues about CFLs and, more broadly the merits of the law itself, we return to the question that consumers will want answers to  beginning in 2012: Will the law, as Stenhouse states, ""make it illegal to use the old bulbs.""

While the bill sets standards for new light bulbs ""manufactured or imported"" to the United States, it does not address using old bulbs that don’t meet the new standards.
   
When reached by PolitiFact National, Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said people can keep using their old incandescent bulbs and stores can continue to sell them -- even after the new standards are in place -- until they are sold out.
   
""There are no energy police coming to your home to make you remove your light bulbs,"" said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a 30-year-old advocacy organization that advises lawmakers and conducts research.

Stenhouse admitted the possibility that he ""might have made a little mistake there"" in saying that incandescents will be illegal to use -- a statement he made at two separate points of his appearance.

Also, he emphasized that his appearances as a guest of Glover, the former Survivor contestant, are part of  his group’s ""Liberty Bytes"" program. He said the initiative encourages listeners to ask how issues reported in the news ""affect your personal liberties....It’s not our research...it’s all based on media accounts.""

""Obviously, we were convinced that it was accurate,"" he said, but added, ""We did not take the next step of going into the bill and looking up this stuff ourselves.""

We don’t think it would have taken that much research to get a simple and key fact about the bill straight. We found numerous references, including at the Department of Energy website, where  a Q & A states that, ""Consumers will have the choice to continue using traditional incandescent bulbs for as long as they last, or switch to more efficient bulbs.""

Stenhouse needn’t fret personally about which bulbs to use. There’s plenty of light emanating from his trousers. We rate this one Pants on Fire!

Rubio says mobile phone, e-mail, Internet, GPS stem from 'American miracle'
","
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio used his first speech on the Senate floor, on June 14, 2011, to evoke the American dream. The so-called maiden speech is a ""big deal for a senator,"" said fellow Florida Sen. Bill Nelson — and Rubio went for big ideas.

""America is not perfect,"" said the freshman Republican, the child of Cuban immigrants. ""... But since her earliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world. Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one. Many others decided they could not wait. And so they came here from everywhere, to pursue their dreams and to work to leave their children better off than themselves. And the result was the American miracle.""

As he held the floor for nearly 15 minutes, Rubio highlighted rags-to-riches stories that he said happen ""only in America,"" describing the founders of Nordstrom, Mattel and eBay. When he finished, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., commended him, saying, ""No one expresses American exceptionalism better than Sen. Rubio.""

Rubio traced America’s role in the 20th century, from two world wars to the Cold War and the defeat of communism. Then he turned to other contributions:

While our military and foreign policy contributions helped save the world, it was our economic and cultural innovations that helped transform it. 
The fruits of the American miracle can be found in the daily lives of people everywhere. 
Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle. 
Anywhere in the world, when a bone marrow, lung or heart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the American miracle. 
And on one night in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle firsthand. 
For on that night an American walked on the surface of the moon, and it was clear to the whole world that these Americans… could do anything.

We briefly considered wading into fringe conspiracy theories about whether astronauts actually walked on the moon, but got control of ourselves. We were more curious about his other technology claims. Were Americans truly the ones responsible for innovation of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and the global positioning system?

We dropped a line to Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos, who provided us with links about inventors of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and GPS. Indeed, stories from The Telegraph (via Huffington Post), NPR, the Internet Society, PBS and MITnews identify American origins for all four technologies. But these are complex systems that have developed over time. We wondered: Was there more to the story?

Mobile phone

A lot fits under the umbrella ""mobile phone"" -- including, say, early radio technology that led to car phones by the 1940s. But Rubio’s spokesman pointed to the inventor of the first portable cellular phone, which is fine by us. (Did you think of dawn-of-the-1900s ship-to-shore communication when Rubio said ""mobile phone""? We didn’t think so.)

Martin Cooper worked for Illinois company Motorola as it developed the DynaTAC phone and the cellular network behind it in the early 1970s. The lead engineer for the team that developed the phone, Martin made the first wireless call from Manhattan in 1973. The FCC approved the phone -- the world’s first commercial portable cell phone -- for regular folks in 1983.

Now, Japan and some European countries were quicker to deploy cellular networks, in the late ‘70s and very early ‘80s. But Paul Levinson, a Fordham University professor who wrote the 2004 book ""Cellphone: The Story of the World's Most Mobile Medium and How It Has Transformed Everything!"" says it’s the phone that matters.

""That was the breakthrough,"" he said ""There were several different companies and scientists working on it. … But no one believed that it could be done. … So everything that came afterwards was based on that first breakthrough.""

An American breakthrough. Score one for Rubio.

Internet & E-mail

We read the work from the Internet Society and PBS that Burgos sent our way, then exchanged messages with Stephen Stein, who teaches the history of technology at the University of Memphis.

Computer networks that led to the Internet we know today include Arpanet , a 1970s project of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NSFnet, created by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. These projects, with their indisputably American roots, provided two cornerstones of the modern-day Web: the TCP/IP protocol and a major communications backbone.

But Stein pointed out that the way we interact with the Internet owes much to the work of Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who worked for CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland. It was there -- in the late ‘80s as NSFnet was being developed in the United States -- that Berners-Lee ""developed the whole concept of the World Wide Web,"" Stein said. (There’s more on this in a PBS article related to the one Burgos sent.)

HTTP? HTML? Both Berners-Lee.

""So, yes, Americans developed the Internet, but Berners-Lee made it user-friendly,"" Stein said.

Meanwhile, Virginia Tech scholar Janet Abbate says in her 1999 book ""Inventing the Internet,"" published by MIT Press, that even in the expansion of Arpanet , Americans enlisted the help of computer experts from England and France. She also points to Berners-Lee’s contributions, saying, ""The history of the Internet is not … a story of a few heroic inventors; it is a tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players.""

The origins of e-mail, as you might expect, are entwined with the Internet. Electronic mail was part of the development of Arpanet in the early ‘70s, according to Stein, Abbate and others. American programmer Ray Tomlinson gets credit (and tongue-in-cheek blame) for the first working network mail program, picked up by users of Arpanet sites. 
Here's what Abbate told us when we asked her about Rubio's claim. 
""I think it's an overstatement to call the Internet a purely American product. Certainly other countries were building their own computer networks (and inter-networks) in parallel with the U.S.; these other networks eventually became part of the Internet,"" Abbate said. ""Also, the Internet itself (as opposed to the earlier Apranet) was a collaborative effort with input from computer scientists in France and elsewhere, and I argue in my book that the diversity of input made the resulting system stronger. I do think the U.S. did a remarkably good job with the Internet design and expansion, maybe better than anyone else would or could have done. But if the resulting Internet hadn't suited other countries' needs, they were perfectly capable of creating their own networks (indeed, for a while there were a number of different competing network systems before TCP/IP eventually became the standard). 
""And of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN, not in the US or by an American. So does that mean we in the U.S. are enjoying the benefits of the ""Swiss miracle"" every time we use the Web?"" 
GPS

The satellite technology that puts some of the smart in your smart phone and informs your car’s navigation system is a system of satellites funded by taxpayers and operated by the U.S. government. So calling the global positioning system an ""American miracle"" is no stretch. The technology was born at Aerospace Corp., a military research contractor in El Segundo, Calif. Its founding president was New York native Ivan Getting. That isn’t to say there aren’t foreign navigation satellites. The United States cooperates with Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia on global navigation satellite systems, sometimes referred to as GNSS. But Rubio said GPS, and the history there is fairly clear -cut.

The ruling

What to make of all of this?

Rubio's basic point, that the technology behind mobile phones, e-mail, the Internet and GPS all have American roots, holds up. It’s true ""in a general sense,"" said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes on our relationship with technology. Or, as the University of Memphis professor, Stein, put it: ""The statement is superficially correct, but there is (as usual) more to the story."" Stein was most concerned about the non-American role in the development of the Internet, especially the substantial contribution of England's Berners-Lee.

It’s also important to note in the context of Rubio’s ""only in America"" rhetoric that while the United States led, it wasn’t alone in its innovation. Other nations’ researchers contributed to the early Internet; commercial mobile phone networks were available overseas before they were in America; other nations operate satellite navigation systems. But in these areas and many others, Americans can claim primacy. We rate Rubio’s statement, that ""when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle,"" Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/15/marco-rubio/rubio-says-mobile-phone-email-internet-gps-stem-am/

Did Medicare Part D come in 40 percent under budget because of its design?
","
For some fiscal conservatives, the Medicare prescription drug benefit remains a symbol of when Republicans lost their way. So it wasn't surprising that it came up when Republican candidates for president debated on May 5, 2011, in South Carolina. 

Rick Santorum was a U.S. senator when the plan was passed in 2003. Then, he voted in favor of the plan, a vote he has since called a mistake. Santorum got this question at the debate: ""You voted for it. It's cost hundreds of billions of dollars. You've said you regretted that vote now. As president, would you work to repeal that and leave the 25 million-plus seniors, who now enjoy that benefit, without it?""

""No,"" Santorum said. ""What I would do is work to reform the entire Medicare system, which is what's being proposed by Paul Ryan and what I've been proposing for a very long time. One of the reasons I actually voted for the Medicare prescription drug plan was because it was a private sector operated plan. It was not, as the current Medicare system is, and what Obamacare is, a government-run, top-down type of approach. And in fact, the way we designed that program resulted in the program coming in 40 percent under budget. ... And the reason it was, is because the design was right.""

The Medicare prescription drug plan, also known as Medicare Part D, helps pay for prescription drugs for people eligible for Medicare. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. Most beneficiaries get to choose from an average of 33 different plans. The average monthly premium is about $40, but costs and coverage varies with each plan. In addition to premiums, beneficiaries typically pay a deductible, and they pay a portion of the prescription costs. Beneficiaries can change plans every year if they wish. 

Even by fact-checking standards, Medicare Part D is a pretty complex plan, and we're leaving out an excruciating level of detail here. Fortunately, there's a government website where they can type in their prescriptions and dosages, and the website spits out information to help with the decision. 

We decided to check Santorum's numbers on whether the plan came in under budget. We also wanted to understand why it came in under budget. Was it really because of the plan's design? 

First, the numbers. Did it come in 40 percent under budget?

We asked Santorum's campaign for their source but didn't hear back. There are two official estimates for Medicare Part D costs, one put out by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and another put out by the board of trustees for the Medicare trust funds. These reports calculated potential costs differently, so there are different sets of numbers to work with. The board of trustees projected costs higher than the Congressional Budget Office, so if you use the trustees' numbers, the savings are greater and come closer to 40 percent.

If you use the Congressional Budget Office numbers, the savings are somewhat lower. In addition, two analysts we spoke with said you have to subtract the premiums that patients pay, as well as contributions from the states. If you account for those sources of revenue, the program comes in about 28 percent below budget, said Edwin Park, an analyst with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He walked us through his analysis, and it seemed like a reasonable, though different, way to calculate costs.

Whether it's 40 percent or 28 percent, though, we found wide consensus that the program is coming in under budget.

Next, why is it under budget? Santorum says it was because of the program's design, because it was a private-sector operated plan.

One reason it came in under budget is fairly straightforward: Not as many people signed up for the benefit as the government expected. The government projected that about 93 percent of people who use Medicare would also sign up for the prescription drug benefit. But actual enrollment is only at about 77 percent of those eligible, a significant difference. It's not clear why fewer people signed up -- whether they didn't know about the program, didn't need it or for some other reason. But it's hard to say for sure, and we couldn't find any studies on the matter. 

The other reason costs came in under budget is that drug spending did not increase in the 2000s as fast as it increased in the 1990s. So initial cost projections likely overestimated how fast drug spending would grow during the first 10 years of the program.  
Part of the reason for that is that there were more generic drugs coming onto the market and fewer new blockbuster drugs during the 2000s, said Dr. Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University. 

Still, said Dr. Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush, it would be wrong to discount the impact of the program's design, particularly the role it played in encouraging the use of generic drugs.

Under the plan, beneficiaries take an active role in shopping for a plan and comparing costs. By selecting a less expensive plan, they save themselves and the government money, she said. 

""I don't want to say it's 100 percent, but I think it's just foolish to say that wasn't an important contribution,"" she said.  
Insurance companies, meanwhile, have access to aggregated data on what kinds of drugs are most popular and at what dosages, said Richard Kaplan, an expert on retiree health care at the University of Illinois. The companies rework their plans every year in hopes of persuading more seniors to leave their competitors and join their plans.

Beneficiaries can look every year to get a better deal, and the insurance companies can make sure they’re not losing too much money, he added.

Kaplan also said the dreaded doughnut hole may play a part in bringing down the costs of Medicare Part D. The doughnut hole is a coverage gap during which participants pay 100 percent of drug costs. If their costs continue beyond the doughnut hole, the government provides more subsidies. 

Beneficiaries have an incentive to keep their drug purchases below the doughnut hole level (and yes, we know that sounds bizarre). 

""The curiosity may be that the bizarre doughnut hole forced people to really pay attention to cost and substitute generic drugs so that they could avoid the doughnut hole,"" Kaplan said.

President Barack Obama's health care law seeks to phase out the doughnut hole, but it will still be important for another five to six years, he said. 

Getting back to our ruling statement, Santorum said that the Medicare drug program ""resulted in the program coming in 40 percent under budget. ... And the reason it was, is because the design was right."" We found that Santorum is right that the program came in under budget, but he picked the high end of the estimate for how much the savings were. We also found that there is a good bit of disagreement on why the program came in under budget. Some credit the design, but design is just one of several factors that may have kept the program under budget, and there's not much clarity on how much weight each factor should get. Overall, we rate Santorum's statement Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/did-medicare-part-d-come-40-percent-under-budget-b/

Rick Santorum says Barack Obama has raised a ""stop sign"" on oil exploration
","
During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Sen. Rick Santorum blasted President Barack Obama’s policies on oil drilling.

Santorum said that Obama ""has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, and that is depressing. We need to drill. We need to create energy jobs.""

We took a look at a similar statement in March, when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- another GOP presidential contender -- told an audience at a conservative conference that ""the number of new drilling permits under the Obama Administration since they came into office"" is ""one."" We ruled that statement Pants on Fire.

We’ll refer back to our discussion of that claim here, updating it with more current information.

The most recent summary from Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE -- the federal agency that oversees drilling -- is included in a document titled the ""Status of Well Permits and Plans Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements.""

The report says that 56 shallow-water permits for new wells have been issued since June 8, 2010, when new rules and information requirements were put into effect following the BP oil spill. Shallow-water drilling operations were not affected by the deep-water drilling moratorium following the spill.

In addition, since February of this year -- following the lifting of the moratorium and confirmation of the industry's ability to meet subsea containment requirements -- the government has approved 48 deep-water permits requiring subsea containment, covering 16 unique wells. Another 40 permits not requiring subsea containment have also been approved since October. The operators were required to come back and meet the modified standards.

So there’s been movement on offshore permits in the Gulf of Mexico under Obama. What about drilling elsewhere?

Arctic Ocean exploratory drilling permits continue to wend their way through the permitting process at the Department of Interior, said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife.

A chart from BOEMRE confirms that no new offshore wells have been drilled in Alaska since Obama took office. However, only one such well has been drilled in the past dozen years, including eight years when a Republican, George W. Bush was president. So the shortage of drilling in Alaska is not exclusively an Obama-related problem.

Obama did announce in May that he was directing the Interior Department to conduct annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. He also ordered a speed-up of seismic surveys of mid- and south-Atlantic coasts and new incentives for industry to develop unused leases both on and offshore.

We should note that while drilling permits haven’t disappeared entirely, the pace of approval has slowed, in large part because Obama has made clear that he wants drilling to be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive fashion.

Lee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said in March that there has been a ""molasses effect"" with permitting by the Obama Administration. Even shallow-water permits have fallen from their prior level, despite not being directly affected by the post-spill moratorium. Meanwhile, permits for deep-water wells are likely to be a third of what was projected prior to the gulf spill.

Andy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, agreed that permit approvals dropped after the BP spill, but he added in March that the pace of permitting was picking up. ""We'll get to the new normal eventually,"" he said.

All in all, then, Santorum’s claim is incorrect.

""None of this could be accurately even remotely characterized as a ‘stop sign,’"" said Charter of Defenders of Wildlife.

We agree. It’s true that the Obama Administration pulled back the reins after the BP spill. But the administration has continued approving shallow-water wells, and it began to approve deep-water wells again after the moratorium was lifted six months ago. Just because the pace isn’t as fast as some would like doesn’t mean that Obama ""has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska."" At most, it would be a yellow light, and Santorum’s claim -- referring to curbs on ""any kind"" of exploration -- is over-broad. So we rate Santorum’s claim False.",/factchecks/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-barack-obama-has-raised-stop-si/

Newt Gingrich says a ""large number"" of the uninsured make more than $75,000
","
Editor's note: We first published this report on May 17, 2011, and rated the statement True based on numbers from the U.S. Census. Since then, we've heard from readers who said other factors we did not consider weighed against Gingrich's statement. We have incorporated that additional information into our updated report and are republishing the item on June 15, 2011, with a new rating of Half True.

When Newt Gingrich appeared on NBC's Meet the Press on May 15, 2011, the conversation turned to health care. Host David Gregory asked if Gingrich had been inconsistent about the role of the federal government in health care, because in 1993 he said he supported an individual mandate. The mandate -- a requirement that everyone have health coverage -- was the most controversial aspect of the health care law passed last year. 

Polls show the individual mandate remains unpopular with the public. Some opponents of health care reform oppose the mandate on the grounds that it gives the government too much power over health care decisions. There's also some disagreement among those who support health care reform about whether a mandate is necessary to reach near universal coverage. Insurance companies, though, say it's necessary if insurers are required to insure everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions. The mandate is currently being challenged in the federal court system.

Gingrich said there was a difference from what he said 18 years ago because Obama ""basically is trying to replace the entire insurance system, creating state exchanges, building a Washington based model, creating a federal system.""

Still, Gingrich didn't exactly back away from his previous position. ""I agree that all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care. And I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I have said consistently we ought to have some requirement, you either have health insurance or you post a bond, or in some way, you indicate you're going to be held accountable,"" Gingrich said.

(The day after the show, Gingrich issued a video statement clarifying that he is ""completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals. ... I'm against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone, because it is fundamentally wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional."")

On the show, Gingrich expounded a bit on the problem of ""free riders"" -- people who go without insurance on the assumption that they'll still receive care if an unexpected emergency happens.

""A large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year (and) don't buy any health insurance because they want to buy a second house or a better car or go on vacation, then you and I and everybody else ends up picking up for them,"" Gingrich said. ""I don't think having a free-rider system in health is any more appropriate than having a free-rider system in any other part of our society.""

We were interested in checking Gingrich's statement that ""a large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year."" When politicians talk of the uninsured, it often conjures images of people who cannot afford health coverage. But Gingrich's point was that people who are relatively affluent are choosing not to have coverage. 

Why they choose not to have coverage is a complicated question, though. There's at least anecdotal evidence that even well-off people have problems finding an insurance company willing to sell them a policy if they have pre-existing conditions, even minor ones. 

Here, though, we wanted to see if Gingrich was right about the numbers. So we consulted the latest version of ""Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States,"" an annual publication from the U.S. Census that creates detailed estimates of the national population and its health insurance status.

In 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the Census Bureau estimated that there were 50.7 million uninsured people in the United States, or about 17 percent of the total population. 

We originally noted that, ""Among the uninsured, about 10.6 million made $75,000 or more. That number is about 21 percent of all the uninsured."" 

Among the rest of the uninsured, the income brackets are as follows: 

• Less than $25,000: 15.5 million, or about 31 percent;

• $25,000 to $49,999: 15.3 million, or about 30 percent;

• $50,000 to $74,999: 9.4 million, or about 18 percent.

However, after we initially reported this item, several of our readers told us that there are reasons to believe that number is high.The census figures are for household income, not individual income, so it's possible that some of the uninsured in households making more than $75,000 don't make that much on an individual basis. Young adults who are roommates might be counted in that category, or it could include multiple adults and children in a family that earns $75,000 as a unit and thus individual earners would not be considered affluent. A high proportion of the uninsured reside with other adult family members, so they might be more likely to fall into this category.

We tried to find additional evidence or studies detailing how many of the 10.6 million uninsured might be single earners. We couldn't find data on this point. 

We did find one study that calculated the number of uninsured adults, aged 19 to 64, who were uninsured in 2009 but whose incomes exceeded 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $43,320 for a single person). The study, which appeared in Health Affairs, was conducted by John Holahan of the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center. The study's projections found that only 6 percent of that group were uninsured, or about 4.2 million people. But again, we can't say how many of those people were making more than $75,000.

Still, we hesitate to discount Gingrich's point about an individual mandate entirely, because many health care analysts say that free riders -- people can afford insurance but go without, gambling that they won't get sick -- are a genuine problem for a health care program that seeks near-universal coverage. Insurers in particular say that if they must offer coverage to everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions, then there should be requirements that everyone buy insurance. 

In ruling on Gingrich's statement, he said that a ""large number"" of people make $75,000 or more and don't have insurance. The census shows that there are 10.6 million individuals who live in households that earn more than $75,000, and they constitute 21 percent of the uninsured. Because the census counts household income, it's likely some of these people are not making $75,000 on their own, but we don't know how many. We can't say if it's a lot or a little. Still, the census numbers suggest that at least some high earners are uninsured, and there's some wiggle room in what exactly Gingrich meant by ""a large number.""

"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Adam Hasner']","
Adam Hasner says George LeMieux compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner is attacking GOP opponent George LeMieux by invoking two names likely to displease conservative primary voters.

Barack Obama and Charlie Crist.

In an Internet ad released June 10, 2011, Hasner tries to link LeMieux to Crist -- the former governor who left the GOP while trying to win a Senate seat in 2010. Marco Rubio, a former House speaker who served as a state legislator from 2000 to 2008 and is now a national Republican star, won that seat.

The ad shows a photo of Crist and then states:

Defended President Obama's Stimulus As ""Helpful to Florida"" 
Fought For Taxpayer Funded Bailout Of Big Sugar

Architect Of Obama-Style Cap And Trade Plan For Florida

Falsely Attacked Marco Rubio

Even Compared Marco Rubio To Barack Obama

Charlie Crist -- Right?

Wrong.

As the word ""wrong"" appears, the camera zooms out on the picture of Crist. There is LeMieux, whispering in Crist's ear. The ad finishes -- ""Get to know the Real George LeMieux.""

The goal of the message is clear enough: Paint a portrait of LeMieux -- Crist's former chief of staff who was later appointed by Crist to serve in the U.S. Senate -- as an Obama-loving Crist buddy who criticized Florida's GOP superstar, Rubio.

But is it accurate? For this Truth-O-Meter item we will examine the claim Hasner made that LeMieux ""even compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama."" In a related Truth-O-Meter item, we're checking another claim that LeMieux ""falsely attacked Marco Rubio.""

Hasner's ad cited a Nov. 17, 2009, St. Petersburg Times article as the source for LeMieux comparing Rubio to Obama. Back then, LeMieux was supporting Crist over Rubio. And back then, Crist was still running as a Republican.

LeMieux critiqued Rubio in an item posted to the Times' online blog, The Buzz.

From The Buzz: ""Being governor means you have to make choices. And you have to make decisions,"" LeMieux said, heading into a GOP lunch at the U.S. Capitol. ""It's very easy to be a critic and the speaker now is not in office. He wasn't there when the state was facing the challenges of the huge recession and the stimulus. He didn't have to vote on that. All of the folks that were in his administration voted for the stimulus money. And I suspect if he were there, he could vote for it. This is just like President Obama being able to be against the war in Iraq because he didn't have to vote on it. There's a lot of parallels to draw between Speaker Rubio and President Obama in the way they are running their race and in their ability to throw bombs without ever having to lead because they are out of office.""

LeMieux was arguing that it was easy for Rubio, who left the Legislature in 2008, to criticize Crist for taking stimulus money when Rubio was no longer in the Legislature -- just like it was easy for Obama to oppose going to war against Iraq because he wasn't in the U.S. Senate or White House then. (Obama was in the Illinois Legislature when Operation Iraqi Freedom was launched in 2003.) 
LeMieux isn't comparing Rubio and Obama on a stance or an issue here (like they both supported cap-and-trade, or something like that). He is making a general point that it's easy for candidates to later oppose something they didn't have to vote on. 
None of that is made clear in the ad. 
But that's not the only problem when considering this claim. 
""George endorsed Marco the day after Charlie left the Republican Party and aggressively campaigned for Marco in the General Election,"" LeMieux campaign manager Brian Seitchik e-mailed us June 13. LeMieux hosted a fundraiser for Rubio, campaigned with him and introduced him at events, Seitchik wrote. 
(Note: Crist left the GOP on April 29. The next day LeMieux issued this statement: ""I am saddened that my friend, Governor Crist, has decided to leave the Republican Party. Our friendship runs deep, but my commitment to the principles of the Republican Party runs deeper. I cannot walk down the path he has chosen. ... I will support our Republican nominee and will continue to do everything I can both in Florida and across the country to increase the number of Republicans in the United States Senate."" A formal endorsement of Rubio didn't come until July, however, according to The Hill which cited the conservative blog, The Shark Tank.) 
There are other examples of LeMieux supporting Rubio.

On July 12, 2010, The Buzz reported that LeMieux's PAC gave $2,400 to Rubio's campaign. The conservative blog the Shark Tank reported on the same day that LeMieux endorsed Rubio -- see a video of LeMieux here calling Rubio a ""good conservative candidate."" 
And LeMieux campaigned for Rubio at a few Central Florida stops -- including The Villages retirement community -- the Palm Beach Post reported Oct 7. At one of events, LeMieux called Rubio '""the brightest star of our generation in politics — and not just in Florida, nationwide,'"" the Post wrote. 
Lastly, we have to point out that simply comparing Rubio, a Republican, to Obama, a Democrat, doesn't have to be a bad thing. The New Republic, for instance, called Rubio the ""Republican Obama"" in a February 2010 article. And a national conservative figure, Richard Land, was quoted in 2010 talking up a Rubio run for president in 2012, noting that Rubio would have ""more experience than Obama had"" when Obama ran for president. (PolitiFact Florida rated that claim Barely True.) 
On the whole, this claim is puzzling. Let's again look at the text of the ad, which starts by linking LeMieux to three issues -- the federal stimulus package, Big Sugar and cap and trade. Then the ad abruptly switches to general statements about Rubio saying that LeMieux falsely attacked Rubio and ""compared Rubio to Barack Obama."" 
LeMieux didn't compare Rubio and Obama on an issue such as those listed at the start of the ad -- he said they both used a familiar campaign tactic, throwing ""bombs"" about something they didn't have to vote on themselves. The ad provides no explanation for how he compared the two politicians and neglects to note that LeMieux supported Rubio's campaign once Crist left the GOP. 
We rate this statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jun/15/adam-hasner/hasner-says-lemieux-compared-rubio-obama/
"['Regulation', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Missouri', 'Kip Kendrick']","
Kendrick mostly right about reduced corporate tax collection
","Many Missouri lawmakers are worried about the estimated $456 million budget gap for fiscal year 2018. By law, the government cannot approve an unbalanced budget. Although the state has made some cuts, more work still needs to be done. That has lawmakers looking for answers as to why state revenues have dropped. Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, was interviewed by KMIZ's Joey Parker on ""This Week,"" on Jan. 20. Kendrick stated why he believes the budget gap is so large. ""If you look at the budget right now, income tax collection is right where it was projected, the same with sales tax collection,"" he said. ""What is down significantly is corporate income tax collection. Corporate entities are paying a lot less taxes this year than they have in the past. ""Part of that is from a loophole in a bill that was passed in 2015, but it is also some special interest tax cuts that we keep giving out over and over, and it has made it all but impossible to fund our state’s priorities."" We wanted to check out Kendrick’s claim that corporate entities are paying a lot less in taxes — and if they are, why? Budgeted vs. actual revenues The first half of Kendrick’s statement is easy to verify. Overall, the state of Missouri collected less corporate income taxes and about the same amount of individual income tax and sales tax when comparing the collected year-to-date revenue from Fiscal Year 2016 to 2017. According to the latest monthly general revenue report released Feb. 2 from the Office of Administration Division of Budget and Planning, individual income tax and sales tax both grew around 3 percent. However, corporate tax income collections are significantly down compared to last year. In FY 2016, the state collected about $272 million. In FY 2017, it collected only $193 million, which is a 29 percent decrease or about $78 million less. Source: Missouri Office of Administration/Division of Budget & Planning Note that these are collections year-to-date, comparing the collections as of Jan. 31 for FY 2016 to FY 2017. The fiscal year for 2017 runs until June 30, so we won’t know the full accounting until then. Corporate tax income from the tax deadline on April 18 could make up the difference. However, even Gov. Greitens’ proposed FY 2018 budget, which still has to be approved by the Missouri legislature, projected a $97 million decrease in corporate tax income for FY 2017. So what we do know supports Kendrick’s point: ""Income tax collection is right where is was projected, the same with sales tax collection. What is down significantly is corporate income tax collection."" Missouri business climate The second half of his claim is trickier to pin down: ""Corporate entities are paying a lot less taxes this year than they have in the past. Part of that is from a loophole in a bill that was passed in 2015, but it is also some special interest tax cuts that we keep giving out over and over, and it has made it all but impossible to fund our state’s priorities."" First, is there another explanation as to why the corporate tax collections are low? There could be fewer businesses in the state, or these businesses could have generated less income. The Missouri Department of Economic Development tracks the number of businesses in the state. Because the 2016 data are only available through the third quarter, the department provided data in an email for the third quarters in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to compare. According to the department, the numbers are counts of establishments, or individual locations, which is the same measure on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. This means that instead of counting Wal-mart once, the data reports individual Wal-mart establishment. In 2014 there were 185,634 establishments; in 2015, there were 192,108 establishments; and in 2016, there were 193,695 establishments. So the number of businesses increased, if only slightly. So are businesses in Missouri not doing well? Do they have less taxable income? Both Chuck Pierce, the government relations consultant for the Missouri Society of Certified Public Accountants, and Tracy King, the vice president of governmental affairs at the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, said that corporate income can vary from year to year due to the cyclical nature of the economy. Profits can be reduced by a recession. However, Tom Kruckemeyer, the chief economist for the liberal think tank Missouri Budget Project, said the state economy is doing ""reasonably well."" ""Broadly speaking, the economic indicators for the state of Missouri are actually pretty good,"" Kruckemeyer said. One economic indicator is the unemployment rate. According to the numbers release Jan. 24 from U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, Missouri’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 4.4 percent, compared to the national rate of 4.7 percent. And over the past few years, the Missouri and national unemployment rates have dropped. The 2016 Missouri Economic Report produced by the Missouri Department of Economic Development found that 50,000 jobs were added in Missouri between December 2014 and December 2015. This is the largest year-over-year growth in 10 years. The report also stated that Missouri’s personal income increased 2 percent in 2015 and has averaged an increase of 1.8 percent from 2010 through 2015. Overall, these numbers show that Missouri’s economy is doing fine, so corporate entities must be paying less taxes due to tax cuts as Kendrick claims. Taxing corporations In the KMIZ interview, Kendrick said there was a loophole in a bill passed in 2015 that caused corporations to pay less taxes. Kendrick, in an interview with PolitiFact, said the bill he was referring to was Senate Bill 19, which changed the way corporate income tax was allocated for multi-state corporations. The bill expanded House Bill 128, passed in 2013. Before SB 19 was passed, King, of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, said Missouri taxed 50 percent of any goods produced in the state and sold in another state, so these businesses were double taxed. She said that businesses were moving out of the state and taking jobs because of this tax. Thanks to SB 19, Missouri no longer taxes the production of goods sold out of state. In the fiscal notes for SB 19, the estimated cost of the law was $15.2 million per year. However, Kendrick said the new estimate of the bill’s effect on the state’s revenue is a drop of $200 million, which other legislators confirmed. Rep. T.J. Berry, R-Kansas City, said he also heard the bill reduced tax collections by $200 million. And in a Jan. 24 House debate, Rep. Jay Barnes, R-Jefferson City, said a ""corporate allocable tax bill"" passed two years ago cost the state $200 million. The Department of Revenue has not responded to PolitiFact’s inquiries for how much SB 19 affected the revenue collections. A few tax authorities have said this bill has played a part in the decrease of corporate income tax revenues. Kruckemeyer said the combination of HB 128 and SB 19 were the primary causes of the low corporate income tax collections because they were ""explicit changes in tax law."" However, Ray McCarty, president of Associated Industries of Missouri, said SB 19 did lower collections but cautioned that corporate income tax revenue is only a few million dollars out of multi-billion dollar revenue collection. He stressed that there may be other factors at play, including above average tax refunds and other legislation. Our Ruling Kendrick said, ""Corporate entities are paying less taxes this year. Part of that is from a loophole in a bill that was passed in 2015."" There hasn’t been a decrease in businesses, and the Missouri economy is doing well as indicated by various economic data. So corporations must be paying less taxes — though experts can argue about which tax cuts and other factors are behind Missouri’s lower corporate income tax collections. However, we don’t have the complete numbers of corporate tax collections because the fiscal year doesn’t end until June 30. With that caveat, we rate this claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/02/kip-kendrick/kendrick-mostly-right-about-reduced-corporate-tax-/

Reports falsely accuse Democrats of refusing to stand for Gold Star widow
","Conservative blogs accused Democrats of sitting through an ovation for the widow a slain Navy SEAL during President Donald Trump’s first address to Congress, but video shows a different story. In his speech, Trump thanked Carryn Owens, who was married to William ""Ryan"" Owens, the SEAL killed in a Jan. 29, 2017, raid in Yemen. The mention drew the crowd to their feet for extended applause, lasting more than two minutes. But some outlets focused on what they saw as disrespect from Democrats. ""Horrible! Top Democrats refuse to stand for Gold Star widow,"" read the headline on a March 1, 2017, post on 100PercentFedUp.com. A photo showed U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, and Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the current deputy chairman of the DNC, seated together. (Snopes determined the image was taken more than a half an hour prior to the ovation.) Another post from DailyWire.com read, ""Awful: Top Democrats refuse to stand, clap for Navy SEAL widow honored by Trump."" That post originally showed the same photo of Wasserman Schultz and Ellison but was later changed after we inquired about it. The post also excoriated House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont by name. The post did say that ""Democrats initially stood for the widow,"" but the headline suggests otherwise. TheBlaze.com said the incident was ""truly disgusting."" Other posts focused on Twitter outrage over the incident. State GOP organizations piled on. Even Florida Sen. Marco Rubio mentioned the incident the morning after the speech on Fox & Friends. ""I turned back around my shoulder and I see half the room, most of them sitting down, I was just shocked by that,"" Rubio said. ""I noticed as soon as the speech was done they got up and walked out."" The show alluded to the incident with a chyron that read, ""Dems sat during POTUS tribute to SEAL’s widow."" Democrats weren’t too thrilled with Trump’s speech, to be sure. But upon reviewing recordings of the speech, there’s ample evidence that Democrats did stand — just not as long as their Republican counterparts. And that’s a fairly typical thing for the opposition party to do, an expert told us. Tale of the tape Ryan Owens was the first American combatant killed during the Trump administration. Critics have questioned whether the raid in which he was killed should have been approved, and Owens’ father refused to meet with Trump. More recently, Trump been criticized for appearing to assign the blame to the military. Here’s a breakdown of what happens in the video. Video time stamp  (approx.) What’s happening The scene 0:30 Trump says, ""We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero — battling against terrorism and securing our nation."" Both sides of the aisle stand to acknowledge Owens. In the lower lefthand corner of the video you can see Ellison and Wasserman Schultz standing. Sanders is seen standing a few rows closer to the front.  0:45 Republicans and Democrats sit down and Trump continues.  1:20 Trump says, ""I just spoke to our great Gen. Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ‘Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.’ Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity."" People in the chamber rise and applaud. The video shows Carryn Owens in the gallery.  1:50 The camera pans away to show Democrats and Republicans both standing. Some Democrats begin to take their seats. We can see Pelosi standing, but it appears Wasserman Schultz, Ellison and Sanders are seated.  2:00 A wide shot shows that many Democrats have sat down. Republicans remain standing.  2:20 Most Democrats are seated, but it appears some are still clapping, and some are standing.  2:55 Applause ends and entire chamber sits down.  This video from NBC shows some different angles, including a wide, panning shot showing Democrats seated while Republicans cheer. That image was used on some blogs to ""prove"" Democrats didn’t stand, but it’s actually about 2 minutes and 45 seconds into the NBC video. Breaches of etiquette do happen during speeches before Congress — U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., shouted ""You lie!"" during a 2009 speech by President Barack Obama.  ""Republicans often sat stone-faced during Obama's State of the Union addresses. Democrats laughed derisively when Reagan promised to balance the budget,"" said Craig Smith, a former speechwriter for Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush and director emeritus of the Center for First Amendment Studies at California State University, Long Beach. Smith said Trump’s tribute to the Navy SEAL was a ""moment unmatched since Reagan paid tribute to Lenny Skutnick, who actually was in the gallery. And that began the tradition."" Skutnik was a former Congressional Budget Office employee who helped rescue a plane crash survivor from the Potomac River in January 1982. Reagan recognized him days later in his State of the Union speech, which is considered the first time the practice of noting an ordinary citizen became routine. Our ruling Bloggers said, ""Top Democrats refuse to stand for Gold Star widow."" That makes it sound as if the blue side of the aisle stubbornly stayed seated while the GOP cheered for the widow of a Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen. A more accurate headline would be, ""Top Democrats don’t stand as long as Republicans for Gold Star widow."" A video review shows Democrats including Sanders, Pelosi, Wasserman Schultz and Ellison stood.  But most sat down while Republicans renewed their applause.

Taxes on wealthy pay for Obamacare? DNC's Perez overshoots
","The morning after President Donald Trump promised to ""repeal and replace Obamacare,"" Democratic party chief Tom Perez took a dig at Republicans for ignoring the good that the health care law does. ""It's a lifesaver,"" Perez said. ""If they had come in good faith during the Obama administration, we would have been more than open to fixing it. But that's not what they're about. They want it repealed. And here is why: the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act so that you can provide a big giveaway to the wealthy."" Perez was focused on the GOP’s political motives, but our focus is on his assertion that taxing the wealthy is the primary means of paying for the Affordable Care Act. Perez is correct that tax hikes on individuals making over $200,000 per year and couples making over $250,000 are the largest single source of revenues under the law. But that ignores a larger piece of the financial picture: the spending reductions in Medicare. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the impartial analytic arm of Congress, savings from Medicare are projected to provide about $228 billion to offset the costs of the sweeping health care law. The tax on higher-income households delivers about $136 billion, between 2016 and  2020. Melinda Buntin, formerly at the CBO and now a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University, took issue with Perez’s summary. ""I would say that the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act was Medicare changes,"" Buntin told us. Under the law, Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors, is slated to grow more slowly than it otherwise would. It largely does that by limiting payments to doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers. Over time, those limits add up. Joe Antos, a health care analyst at the American Enterprise Institute,  a free-market oriented think tank, cautioned that there’s a lot of guess work in counting those dollars. ""In terms of financing it's not just the revenue you collect, but it’s the reduction in other spending to offset your expansion in other areas,"" Antos said. The Medicare savings, for example, helped pay for the expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program to help the working poor. Marc Goldwein at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget put taxes on wealthier Americans into the context of the many pieces that go into the total package that is the Affordable Care Act. On top of the dollars from Medicare and taxes on the well-to-do, there are taxes on drug and medical equipment makers. ""Taxes on high-earners cover one-fifth or maybe one-quarter of the ACA’s costs,"" Goldwein said. ""That’s large, but I wouldn’t call it the primary financing mechanism."" Antos said that Republicans seem to be fine with the trims in Medicare spending. ""You can’t find anybody who says they want to get rid of those Medicare cuts,"" Antos said. ""If Republicans were to eliminate those, they would have to go elsewhere to find those billions of dollars. In health care, there is no other place to go."" If the Medicare spending trajectory is off the table, then the next big item would be the taxes on higher-income earners. We reached out to Perez’s office and did not hear back. Our ruling Perez said that ""the primary financing mechanism of the Affordable Care Act is a tax on wealthy people."" According to CBO estimates, those taxes are the largest single revenue source, but trims in future Medicare spending growth do much more to keep the Affordable Care Act in balance. Every analyst we reached said that the complete fiscal package includes both revenues and spending cuts and it is misleading to say that the taxes are the main means of financing the health care program. Perez gave only half the picture. Accordingly, we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/01/thomas-perez/taxes-wealthy-pay-obamacare-dncs-perez-overshoots/

Yes, global poverty fell dramatically after 1990
","British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson took a moment at the Munich Security Conference to praise the ""unadulterated triumph of what you might broadly call western values, technology, culture, and indeed western economic thinking."" Johnson’s main example? World poverty. ""The proportion of the global population living in poverty (has) declined to fewer than 10 percent today from 37 percent in 1990,"" Johnson said Feb. 17, 2017. ""An even more staggering accomplishment for the human race when you consider we have added 1.8 billion people to the planet in that time."" Is Johnson on firm ground with those poverty stats? He is, with minor allowances for uncertainty in the data. According to the World Bank, in 1990, 35.1 percent of the total population had to survive on less than $1.90 per day, the official poverty line. In 2013, the most recent year in the World Bank’s Development Indicators database, the level stood at 10.7 percent. Bank economists estimated that in 2015, poverty had fallen to 9.6 percent. Economic gains in China and India largely drove the drop in the poverty rate. Charles Kenny, an economist at the Center for Global Development, a Washington policy group, told us there’s a little bit of give in the numbers. ""The calculation of global poverty numbers has changed a number of times since 1990,"" Kenny said. ""Each time they 'back-cast' to 1990 to create a new estimate of that old number."" Kenny told us, given the unavoidable uncertainty in the data, ""I'd say Boris was pretty much right."" But he cautioned that not all regions have benefited equally. According to the World Bank, poverty in sub-Saharan Africa is just under 50 percent and the region has about twice as many poor people today as it had in 1980. ""There are some stubborn pockets of poverty,"" Kenny said. Johnson also mentioned the world’s growing population. He said it went up 1.8 billion since 1990. The U.S. Census Bureau reports it rose 1.9 billion. Our ruling Johnson said global poverty fell from 37 percent to under 10 percent since 1990. His numbers are quite close to those of the World Bank. An economist familiar with the assumptions behind the data told us that there’s enough uncertainty in the figures that it’s fair to say that Johnson has it right. The one point Johnson’s summary ignores is that some regions such as sub-Saharan Africa have not seen as large a decline in poverty.

Greg Abbott falsely says Travis County not enforcing communication law about unauthorized immigrants
","Greg Abbott, who shut off about $1.5 million in grants to Travis County out of concern that the county’s Democratic officials unduly shield unauthorized immigrants, subsequently accused the local sheriff of breaking a federal law. The Republican governor said in a Feb. 6, 2017, tweet: ""Sheriff violates oath by refusing to enforce 8 USC 1373 & not giving ICE info about drugs cartels & armed robbers."" ICE is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency that focuses on battling the illegal movement of people and trade. Abbott didn’t offer factual back-up for his charge. Separately, Wes Priddy of the sheriff’s department told us by phone there’s been no change in operations that would violate the cited law. ""I don’t know where the governor is getting his information or his point of view. I suspect it’s just conjecture,"" Priddy said. Let’s recap the federal provisions singled out by Abbott before getting to the policy put in place by Sheriff Sally Hernandez and whether she’s not enforcing the law. Federal law Abbott did not single out any law pertaining to local police agencies accepting or refusing ""detainer"" requests from federal authorities seeking a hold on inmates so agents can consider them for deportation. Instead, the governor’s tweet refers to a 216-word law that’s focused on easing the flow of information between federal immigration authorities and local law agencies. Titled ""Communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service,"" the 1990s law bars federal, state or local agencies or officials from restricting any agency or official from sending to, or receiving from, federal immigration authorities ""information regarding the citizenship status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual."" Also, the law bars any person or agency from restricting another government entity from sending, requesting, receiving or maintaining information about any individual’s immigration status or exchanging such information with a government entity. Travis County policy We don’t know why Abbott concluded Hernandez isn’t enforcing those provisions. He didn’t say and an aide, Matt Hirsch, didn’t reply to our inquiry. But Abbott posted his tweet about three hours after a commentary piece by Hernandez was posted by the Austin American-Statesman. In the commentary, Hernandez, a Democrat elected sheriff in November 2016, defended her policy of not automatically honoring every federal request to detain immigrant inmates for up to 48 hours—with the exception of inmates charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Other inmates, she said, would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Hernandez wrote: ""Our policies at the Travis County sheriff’s office are centered on all legal statutes and principles that are applicable to all. We proudly stand by our Constitution and our laws and plan to continue doing so. We will also continue to legally comply with"" ICE, she wrote. A few days later, Hernandez posted a statement on the office’s website saying in part: ""I am following all state and federal laws, and upholding constitutional rights to due process for all in our criminal justice system. Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated."" Travis County official We asked Priddy, who oversees the county’s correctional complex, if the new policy restricts the flow of information about inmate-immigrants as intimated by Abbott. Priddy told us there’s been no change in the flow of each inmate’s vital information to other law enforcement agencies including ICE. That is, Priddy said, each suspect booked into the jail continues to be fingerprinted and that information along with the person’s name and date of birth is conveyed electronically to the Texas Department of Public Safety and then, he said, to federal agencies including ICE, whose officers can then determine if a suspect merits their attention. According to the DPS, its Automated Fingerprint Information System stores the identifying characteristics of more than 4.8 million individuals. Also, Priddy said, ICE agents can continue to contact the department directly about an inmate, for instance seeking to interview a jailed individual subject to an ongoing investigation. ""If so, we share and allow,"" Priddy said, though he said ICE officers don’t have unfettered access to inmates in the jail’s intake area, which they once did. ""We are complying"" with 8 USC 1373, Priddy said, adding: ""We are allowing ICE the opportunity to interview inmates; we are providing them information on their requests, just as we are with any other agency."" We noticed, though, the sheriff’s policy includes a provision that seemingly could fetter information flow. It states that sheriff’s office ""officials shall not conduct or initiate any immigration status investigation into individuals in TCSO custody or provide information on an inmate’s release date or address to ICE."" Asked about that, Priddy said by email: ""The segments you are referring to are there to ensure TCSO staff do not conduct their own investigation regarding someone’s immigration status. Information regarding citizenship or immigration status is readily shared with ICE upon that agency’s request."" ICE focuses on detainers Next, we asked an ICE spokeswoman, Nina Pruneda, to evaluate Abbott’s claim. Prunedo, by email, sent an agency statement  that didn’t touch on any law explicitly: ""ICE would welcome any changes to current policy that would allow local authorities to more fully cooperate with ICE toward achieving the shared goal of protecting public safety and national security while balancing important community policing needs,"" ICE said. ""When law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders onto the streets, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect public safety and carry out its mission,"" ICE said. Immigration experts We also asked immigration experts from different vantage points about the accuracy of Abbott’s claim. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, suggested the sheriff’s policy against employees inquiring into immigration status or providing information on a person’s release date or address conflicts with the intent of the statute noted by Abbott. By email, Vaughan pointed out a 2016 Justice Department memo that led us to an explanation of 8 USC 1373 by the Republican-majority House Judiciary Committee. That 1996 explanation says the panel’s intent was to ""give state and local officials the authority to communicate with the INS regarding the presence, whereabouts and activities of illegal aliens."" (After 9/11, Congress dissolved the Immigration and Naturalization Service with ICE assuming some of its duties.) ""This section,"" the committee said, ""is designed to prevent any state or local law, ordinance, executive order, policy, constitutional provision or decision of any federal or state court that prohibits or in any way restricts any communication between state and local officials and the INS."" We also heard back from Lena Graber, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which has as its mission working with and educating immigrants, community organizations and the legal sector to continue to build a democratic society that values diversity and the rights of all people. Generally, Graber commented by email, the sheriff’s policy is limited to limiting detainer requests honored by the department and doesn’t extend to restricting information flow, which would conflict with the law highlighted by Abbott, she said. Sheriff revised policy Graber also underscored a section of the sheriff’s policy that wasn’t initially there, we noticed. The added section, point No. 10 in the policy, tracks with 8 USC 1373, stating: ""This policy in no way prohibits or restricts sending information to or requesting or receiving information from ICE regarding an individual’s immigration or citizenship status, and nothing in this policy shall be construed to prohibit or restrict TCSO personnel from exchanging information regarding the immigration or citizenship status of any individual with ICE."" We asked the sheriff’s office why the section was added. By email, spokeswoman Kristen Dark replied that the provision was added Jan. 31, 2017 ""in the interest of clarity."" Simultaneously, Dark wrote, another part of the policy was expanded, in part with: ""Information regarding incarceration status of inmates is available on the TCSO website. Information regarding court dates is available on the Travis County Courts’ website."" Those sentences were inserted in front of an existing declaration about department personnel not using resources to help enforce federal immigration laws. Our ruling Abbott said Sheriff Hernandez refuses to enforce 8 USC 1373. Given the sheriff’s policy against automatically granting federal requests to detain immigrant-inmates or using personnel to enforce immigration laws, we can see how someone might speculate about the sheriff not enforcing, or complying with, the cited law about easing the flow of information about immigration or citizenship statuses. But Abbott didn't back up his claim, which also wasn’t explicitly borne out by ICE. Notably too, the sheriff's policy was expanded before Abbott leveled his claim to specify that it shouldn't be read as slowing or stopping any information flow between office personnel and ICE regarding the legal status of individuals. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Trump wrongly claims historic defense increase
","In his address to Congress, President Donald Trump said his budget ""calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history."" Trump’s budget director Mick Mulvaney gave reporters a broad overview of the president’s budget Feb. 27. He said the White House wants to spend $603 billion on defense. Mulvaney compared that to the $549 billion allowed under spending caps based on a 2011 budget control law. On that basis, Trump seeks nearly a 10 percent increase. But when we looked at past budgets, we found there have been much heftier jumps in military spending. As America entered WWII, its defense spending more than doubled. However, that was a world war, so a fairer comparison might be more recent budgets. But even over the past 35 years, Trump’s plan still isn’t exceptional. A word of caution: Making apples-to-apples comparisons in defense spending can be tricky. Budget writers talk about the base defense budget. That number excludes billions for Overseas Contingency Operations, a big ticket item that covers the costs of actually fighting wars. Right now, that spending adds about $55 billion to the Pentagon’s account. When the contingency money is factored in, spending today is about $587 billion. This difference can lead to some confusion as people debate the magnitude of Trump’s request. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Trump’s plan raises the Pentagon’s budget by only about $18 billion. But he’s comparing Trump’s apparent base request to the full Pentagon budget. So with that in mind, let’s go back in time. President Jimmy Carter’s last budget kicked up military spending 25 percent in 1981. President Ronald Reagan’s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised it by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008. Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, had a tempered view of Trump’s assertion. ""The defense budget Trump proposed for 2018 is a significant increase, but it is not one of the largest increases,"" Harrison told PolitiFact. During Trump's speech, Harrison tweeted this chart, which excludes war-related money. By Harrison’s count, since 1977, there have been 10 increases that were at least a little bit larger than what Trump has in mind. Laicie Heeley, a defense budget analyst at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank, said, ""Trump's historical increase is actually quite average."" We reached out to the White House and were still waiting for a response when we published. Our ruling Trump said his budget plan has one of the largest increases in defense spending in the country’s history. Looking strictly at money for the Pentagon’s base budget, Trump is calling for about a 10 percent hike in spending. But in the past three decades, there have been 10 years when the base defense budget has gone up more than what Trump has requested. In some years, the increase was more than double Trump’s. The term ""one of the largest"" has some leeway, but the defense analysts we reached said while it is a significant increase, it is not remarkable. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c715d253-c396-4eb9-8ccb-62308ed6c123",/factchecks/2017/mar/01/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-claims-historic-defense-increase/

Scott Walker wants to add 485 positions in management 'category' to state Administration Department?
","Wisconsin Democrat Kathleen Vinehout, who is considering a run for governor in 2018, is sounding alarm bells about the state budget proposed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker -- who appears to be preparing to run for a third term. In a Feb. 20, 2017 interview, the state senator from Alma was asked by Wisconsin Public Radio talk show host Joy Cardin about a column she had written about Walker’s 2017-’19 spending plan, which was released a couple of weeks earlier. The column highlighted what Vinehout -- who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to run against Walker in the 2012 gubernatorial recall election -- described as little known details about the budget. Cardin wanted to know why there would be a large increase in the number of people working for the Department of Administration. That’s a department, whose secretary is appointed by Walker, that works closely with the governor’s office. Vinehout replied by saying 485 positions would be added to the department ""in the category of supervisor and management,"" although in many cases, they would be people transferred from other departments. ""It really kind of takes the whole heart of state government -- especially as money flows in and out of agencies, and puts it into the Department of Administration,"" she added. Leaving aside Vinehout’s view of the impact of the move, let’s check whether Walker is proposing to add 485 positions ""in the category of supervisor and management"" to his Department of Administration. The numbers The major functions of the Department of Administration include helping the governor develop and implement the state budget and supporting other state agencies with centralized purchasing and financial management. The department also coordinates telecommunications, energy, and land use planning and community development, and it regulates racing, charitable gaming and Indian gaming. Walker’s budget, which must be approved by the Legislature, would increase the department’s positions in both years of the budget. The new total for the department would be 1,149 positions -- an increase of 485. And those positions are listed under the heading of ""supervision and management."" But Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, gave us some context about the 485: The majority of positions are held by existing employees who work for other agencies; these are not new state government positions. The majority would continue to physically work in those agencies, such as the Department of Natural Resources, but would become employees of the Department of Administration. Despite the designation in the budget document as ""supervision and management,"" the vast majority would not be supervisors or managers -- rather they are involved in the supervision and management of human resource activities such as employee recruitment and assistance, training, and payroll and benefits. Walker says the primary aim is to ""assign various administrative functions to a single entity, allowing individual agencies to focus on their core business missions and avoid redundant efforts on services that can be offered most effectively from a central entity."" But it’s also true that if the Legislature goes along with Walker’s plan, those employees would be more directly under his control. Our rating In sounding alarms about Walker’s budget, Vinehout says the governor is proposing to add 485 positions ""in the category of supervisor and management"" to his Department of Administration. Vinehout is correct on the number and, technically, they are ""in the category"" of supervisor and management. But while they are involved in the supervision and management of human resource activities, the vast majority are not actually in supervisory or management positions. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/mar/01/kathleen-vinehout/scott-walker-wants-add-485-positions-management-ca/

Fact-checking Donald Trump’s claim about soaring Obamacare premiums
","President Donald Trump zeroed in on repealing the Affordable Care Act in his first address to Congress, saying the federal health care law has been a ""disaster"" that has caused premiums to skyrocket. ""Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits,"" Trump said on Feb. 28, 2017. He then cited a 116 percent increase in Arizona as an example. When Trump says ""Obamacare,"" he’s not talking about everyone who benefitted from President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He’s referring to premiums for insurance plans on the federal insurance exchange. Premiums for those plans did increase in the past year, drawing criticism from Republicans that the system had failed. But Trump is leaving out a significant part of the story. An off year When officials and policy wonks talk about premium increases, there’s a commonly used benchmark employed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency takes a look at the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old. That allows a comparison of rates between years and different parts of the country. In its Oct. 24, 2016, brief, HHS showed that premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. As an average, that means some places saw higher increases than others. Oklahoma saw a 69 percent hike, for example, while Arkansas premiums only went up 2 percent. For the record, Arizona is the only state where premiums went up by triple digits. And in Indiana, premiums actually decreased in 2017. (It was the only state where that happened.) The 25 percent average increase is much higher than the earlier years of the Affordable Care Act. Premiums went up about 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015. It’s also much higher than the increases people who acquired health care through an employer saw.  In a survey of 425 large employers, the National Business Group on Health estimated that workers who get insurance through their jobs — which most people do — would see a 2017 increase of about 5 or 6 percent. The sudden jump is due in part because portions of the law designed to keep costs artificially low have ended or didn’t work as originally intended. Reinsurance kept premiums for high-cost policyholders low by transferring money to their plans. A program called risk corridors was designed to share money from profitable insurers with companies that lost money, but was targeted by Republicans. Both programs ended as planned for 2017, so many premiums went up considerably to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer policies on the exchange. An Urban Institute report said that underpricing was the norm in the early years of the health care law, so the jump this year was a short-term correction. There are other factors, too: Health care costs still are rising each year, though not as much as before the Affordable Care Act. There also are annual changes in who signs up, changes in provider networks and so on. ""Price increases are lower than we would have expected without exchanges in place,"" said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago. Enrollment for 2017 also went up, even with higher premiums and a possibility the law could be repealed. Close to 6.4 million people signed up for policies through the marketplace, about 400,000 more than last year. (Trump also doesn’t mention that the Medicaid expansion portion of the law accounts for more than half of newly covered patients.) David Himmelstein, a professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, noted something else not said by Trump. While premiums for some did go up significantly, most people buying these plans aren’t paying those increases. ""More than 70 percent of people who purchase coverage through the exchanges receive subsidies, and they will not pay any more for their coverage since their share is fixed,"" Himmelsten said. ""Government will pick up any increase, and government costs for Obamacare have actually been lower than initially predicted."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.""  Many people purchasing health care through federal and state insurance marketplaces did see double-digit premium increases, and one, Arizona, saw a larger increase. But as we have noted in previous fact-checks, Trump’s talking point doesn’t accurately reflect the situation overall. Several states did not see such dramatic premium changes, and experts say that health care costs broadly are increasing at a lower rate than before the health care law took effect. Most people get their health care through the employer, which hasn’t seen the same premium spikes. And for people on the health care exchanges, federal subsidies are offsetting premium increases for many. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

North Carolina Republican leader claims credit for the nation's best teacher pay raises
","North Carolina teachers have been among the lowest-paid in the nation for the better part of a decade now. Concerns over education funding have dogged Republican politicians since they took over the state legislature in 2011. Pushing back against the criticism, N.C. House Speaker Tim Moore said he and his fellow Republicans are doing more to give teachers raises than politicians anywhere else in the country. ""North Carolina's teacher income is rising faster than any other state,"" Moore wrote on Twitter, Facebook and in a press release earlier this month. Teacher pay debates can quickly become controversial. Local school boards are the largest employers in many of the state’s 100 counties, and the liberal N.C. Association of Educators, a teacher advocacy group, holds a great deal of political clout. When campaigning in North Carolina, politicians on both sides of the aisle tend to exaggerate claims about teacher pay. See our fact-checks of Mostly False claims by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and North Carolina’s Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper for just a few examples. Now, similar to those two claims from Democratic politicians, this time Moore takes a snippet of truth and twists it out of context to try to bolster his own party. Figuring out what years to measure It wasn’t immediately clear what Moore meant by ""is rising faster."" We asked if he was talking about just the most recent school year, or the entire time Republicans have been in charge of the state budget. Moore’s communications director Joseph Kyzer said it was neither. Moore was talking about the period from 2014 to 2016, Kyzer said. While none of Moore’s statements ever directly gave that time frame, his press release and website did cite several blog posts and news articles about teacher pay raises in those years. ""The 2014-16 time period provided in the data the Speaker linked to covers the total teacher raises (under) Republican leadership, so it is accurate to quantify Republican pay increases over that combined period and claim NC ranks No. 1 in the U.S.,"" Kyzer said. So we looked at that time frame. But we didn’t stop there, because doing so would ignore half the budgets written and passed by Moore and his colleagues. Furthermore, when the N.C. GOP shared Moore’s claim in its own press release, it used the more sweeping headline ""Teacher Pay in NC Under Republican Leadership"" and never mentioned Moore’s timeframe. So we looked at the years Moore’s office suggested, as well as how North Carolina has done under all six years the GOP has had control of the state budget. Year-by-year In the current 2016-17 school year, the average North Carolina teacher is making just shy of $50,000. That’s about a 3.9 percent raise since last year. We don’t know if that’s the best in the country. There’s no national data yet. But it is well above the national average for the post-recession years, which has typically been below 1.5 percent. The national data for 2015-2016 is partially complete. The National Education Association, the country’s largest teacher’s union, aggregates this type of data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. NEA researcher Tim Tang said nearly half haven’t reported their 2015-2016 numbers year, so the data listed for them in that year's NEA reports is instead an inflation-based placeholder, But North Carolina is one of the 27 states we do have data for, and we don’t need the rest to know it didn’t have the nation’s fastest-rising pay in 2015-2016. The state’s 0.35 percent raise was higher than eight but lower than another 18. So once the other 24 report, North Carolina will rank somewhere between 19th and 43rd. The previous year, in 2014-2015 North Carolina did have the country’s biggest raise, at 6.2 percent. But in 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, the average North Carolina teacher’s pay dropped each year. The state’s change in pay ranked 47th or 48th all three years. So we crunched the numbers to see if that one excellent year could make up for the rest. Total during GOP control Moore’s claim clearly isn’t true if you consider the GOP’s entire record. Between 2011-2012 and 2015-2016, teacher pay increased in North Carolina by 4.5 percent. Of the 27 states that have reported for 2015-16, 10 had larger increases. And between 2011-2012 and 2014-15, when we have data from all 50 states and D.C., 21 others had larger increases than in North Carolina. Teacher pay in North Carolina rose 4.1 percent in that period. The national average was 3.6 percent and the top state, Vermont, saw teacher pay rise by 12.3 percent – triple the North Carolina rate. Moore’s chosen timeline If we consider only Moore’s cherry-picked data from 2014 on, North Carolina does appear (at least at first glance) to have the country’s fastest-growing teacher pay. In those years, North Carolina’s teacher pay rose 6.7 percent. But that’s an arbitrary selection of years that only counts years of positive growth and excludes the years when salaries actually fell. PolitiFact previously dinged President Barack Obama for similarly cherry-picking data to warp the facts, in a Half True claim about job creation. And again, we should note that we still don’t have data from 24 of the 51 states and D.C. from the 2015-16 school year. So that means while North Carolina does appear to have the fastest-rising teacher pay, 24 others could possibly surpass it. More realistically, though, five of the 24 have a reasonable chance of doing so. They are North Dakota, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Florida and the District of Columbia. Each gave about a 2 or 3 percent raise in 2013-14 and again in 2014-15. If they kept up that trend in 2015-16, they might have already surpassed North Carolina. It’s simply too soon to know. Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. Tim Moore, the N.C. House Speaker, said that ""North Carolina's teacher income is rising faster than any other state."" If you look at all six years Moore and his fellow Republicans have been in charge of the state budget, the claim is clearly not true. Teacher pay has risen faster in many other states. Moore said he was only counting from 2014 onward, which excludes the years teacher pay fell under GOP leadership. We frown on cherry-picking data like that. However, that data does support Moore’s claim – but only with the caveat that the data is incomplete, and some states could still feasibly overtake North Carolina. Either way, Moore has a point that the teacher pay is rising quickly in recent years.

TRUE: During campaign, Trump pledged to leave marijuana legalization up to states
"," The Trump Administration signaled last week it could crack down on recreational marijuana in states such as California where voters legalized pot last November, marking a possible change from the Obama Administration’s more permissive approach. ""There is still a federal law we need to abide by in terms of when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Feb. 23, 2017. ""I do believe that you'll see greater enforcement."" The next day, Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom urged Trump in a letter to follow the hands-off pot approach he claimed Trump had promised during his campaign. ""A Quinnipiac poll released yesterday says that 71-percent of US voters (say) that the government should not interfere with states that passed legalized marijuana and during your campaign, you committed to honoring states’ rights when it comes to marijuana legalization,"" Newsom wrote on Feb. 24, 2017.  Newsom also helped write California’s voter-approved ballot measure, Proposition 64, that legalized recreational marijuana last November. He is running for California governor in 2018. We wanted to know whether Newsom was right: Had Trump ""committed"" during his campaign to leaving recreational pot up to the states? Our research Newsom’s spokesman pointed to three examples during his campaign where Trump said marijuana legalization should be up to the states. In a television interview on July 29, 2016 with KUSA-TV in Colorado, Trump said: ""I wouldn’t do that [using federal authority to shut down recreational marijuana], no … I wouldn’t do that … I think it’s up to the states, yeah. I’m a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely."" In a radio interview with WWJ Newsradio 950 in Michigan on March 8, 2016, Trump said ""I think it certainly has to be a state — I have not smoked it — it’s got to be a state decision …  I do like it, you know, from a medical standpoint … it does do pretty good things. But from the other standpoint, I think that it should be up to the states."" At a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada on Oct. 29, 2015, Trump said: ""The marijuana thing is such a big thing. I think medical should happen — right? Don’t we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states. It should be a state situation ... but I believe that the legalization of marijuana – other than for medical because I think medical, you know I know people that are very, very sick and for whatever reason the marijuana really helps them - … but in terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state.""  Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada in October 2015 about marijuana legalization. Trump’s comment at the Sparks rally was also recorded in a Washington Post news article at the time with the headline ""Trump softens position on marijuana legalization."" A different view? Newsom’s spokesman did not include a fourth high-profile example where Trump discussed legal pot, one that somewhat contradicts Trump’s other comments on the topic. In an interview with Trump on Fox News on Feb. 11, 2016, host Bill O’Reilly described Colorado’s experience legalizing pot as leading to ""... all of the dealers, all of the pushers are going to Colorado, loading up on the free pot because it’s legal, not free -- legal and then zooming around the country selling it. Does that concern you?"" Trump responded saying he favors medical marijuana ""100 percent."" ""But what you are talking about (with recreational marijuana), perhaps not. It's causing a lot of problems out there,"" Trump added. Trump doesn’t bring up states rights in this interview. But in his subsequent interviews, with the Michigan radio station in March 2016 and the Colorado television station in July 2016, he returns to his line that states should decide the matter. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has strongly opposed marijuana legalization. He told reporters on Feb. 27, 2017 that: ""States they can pass the laws they choose. I would just say it does remain a violation of federal law to distribute marijuana throughout any place in the United States, whether a state legalizes it or not."" Long before running for president, Trump voiced strong opinions on drug legalization. In April 1990 in an article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Trump said the United States should legalize drugs and use the money collected to educate the public on the dangers of drug use. ""We're losing badly the war on drugs,"" Trump said at the time, according to the article. ""You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars."" Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed Donald Trump, during his campaign for president, ""committed to honoring states' rights when it comes to marijuana legalization."" In at least three campaign interviews, Trump said he thought the issue of legalizing marijuana should be left to the states. This wasn’t one of Trump’s high-profile promises like building a wall on the Southern border. And he did not address marijuana in his major campaign speeches. But he did make clear, multiple times, how he felt when asked. In a separate interview on Fox News, Trump expressed concern over legal pot in Colorado. But in two subsequent interviews he returned to his line that the matter should be decided by the states. In the end, Trump’s own words back Newsom’s claim. We rated it True.

No evidence that protesters are paid to disrupt Republican town hall meetings
","Several Republican lawmakers have accused protesters at recent town hall-style meetings of being the tools of deep-pocketed benefactors pushing a liberal agenda. They’re being paid to demonstrate, some GOP officials say, with some activists being shipped in from out of state to Republican-led congressional districts to kick up an artificial fuss. U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas was one Republican who leveled the charge in a Feb. 21 statement. Gohmert was refusing to hold any constituent meetings because of protests elsewhere. ""Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety,"" the statement read. His statement noted former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords ""was shot at a public appearance,"" prompting Giffords to release a statement excoriating members of Congress who ""have abandoned their civic obligations"" to ""have some courage"" and ""hold town halls."" While Gohmert is not the only official to claim protesters are being paid, nothing has yet turned up to support those claims. The burden of proof still lies with the accusers, however, and Republicans haven’t been offering any evidence (and neither did Democrats when they made similar claims about the tea party a few years ago). Nothing proven First thing about these town hall protests: Crowds have been pretty raucous and confrontational, but not violent. Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham did not provide evidence that protesters had been paid. Also silent when we asked for proof was Jim DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina who now is president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He told Greta Van Susteren on MSNBC on Feb. 22 that’s he’d been reading the Indivisible Guide, a handbook for grassroots protest compiled by several Democratic former congressional staffers. DeMint tried to draw a contrast between Indivisible’s protesters and the tea party, saying Indivisible’s activists were ""very well-financed, very well-organized"" and were ""being bused around to go to these different town halls to disrupt them."" That was news to the leaders of Indivisible, who have said they only tried to provide resources — how to found an activist group, how to reach members of Congress, how to hold meetings and form talking points, etc. — to groups unhappy with leaders in their districts. ""It’s easier to say all these protests are paid than to admit there are wide swaths of people in your district who disagree with how they are represented in Congress,"" Sarah Dohl, a spokeswoman for Indivisible told PolitiFact. Dohl said there were only a handful of people behind Indivisible, which offers a website that has registered more than 5,300 different activist groups in order to help them organize. The group was conceived over Thanksgiving 2016, she said, actually drawing from some tea party principles (keeping groups relatively small and committed to local issues, for example). While they have received some donations, none of the board members draw a salary. Most of the people Indivisible helps have not been politically active before, Dohl said, but President Donald Trump’s election had sparked them into action. One such protester is Caitlynn Moses, a 23-year-old from Fayetteville, Ark. She told us she had never gotten involved in politics, but helped organize her group Ozark Indivisible to convince Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to hold a town hall meeting in Springdale on Feb. 22. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., faced a large crowd at a meeting in Springdale, Ark. Cotton acknowledged the paid protester controversy at the meeting, which Moses said attracted more than 2,000 people. ""I don't care if anybody here is paid or not,"" Cotton said. ""You're all Arkansans and I'm glad to hear from you."" Moses was glad Cotton was willing to come out, although she laughs at the idea that her group — or anyone other activist — is paid to attend forums. ""I would say the majority of us are losing money to do this,"" she said. ""It's so important for us to stand up for what we believe that we are willing to sacrifice for it. The rumor that we're paid protestors is absolutely despicable. It's just something someone came up with so they could write us off."" The backlash against protests has roots in the current White House, which has questioned their legitimacy since before Trump took office. Press secretary Sean Spicer said on Feb. 22 that he thought ""some people are clearly upset, but there is a bit of professional protester manufactured base in there."" This after Spicer earlier this month on Fox News accused protesters opposing Trump’s executive order on immigration of being ""a very paid, ‘AstroTurf’ type movement."" Nothing new If that term sounds familiar, it’s because liberal pundits and politicians used it to describe the tea party in 2009. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said in April 2009 that ""the tea parties don’t represent a spontaneous outpouring of public sentiment. They’re AstroTurf (fake grassroots) events, manufactured by the usual suspects."" Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also used the term, saying of the tea party a few days later: ""This initiative is funded by the high end; we call it AstroTurf, it's not really a grassroots movement. It's AstroTurf by some of the wealthiest people in America to keep the focus on tax cuts for the rich instead of for the great middle class."" Trump addressed the protests last week, tweeting, ""The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists."" The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad! That echoes a common fallback position for politicians who can’t prove that protesters are paid, University of California-Irvine sociology and political science professor David Meyer told us. ""It's a little interesting that some of the Republican targets, unable to substantiate the paid professionals charge, retreat to making the claim that the protesters are organized,"" said Meyer, who wrote the book The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. ""Of course they are. Someone distributed information about the time and place of each town meeting and encouraged people to show up and ask tough questions. That's how politics works."" Meyer has looked into several activist groups, with no evidence yet of protesters being paid. The closest some aides have come is suggesting that Planned Parenthood, with its paid staff, have supported activist meetings, he said. Trump has been suspicious of protesters since the campaign trail, when he accused Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama of paying people to incite violence at rallies, without ever providing proof. The Internet also has spread unproven or outright faked claims that protesters raked in thousands of dollars or that George Soros paid Women’s March participants. Soros has denied such reports; his foundation has recently denied paying town hall protesters. Town hall attendees have taken to holding up their drivers licenses and signs with their ZIP codes in order to prove that they live in the districts in which they are protesting. ""Not a single member has challenged the authenticity of a town hall questioner to their face,"" said Nathan Williams, a spokesman for volunteer-based forum organizers the Town Hall Project. ""Because they all know these claims of ‘paid protesters’ are ridiculous."" Williams said the Town Hall Project has no paid employees, even its full-time staff. Our ruling Gohmert said political activists are ""being paid"" to protest members of Congress. His office didn’t provide any evidence of this, and neither did several other Republican officials we asked. It’s possible some protesters somewhere may be paid, but there’s zero evidence of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring in paid activists to disrupt meetings. We rate this statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a6193c51-8464-41e6-be3a-6f31d4804f51",/factchecks/2017/feb/27/louie-gohmert/protesters-are-paid-disrupt-town-hall-meetings-goh/

Checking rural PA Republican’s claim that city students need ‘less intensive’ education
","Would students from distressed urban neighborhoods be better off if their instruction was ""less intensive""? A Republican Pennsylvania senator out of Blair County sparked controversy for suggesting as much at a town hall in West Pennsboro last week. As reported in the Carlisle Sentinel, Sen. John Eichelberger criticized state education programming that directs students of color toward college rather than vocational courses as a matter of ill-used funding.   ""They’re pushing them toward college and they’re dropping out,"" Eichelberger, chair of Senate Education Committee, said. ""They fall back and don’t succeed, whereas if there was a less intensive track, they would."" Pa. Sen. Vincent Hughes, D-Philadelphia, called Eichelberger’s remarks ""racist."" Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, told Philly.com the commentary was ""offensive"" and that he had contacted Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, to discuss it because the Democratic caucus members found it alarming. Eichelberger, amid blowback, has insisted that his words were taken out of context. He’s even accused the Sentinel of publishing fake news.  But Zack Hoopes, the Sentinel business editor who captured the quotes, told PolitiFact Pennsylvania he stands by the article’s accuracy. Despite of the severity of Eichelberger’s accusation, the senator doesn’t challenge that he actually said this. Eichelberger’s office gave PolitiFact Pennsylvania the following statement yesterday: ""He’s never denied saying that, but the comment was taken out of a larger conversation on education and how we prepare our students for the future. The larger context is lost in the story. What has been reported was a brief snippet of an elaborate conversation with local residents.  The observations were made about options in our education system during an hour-and-a-half of discussion.  It wasn’t perfectly worded, but it is something that needs to be discussed, so instead of misplaced outrage, the Senator would prefer to see an open and honest conversation."" So, on with the fact-check! Eichelberger’s office shared no evidence to substantiate his claim. PolitiFact Pennsylvania wasn’t able to find studies that make similar arguments in our research, that a ""less intensive"" track would be lead to more success for ""inner city"" students, and the academics we spoke with weren’t familiar with papers that could back that up either. Julia C. Duncheon, an expert on college readiness for urban students based at the University of Texas at El Paso said that is was ""not true"" that lower-income students needed ""less intensive"" instruction. In fact, studies show the opposite: ""Those who have taken the more rigorous classes are more likely to persist in college,"" she said. The Institute for Higher Education Policy emphasizes the importance of ""a rigorous, college-ready curriculum, starting in middle school,"" calling this ""crucial."" Education researchers regularly identify that low-income students in cities often lack access to bona fide college preparatory coursework. In an email, pointing to a 2009 Center for American Progress report that espouses high standards in college prep curricula, Duncheon noted that certain demographics see particular gains. ""While rigorous academic preparation is important for all students, it is especially important for African American and Latina/o students,"" wrote Duncheon. ""Again, we see equity gaps decrease among college students who have completed a rigorous academic course load in high school."" Duncheon found Eichelberger’s recommending vocational tracks problematic. ""We tend to see low-income students funneled into those,"" said Duncheon. As inadequate access to high-level classes persists in underserved neighborhoods, poor students of color are underrepresented in these courses. ""The notion that they pursue vocational education is troubling because we’re already dealing with problems of racial segregation with vocational education."" Duncheon was careful not to discourage vocational training, saying that students need ""a variety of pathways."" ""There are too many students getting less intensive education anyway,"" said Ivory Toldson, editor of the Journal of Negro Education and a professor at Howard University. In 2012, Toldson co-authored the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation report ""Challenge the Status Quo: Academic Success among School-age African American Males."" They had several recommendations for better preparing black boys: many pushed fostering supportive, bias-free environments in school and at home, but they also recommended ""offer[ing] a curriculum that, at a minimum, meets the admissions requirements for the most competitive public university of your state."" ""What I found in my analysis was that black and Latino students in urban districts like Philadelphia were the least likely to take high-level math and science courses which limited their opportunities,"" said Toldson. ""The short of it is: I think what the senator is proposing is actually the opposite of what they need."" Toldson argued that modern technical instruction not only could bear benefits for some students, but relies on a comprehension of math and science that corresponds to the digital age. ""We don’t want to give kids the outdated notion that to be an auto mechanic you don’t need math,"" he said. ""That may have been true in the ’50s and ’60s, but that’s not true today."" Duncheon didn’t want to dismiss that dropouts are a persistent problem for low-income students. But, she said, ""there’s a lot of complexity around why students drop out. There’s no clear cut reason why they do, there’s a lot of factors."" Certain trends that researchers like Duncheon have observed pertain to financial restraints and first-generation college students. A 2012 American Institutes for Research report noted that only 10 percent of college dropouts left due to academic struggles. Half of their respondents cited something more hazy, ""personal reasons."" ""Academics are definitely a piece of it, but it’s not the full story,"" she said. Eichelberger declined repeated requests for interview, but his office did share this statement as well: ""Each child has different skills that may be best suited for college or vocational training. This has been recognized by educational experts in our state and around the nation. The best option for kids should be available for all students, whether in Carlisle or Philadelphia or anywhere else in the Commonwealth. ""Vocational training is not an offensive term and should not be treated as such. Vocational education is a path for training and education that leads to higher incomes and family-supporting jobs. For many, it is their stepping stone for success. ""We cannot continue to protect a system that is failing children. If our students are not being provided with that guidance and options in a significant way, then we need to take a closer look at that to ensure that every student deserves the chance to succeed no matter their skin color or economic situation.""
  Our Ruling Eichelberger said, Inner-city students ""fall back and don’t succeed, whereas if there was a less intensive track, they would."" While there are experts who support offering vocational education to low-income students, we were not able to find any research that backs Eichelberger’s comment. To the contrary, studies show that low-income students with experience in accelerated courses fare better in college.

No evidence for PAC's claim that Tammy Baldwin 'wants to require children' to 'learn about gay sex'
","The sexuality of Tammy Baldwin, the nation’s first openly gay U.S. senator, is under attack by a group that says it wants to unseat her in an election that is 21 months away. Restore American Freedom and Liberty goes personal on the Wisconsin Democrat as part of what it says is an effort to draft conservative Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. to run against her in 2018. In a fundraising email revealed by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Feb. 16, 2017, the group calls Baldwin a ""pervert"" and ""disgusting."" It also uses extreme language in claiming Baldwin ""wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!"" That claim caught our attention. The group The Denver-based Restore American Freedom and Liberty, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, is a so-called Carey committee -- a ""hybrid"" political action committee that is not affiliated with a candidate and can operate as a traditional PAC, contributing funds to a candidate's committee, and as a super PAC, which makes independent expenditures. The Journal Sentinel reported that Restore American Freedom and Liberty is one of four pro-Clarke groups that drop the names of popular politicians in fundraising appeals but then use the cash primarily on consultants, not candidates. Denver attorney Alexander Hornaday, the treasurer for the group, did not reply to our email and phone requests for information to back up the group’s attack on Baldwin. According to the Denver Post, Hornaday is a gay Republican who was a leader of the Colorado chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, which represents gay conservatives. The attack Since Restore American Freedom and Liberty didn’t respond to us, we’re left to search for what its claim might be alluding to. We found three pieces of legislation backed by Baldwin, none of which became law, that are possibilities in that they all pertained to gay students. Orientation surveys: In 2010, as a member of the U.S. House, Baldwin introduced a bill that would have required a federal agency to request sexual orientation data in health-related national surveys it does. But the bill did not have any requirement to teach children about gay sex. Bullying in schools: In 2015, Baldwin co-sponsored a bill to require states to direct their local educational agencies to establish policies that prevent and prohibit bullying. The bill states that students have been singled out for bullying based on various factors, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Again, no requirement to teach about sex. Sex education: In 2016, Baldwin co-sponsored a bill that would, among other things, require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to award grants for training teachers and staff to teach age-appropriate comprehensive sex education to elementary and secondary school students. For the elementary students, the teaching would be aimed at ""broadening student knowledge about issues related to human development, relationships, personal skills and sexual behavior, including abstinence."" None of the grants could be given to programs that ""are insensitive and unresponsive to the needs of sexually active youth or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth."" So, that legislation provides financial incentives to teach sex education in a manner that is inclusive of gay students. But it’s not a requirement. It’s a grant program that school districts can choose to apply for. What’s more, it is for elementary and high school students, not targeted at kindergarteners. Indeed, the bill dictates the education be age appropriate, making it highly unlikely that 5-year-olds would be taught about sex acts. Our rating Restore American Freedom and Liberty says Baldwin ""wants to require children starting at age 5 to learn about gay sex!"" The group did not reply to our requests for information that would back the statement. And we could not find any evidence that Baldwin supports such a requirement. If information surfaces that was available when the group made its claim and it is relevant, we could reconsider this fact check. But in the meantime, we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2017/feb/27/restore-american-freedom-and-liberty/no-evidence-pacs-claim-tammy-baldwin-wants-require/

Mostly False: New DNC chair Tom Perez says Donald Trump wants to eliminate overtime pay
","On his first full day as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, former Labor Department secretary Thomas Perez said the Democratic Party needs to win back American workers who turned to Republicans in the 2016 election. On the Feb. 26 edition of NBC’S Meet the Press, Perez said Democrats fell short by spending too much time bashing President Donald Trump and not enough time talking about a progressive economic message. ""We stand for good wages. We stand for Social Security. We stand for retirement security. We brought this nation Medicare,"" Perez said of Democrats. ""The Republicans are trying to voucherize Medicare and privatize Social Security."" Then he said something we hadn’t heard before: ""Donald Trump wants to eliminate overtime pay for people."" While Trump has said he will not cut Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare, other Republicans have laid out plans for restructuring the programs. We wanted to look into the last part of Perez’s comment — is Trump really planning to deliver a KO to OT? To back up his claim, Perez’s team sent clips from three news articles and a memo from Trump’s campaign. However, none of these sources show Trump wants to ""eliminate overtime pay,"" the money earned for working more than a specified number of hours a week. What Trump has said While Trump has not talked about eliminating overtime pay, he has supported rolling back an Obama-era regulation that would expand the number of people eligible for overtime. In an August 2016 interview with the online news service Circa, Trump was asked if there’s any new regulations he wanted to eliminate. The interviewer asked, ""What are some fresh examples of federal regulations you’d roll back if you were president? For example, the Labor Department. They have a regulation that’s going to take effect on Dec. 1. It’s going to impose overtime requirements on small business. Would that be one of them?"" Trump said the rules regarding overtime were just an example of the type of business regulations he would seek to roll back as president. Trump is quoted as saying, ""We have to address the issues of over-taxation and over-regulation and the lack of access to credit markets to get our small business owners thriving again. Rolling back the overtime regulation is just one example of the many regulations that need to be addressed to do that."" A small business advisory council memo from the Trump-Pence campaign Oct. 17 conveyed a similar message about the burden of economic regulations. ""Labor issues like minimum wage, overtime rules, and union organizing all take their toll, reads the memo. ""It seems to many small business owners out here in ‘flyover land’ that the insiders in D.C. have it in for them. And they probably do."" It’s not clear from his comments if Trump was referencing any particular rule or regulation, but there is one notable Obama-era rule that made waves in Republican circles in 2016. Most employees in the United States are eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours a week. But there’s an exception for white-collar workers. To be considered a white-collar worker by the government, an employee has to make more than $455 per week, be paid salary, and work in an administrative, executive or professional position. People who meet these criteria do not qualify for overtime pay.  In March 2014, President Barack Obama signed a presidential memorandum directing the U.S. Labor Department (then led by Perez) to update regulations related to overtime pay in the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Two years later, the Obama administration finalized a rule that would shrink the number of workers affected by the ""white-collar"" exemption. Under Obama’s proposed rule, those workers would be eligible for overtime if they made less than $47,500 a year (up from $26,660). The Department of Labor estimated that 4.2 million workers would become eligible to earn overtime as a result of the new rule. However, many states and businesses, unhappy with the new proposal, filed an emergency motion challenging the rule. On Nov. 22, 2016, U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant in Texas, sided with those states and business groups and granted their motion for a nationwide injunction. With the new regulation on hold, the Trump administration could have decided whether to continue defending the rule in court, or kill it completely. In response, the White House issued a moratorium on all proposed federal regulations that have yet to take effect. Trump’s Labor Department is without a permanent chief. Trump had nominated fast-food executive Andrew Puzder for the role, though he withdrew from consideration Feb. 15 before a doubtful confirmation vote. Trump then nominated Alexander Acosta, a law school dean at Florida International University and former Justice Department official, who is awaiting confirmation. On Meet the Press, Perez said Trump wanted to eliminate overtime pay, and also that ""he nominates someone to head the Labor Department who wants to gut overtime pay."" It is likely Perez was referring to Puzder, who was an open critic of Obama’s overtime rule. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Puzder cautioned against ""rewarding time spent rather than time well spent."" We could not find instances of Acosta opposing the overtime rule. The White House did not respond for comment. Our ruling Perez said Trump ""wants to eliminate overtime pay for people"". Perez’s statement offers a misleading view of Trump’s position on overtime. Trump’s administration has said he wants to roll back regulations — some of which would expand the number of those eligible for overtime — but that doesn’t translate to wanting to eliminate overtime completely. The regulation that would expand overtime eligibility for white-collar workers has never been enforced because of a pending court challenge.

Why Donald Trump's tweet about national debt decrease in his first month is highly misleading
","In an early morning tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump echoed a post on a fringe website claiming that the national debt has decreased by $12 billion since Trump took office. ""The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.,"" Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017. The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo. The tweet mirrors an article posted on the Gateway Pundit website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trump’s tweet. ""On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion,"" the Gateway Pundit website reads. ""On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office!"" The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury. But, experts say, people shouldn’t read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne. ""Considering that Trump hasn’t enacted any fiscal legislation, it’s a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels,"" Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us. ""Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns,"" he said. The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check. Looking at the debt numbers Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is ""debts held by the public,"" which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else. On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion. Here’s a chart that shows debt figures on selected days since Trump took office.  Date Debt Held by the Public Intragovernmental Holdings Total Public Debt Outstanding 01/20/2017 14,403,704,176,388.94 5,543,600,378,823.55 19,947,304,555,212.49 01/27/2017 14,387,267,502,732.51 5,551,752,332,096.38 19,939,019,834,828.89 02/02/2017 14,366,132,157,960.80 5,536,695,305,608.30 19,902,827,463,569.10 02/07/2017 14,365,365,821,333.09 5,530,397,847,836.97 19,895,763,669,170.06 02/09/2017 14,402,429,500,385.19 5,519,906,129,921.50 19,922,335,630,306.69 02/14/2017 14,404,012,711,812.97 5,528,666,521,903.19 19,932,679,233,716.16 02/15/2017 14,417,333,314,382.25 5,520,031,281,120.76 19,937,364,595,503.01 02/16/2017 14,403,392,566,439.40 5,523,188,600,438.96 19,926,581,166,878.36 02/22/2017 14,404,723,995,058.93 5,531,156,856,922.13 19,935,880,851,981.06 02/23/2017 14,384,082,361,381.86 5,529,818,758,806.29 19,913,901,120,188.15 So, in isolation, the debt held by the public is down since Trump took office. But experts say it’s likely to shoot back up any day. ""I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about,"" said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel. ""This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future?"" Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, ""both matters that he has not affected one iota."" Added Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters: ""No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all. There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number."" Donald Marron,  Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute, speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obama’s administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently.  On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department. By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion. Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion."" Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is ""down"" after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise. This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure. We rate this claim Mostly False. Update: This post has been updated to include comments from Neil Buchanan and to include Donald Marron's current title.  ",/factchecks/2017/feb/25/donald-trump/why-donald-trumps-tweet-about-decline-national-deb/
