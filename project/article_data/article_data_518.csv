Braves stadium jobs and wages numbers fall short
","Backers of constructing a taxpayer-subsidized Atlanta Braves stadium in Cobb want residents to know that the new field of dreams will grow jobs and money. Revitalize Cobb, a pro-business interest group, announced the expected yield in a glossy mailer.  ""9,241 New Jobs + $295,000,000 in Wages + $0 Tax Increase for Homeowners + $3,000,000 Annually for Cobb Schools = 1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents,"" said the ad, which was sent to residents late last month. Should county taxpayers bet the farm on these numbers? Supporters of major publicly subsidized projects have made similar claims to fend off criticism that taxpayers are getting a bad deal. The Truth-O-Meter has checked a few that reference economic impact studies they say prove their point. But in many cases, they don’t come close. An earlier PolitiFact analyzed the claims that the stadium would require no tax increase for homeowners and provide $3 million for Cobb schools. They were rated Half True. Now it’s time to look at Revitalize Cobb’s jobs and wage figures. The group’s source is an economic impact study commissioned by the Cobb Chamber of Commerce, which has championed the stadium. It estimates the effects of two phases of the project — construction and the stadium’s operations over 10 years. Analysts assumed the ballpark will have 41,500 seats and attract 3 million fans during its first year. (The stadium is projected to open in 2017.) Attendance will stabilize at 2.7 million three years later. Construction will require 5,227 jobs over three years, according to the report, which was prepared by program management firm Brailsford & Dunlavey.  The report also states that each year, operating the park will require 1,187 full-time jobs, 1,753 part-time jobs, and 1,074 ""nonprofit jobs,"" an unusual category that we will explain later.  Add them up and you get 9,241 jobs, which is the figure used by Revitalize Cobb. The estimate of $295 million in wages combines the salaries earned over three years of construction with one year of wages for workers operating the park. We found a few problems with Revitalize Cobb’s portrayal of the study’s findings. Most jobs will not go to Cobb residents. And from a metro Atlanta and state perspective, by and large, these jobs aren’t ""new."" First, let’s consider construction jobs. These were calculated using a measurement called a ""job year,"" which is equivalent to one full-time job lasting one year. Economists use this measure to express the number of jobs created during the construction phase of a project because in this industry, positions can last for only a few months. So if four different plumbers worked three months each on the stadium, their combined efforts would equal one job year. According to the study, only 784 of these jobs -- or about 15 percent -- will go to Cobb residents. However, because of the nature of a job year, the stadium may put more than 784 Cobb residents to work. For the ballpark’s operation phase, the study counted a ""job"" as one position. Only about 27 percent of the full-time jobs and 30 percent of the part-time jobs are expected to go to county residents, the study states. Revitalize Cobb’s claim that the Braves move will result in $295 million in wages is also based on a regional number. ""The overall amount of wages is absolutely not the Cobb County payroll. No way,"" said Bruce Seaman, a professor at Georgia State University who has studied the economic impact of the Braves.  Revitalize Cobb did not hide this fact. Some of this breakdown appears in smaller type on the other side of the mailer.   But because the group used these numbers as proof that the stadium is ""1 Great Deal for Cobb Residents,"" readers could get the impression that the 9,241 jobs and $295 million in wages would go to locals, Seaman noted. From a state or regional perspective, these are not ""new"" jobs. For the most part, jobs that already exist in downtown Atlanta are simply moving to Cobb. ""You’re taking money out of one pocket and putting it in another,"" said Robert Baade, a Lake Forest College professor who studies the economics of sports. And many workers at the downtown stadium may not move with the Braves. If these current workers stay behind, Cobb residents have a good shot at the vacancies.  ""It’s a more direct opportunity for Cobb County residents,"" said Jason Thompson, a vice president at the firm that produced the study. Plus, new ballparks often provide services that require teams to boost their staffing, he said. Another problem with Revitalize Cobb’s claim is the group’s decision to count 1,074 ""nonprofit"" jobs among the new positions that would be created by the Cobb stadium. These positions are the result of a Braves program where nonprofit volunteers work for free in stadium jobs, Thompson said. The wages they would have earned go to their nonprofit. This volunteer work does have an economic impact. Their labor infuses money into the economy. However, this isn’t what your average person counts as jobs. By including them, Revitalize Cobb boosts its job numbers by 13 percent. While the study’s annual jobs figures seem a little high, the study’s findings appear to be in the ballpark, said Georgia State University professor Seaman, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Georgia. Our ruling: Revitalize Cobb used numbers generated by an economic impact study commissioned by the county’s Chamber of Commerce, which supports the stadium. The study’s findings are not unreasonable. But the mailer published by Revitalize Cobb uses its findings in a confusing way that could give the impression that a new stadium’s impact on Cobb is greater than the study predicts. While the interest group tried to provide context through the mailer, it didn’t do enough. It also added projected ""nonprofit"" positions to its jobs figures, which gives an inflated impression of the number of jobs the stadium is estimated to provide.  The pro-stadium mailer had an element of truth, but was a less-than-accurate portrayal of a flawed study commissioned by stadium boosters. Revitalize Cobb earns a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC69F2C0>],/factchecks/2013/dec/20/revitalize-cobb/braves-stadium-jobs-and-wages-numbers-fall-short/
"['PunditFact', 'Dennis Hastert']","
Dennis Hastert: There was no Hastert Rule
","One of the guiding principles for Republicans in the House of Representatives is that no bill comes up for a vote unless a majority of Republican members support it. It’s called the ""Hastert Rule,"" after former House Speaker Dennis Hastert who held the post from 1999 to 2007. The Hastert Rule got a lot of attention during the government shutdown. Democrats said the House could have broken the logjam sooner if they had been allowed to vote on a bill that would have pulled in about 30 Republican members. Current Speaker John Boehner would have none of it. But the namesake of the rule now says no rule, in fact, exists. ""There never really was a 'Hastert Rule',"" Hastert said Wedneday on MSNBC’s The Cycle. He said the ""rule"" was just a statement of common sense. ""If you're a leader of the House and you need to go to the other side of the aisle to move your agenda, you give up a lot of power and leadership,"" Hastert said. ""The real Hastert Rule (was) you didn't bring a bill to the floor unless you had 214 votes."" We wanted to address two issues in this fact-check. Is there an actual rule? And if not, why is everyone acting like there is one? Donald Wolfensberger, who spent 28 years as a House staffer and now directs the Congress Project at the Wilson Center, said there is no official Hastert Rule. ""It was neither a House rule nor a Republican conference rule, and certainly not a matter of law nor enforceable by point of order or caucus sanction,"" Wolfensberger said. ""As Hastert put it, it is a commonsense rule of thumb."" In fact, Boehner himself has deviated from the Hastert Rule without consequence. In January, the House passed $50.7 billion in federal aid for Hurricane Sandy victims with a majority of Republicans in opposition. A majority of Republicans also voted no on a January 2013 fiscal cliff deal that passed the House. The Hastert Rule, essentially, is popular shorthand for a tactic to prevent political embarrassment. In the rough and tumble of House politics, Wolfensberger said, the leader of the majority party would be naive to count on help from the minority to get a bill passed. ""It may be hard to believe but the minority sometimes takes delight in leaving the majority high and wet on the losing end of a vote on a matter that was supposed to have had bipartisan support,"" Wolfensberger said. Its origins likely stem from the GOP takeover of the House in 1995, said Linda Fowler, professor of government at Dartmouth College. Before then, Republicans had not controlled the House since President Dwight Eisenhower was in office. ""Old-style Republicans had been in the minority so long, they worked with the majority on the theory that part of a loaf was better than nothing,"" Fowler said. ""Gingrich and others like him were scornful of such accommodation."" Hastert says the term that bears his name originiated during a contentious vote on immigration policy in 2006. A reporter asked him why he wouldn’t move forward with help from Democrats. ""You don't really want to move anything unless you have the solid base of your party along with you,"" Hastert explained. Chicago Sun Times Washington bureau chief Lynn Sweet tracked it back to a 2003 speech by Hastert where he outlined his guidelines as speaker. ""My fifth principle is to please the majority of your majority,"" Hastert said. As Hastert said on MSNBC, it was all about holding on to power within his own party. A rule without a capital R The record is clear that the principle known as the Hastert Rule never had any formal standing. But the record is full of moments when politicians, staffers and journalists used the phrase. In March, Rep. David Schweikert, R- Ariz., urged his colleagues to ""honor the Hastert Rule and bring bills to the floor that enjoy majority support among our conference."" In September, a spokesman for Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D- Ill., said ""The Hastert Rule basically means that 118 Republicans have to agree on immigration reform before the whole House can consider it."" A Nexis search produced nearly 100 references to the Hastert Rule in newspapers since 2004. According to Nexis, the first instance was in November 2004 when Los Angeles Times reporter Richard Brownstein wrote about Hastert: ""One of his guiding principles has been that no bill should pass the House unless it has support not only from an overall majority but from a majority of Republicans. Call it the Hastert Rule."" An interesting, but worthwhile aside. For a brief time, members of Congress referred to a different ""Hastert Rule."" In May 2004, we found instances of people talking about the Hastert Rule in terms of members of Congress being able to raise the nation’s debt ceiling without voting on a standalone measure (the idea being to make life easier for members of Congress). The mechanism had been called the Gephardt Rule after former Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., but when Hastert became speaker, Democrats changed the ""rule’s"" name. Our ruling Hastert said there never was a Hastert Rule. As a formal rule, adopted by the Republican Conference or the House Rules Committee, that is accurate. Boehner himself broke the Hastert rule at least twice in 2013 and suffered no consequences. Yet, the Hastert Rule has become shorthand for a belief popular among Republicans that has no-doubt shaped GOP policy in the past and present. And Boehner could face consequences from his Republican caucus if he continued to violate the rule -- namely losing his speakership. In that sense, the Hastert Rule has become a little akin to common law among the GOP. Hastert has a technical point but glosses over some important caveats. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAB0780>],/factchecks/2013/dec/19/dennis-hastert/hastert-there-was-no-hastert-rule/

Does the Oregon Lottery show people playing and winning video lottery games?
 ","The Oregon Lottery has churned plenty of money into the state’s coffers since its inception in 1984. It’s now a $500 million-a-year cash cow, with 86 percent of that coming from video slot and poker machines. Of course those proceeds also mean big losses for players. Many of them, as The Oregonian’s Harry Esteve showed in a recent series on the Oregon Lottery, are problem gamblers who lose thousands of dollars a year playing video lottery machines. Jack Roberts, who became the Oregon Lottery director Dec. 1, 2013, took issue with the series and its contention that the lottery uses ""aggressive"" marketing to get people to play video slots. In a Dec. 11, 2013, interview on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s ""Think Out Loud"" radio show, he defended lottery advertising. ""We’re very careful in terms of our marketing,"" said Roberts, Oregon’s former labor commissioner. ""We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games."" But we had seen an ad that showed people playing and wondered whether that’s true. PolitiFact Oregon decided to get to the bottom of it. The lottery has several ads, including print, radio and television spots. Some talk about how money from the lottery helps parks or fish habitat, for example. Others encourage people to buy scratch-off tickets. PolitiFact Oregon also found two videos on the lottery website, one that is also being shown on television. The one that appears on television shows a young woman zipping up a life vest to paddle a kayak on the Willamette River. It also shows a man putting on a helmet for a motorcycle ride. A voice-over talks about gambling responsibly by setting a time limit and a budget as the video shows someone setting a smartphone timer for 20 minutes and circling ""Entertainment"" on a sheet of paper next to a ""150."" Then it shows the woman and man playing an Oregon Lottery video game and breaking into broad smiles, the man pumping his fists, after the woman pushes the button. The second video can be viewed only on the lottery’s website by clicking the words ""Click here to see how much fun Video Lottery can be."" It shows various people smiling and laughing as they play Oregon Lottery slot machines. In one scene, three people cheer and clap as they win; the video shows three fives lined up on the game screen. In another scene, two people brim with elation and high-five as they look at a video game screen. At the end, a voice tells viewers that ""Lottery games are based on chance and should be played for entertainment only."" Next we contacted Roberts’ office in Salem and asked about his assertion. Through lottery spokesman Chuck Baumann, Roberts provided this statement: ""My reference to marketing referred to our advertisements for the lottery. I was not referring to our responsible gambling ads, where we believe it helps to show people gambling in order to demonstrate what responsible gambling means. Even these ads mainly show side shots of the machines and do not portray players winning a jackpot or celebrating their winnings. My statement was in response to accusations that we run ads glorifying gambling in order to attract more players. In fact, we do not."" We called Jeff Marotta, who works with problem gamblers and who, until recently, belonged to a lottery advisory group. Marotta, president and senior consultant at Problem Gambling Solutions, said he had seen the ""kayaking and motorcycling"" ad on television for the first time the night before. However, it wasn’t the first time he’d seen the ad. He saw it in September, when lottery officials asked him to critique new responsible-gambling ads showing people playing ""VLTs,"" -- or video lottery terminals. ""The images in the final segment of these ads show men playing VLTs with attractive women by their sides, smiling at the man and the machine,"" Marotta wrote to lottery officials in a memo dated Sept. 25, 2013. ""The message that VLTs are fun and attractive are further accentuated by the peppy music, announcer tone, choice of actors, association with cool activities…"" He ended the memo by writing, ""In sum, these responsible gambling ads could be viewed as wolves in sheep’s clothing and in my opinion should not be aired."" Marotta told us his long-term contract to advise lottery officials was terminated soon after. ""Was it this that burned my bridge with them?"" he said. ""Maybe. I’ll never know for sure."" Roberts, in a follow-up email, noted that he became director after Marotta’s departure as a consultant. He added, ""Our advertisements about responsible gambling are in fulfillment of our obligation to operate the lottery in a manner commensurate with the public interest."" He did not elaborate on his earlier claim that the ads don’t show people playing or winning video games. But Baumann, in a later phone conversation, said Roberts had not seen the website-only video at the time of his OPB comments. It’s true that Roberts had been on the job less than two weeks when he made the statement on OPB and understandable that he had not seen one of the ads. The lottery has many ads, and the website has many pages. The kayaking ad is more problematic. The Oregon Lottery does classify it as a ""responsible gambling"" ad. But Roberts, on OPB, said of lottery marketing: ""We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games."" He didn’t mention a distinction. Neither would that distinction be clear to viewers. And as Marotta noted, the ad -- showing young, attractive people having a great time -- would be unlikely to dissuade people from gambling. Finally, despite Roberts’ statement on OPB, even the kayaking ad clearly shows people not only playing but enthusiastically smiling and reacting to an apparent win. We find Roberts’ statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAF5280>],/factchecks/2013/dec/19/jack-roberts/does-oregon-lottery-show-people-playing-and-winnin/

Florida Republican Party says state has had 39 consecutive months of job growth
","After a recent Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times investigation revealed that state incentives have so far only led to a tiny sliver of promised jobs, Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican Party of Florida decided to fight back with their own job statistics. ""Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months,"" the Republican Party of Florida posted on Facebook this month. The claim seemed odd to us, since 39 months would include part of former Gov. Charlie Crist’s term. We wanted to dig further. Florida job statistics currently are available through October 2013, meaning Scott has been in office for 34 months where figures are available. In that time, Florida has gained jobs in 29 months and lost jobs in five months -- including as recently as May. That means Florida has added jobs for five consecutive months, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, not 39. Case closed? Not entirely. The state Republican Party told us it didn’t mean ""consecutive"" as in month after month. Instead, Republicans said they were comparing each month to the same month the previous year -- so October 2012 vs. October 2013, etc. By that measure, Florida has had 39 months of positive job growth. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, the last month that saw a decline in the total number of people employed compared to the same month the previous year was July 2010. We turned to economists to see what they thought of the GOP’s wording and approach. They said the GOP was misleading in its wording but that one measure of job growth isn’t necessarily better than the other. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s and Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College in Florida, told us it can be more useful to look at trends over a few months in a row. ""For example, In March and April of 2013, the Florida economy added about 25,000 and 19,000 jobs, respectively,"" Seyfried said. ""There were about 5,000 fewer jobs in May but then about 36,000 jobs added over the next two months. As an economist, I view May as the outlier given solid employment gains in the two months before and two months afterwards. I wouldn’t extend that to 12 months, but normally would focus on the three-month average (as opposed to just one month at a time)."" Gary Burtless, an economist at Brookings, said that most readers would have misinterpreted the Republican Party’s statement to refer to one month followed by the next month. ""Employment has generally increased over the past 39 months,"" he said. But ""it simply hasn't increased for 39 consecutive months."" Retired University of Florida economics professor David Denslow agreed. The GOP ""should have said, Florida has experienced positive year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months,’ "" Denslow said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said ""Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months."" Economists say the state GOP is guilty of sloppy wording here. Florida has not experienced 39 consecutive months of job growth. The correct figure is five. But there is a sliver of truth if you look at the claim through the GOP’s eyes. Florida has seen year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months, which while not what Republicans said, is an equally notable metric. Words matter. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBADF80>],/factchecks/2013/dec/19/republican-party-florida/nod-rick-scott-republican-party-says-florida-had-3/
"['Economy', 'PunditFact', 'Steven Rattner']","
Is it easier to obtain the American Dream in Europe?
","Oh, sweet America, ye land of opportunity, home to the time-tested formula in which hard work + perseverance = success, in spite of family background. Or not. The new reality, as described in a Dec. 16, 2013, discussion on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, is it’s harder than ever for Americans born into low-income families to advance up the economic ladder. Middle-class economic growth is stunted compared to other parts of the developed world, and it’s hard for people to work their way out of poverty, said Steven Rattner, a Morning Joe economic analyst and former Treasury Department official who oversaw the restructuring of the auto industry under President Barack Obama. ""We have fallen way back,"" Rattner said. ""We're behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead. It's a real problem."" Why is that? host Joe Scarborough asked. They talked about the globalization of the job market and increased poverty. Rattner’s statement betrays our classic view of the American Dream. Is his point accurate? Rattner researcher Sundas Hashmi directed us to reports that bolster Rattner’s statement. The takeaway: The American rags-to-riches story is more out of reach than ever, possibly responsible for restricting economic growth. The Great Gatsby Curve We last heard a version of this talking point from the president himself, who spoke at length recently about the dangerous consequences for America if income inequality continues to rise and income mobility decreases. ""In fact, statistics show not only that our levels of income inequality rank near countries like Jamaica and Argentina, but that it is harder today for a child born here in America to improve her station in life than it is for children in most of our wealthy allies, countries like Canada or Germany or France,"" Obama said. ""They have greater mobility than we do, not less."" Alan Krueger, former chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, explained the connection between economic mobility and income as the ""Great Gatsby Curve,"" named after the novel about Prohibition-era upper-class excess by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Families at all earning levels were growing together after World War II but have been growing apart since in the decades since, Krueger wrote. The country’s top earners have pulled a lot further ahead than the middle and lower class, he said, and the trend line suggests the future earnings of today’s children will be tied more and more to the income level of their parents. ""Not since the Roaring 20s has the share of income going to the very top reached such high levels,"" Krueger said, according to prepared remarks. Krueger compared income inequality of 10 developed countries with the correlation between a parent’s income and their children’s (it’s more complicated than we described, check out the details in Krueger’s presentation or this Bloomberg infographic). The ""Gatsby Curve"" showed economic possibilities for children in European countries such as Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and France were much less connected to their parents’ income than in the United States and United Kingdom. Evidence from Pew and others Other research hits similar notes. A 2011 short report by the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project described a joint study by researchers from 10 countries who looked at how children’s mobility is connected to their family’s socioeconomic background. They used parents’ education as a measure because it has strong ties to income and offered cross-country comparisons. Of the 10 countries studied, the United States had the strongest link between parents’ education and a child’s economic, educational and socio-emotional outcomes, the study found, more pronounced than in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Nordic countries, as well as Canada and Australia. ""Americans absolutely confirm they believe America is the land of opportunity and that people should have equal opportunity if they have the skills,"" said Diana Elliott, research officer for the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project, in an interview. ""The data fly in the face of what Americans have believed and what they say they believe in our polling work."" Pew researchers use data from a long-term survey that started tracking 5,000 families in 1968 and follows those parent-child pairs as they form their own households (known as Panel Study of Income Dynamics). Since economic mobility is best measured when people are in their prime working years around age 40, we won’t have a third generation comparison for another decade or two, Elliott said. The United States has a greater degree of ""stickiness,"" in which people at both extremes of the income distribution are likely to stay in the quintile into which they were born, than neighbor Canada, she said, referencing this report. The Brookings Institution and Pew Charitable Trusts teamed up on a 2008 report that analyzed several studies on economic mobility and concluded the following: Cross-country comparisons of relative mobility aren’t always based on perfect data. But the United States is distinct from other countries, research shows, in having ""less, not more, intergenerational mobility than do Canada and several European countries."" Upward mobility is particularly uncommon for children who are born into families at the lowest income bracket. A previous examination of this issue by PolitiFact Ohio mentioned a 2010 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, a Paris-based think tank with 34 member countries, including the United States. The study found Denmark, Australia, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France out-ranked the U.S. in terms of a child’s ability to earn more than his or her parents. Only Italy and Great Britain had stronger links between a person’s earnings and his or her parents than the U.S. of the 12 countries evaluated. Why is this happening?  A 2012 New York Times article that examined five studies about the United States' lagging economic mobility identified the depth of American poverty as one culprit, as the country has a ""thinner safety net"" than other wealthy nations. Other potential reasons the Times reported include the increased likelihood of poor Americans to be raised by single mothers, decreased unionization, high incarceration rates and the country’s historical racial divide. A college education is one way for children born into the lowest income distribution to move up despite their family background, noted a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. But for many born into the poorest bracket, college is out of reach. Just 7 percent of adults whose parents were in the bottom income quintile obtained a college degree. Disagreement, caution and another measure Is it time to ring the alarm? Not yet, say some economists of conservative backgrounds. Among their concerns of the methodology and thrust of some of the research we have described: It is not wise to compare U.S. data with considerably smaller, more homogenous populations in European countries, such as Denmark. The evidence is scant that income inequality is hurting or driving our country’s economic woes. Looking at absolute mobility, or comparing a person’s income to their parents’, reveals a different story than isolating the measure that most of these studies used (that’s relative mobility, or looking at where an adult landed in the income distribution compared to his or her parents). For children born into the lowest quartile, 83 percent made higher family incomes than their parents, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which examined the same long-term family survey that Pew uses. As a whole, 67 percent of U.S. adults out-earned their parents. Thing is, we don’t have solid comparisons for absolute mobility for other countries, said Donald Schneider, a Heritage researcher who addressed his concerns about international comparisons of economic mobility in a whopping 6,700-word piece. We won’t visit each point here (this is getting long enough -- eat a cookie, you deserve it). Basically, he cautioned the data used for some of these studies is not collected in the same way, and cultural differences could account for some of the income gaps. Plus, he wrote, Americans have to make more money to move from the bottom to the top than in countries such as Denmark. But many see that as the problem, said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studied international comparisons of generational income mobility in 2007. More distance means more inequality. ""We have more distance from the top to bottom,"" she said, ""and whether that’s a good or bad thing may depend on your point of view."" Our ruling Steven Rattner said, the United States is ""behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead."" Some conservative economists say the comparisons between countries are imperfect, that we need better data, and Americans are doing just fine if you look at their ability to simply out-earn their parents. We don’t know how that compares to European countries. But many studies back up Rattner’s point. Studies show that we are behind ""many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead."" Nordic countries have particularly higher rates of income mobility than the United States.

"['National', 'Congress', 'Federal Budget', 'Paul Ryan']","
Rep. Paul Ryan said bipartisan budget deal is the first in divided government since 1986
","Lawmakers and pundits heralded the recent agreement on federal spending reached between House Republicans and Senate Democrats as a rare, bipartisan accord between a deeply divided Congress. Some went so far as to suggest that it was historic, including Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican and chief budget negotiator for the GOP. ""This is the first divided-government budget agreement since 1986,"" Ryan told reporters Dec. 10, 2013, when announcing the deal alongside Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. The deal has since passed the House and Senate. We knew that recent Congresses have clashed on federal spending over the years, but was it really almost three decades since two parties came together to cut a deal? Let’s take a trip down memory lane. Budgets 101 First, a brief explainer on the agreement. The legislation Ryan and Murray hammered out averts a government shutdown in January 2014 by funding federal agencies and providing some relief from the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester. The sequester cuts are unpopular among many Democrats and some Republicans because the cuts slash discretionary spending, including defense, in an across-the-board fashion, rather than allowing lawmakers the ability to cut less-crucial programs and save more urgent ones.  The agreement also raises some fees on air travel, requires federal workers to contribute more to their pensions, and decreases retirement benefits for veterans younger than 62. Under the agreement, budget caps for discretionary spending are set at $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. For 2014, that figure is $45 billion more than it would have been under sequestration, and it’s $18 billion more for 2015. Also notable — and often unexplained in media accounts — is that the bill includes language that serves the purpose of a ""budget resolution,"" an annual fiscal blueprint agreed to by both chambers. A budget resolution provides a general outline of spending, taxation and deficit reduction. While passage of a budget resolution is not mandatory, it can be valuable to lawmakers by easing the process of passing spending bills. The president does not sign it. Typically, if a budget resolution is passed, it happens relatively early during a congressional session, and it is passed independently of spending bills. But due to partisan battling, that didn’t happen this year; to rectify this, the spending bill belatedly included language that made it like a budget resolution as well as a spending bill. Divided government vs. divided Congress We contacted Ryan’s staff the day after he made the comment we’re checking, and they offered a key clarification: They said Ryan had meant to say it was ""the last time a budget resolution was adopted while Congress was controlled by opposing parties was 1986."" This is an important distinction. Divided government means that each major party controls one of the following three entities: the presidency, the House of Representatives or the Senate. By contrast, a divided Congress means that one party controls one chamber of Congress and the other controls the other chamber. Both scenarios mean that the levers of power are divided between the parties, but divided government is much more common than a divided Congress in recent history, so whether you use one phrasing or the other leads to a different outcome. We’ll look at both here. We should add that Ryan has used both formulations. On Dec. 12, for instance, ABC quoted him saying: ""This is the first time, with a divided Congress, that we’ve had a budget agreement since 1986, when both houses were controlled by the other parties."" The following chart outlines control of each chamber of Congress and the presidency since 1986.   Congress             Year House control Senate control President control 99th 1985-87 Democratic             Republican             Republican             100th 1987-89 Democratic             Democratic             Republican             101st 1989-91 Democratic             Democratic             Republican             102nd 1991-93 Democratic             Democratic             Republican             103rd 1993-95 Democratic             Democratic             Democratic             104th 1995-97 Republican             Republican             Democratic             105th 1997-99 Republican             Republican             Democratic             106th 1999-2001 Republican             Republican             Democratic             107th 2001-03 Republican             Republican/ Democratic Republican             108th 2003-05 Republican             Republican             Republican             109th 2005-07 Republican             Republican             Republican             110th 2007-09 Democratic             Democratic             Republican             111th 2009-11 Democratic             Democratic             Democratic             112th 2011-13 Republican             Democratic             Democratic             113th 2013-15 Republican Democratic   Democratic   As the chart shows, the usual state of affairs has been for the same party to control both chambers of Congress. Since 1986, the only exceptions are the two annual sessions of the 112th Congress, the first session of the 113th, and the second session of the 107th Congress, when a mid-session party switch tipped the Senate from Republican to Democratic control at a time when the House was in GOP hands. (That change occurred on May 24, 2001, which was after the Senate agreed to a budget resolution for the first session.) Here’s a cross-tabulation of party control in Congress with the passage of a budget from 1986 to 2013.   Party control Passed budget Failed to pass budget Unified Congress and president 6 3 President of one party, Congress unified under other party 13 1 Divided Congress 2 3   So, if you analyze Ryan’s words literally, he’s wrong: There are actually 15 instances since 1986 in which ""divided government"" produced a budget agreement, 13 with a unified Congress in opposition to the president and two with a divided Congress. On the other hand, if you cut him some slack and rate his claim based on the term ""divided Congress,"" he’s right -- but it’s also not all that enlightening, since there have been just four annual sessions of Congress that have occurred under divided control during the past 28 years. In 2002, with the House controlled by Republicans and the Senate run by Democrats for most of the year, no budget resolution was agreed to. The Republican House and Democratic Senate also failed to reach an accord in 2011 and 2012. Roy Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County and a former analyst at the Congressional Budget Office, agreed that Ryan’s point is correct but doesn’t mean much. He added that the wider understanding of the term ""divided government"" is a split in control between Congress and the White House -- something that doesn’t matter in evaluating budget resolutions, since they only need Congress’ approval, not the president’s. Meyers also emphasized that just because one party controls both chambers of Congress doesn’t guarantee a budget resolution will be passed. Republicans controlled Congress in 1998, 2004 and 2006 but didn’t pass a budget. Democrats also failed in 2010 despite running the House and Senate. Patrick Griffin, an American University government professor who worked in legislative affairs for President Bill Clinton, added that the final spending bills are more important than the budget resolution, anyway. Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton, he said, all had budget battles with the opposing party controlling Congress, and this made the final pact more powerful once the White House gave its blessing. ""For (a budget resolution) to have consequence, it has to involve all the institutions,"" Griffin said. Our ruling At the initial news conference, Ryan said the current deal ""is the first divided-government budget agreement since 1986."" He later clarified his statement to note it’s actually the first one ""with a divided Congress"" since 1986. The first claim is wrong -- there are actually more than a dozen instances since 1986 in which ""divided government"" produced a budget agreement. And while the second version of Ryan's claim is right, it's not very significant, since Congress has been under divided-party control for just four years out of the past 28. On balance, we rate Ryan’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBD3080>],/factchecks/2013/dec/19/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-said-bipartisan-budget-deal-first-di/

RNC offered wrong poll figure for Obama support
","A reader recently asked us to check into a series of Facebook posts by the Republican National Committee themed to the ""Twelve Days of Christmas."" In the RNC’s version, the 12 days refer to aspects of President Barack Obama’s health care law that, according to Republicans, are having negative repercussions on the economy and health care system. One of those posts claimed that ""the latest Quinnipiac poll found that nearly six-in-ten Americans oppose ObamaCare -- 30% support the law and 57% oppose it."" It received nearly 4,000 ""likes"" -- but as it turns out, one of the percentages cited in the post was wrong. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, released on Dec. 11, 2013, respondents were asked, ""Do you support or oppose the health care law passed by Barack Obama and Congress in 2010?"" The poll results showed 57 percent opposition to the law, which was what the RNC had correctly cited. But the actual level of support in the poll was 39 percent -- not the 30 percent listed in the Facebook post. The error cut the amount of support by about one-quarter -- not a trivial amount. As it turned out, the error was simply a typo; the supporting material cited in the RNC’s Facebook post had the correct number -- 39 percent. When we brought this to the RNC’s attention, spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski wrote back, ""Yes, this was a typo and we are fixing it right now."" True to her word, the Facebook post was corrected within an hour or so. (We’ve posted a before-and-after look at right.)

Texas has highest uninsured rate and most uninsured children in country
","As a congressional committee prepared for a North Texas hearing about Obamacare ""navigators,"" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius rose to their defense. Texas particularly needs them to educate and enroll others in the online health insurance marketplaces created by the law, she said. ""Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. ... And there are more uninsured children in Texas than in any other state,"" Sebelius wrote in a Dec. 15, 2013, opinion column in the Dallas Morning News. In the piece, which later appeared in the Dec. 18, 2013, Austin American-Statesman, Sebelius said Texas could have helped many immediately by accepting the Affordable Care Act’s offer of federal dollars to help pay for expanding Medicaid. We recently rated as True a claim from President Barack Obama that a million Texans could get insurance right away if the state agreed to the expansion. Critics have noted how few Texans have health insurance for decades, though in March 2013, PolitiFact Texas rated as False a claim by state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, that Texas had the most uninsured residents of any state at 6 million. In fact, California had about 1 million more uninsured residents in 2011. Then again, California’s population then exceeded Texas’ by some 12 million. Rate of uninsured residents When you look at the percentage of uninsured residents instead of the raw numbers, Texas has the highest, as Sebelius said. Drawing on U.S. Census Bureau research, the Kaiser Family Foundation said 24 percent of Texas residents in 2012 had no health insurance, followed by Nevada (23 percent) and Florida (21 percent.) Nationwide, the uninsured rate was 15 percent. A September 2013 analysis by the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education, said Texas in 2012 had the highest rate of nonelderly uninsured: 26.9 percent. Uninsured children Census spokesman Robert Bernstein guided us by phone through 2012 American Community Survey data on uninsured children, helping us produce a table that showed Nevada ranked first in percentage uninsured, followed by a grouping of states with statistically similar percentages: Alaska, Arizona, Texas and Montana. So in 2012, Texas was tied for second among states with the highest share of uninsured children. But Sebelius cited the raw number of uninsured children, not rate. As above, in raw numbers one might expect the most-populous states to have high totals. But despite having fewer residents than California, Texas had more uninsured children in 2012. Spokeswoman Emma Sandoe at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, part of the federal Health and Human Services Department, guided us to the 2012 Census estimates of uninsured children by state. Texas ranked first, with 1.1 million uninsured children, followed by California with 891,000; Florida with 528,000; and Georgia with 321,000. Our ruling Sebelius said, ""Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. ... And there are more uninsured children in Texas than in any other state."" Texas has the highest rate of uninsured residents overall, about a quarter of its population, and has the most uninsured children (though not the highest rate of uninsured children).

"['Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'PunditFact', 'Peter Orszag']","
Peter Orszag says Medicare spending has actually fallen in absolute terms over the past year
","There’s broad agreement that one of the biggest challenges for the nation’s future fiscal health is rising federal spending on Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans age 65 and older. That’s why a recent claim that the costs are slowing down caught our attention. On the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of CNN's State of the Union, Peter Orszag said, ""Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year."" Orszag is the former director of the Office of Management and Budget for President Barack Obama. We wondered whether this was correct. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan budget-analysis arm -- projected that the cost of Medicare would rise (from 3 percent of gross domestic product today to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2038) due in large part to the aging of the baby-boom generation. So Orszag’s claim that Medicare costs are slowing down is notable and surprising. Initially, we had trouble finding monthly data for Medicare expenditures, but when we contacted Orszag, he pointed us to a CBO document, the ""Monthly Budget Review for November 2013."" (Orszag knows his CBO documents -- before taking the reins of OMB, he was CBO’s director.) In the document Orszag cited, CBO reported that, according to preliminary data, outlays for Medicare fell from $101 billion in October-November 2012 to $96 billion in October-November 2013. And the year-on-year decline was actually a little bit bigger once CBO smoothed out some calendar oddities. This fits the bill for what Orszag claimed -- a year-over-year decline in ""nominal"" Medicare costs. In fact, Orszag told PolitiFact, this decline is ""all the more remarkable because the number of beneficiaries is rising."" In the meantime, while an absolute decline in Medicare expenditures is especially notable, there is evidence that something less dramatic, but still noteworthy, has been underway for even longer -- a slowing of the growth of Medicare costs. That is, Medicare expenditures have recently been rising, but at a slower rate than in the past. This isn’t as favorable for getting the federal budget into balance as an absolute decline would be, but it’s still an important step in that direction. This trend is documented in an August 2013 CBO working paper, written by a pair of present or former CBO health care analysts, Michael Levine and Melinda Buntin. They concluded that the growth in spending per beneficiary in Medicare’s fee-for-service program ""has slowed substantially in recent years,"" specifically from 2000 to 2010. The authors said the slowdown ""has been widespread, extending across all of the major service categories, groups of beneficiaries that receive very different amounts of medical care, and all major regions."" That said, the authors noted that their understanding of why this expenditure slowdown occurred ""remains incomplete."" And that is a problem that limits the usefulness of the data points Orszag offered on CNN. For starters, past performance does not equal future performance, noted Joseph Antos, a health care specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The pattern Orszag cites ""does not mean a slower trend will last,"" Antos said. And while Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said she sees the recent data as a positive development, she added wistfully, ""If only anyone knew why and whether it will last."" Orszag doesn’t dispute their words of caution. ""I agree it's unclear how long it will last, but I am more hopeful than some others,"" he said, arguing that the decline in expenditures is ""consistent with major structural changes in the sector that I see happening every day. ... The bottom line is that it's not guaranteed to continue, but it's a huge deal if it does."" Our ruling Orszag said, ""Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year."" He’s right about the nominal decline in total Medicare expenditures over the past year, and he’s right that per-beneficiary spending declined broadly between 2000 and 2010. Determining the reasons why it’s happening remains a work in progress, but that doesn’t detract from the statement’s factual accuracy. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD64D00>],/factchecks/2013/dec/18/peter-orszag/peter-orszag-says-medicare-spending-has-actually-f/

Marco Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family, Charlie Crist says
","Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat and a 2014 candidate for governor, wrote an op-ed thanking U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a one-time Senate race opponent of his. Sound nice? It isn’t. It’s a thinly veiled dig at Rubio. ""Senator Marco Rubio’s endorsement of Obamacare for his own family should end the rhetoric coming from Governor Rick Scott and other tea party groups,"" Crist wrote, adding, ""The rollout of the Affordable Health Care Act has clearly been flawed, but that doesn’t mean that our work towards affordable health care should end. It should continue."" We wanted to sort through the rhetoric and clarify Rubio’s stance on President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. First things first: Rubio did purchase insurance for his family on the Washington marketplace. Rubio and others are signing up for insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces to comply with the law’s individual mandate. Federal lawmakers will stop getting government-provided coverage. Instead, they’ll purchase insurance alongside small businesses and the uninsured. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced that rule in an amendment to the law so that legislators would see firsthand what average Americans would experience on the marketplaces. Federal legislators make up the only group of people to get kicked off employer-provided insurance. When they sign up on the marketplaces, they’ll get a subsidy that covers up to 75 percent of their premium costs. That subsidy they get is similar to the deal many Americans get through employer-provided benefits. Some of Rubio’s fellow Republicans have refused the federal subsidy, or refused insurance on the marketplaces altogether in favor of choosing a policy directly through a private insurer. Crist is highlighting that Rubio didn’t do the same. But does taking the subsidy mean Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family? Crist’s spokesman offered us one Merriam-Webster definition of ""endorse"" to support his point: ""to publicly say that you like or use (a product or service) in exchange for money."" But there’s another definition that applies here, one that’s at least equally common: ""to publicly or officially say that you support or approve of (someone or something)."" Rubio is publicly saying he’s using a product, but it’s not quite right to say it’s in exchange for money. The money is awarded to any U.S. legislator who buys insurance on the exchanges, whether or not they make that decision public. He’s getting the money because that’s what the law stipulates, not because he’s promoting Obamacare. And that second definition of ""endorse"" rings false. Rubio has been vocal in his criticism of Obamacare, as Crist’s column itself acknowledges. ""Senator Rubio is following the law, even though he opposes it,"" said Brooke Sammon, Rubio’s spokeswoman, after the senator enrolled in Obamacare. Rubio has even called the individual mandate a ""disaster,"" and pushed for getting the entire law repealed and replaced. In response to Crist’s column, Rubio said Monday, ""I don’t endorse Obamacare. I much rather would have a vibrant private market where individuals like myself and others can buy health insurance from any company that will sell it to us."" It is worth repeating the Miami Herald’s observation, though, that when Rubio served as Florida House speaker while Crist was governor, Rubio pushed to open an exchange that would help small businesses offer insurance. So he’s supported that sort of concept before, even if he emphatically doesn’t support something similar on the federal level. Our ruling Crist said Rubio endorsed Obamacare for his family. He did sign up for insurance on the Washington marketplace, but we think calling that an endorsement is too strong. Rubio certainly doesn’t support Obamacare, and has pushed for its repeal. He’s signed up through the marketplace simply to abide by the law. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB872540>],/factchecks/2013/dec/18/charlie-crist/marco-rubio-endorsed-obamacare-his-family-charlie-/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Chris Matthews']","
Matthews: Every dollar in Obamacare goes to private insurance companies
","Like most MSNBC hosts, Chris Matthews has been using his show Hardball recently to both defend the health care law and criticize Republicans who attack it. On Dec. 16, 2013, Matthews played a video clip of former Pennsylvania senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum speaking at a young Republicans event. In the video Santorum refers to the health care law as ""free health care"" and says it would deny care to anyone who needed it. ""It’s a pretty clever system,"" he said. ""Take care of the people who can vote. The people who can’t vote, get rid of them as quickly as possible by not giving them care, (they die) so they can’t vote against you."" Santorum also compared the Affordable Care Act to the United Kingdom's government-owned health care system. Matthews, in response, was keen to note that’s completely unlike what exists in America. ""Every dollar spent in the new Obamacare system -- if you want to call it Obamacare -- goes to insurance companies,"" Matthews said. ""All the money goes to private-sector insurance companies that already exist."" We decided to check Matthews' retort that ""Every dollar spent in the new Obamacare system ... goes to private-sector insurance companies."" We reached out to MSNBC but did not hear back. The part of the Affordable Care Act that matches Matthews’ description is the insurance marketplaces run by the federal government and by individual states. These are the places where private insurance companies can sell their plans. People of any income can purchase insurance through one of these marketplaces and if they don’t make too much, they are eligible for subsidies to make their premiums more affordable. But what Matthews overlooked is the very large role that expanded Medicaid plays in Obamacare. The Affordable Care Act allows states to open that health care program to people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. So far, only 25 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to do that. But in terms of the number of dollars and people, this side of the Affordable Care Act is roughly equal to the insurance marketplaces Matthews described. A few numbers The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number crunchers for Congress, projected that in 2014, the subsidies provided through the marketplaces would cost the government about $26 billion. The matching figure for Medicaid expansion? $21 billion. Looking at how many people will gain coverage in 2014, the budget office expects 6 million people will take advantage of subsidized policies through the marketplaces. The expansion of Medicaid, including the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, would add 9 million people, CBO says. (The Medicaid numbers are likely to be lower since states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion.) Health economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California-San Diego told PunditFact that looking forward, Medicaid expansion accounts for about 39 percent of the cost in the Affordable Care Act to get more people covered. Clemens and Thomas Getzen, professor at Temple University’s Fox School of Business and Management and executive director of the International Association of Health Economics, both said that regardless of who gets paid first, money in Obamacare continues to move through the health care industry. Some of it ends up with insurance companies, some of it ends up with doctors and other providers. Medicaid is a government-run program that pays doctors and hospitals for their services. So, those dollars also go back to the private sector, but they don’t pass through the hands of private insurance companies first. Our ruling Mathews said every dollar in the ""new Obamacare system"" goes to insurance companies. The use of ""every"" gets Matthews in trouble here. About half of the Affordable Care Act flows through marketplaces where private insurance companies sell policies. But the other half runs through the government’s Medicaid program. That expansion costs about the same as the subsidies offered through the marketplaces and at least in the near term, touches even more people. Matthews was drawing a contrast with government-owned health care systems and focused on the part of the Affordable Care Act that has dominated the news. But when he said ""every dollar,"" he went too far. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC636280>],/factchecks/2013/dec/18/chris-matthews/matthews-every-dollar-obamacare-goes-private-insur/

Did Rick Scott back the federal government shutdown?
","Gov. Rick Scott had a ""terrible 2013,"" says the Florida Democratic Party in a year-end video bashing the Republican leader who faces voters next year. The Democrats unveiled a long list of attacks, most of which were recycled from earlier attacks or news articles. But this one in particular caught our eye: ""This fall Scott even backed the federal shutdown that cost Floridians millions each day and pushed America to the brink of default."" We wanted to check if Scott, the self-described jobs governor, backed the October shutdown that furloughed hundreds of thousands of employees. Some House Republicans had hoped to use a shutdown to delay or defund the federal health care law, but that didn’t happen. What Scott said Scott didn’t get a vote on the federal shutdown so the only way to judge whether he ""backed"" it is by reading his words. We reviewed statements Scott made in news releases and to the media about the shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and ended Oct. 16. We found that Scott repeatedly bashed Obama and praised the way that Florida had handled its own finances, but he avoided taking a stance in favor or against the shutdown. On Sept. 30 Scott issued a news release that stated: ""The impending federal government shutdown represents a failure of leadership. One of the most basic functions of governing is budgeting. At the state level, we compromise and negotiate to create a balanced budget every year. But, President Obama has shown no interest in negotiating or compromising. We have paid down state debt in Florida by $3.5 billion and paid back another $3.5 billion federal loan over the last two and a half years while also cutting taxes."" (We should note that state debt is a very different animal than federal debt, and states are prohibited from running annual budget deficits.) In addition to that news release, a Scott spokeswoman sent us a few tweets by Scott (""The buck stops with the President. We need leadership now,"" and ""@BarackObama and Congress should not take pay for every day of shutdown""). But none of those tweets shed much light on whether he thought shutting down the government was a good idea or not. During a news conference Oct. 9, Scott refused to answer questions about whether he agreed with Republicans in Washington who tied the budget to delaying or defunding Obamacare: ""What I agree with is the fact that the buck stops with the president,"" Scott said. ""It's disappointing he doesn't know how to compromise and negotiate to get a budget done. I've done it for three sessions...."" The next day, Scott’s chief of staff announced that Florida would not use state funds to temporarily backfill federal programs. At the time, there was mounting criticism that the shutdown which closed federal parks was a blow to the fishing and tourism industry in the Keys. On Oct. 16, Obama signed a bill that ended the shutdown. Scott criticized the fact that it wasn't a long-term agreement on debt and said that ""our nation’s leaders have their heads in the sand about our economic future."" A spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party pointed to two blog posts -- from the Tampa Bay Times and the Florida Times-Union -- that stated Scott’s position on the shutdown aligned him with congressional Republicans and pointed to Scott’s repeated criticism of Obama. While it’s true that Scott did put blame on Obama, a review of Scott’s actual statements shows that he appeared to dodge the question of whether he supported or opposed the shutdown as a political tactic. Instead, Scott used the shutdown as a chance to criticize Obama and call for reducing federal spending and debt. One final note: The Florida Democratic Party also said the shutdown would ""cost Floridians millions each day."" Financial analysts at Moody’s estimated the shutdown cost the economy about $20 billion in direct and indirect effects, or roughly $4 per day for every man, woman and child in America. Based on Florida’s population of about 19 million, that translates to about $77 million per day in Florida. ""It’s fair to say that the shutdown cost Floridians as economic agents and as taxpayers millions per day,"" Moody’s economist Brian Kessler said. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said that Scott ""backed the federal shutdown."" Scott used the October shutdown as an opportunity to tout the state’s fiscal management and wag his finger at Obama. But a review of Scott’s statements about the shutdown shows that he dodged taking a clear stand favoring or opposing the shutdown itself.

Abbott defended school funding system and legislated aid cuts in keeping with his legal duties as attorney general
","When Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott visited a Dallas-area school district, the leading Democratic aspirant cried foul. ""As Greg Abbott visits a Plano ISD school today it’s unlikely that he will apologize to students for defending school budget cuts and fighting against their school district in court,"" state Sen. Wendy Davis said in a Dec. 3, 2013, post on her campaign website. ""Greg Abbott’s actions speak louder than his words. While I fought against over $5 billion in unconstitutional budget cuts to our public schools,"" Davis said, Abbott ""wasted taxpayer funds to defend those cuts in court."" Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, helped force a special legislative session in 2011 by filibustering, and temporarily delaying, a decision by the revenue-strapped Republican-majority Legislature to reduce education funding by more than $5 billion through 2012-13. And did Abbott, the state’s attorney general, defend the cuts in court? That’s been acknowledged. Abbott was quoted during his Dec. 3, 2013, Plano visit as telling the Dallas Morning News the reason he’s defending the cuts is because the Legislature  passed them and it’s his job to defend them. ""The attorney general in Texas takes an oath of office to defend the laws passed by the legislature,"" Abbott said, according to the News. ""I’m fulfilling that duty."" That news story came to our attention in an email from Davis’ campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña, who responded to our request for the basis of Davis’ statement with a document listing web links to additional news stories as well as legal filings by Abbott’s office in defending the school funding system in the latest round of litigation likely headed to the Texas Supreme Court. In February 2013, a Travis County state district judge, John Dietz, ruled the system unconstitutional, though he later reacted to legislative actions restoring $3.4 billion in spending cuts and easing mandated high-school tests by scheduling fresh hearings for early 2014, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news story posted online June 19, 2013. A vital issue in the original trial, the Statesman said in a news story posted online Oct. 20, 2012, was the charge by two-thirds of the state’s school districts accounting for three-quarters of Texas students that the state was failing to ensure that districts had adequate resources to bring students up to what lawmakers handed down in tougher academic expectations. Texas districts have litigated how the state funds the schools for decades. Each time, expert lawyers told us, the state attorney general has defended the existing law just as Abbott has in the latest legal battle, which is expected to resume in early 2014. That’s in keeping with the duties of the attorney general as specified in the Texas Constitution, which says the attorney general ""shall represent the state in all suits and pleas in the Supreme Court of the state in which the state may be a party."" Lawyers representing groups of districts in the latest lawsuits each said it would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a state law and related legislative decisions. Buck Wood of Austin, who has long represented property-poor districts in school finance suits, said deputies to Abbott ""vigorously defended"" the law during the latest trial before Dietz. Austin lawyer Rick Gray, representing some 400 districts in the latest litigation, said he could not recall any attorney general backing down from defending the school finance system through the decades of court battles. David Thompson of Houston, who represents districts (including the Austin one) serving more than 1.8 million children, stressed that Abbott’s office has defended the constitutionality of the funding system and the legislated cuts, not necessarily speaking to whether the spending reductions were good policy. ""The attorney general’s office is actively and I would say vigorously defending the state’s actions,"" Thompson said. ""That would include specifically the cuts to funding as well as just the overall design and structure of the (funding) system."" The lawyers each added that while it’s an attorney general’s duty to defend the state and actions taken on behalf of the state, he or she also has discretion to settle cases. Our search of news stories and Abbott-issued press releases yielded no sign of Abbott personally appearing in the courtroom during the latest school funding trial. At our request, Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, reviewed her notes from the trial. By telephone, Clark said she found no instances of state attorneys defending the 2011 cuts in education aid except to elicit testimony that the reductions were less dramatic than other state budget cuts that year. ""I don’t see them standing up there and saying, gosh, we needed to"" make those cuts, Clark said. ""But they did admit there were cuts."" We asked a spokeswoman for the attorney general, Lauren Bean, if Davis is correct that Abbott has defended the 2011 cuts in the school funding lawsuits. By email, Bean said yes, Abbott’s ""office defended the law in court."" In a follow-up email, she listed court rulings specifying the attorney general has an exclusive role in representing state agencies. Our ruling Davis said Abbott defended more than $5 billion in cuts in public school funding in fighting hundreds of school districts in court. That’s factually correct as far as it goes, but this claim is missing important details and context in that the state attorney general has a legal duty to represent the state in challenges reaching the Texas Supreme Court, which the latest school finance lawsuits are expected to do. It would be unusual for an attorney general not to defend a law and legislative actions in such a suit. We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Bloggers claim photo shows millions at ""tea party"" protest
","
In the competitive world of Washington protests, crowd size is often a matter of dispute. Organizers usually boast of huge crowds, while police and the news media offer much smaller estimates.
 
So supporters of Saturday’s “tea party” protests against President Barack Obama were quick to highlight their big turnout. To bolster countless claims on blogs and Facebook, many posted a photograph that showed a gargantuan crowd sprawling from Capitol Hill down the National Mall to the Washington Monument.
 
But it turns out the photo is more than 10 years old, apparently taken during a 1997 Promise Keepers rally.
 
On Saturday, estimates about the crowd spread quickly through the conservative blogosphere. Many writers, including author Michelle Malkin, pegged the number of people between 1 million and 2 million. Those reports were largely based on information from people in the crowd.
 
Malkin, for example, updated her blog at 12:34 p.m. noting that, “Police estimate 1.2 million in attendance. ABC News reporting crowd at 2 million,” and she cited a Twitter post from Tabitha Hale, writer of Pink Elephant Pundit, who was in Washington for the protest.
 
Many bloggers said the media was unfairly reporting much smaller numbers, and many included the photo.
 
“I have no doubt that Washington Democrats are well aware of how many people turned out, even as their media outlets try to downplay the event,” said Power Line, a conservative blog that linked to the photograph from

Say Anything

, another conservative Web site.
 
“ 'Media’ estimates range from 60,000 to 500,000 to around 2 million (yes, 2,000,000),” wrote John G. Winder for the conservative blog Cypress Times. “Those estimates, the language employed, and the visuals chosen for use in reporting the rally and representing the people gathered, vary greatly based solely on bias.”
 
In the mainstream media, crowd estimates varied.
 
The New York Times reported that “thousands” of protesters “filled the west lawn of the Capitol and spilled onto the National Mall,” while Fox News wrote that “tens of thousands” marched on Washington. CNN said “reporters at the scene described the massive crowd as reaching the tens of thousands.”
 
Pete Piringer, public affairs officer for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Department, said the local government no longer provides official crowd estimates because they can become politicized. But the day of the rally, Piringer unofficially told one reporter that he thought between 60,000 and 75,000 people had shown up.
 
“It was in no way an official estimate,” he said.
 
We asked Piringer whether there were enough protesters to fill the National Mall, as depicted in the photograph.
 
“It was an impressive crowd,” he said. But after marching down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, the crowd “only filled the Capitol grounds, maybe up to Third Street,” he said.
 
Yet the photograph so widely posted showed the crowd sprawling all the way to the Washington Monument, which is bordered by 15th and and 17th Streets.
 
There’s another problem with the photograph: It doesn’t include the National Museum of the American Indian, a building located at the corner of Fourth Street and Independence Avenue that opened on Sept. 14, 2004. (Looking at the photograph, the building should be in the upper right hand corner of the National Mall, next to the Air and Space Museum.) That means the picture was taken before the museum opened exactly five years ago. So clearly the photo doesn’t show the “tea party” crowd from the Sept. 12 protest.
 
Also worth noting are the cranes in front of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. According to Randall Kremer, the museum’s director of public affairs, “The last time cranes were in front was in the 1990s when the IMAX theater was being built.”
 
It appears that the photo was actually taken in 1997 at a rally for Promise Keepers, a group for Christian men. According to the group’s Web site, nearly 1 million people attended the event. Photos of the Oct. 4, 1997, event that were posted on various Web sites in 2003, 2008 and earlier this year show either the same picture or a similar photo that has identical tents and what appear to be TV screens in the same locations.
 
Conservative bloggers who originally posted the picture have backed down.
 
Malkin, like some of her conservative cohorts, retracted the number she had attributed to ABC when the network chastised FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, whose organization arranged the event, for inaccurately telling the crowd that the news organization had reported the crowd at 1 million to 1.5 million people.
 
Malkin linked to the ABC story on her site, and changed her blog post headline to “Celebrating the 9/12 rallies; Turnout estimated at 2 million; Update: How many?; FreedomWorks in error.”
 
Say Anything updated its original post to say that the picture was “of the wrong rally.” An accurate photo “clearly shows that (the rally) didn’t take place on the mall nearly as extensively as the image I mistakenly posted does.” Power Line took the picture down all together.
 
But because mistakes can still live forever on the Internet and many people who saw the photo on Facebook were unaware it was found to be the wrong picture, we decided to still rate it on the Truth-O-Meter. And Pants on Fire it is.
 
UPDATED: We updated this item to include new details about the Promise Keepers photos.

Boustany and other Republicans say health care plan would create 53 new government bureaucracies
","
In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's address on health care before a joint session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., a heart surgeon by profession, repeated a popular Republican talking point, saying the health care reform bill introduced in the House would  ""create 53 new government bureaucracies.""
 
This claim originates with a detailed list complied by the House Republican Conference, which you can view

here

.
 
Fifty-three new bureaucracies sounds like a lot, and the list is so specific, we decided to dig into it to see if it's legitimate.
 
""Bureaucracy"" can mean different things to different people, so we began with a trip to the Merriam-Webster dictionary to set some parameters. It defines it like this: ""a body of nonelective government officials; an administrative policy-making group; government characterized by specialization of functions, adherence to fixed rules, and a hierarchy of authority; a system of administration marked by officialism, red tape, and proliferation.""
 
So, to the list...
 
The first two are no-doubt-abouters. No. 1 is a Health Benefits Advisory Committee (Section 123, p. 30). This is a new panel of experts that will make recommendations to the secretary of Health and Human Services on covered health benefits. It's an advisory board, but a new entity nonetheless. New bureaucracy, check.
 
No. 2 on the list is the creation of a Health Choices Administration (Section 141, p. 41). This is a biggie. The Health Choices Administration would be an independent executive branch agency charged with establishing qualified plan standards, creating the health insurance exchange and administering affordability credits for low-income people. New bureaucracy, check.
 
After this, however, the list gets murkier.
 
Consider No. 3, Qualified Health Benefits Plan Ombudsman. This person, or office, would be charged with helping people navigate the new health reform system and report to Congress on recommendations for improvements in administration of the program. It's part of the Health Choices Administration (No. 2 on the list). That sounds like double-counting to us. And that's true of a number of other items on the list as well.
 
We're not going to detail all 53 items on the list. But here are a few general observations from our examination of them. Four of the items on the list include the creation of various trust funds. These are new funds, but they are to be created by existing agencies. These are essentially bank accounts. Those aren't new government bureaucracies in our book.
 
The list also includes six pilot programs and three demonstration programs. These are small-scale demo programs. If the programs turn out to improve care and save money, the government will roll them out nationally. There's already an office in place in Medicare that runs demonstration programs.
 
In fact, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2003 included 14 new demonstration projects. It wouldn't be fair to call that 14 new bureaucracies then, and it's not fair to call these demonstration programs new bureaucracies now.
 
""The programs and demonstration projects they list aren't new agencies but rather new projects, and they're sensible ways to test new policies before more broadly implementing them,"" said Brian Cook, press secretary for Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. And, he said, ""many of the programs and demonstration projects are things that Republicans themselves have called for and supported.""
 
The list also includes three new ombudsmen and a special inspector general for the Health Insurance Exchange.
 
And again, these are individual offices in existing agencies — not bureaucracies.
 
Three items on the list deal with comparative effectiveness research. Although the government already does such research, we think it's fair to count the creation of a new Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research on the list. But the next two items, a comparative effectiveness research commission and a patient ombudsman for comparative effectiveness research seems like triple-dipping.
 
Ironically, said Stan Dorn, senior research associate at the left-leaning Urban Institute, those safeguards were put in to assure Republicans that the program would not be used to force insurers to comply with the council's research findings.
 
""Some of these things are new government bureaucracies,"" Dorn said. ""But a lot of these items are not new government agencies, they are new activities that existing agencies would be asked to perform.""
 
By Dorn's count, 36 of the 53 items on the Republican list fall in that latter category.
 
An example is an item on the list for a program of administrative simplification (Section 163, p. 57). It would be up to the department of Health and Human Services to implement the updated standards.
 
""That is not a new bureaucracy,"" Dorn said. ""That's an activity required of an existing government agency.""
 
""Just eyeballing this list,"" Dorn said, ""it is clearly way over the top.""
 
We agree that there are lots of suspect items on the list and the Republicans' methodology in choosing them is inconsistent. But we also think it's fair for them to claim that the Democratic health plan would create new government bureaucracy. The plan would create new ways to subsidize health insurance for millions of low-income people. It would establish a health insurance exchange in which people not on plans provided by large companies could shop for competitive rates. That requires the creation of some new institutions.
 
But they are wrong to cite 53 as the number. In fact, the number is clearly much smaller. So we find the claim Barely True.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'John Boehner']","
Boehner says abortion access was always a key goal for Obama health plan
","
To build opposition to the health care bill, Republicans have been saying it would expand coverage of abortion. To back up that claim, House Republican Leader John Boehner sent a ""GOP Leader Alert"" that said President Barack Obama was doing that to fulfill a campaign promise.


""During his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president,"" Boehner wrote in the Sept. 10, 2009, message.


There's never been any question that Obama favors abortion rights. On Jan. 22, 2008, for instance, Obama released a statement on the 35th anniversary of the

Roe vs. Wade

decision that legalized abortion that said, ""Throughout my career, I've been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice, and have consistently had a 100 percent prochoice rating with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America."" But he has been somewhat more coy, or perhaps strategically fuzzy, about exactly where he would draw the line on federal funding for abortion in his own health care plan. His comments on abortion rights have often used the phrase ""reproductive care"" rather than abortion.


We'll take a separate look at the three parts of Boehner's sentence. Did candidate Obama say that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care? Did he say that such issues are at the heart of his health care reform plan? And did his definition of ""reproductive health"" care include abortion?


On the first and second questions, we think then-candidate Obama did say something that closely matches what Boehner says he did.


In a July 17, 2007, appearance before the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Obama said the following: ""In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we’re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don’t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we’re putting more money into preventive care."" (This one is not included in our

Obameter

database of promises, but we'll examine next week whether it should be.)


The words Obama used are slightly different from the ones cited by Boehner, but we think that to say reproductive care is ""essential"" means that ""everyone deserves"" to have it. Meanwhile, inferring from Obama's language that it's a ""right"" requires a slight leap, but it's close enough that we won't quibble.


So the key to whether Boehner is right comes with the third question: Does Obama's definition of ""reproductive health care"" necessarily include abortion? On this question, the evidence is suggestive but not quite a slam dunk.


Abortion opponents rely on a few pieces of evidence to support the assertion that Obama believes reproductive health care includes abortion. One is a story that ran in the

Chicago Tribune

on July 18, 2007, the day after Obama's Planned Parenthood speech. In it, Washington bureau reporter Mike Dorning wrote that when Obama was asked about his proposal for expanded access to health insurance, the candidate ""said it would cover 'reproductive health services.' Contacted afterward, an Obama spokesman said that included abortions.""


Another source is a candidate questionnaire by RH Reality Check, which describes itself as ""an online community and publication serving individuals and organizations committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights."" Posted Dec. 21, 2007, the questionnaire was filled out by ""Sen. Barack Obama's campaign staff.""


The question that's most relevant to Boehner's assertion is this one:


Q: Does Sen. Obama support the Hyde amendment (which bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortions)? Under what circumstances does he believe that Medicaid should cover abortions (all pregnancies, life- or health-threatening pregnancies, pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest, extreme fetal malformation)?


A: Obama does not support the Hyde amendment. He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor woman's decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors.


Both of these comments suggest, fairly strongly, that Obama would include access to abortion in his health care plan — but they leave a degree of doubt. While we are not aware of any pushback from the campaign once these two items were published, both statements were made by campaign staffers, not the candidate himself.


On his campaign Web site, Obama did not specifically address the federal funding issue. In the ""women's issues"" section, the campaign said only that ""Barack Obama understands that abortion is a divisive issue, and respects those who disagree with him. However, he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving women's rights under

Roe vs. Wade

a priority as president. He opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in that case.""


Asked for any additional evidence to back up Boehner's assertion that Obama was referring specifically to abortion, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee, told PolitiFact that Obama was speaking in ""terms of art"" that his Planned Parenthood audience would immediately grasp.


""'Reproductive health services' is one of those conventions that all of the players understand. It is not limited to abortion, but it always encompasses abortion. It is like when a prolife candidate says, 'I support strong legal protection for the right to life of unborn children.' Everyone on all sides understands that this means he thinks abortion generally should not be legal, and no doubt he also supports fetal homicide laws . . . I suppose someone could argue that since he didn't specifically mention abortion, there is the theoretical possibility that he wants to keep abortion completely unrestricted and only wants to pass fetal homicide laws. But that would be to ignore the lexicon that groups develop on these issues and the way they are understood in context.""


So back to Boehner's claim. He said that candidate Obama ""declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president."" The record shows that Obama did indeed make those statements. His message to the abortion rights group may have been deliberately fuzzy, but it's clear what he meant — and it was confirmed by the campaign to the

Tribune

reporter. We find Boehner's claim to be True.

'$64,000 question' e-mail says Congress is exempt from health reform. They're not.
","
A chain e-mail claims that Congress has exempted itself from health care reform.
 
The e-mail appears to have been created shortly after President Barack Obama appeared in a forum on health care with Charlie Gibson of ABC News, an event that took place on June 24, 2009.
 
It has the subject line, ""The $64,000 Question."" (For you young whippersnappers,

The $64,000 Question

was a popular game show that aired in the 1950s and revived in the 1970s as

The $128,000 Question

.)
 
Here's the text of the e-mail:
 
""Finally ... The $64,000 question was asked ... Yesterday on ABC TV (better known as the all Barack Channel) during the 'Network Special on Health Care' ... Obama was asked:
 
""'Mr. President, will you and your family give up your current health care program and join the new ""universal health care program"" that the rest of us will be on????' ... (Bet you already know the answer) ... There was a stoney silence as Obama ignored the question and chose not to answer it!!!
 
""In addition, a number of senators were asked the same question, and their response was ... 'We will think about it.' And they did. It was announced today on the news that the 'Kennedy Health Care Bill' was written into the new health care reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt!
 
""So, this great new health care plan that is good for you and I ... is not good enough for Obama, his family or Congress...?? We (the American public) need to stop this proposed debacle ASAP!!!! ... This is totally wrong!!!!!
 
""Personally, I can only accept a universal health care overhaul that extends to everyone ... Not just us lowly citizens ... While the Washington 'elite' keep right with their gold-plated health care coverage. If you agree please pass this on ... ""
 
A reader sent us the e-mail and asked if it was true.
 
To start with, the e-mail seems to assume — though it doesn't say so explicitly — that the health care reform plan sends everyone into a new public plan. This is not the case.
 
The Democratic health care legislation under consideration in Congress leaves in place employer-provided health insurance for the vast majority of Americans. But people who work for small businesses, are self-employed or currently uninsured would be eligible for a separate system known as the health care exchange. It would offer a variety of plans, including a government-run plan that is known as the public option.
 
Much of the controversy about health care reform has surrounded the public option. Critics say it could create a large bureaucracy and would not provide coverage as good as private insurers, while supporters say it would stimulate competition for people in the exchange. People who receive health insurance coverage from large employers would not be eligible for the public option.
 
Members of Congress are offered insurance through their employer, which in this case is the federal government. They can purchase it through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, which is offered to all federal employees. (We've written about

this plan

previously.) Under the plan, federal workers — and members of Congress — can choose from a variety of insurance plans just as people would in the new health care exchange.
 
There's nothing in the health care bills that exempts Congress from the same requirements as regular citizens. However, some Republicans have attempted to pass amendments that would require members of Congress to drop their current coverage and force them to enroll in the public option. Republicans have said it would prove to the American people that the public option is a good thing. But Democrats have largely voted against these amendments, as we've

reported previously

.
 
But the chain e-mail doesn't address this. Instead, it says members of Congress have somehow exempted themselves from reform, which is not correct. Under the bill, the lawmakers would continue to receive the same insurance they get now, just as most Americans would.
 
Members of Congress are treated like any other citizens under the terms of the bill. We rate the chain e-mail's statement False.

House Republicans back up heckler, saying health bill wouldn't check who's illegal
","
The issue that drove Rep. Joe Wilson to become a heckler during President Barack Obama's health care address on Sept. 9, 2009, was the question of whether illegal immigrants would receive coverage from Democratic health care reforms. On the night of Obama's speech, we ruled that Wilson's outburst — shouting ""You lie!"" after Obama said that health reform would not insure illegal immigrants — was False.


Since then, many Republicans have said there's nothing in the bill that ensures people would have their citizenship verified before getting coverage, a claim that we will explore with this item.


In a ""myth vs. fact"" statement responding to the president's address, the House Republican Conference quoted President Obama saying, ""There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false. The reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.""


The Republican conference then says, ""Fact: Nothing in any of the Democrat bills would require individuals to verify their citizenship or identity prior to receiving taxpayer-subsidized benefits, making the President's promise one that the legislation itself does not keep.'""


To explore that, we first need to explain that there are two kinds of benefits in the bill that can be considered taxpayer-subsidized: tax credits and access to the public insurance option.


Democrats say the main health care bill, HR 3200, explicitly prevents illegal immigrants from getting ""affordability credits"" — tax credits for low-income people to buy health insurance on a national health insurance exchange. While illegal immigrants would be able to buy insurance just as a qualifying legal resident could, they would have to pay for it themselves without the ""affordability credit"" subsidy. (If you want to check, it's on page 132, section 242.) That's essentially keeping the status quo, in which illegal immigrants are able to buy private insurance on their own dime.


Critics of the health care bill, however, cite a couple of possible loopholes. We'll address the one cited by the House Republican Conference, which has also been noted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization critical of illegal immigration. Both groups contend that the Democratic bills lack verification procedures to make sure that illegal immigrants aren't signing up for the affordability credits. Such safeguards, FAIR says, were included in the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.


From our examination of the House bill, we don't see any verification system, either. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, agrees. In a report issued Aug. 25, 2009, CRS wrote that ""HR 3200 does not contain a mechanism to verify immigration status."" (We also noted that in our original item when we checked Wilson's heckle,

here

.)


FAIR notes that the House Ways and Means Committee rejected an amendment that would have required those seeking affordability credits to verify eligibility with two databases used to check it for federal benefits such as Medicaid.


But there are two caveats that keep the Republican assertion from being fully accurate.


The first is if the tax credits are administered through the Internal Revenue Service, there would be built-in scrutiny. For instance, if a system were set up for taxpayers to declare insurance expenses and then receive a refund or a rebate, illegal immigrants couldn't obtain coverage, ""because illegal immigrants do not have legitimate Social Security numbers,"" said Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a group that is generally proimmigration. ""Screening out illegal immigrants through the tax system would prevent them from obtaining health care-related subsidies.""


The second caveat is that language in the House bill does provide clear authority for the new government official who will run the exchange to set up that verification, as the CRS report notes.
 
Rosenblum concurs. ""The commissioner could enforce these restrictions in one of two ways: through document- and database-based screening requirements as in the Medicaid system, or by reimbursing health care expenses through tax refunds,"" he said.


Because the House Republican Conference assertion referred to ""any"" of the Democratic bills, we also looked through the bill reported by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The bill is generally more vague on these issues, but we did find the following passage, which seems to grant similar authority as the House bill passage cited earlier.


""The Secretary (of Health and Human Services), in consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, shall develop interoperable, secure, scalable, and reusable standards and protocols that facilitate enrollment of individuals in Federal and State health and human services programs. ... The Secretary shall facilitate enrollment of individuals in programs ... through methods which shall include (i) electronic matching against existing Federal and State data to serve as evidence of eligibility and digital documentation in lieu of paper-based documentation; (ii) capability for individuals to apply, recertify, and manage eligibility information online, including conducting real-time queries against databases for existing eligibility prior to submitting applications; and (iii) other functionalities necessary to provide eligible individuals with a streamlined enrollment process.""


Now for the second issue: access to the public option. FAIR and many Republicans have argued that while the bill bars illegal immigrants from getting the affordability credits, it still permits them to take part in the public option. We believe that reading is correct. But FAIR asserts that the public option is ""taxpayer-funded,"" something Democrats insist is not true. They say the public plan will be self-supporting through its participants' premiums. Obama reiterated that point in his speech. ""I have insisted that like any private insurance company, the public insurance option would have to be self-sufficient and rely on the premiums it collects,"" he said. Nothing we've seen so far has persuaded us that the public option will provide subsidized care.


So let's recap. There is explicit language in the House bill that says illegal immigrants should not receive the subsidized benefits. But we find the Republican conference is right that the legislation does not directly mention verification procedures and, for that reason, it's possible that illegal immigrants who are determined to beat the system might be able to get around the ban. But it's likely that the IRS would, at least indirectly, help to police that. And, the health choices commissioner would have the authority to set up a verification system. On balance, we rate the Republican claim Half True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
National health insurance exchange has restrictions
","
President Barack Obama extolled the virtues of a national health insurance exchange in a speech to a joint session of Congress.
 
""If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage,"" Obama said. ""If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices.""
 
Obama went on to compare this exchange to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, which is offered to all federal employees. (We've written about

this plan

previously.)
 
""Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves,"" he concluded.
 
But saying every American will get the same opportunity that Congress has to purchase insurance is not correct. There are several key differences between the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan and the national health insurance exchange.
 
The biggest issue is that there are significant limitations on who gets to use the exchange. Right now, the House bill allows in individuals and people who work for small businesses.
 
Pending legislation in the House says that only individuals and small businesses of fewer than 10 employees would be able to use the exchange during the first year, and only individuals and small businesses with fewer than 20 employees in the second year. In the third year, businesses are allowed in ""based on the number of full-time employees of an employer and such other considerations as the Commissioner deems appropriate."" This sounds like employers will gradually be allowed into the exchange based on size, as well as ""other considerations as the (health exchange) Commissioner deems appropriate.""
 
But people who can get insurance through a large employer will not be eligible to purchase on the exchange if their employer offers a plan that meets minimum requirements for coverage.
 
We should also add that many employers offer only a few choices of plan. Some only offer one plan. Federal employees, on the other hand, choose from an array of plans, with different levels of coverage. They are part the largest employer-sponsored program in the world, covering over 9 million employees, retirees, former employees, family members and former spouses, according to the Office of Personnel Management's Web site.
 
To say, as Obama does, that ""every American"" could get similar coverage as Congress on the exchange is not accurate. People who can get insurance through work are specifically excluded under the House bill. Obama lays out the right categories of people who would be allowed to shop ont the exchange in the first part of his statement: people who lose coverage or who are part of a small business. But he crossed a line when he told Congress, ""It's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves."" There are significant limitations on who will be allowed on the exchange. We rate his statement False.

Joe Wilson of South Carolina said Obama lied, but he didn't
","
We suspect it's rare that the president gets heckled during a speech to a joint session of Congress, but Rep. Joe Wilson didn't hold back.
 
""You lie!"" shouted the South Carolina Republican. This was in response to President Barack Obama's statements on illegal immigrants.
 
""There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants,"" Obama said. ""This, too, is false — the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally.""
 
So who's right here? Wilson or Obama?
 
Incidentally, Wilson apologized for the outburst after the speech, but said he still disagreed with Obama's statement.
 
We've been monitoring claims about health care reform and illegal immigrants for some time now. Most notably, a

chain e-mail claimed
 
that page 50 of the House bill gave free health care to illegal immigrants. That page didn't say that. Rather, it included a generic nondiscrimination clause that said insurers may not discriminate with regard to ""personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services."" So we rated the chain e-mail's claim

Pants on Fire

.
 
We read all 1,000-plus pages of the health care bill and were struck by the fact that it is largely silent on health care for illegal immigrants. Keep in mind that experts estimated there were 6.8 million uninsured illegal immigrants in the United States in 2007, out of a total of 11.9 million illegal immigrants. Right now, there are laws on the books that require hospitals to treat severely ill people who arrive at the hospital, regardless of immigration status, and we didn't see anything that would change those laws, either.
 
Most illegal immigrants are also now excluded from Medicaid, the government-run health care for the poor. We didn't see anything that would change that.
 
One place where the bill

does

mention immigration status is for ""affordability credits."" These are tax credits for people of modest means need to buy health insurance. The credits would help them buy insurance on a national health insurance exchange. The bill specifically says that people in the United States illegally are not eligible for tax credits, on page 132, section 242.
 
Still, given all that, we have heard from people who said that other aspects of reform could benefit illegal immigrants.
 
One of the most detailed responses was from the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform, called FAIR. You can read

their statement

on the matter on their Web site.
 
Primarily, they argue that illegal immigrants would be permitted to purchase insurance on the national health insurance exchange because the bill does not include a mechanism for verifying citizenship. So illegal immigrants would have the chance to purchase insurance in the public option, a government-run health care plan that would offer basic coverage at a low price.
 
FAIR also argues for more robust verification measures for the affordability credit and making sure that illegal immigrant parents won't be able to receive coverage if their citizen children are eligible.
 
FAIR has a point that illegal immigrants would likely be able to buy insurance on the national health insurance exchange. We don't see anything in the bills that would hinder that. A Congressional Research Service report issued Aug. 25, 2009, confirmed our observation. The House bill ""does not contain any restrictions on noncitzens participating in the Exchange — whether the noncitizens are legally or illegally present, or in the United States temporarily or permanently,"" the report said.
 
But it's worth pointing out that illegal immigrants participating in the exchange would be paying for their insurance like everyone else. That's similar to the current system — we're not aware of any particular restrictions that stop illegal immigrants from buying private insurance now. Under health care reform, illegal immigrants would be able to buy private insurance or the public option.
 
When we look at all of this evidence, it seems that health reform leaves in place the status quo on illegal immigration, and certainly does not provide any new benefits particularly for illegal immigrants. We hope to look at this issue more in the days ahead, because some hospitals are concerned about recouping their costs for treating illegal immigrants, and we're curious to know more about that problem and how it might or might not be solved by reform.
 
The best argument that we find that health reform would help illegal immigrants is that some might be able to purchase the public option — if it passes, and it might not — on the new health insurance exchange. They would purchase that at full cost. Obama said, ""The reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally,"" which Wilson said was a ""lie."" Actually, Obama can make a pretty thorough case that reform doesn't apply to those here illegally. We don't find the public option argument enough to make the case that Obama ""lied."" We rate Wilson's statement False.

Obama says health plan incorporates the ideas of Democrats and Republicans
","
In his address on health care to a joint session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, President Barack Obama suggested the health care bills in Congress are a bipartisan collaboration.
 
""It’s a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight — Democrats and Republicans,"" Obama said.
 
Earlier in the day, in a conference call with the media, Obama's deputy communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, argued that while the health bills in the House and Senate have not gotten Republican votes, the process was bipartisan because dozens of Republican amendments were adopted.
 
And that's technically true. But it's a stretch to characterize it as bipartisan.
 
The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions adopted 159 amendments offered by Republicans, but only two of them were significant or controversial enough to merit roll call votes. One of those two affected the manufacture of biologics medication and another required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option.
 
Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, said 132 of the 159 were for ""technical amendments"" and that it was a misnomer to call them proof of bipartisanship.
 
None of the Republicans' priorities have gotten any traction, he said: Tort reform, equalizing the tax code, reducing the proposed cuts to Medicare spending, and scrapping the proposed ""public option.""
 
In fact, he said, only one big-picture Republican issue seems to have gotten the attention of the Democratic majority: creating incentives for wellness, such as cutting insurance costs for people who exercise or don't smoke.
 
Over in the House, several versions of health care bills have passed various committees. Here's how Republican amendments fared there:
 
In the Energy and Commerce Committee, 16 Republican amendments were adopted. With the exception of one that would create a pathway for nonpioneer drug companies to manufacture ""follow-on"" biologics, said Lisa Miller, a spokeswoman for Republicans on the committee, none of the Republican amendments could be considered major, and none change the core of the legislation.
 
""The process in our committee was bipartisan only in that we were given the opportunity to mark up the bill,"" said Miller. ""In large measure, the bipartisanship that existed during the E&C markup was that of luck and circumstance, not intent among Democrats.""
 
In the Education and Labor Committee, just six of the 17 amendments offered by Republicans were adopted. Several ""probably are best described as technical,"" said Alexa Marrero, a spokesman for Republicans on the committee. And one, which sought to have members of Congress be enrolled in any government-run plan that would be created, was defeated by Democrats in other committees.
 
One, from Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., would allow employers who would have to cut jobs to meet health coverage costs the opportunity to seek a waiver from the bill’s requirements. It was adopted by voice vote.
 
In the House Ways and Means committee markup, all 38 of the Republican-sponsored amendments were rejected along a party-line vote.
 
To see a more detailed accounting of some of the Republican amendments that have been considered, click on some of the links in our list of sources. But suffice to say, we didn't come across many that passed that seem significant.
 
Michael Steel, spokesman for House Republican Leader John Boehner, said that while it's true that some Republican or bipartisan amendments were accepted, the legislation itself has received zero Republican votes.
 
""No amendments have changed the core of the legislation"" or altered the public option, Steel said.
 
Back when the House Education and Labor Committee considered its version of the bill in mid July, several Republican legislators complained that there was little real effort to engage a bipartisan process, and they called on Democrats to scrap the plan and start over.
 
According to an article in

Congressional Quarterly

, the panel’s chairman, George Miller, D-Calif., said that Republicans and Democrats simply have a ""serious difference in opinion on how to approach health care in this country.""
 
We also note that after Obama's appeal to the joint session of Congress, the man designated to offer Republican rebuttal, U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., again called on Obama and Congress to ""start over on a common-sense, bipartisan plan focused on lowering the cost of health care while improving quality.""
 
When Obama said the health plan incorporated ideas from Democrats and Republicans, we think he grossly overstated the bipartisanship of the process to date. Both sides claim the other party is to blame for that, an issue that we will not wade into here. However, we note that none of the plans that have graduated from congressional committees have received a single Republican vote. Yes, Congress adopted dozens of the amendments proposed by Republicans, but we couldn't find any that dramatically altered the plan. Still, to the extent there were at least some, we give Obama's statement a Barely True.

Obama is correct that ""death panel"" charge is a lie
","
In his address to a joint session of Congress, President Barack Obama brought up the most explosive charge to emerge in the health care debate: the specter of ""death panels.""


""Some of people’s concerns (about the health care legislation) have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost,"" Obama told lawmakers and a national television audience on Sept. 9, 2009. ""The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Now, such a charge would be laughable if it weren’t so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.""


The president was referring to a notion most prominently raised by former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin in a note posted on her Facebook page on Aug. 7, 2009.


""And who will suffer the most when they ration care?"" Palin wrote. ""The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.""


We have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's ""level of productivity in society"" to determine whether someone is ""worthy"" of health care. When we first

assessed

Palin's claim on Aug. 7, 2009, we gave it our lowest rating — Pants on Fire.


Palin may have jumped to a conclusion about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for ""worthiness."" Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others.


The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall ""conduct, support, and synthesize research"" that looks at ""outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically.""


The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research.


The House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission that ""nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer."" In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select.


Nothing has emerged to suggest to us that the death panels claim is any more true today than it was when Palin first floated it. We still rate it as Pants on Fire today. In our book, that counts as a ""lie, plain and simple."" So we find Obama's claim True.

Obama says preventive care saves money. It doesn't.
","President Barack Obama defended his health care plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress, promoting the benefits of reform for those who already have coverage. One of those benefits, he said, is that insurers will be required to cover checkups and other preventive care. ""Insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies — because there’s no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse,"" Obama said. ""That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives."" It may make sense and save lives, but does it save money? Experts say no. The head of the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does all the number-crunching for Congress, has said this isn't the case, despite claims from many Democrats to the contrary.     ""The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall,"" CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate.      Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive:     ""But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. . . Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it.""     In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on.   The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in bills being considered in the House of Representatives because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the  New England Journal of Medicine  that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care.   ""Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching,"" according to the paper. ""Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs.""   And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, ""as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs.""   So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it won't reduce government spending on health care. As a result, we rate Obama's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECB64800>],/factchecks/2009/sep/10/barack-obama/obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money-it-doesnt/

Health insurance stays in place under reform proposals
","
Seeking to jump-start efforts to pass a health care bill, President Barack Obama defended his reform plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress.
 
He sought to reassure Americans they would not lose their current coverage.
 
""First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have,"" Obama said. ""Let me repeat this: Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have.""
 
Obama is correct that the plans under consideration do not force those who currently have insurance to change plans. The proposals seek to build on the current system, where many Americans get coverage through work.
 
The plans do, however, implement new consumer protections and introduce new ways of regulating health insurance companies.
 
These new rules will surely change the current health care system. The bill in the House of Representatives gives employer-provided insurance five years to come into compliance with new rules, such as caps on out-of-pocket expenses and coverage for preventive care.
 
Right now, employers have the freedom to change or drop coverage, and they will continue to have that freedom under health reform. Doctors, too, can opt in or out of accepting various insurance plans, including Medicare. Because of this inherent instability to the health care system, and because of the new regulations, we rated one of Obama's earlier statements on the effects of reform — ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan"" —

Half True

.
 
Given what we know about reform, it seems likely that at least some people will have employers who decide to change plans when insurers alter their offerings under the new regulations. This would be most likely for any small businesses that currently offer health insurance. They will be allowed to use a national exchange where insurers compete to offer insurance, and prices are expected to be lower.
 
Obama's statement from the speech is more carefully phrased than his earlier statement. In his speech, he said that if you are ""already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."" That is true, there is nothing in the plan that proactively forces these kinds of changes, and the bills clearly intend to leave much of the current health care system in place. We rate Obama's statement True.

Analyst says Netherlands, Switzerland achieve universal coverage through private insurance
","
People on both sides of the health care debate like to make comparisons with other countries. Critics of President Barack Obama's plan have warned that the United States could end up with programs similar to those in Canada and the United Kingdom, which they say have long waits and substandard care. But Matt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide now working as a management consultant, is citing two other countries — the Netherlands and Switzerland — as useful models for the United States because they have private insurance but still manage to provide universal coverage.


In a

Washington Post

op-ed on Sept. 8, 2009, he wrote that those nations illustrate how the United States could achieve the goal of covering the uninsured without expanding direct government-run health care, such as offering a ""public option,"" an approach supported by many Democrats but opposed by many Republicans.


""The first fallacy of the 'public option or nothing' mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost — 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured.""


Let's take Miller's assertions individually.


First, he's right that both countries have systems in which private companies provide the insurance. In both countries, citizens must buy health insurance from a company that must provide the customer with a basic package of services defined by the government. Subsidies are provided for people who need them. Because everyone is covered, the insurers can spread their financial risk across a large and diverse group of beneficiaries.


Companies cannot compete against each other on the basic package (and in Switzerland, any profit they make on basic services must be used to reduce premiums the following year). Instead, they can make a profit by offering supplementary packages that cover certain services such as dental care, eyeglasses and cosmetic surgery. In Switzerland, many insurers also provide life insurance or homeowners insurance.


The degree of government mandates and restrictions for private insurers in the Netherlands and Switzerland goes well beyond what is practiced by the U.S. government. But the insurers are indeed private, profit-seeking companies, as Miller said they are.


Miller's second point is that both countries have universal coverage. Yes, both require people to have health insurance (just as the Democratic bill would). In the Netherlands, for instance, the penalty for not having insurance is having to pay 130 percent of the premium during the time one is not insured. In both countries, the government can forcibly enroll uninsured citizens in a plan if they do not do so themselves. Enforcement of the law is probably not 100 percent in either country, but it's close.


Finally, Miller asserts that both nations spend less on health care than the United States does. Here, too, he is correct.


According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — a group that analyzes statistics on wealthier, industrialized countries — the Dutch spent 9.8 percent of gross domestic product on health care in 2007, while the Swiss spent 10.8 percent and the United States spent 16 percent. So while Miller slightly overstated the percentage for Switzerland and the United States, he's close.


As for the number of uninsured Americans, the most commonly cited number is 46 million. (We looked into the validity of this number

here

.) The recession has almost certainly bumped that number upward, so his ""nearly 50 million"" assertion is probably pretty close.


So let's recap. Miller is correct that both the Netherlands and Switzerland achieve universal coverage through systems that use private insurers. And he's right that both countries do so more cheaply than the United States. So we rate his statement True.

Texas lawmaker is latest Republican to say health bill would kill 4.7 million jobs
","
In an argument, it's always helpful to quote your rivals when they seem to undermine their own case. That's what Republicans have been doing as they attempt to cast doubt on the Democratic push for health care reform.
 
This summer, a number of Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators have asserted that Christina Romer, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, believes that the Democratic health plan could result in 4.7 million Americans losing their jobs.
 
Here's a recent version of this claim, made by Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, in an Aug. 31 column on the Web site of the Christian Coalition of America:
 
Answering his own question, ""Will the Bill Cost American Jobs?"" Carter writes, ""No argument here either. The Obama administration's own White House Council of Economic Advisers has estimated 4.7 million Americans will lose their jobs if the bill passes, as employers who cannot afford health insurance or the 8 percent payroll tax penalty will have to fire their employees, move overseas, or go out of business.""
 
But Obama's Council of Economic Advisers has not said that. Rather, the number comes from calculations made by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee, based on ideas in two papers co-authored by Romer, who was an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining the administration. Another Republican lawmaker, House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, put it more accurately when he wrote in a July 20 column, ""According to methodology developed by Dr. Christina Romer, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, the government takeover would cost Americans 4.7 million jobs over the next 10 years.""
 
But since many other Republicans have cited the same numbers, we thought it would be helpful to explore whether they are accurate.
 
We obtained a copy of the math behind the claim from the Ways and Means GOP staff and, to be honest, it's pretty complicated stuff. (Readers with a taste for econometrics can read a more detailed version

here

.) But despite the complexity, we think that a thorough examination of the statistic is warranted because one of the major Republican arguments against the bill is that it's a job killer. And, based on the number of Internet hits we see on the 4.7 million jobs figure, this statistic has become a key talking point for the party. (Complicating matters further, the Ways and Means Republican staff later issued a revised estimate, and the new number — as many as 5.5 million jobs lost — has begun to pop up as well, including in a national radio address by Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., on Sept. 5, 2009. However, because commentators have been using the 4.7 million jobs figure for most of the summer and continue to do so, we're mainly going to scrutinize the calculations that led to that number.)
 
First, a little explanation of the math by the Ways and Means Republican staff. They focused on a tax in the health care bill that is informally known as ""play or pay."" It requires employers to either pay for health care coverage (that's the ""play"") for their workers or else pay a penalty equal to 8 percent of wages. The Republicans sought to estimate how many jobs would be lost from businesses being forced to cut back on expenses if this tax was implemented.
 
In assembling their calculations, Republican staffers referred to two papers by Romer. One, from 2007 when she was a professor, was co-authored with her husband and fellow economist, David Romer. It explores how changes in tax policy affect the broader economy. The second paper, released by the Obama transition team on Jan. 9, 2009, sought to quantify how many jobs would be created by the economic stimulus package.
 
The Ways and Means staff took two key numbers from Romer's papers, both of which are what economists call ""multipliers."" A multiplier is a number that shows how much of an added impact a given statistic (say, a tax increase) has on a different statistic (say, job numbers). Essentially what the GOP staffers did was to take three basic facts — the size of the health bill's tax increase, the size of the U.S. gross domestic product and the current number of jobs in the United States — and use the theory outlined in Romer's papers, including the multipliers she came up with, to figure out how many jobs the tax hike threatened to eliminate.
 
When we talked to independent economic experts and the White House, we didn't hear a lot of complaints about the multipliers chosen by the Ways and Means staff. But we did hear a range of other concerns:
 
—

The size of the tax increase in the health bill.

The figure used in the Republican calculation was $300 billion over 10 years. But a July 14 estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office pegged it at $163 billion. The Ways and Means Republican staff did use the $163 billion in its second set of calculations, but because the $300 billion figure was built into the math that led to the 4.7 million jobs number, we're focusing on that number here. Simply put, using the $300 billion figure for the tax hit, rather than the $163 billion figure, inflates the job-loss number cited by Carter and others.


—

An expanded exemption for small businesses.

On July 31, 2009, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adopted an amendment to the House health care bill (H.R. 3200) to make more small businesses exempt from the ""play or pay"" provision. In the original bill, companies with payrolls smaller than $250,000 annually were to be exempt. The amendment made the cutoff level $500,000. There's no guarantee that this provision will make it into the final bill, and even if it does, the CBO has not estimated the impact. But if the new limit becomes law, it seems likely that the size of the tax hit will go down — another factor that would decrease the Republican estimate of 4.7 million lost jobs.


—

What's the purpose of the tax hike?

Romer's 2007 paper takes pains to distinguish between two types of tax policy changes. One type accompanies significant increases in spending — perhaps, as Romer suggests, to combat a recession, to fund a war or to foot the bill for a new social insurance program. These tax changes tend to balance out the other major changes going on in the economy, she argues, and they tend to keep economic growth on an even keel. The other kind of tax changes are undertaken either to reduce the deficit or to spur long-term growth, in the absence of economic emergencies or major expansions in government programs.


This distinction becomes relevant for the Republicans' calculation because Romer concludes that the broader economic effects of the first type of tax changes are harder to identify because more factors are changing at the same time. For this reason her paper focuses primarily on the second type of tax changes, which she found to have much more reliable and measurable impacts on the economy. But the tax increases studied by Ways and Means accompany a major expansion in social insurance, meaning that by Romer's own definition, this scenario is not a good candidate for reliable calculations under her formula. Republican economists dismiss those complaints, saying her approach works equally well in a deficit-reduction scenario as when a new program is being created.


—

Ten years vs. one year

. Our biggest concern about the Republican estimate is a math assumption that could make the jobs estimate off by a factor of 10. In the Ways and Means calculation, the Republican staff determined the tax increase's size as a percentage of GDP — a necessary step in the calculation — by dividing the total tax increase over 10 years ($300 billion by their count) by the U.S. GDP in a single year ($14.047 trillion, the CBO's projection for 2009). This struck us as odd, since one would think that a tax increase spread out over 10 years should be divided by GDP over 10 years. Other economists agreed with us. The Ways and Means staff told us that Romer did it that way in her papers, but the White House told PolitiFact that Romer's papers did not make calculations in which 10 years' worth of taxes were divided by one year's worth of GDP. Economists outside the White House told us they found several indications in her writings to back up the White House's assertion.


This question is important because dividing by one year's GDP rather than 10 makes the scale of the expected job losses 10 times bigger. Not 10 percent bigger — 10 times bigger. That's enough to skew the entire results. We recalculated the original Ways and Means formula — this time dividing by 10 years' worth of GDP and using the smaller CBO estimate of the size of the tax hit — and came up with job losses totaling 193,946, far less than 4.7 million. We also took the suggestion of J.D. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and divided the 10th year tax hit by that year's estimated GDP. Using this calculation, we came up with 323,980 jobs lost over 10 years. That's a higher number than our first attempt, but still less than one-tenth of what the GOP Ways and Means staff estimated.


It should be emphasized that any calculation of this sort is just an estimate, and a rough one at that. For instance, several factors not included in Romer's calculation could either push the job loss number higher or lower.


Republicans say the bill as written will create higher deficits, which they predict will increase the pressure on lawmakers to eventually raise taxes beyond what is currently envisioned in the bill. Those tax increases, which are not captured by the Romer formula, could increase job losses in future years.


So, assuming big deficits far into the future, it's possible that the number of jobs lost due to the passage of health care reform would rise to something approaching, or even exceeding, 4.7 million. And Republicans are free to make that case. But if Rep. Carter is using Romer's handiwork to make the argument, he has an obligation to cite her work fairly. And it is a significant distortion to say that her Council of Economic Advisers made such an estimate. That by itself is enough for us to find his claim False.


But the case doesn't get much stronger when they use the Republican interpretations of Romer's work. The number initially calculated by Ways and Means Republicans overstated the size of the tax hit which in turn would exaggerate the number of jobs lost. The number ignored an amendment that could end up further shrinking the size of the tax hit. It invoked Romer's position even as it contradicted her view of whether her formula was legitimate to use in this situation. And most importantly, it used a calculation that increased the scale of job losses by a factor of 10.


So we find Rep. Carter's claim to be a major distortion, not just because of the questionable math he based it on, but because he distorted who said it. We find his statement False.

Glenn Beck says Van Jones is an avowed communist
","Radio and TV political commentator Glenn Beck has spent weeks detailing what he says is a web of Obama administration officials with socialist or communist ties. And Exhibit A in the Beck argument has been Van Jones, Obama's so-called green jobs czar (his actual title was special adviser for green jobs at the Council on Environmental Quality). Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck has repeatedly claimed Jones is a communist. For purposes of a fact-check statement, we selected a Sept. 1, 2009, remark Beck made on his radio program that Jones ""is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist."" There's little question that Jones  was  an avowed communist. In a Nov. 2, 2005, profile of Jones in the  East Bay Express  , an alternative weekly in Berkeley, Calif., Jones said his life hit a turning point in the spring of 1992 when he was swept up in mass arrests while protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Although the charges against Jones were dropped, Jones said that while in jail, ""I met all these young radical people of color — I mean really radical, communists and anarchists. And it was, like, 'This is what I need to be a part of.' I spent the next 10 years of my life working with a lot of those people I met in jail, trying to be a revolutionary."" ""In the months that followed,"" the  Express  article said, ""he let go of any lingering thoughts that he might fit in with the status quo. 'I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,' he said. 'By August, I was a communist.'"" In 1994, the story states, Jones formed a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM. According to a history of STORM written in the spring of 2004, the group held ""structured political education"" training at every meeting ""to help members develop an understanding of the basics of Marxist politics."" They ""trained members on capitalism and wage exploitation, the state and revolution, imperialism and the revolutionary party."" So Jones was a self-avowed communist. But is he still? The answer lies in the very same article. Even before the group disbanded in 2002, the  Express  article says, ""Jones began transforming his politics and work..."" According to the article, ""He took an objective look at the movement's effectiveness and decided that the changes he was seeking were actually getting farther away. Not only did the left need to be more unified, he decided, it might also benefit from a fundamental shift in tactics. 'I realized that there are a lot of people who are capitalists — shudder, shudder — who are really committed to fairly significant change in the economy, and were having bigger impacts than me and a lot of my friends with our protest signs,' he said."" In recent years, Jones established himself as a leading, charismatic cheerleader for transitioning the American economy to green jobs. We weren't able to find any recent interviews where Jones directly addresses the question of where he stands on communism. When he resigned this week, Jones said he was the victim of a ""vicious smear campaign"" by conservatives and decided to resign so as not to be a distraction. ""I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past,"" he said in a released statement. But check out these two statements and see if this sounds like a communist. This, from his book,  The Green Collar Economy  , released in October 2008: ""There will surely be an important role for nonprofit voluntary, cooperative, and community-based solutions,"" Jones writes on page 86. ""But the reality is that we are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither the government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely. ""So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs — and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world — and everyone else."" Or how about this, from an address before the Center for American Progress on Nov. 19, 2008 (well before Jones was brought into the Obama administration): ""Everything that is good for the environment, everything that's needed to beat global warming, is a job,"" Jones said. ""Solar panels don't manufacture themselves. Wind turbines don't manufacture themselves. Homes don't weatherize themselves. Every single thing that we need to beat global warming will also beat the recession. And the challenge is, how do we get the government to be a smart, and limited, catalyst in getting the private sector to take on this challenge?"" That doesn't sound Marxist to us. Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones  used to be  a communist. Jones has been up front about that. But Beck has repeatedly said Jones  is  a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones  was  a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests. So we find the claim Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE476C0>],/factchecks/2009/sep/08/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-van-jones-avowed-communist/

Van Jones a 9/11 'Truther?' Glenn Beck thinks so.
","Glenn Beck has harshly criticized several appointees in the Obama administration. One of them was Van Jones, known as the ""green jobs"" czar. (His formal title was special adviser for green jobs, enterprise and innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality.) Jones is an environmental activist and author best known for his work promoting renewable energy as a means of creating jobs for low-income people. Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck attacked Jones for endorsing a group known as the 9/11 ""Truthers,"" conspiracy theorists who believe that the government deliberately allowed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in order to promote a militaristic agenda. Specifically, Beck said, Jones signed a 2004 petition promoted by 911truth.org, which demanded a new investigation into Sept. 11 to answer what the group considered to be unanswered questions about the attacks. Beck read the names of several celebrities who signed the petition, including the actor Ed Asner, actress and actor/comedian Janeane Garofalo, and Cynthia McKinney, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Georgia. He then noted that Jones signed as directer of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, a California-based civil rights group Jones directed at the time. Jones ""thinks the Bush administration blew up the World Trade Center and covered it up,"" Beck said. Later he added, ""Did President Obama know about all of this? . . . As the White House has been silent on this, I can't answer it."" The Obama administration soon issued a statement from Jones, saying that Jones did not agree with the statements on the petition, especially that government officials may have allowed 9/11 to happen. ""I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever,"" Jones said in the statement. We reviewed the petition, and its most incendiary language is in the form of hanging questions, such as, ""How could Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, have flown back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA's radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military?"" and ""What happened to the over 20 documented warnings given our government by 14 foreign intelligence agencies or heads of state?"" Jones' name is listed  on the petition  , and he has not disputed that he signed it. Democrats such as Howard Dean said that Jones made a mistake by signing the petition without knowing its complete contents. Since the petition hit the news last week, some signatories have said they were misled about its contents and at least one asked that her name be removed. (  Politico  has reported on these disputes in greater detail.) As fact-checkers, we can't know what Jones thought he was or wasn't signing. We can confirm that Jones is listed as a signatory on the petition. So far, his public statements seem to indicate he signed the petition but was either not in full agreement with some of its implications or didn't know what he was signing. He said, ""I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever."" On one level, the petition is just asking for more investigations. But given the pointed questions it asks, it pretty clearly implies that the Bush administration allowed the terrorist attacks to be executed due to indifference or incompetence, at a minimum. It also states that ""people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen, perhaps as a pretext for war."" Still, Beck pushes the envelope when he says Jones ""thinks the Bush administration blew up the World Trade Center and covered it up."" The petition doesn't state that definitively. It does ask for investigations. We rate Beck's statement Half True. UPDATE:  A few days after we published this story, Jones name was removed from the petition on the Web site of  911Truth.org. ""Following recent media-generated controversy over Obama appointee Van Jones' signature on this Statement, he and two other signatories have requested their names be removed. That has been done,"" the site noted.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBEFF40>],/factchecks/2009/sep/08/glenn-beck/van-jones-truther-glen-beck-thinks-so/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Rush Limbaugh says health care bill would allow government to make transfers in your bank account
","On his radio program on Aug. 28, Rush Limbaugh continued to hammer the Democrat-backed health care bill, claiming ominously that it would allow government ""the right to get into your bank account...and make transfers without you knowing it."" A similar claim was included in a widely circulated chain e-mail that contains numerous distortions about the health care bill. We examined the claims in depth and reported on many of them  here.  Limbaugh has raised this issue several times. On Aug. 6, 2009, a caller to his radio program said, ""Listen, of all the scary things in this health care bill, Rush, the scariest thing is this:  The government, if this passes, will be able to go into your bank account or anybody's bank account — I just read this last night — anybody's bank account, take the money out to fund this monstrosity.  Did you know that?"" 

Said Limbaugh, ""He's right, folks, he's right.  That is in the House bill."" The provision in question is in Section 163 of the House bill (page 59) , under the heading ""Administrative Simplification."" It broadly sets out goals for standardizing electronic health records. The legislative summary says the intent in the section is ""to adopt standards for typical transactions"" between insurance companies and health care providers. Edwin Park, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the intent is to set standards for electronic communication between health providers and insurance companies and has nothing to do with an individual's bank account. So for example, a doctor would have access to real-time information about a patient's co-pays and whether a particular procedure or medication is covered under their plan, how much is owed, and so on, he said. Much of that already happens today, he said, but it would standardize electronic records so that with out-of-network transactions, everyone is using the same coding and standards. Park's interpretation is shared by Health Care for America Now, which is lobbying for health care reform. According to the group's Web site, the provision ""continues the discussion of administrative standards, and authorizes electronic transfers of money within the government. In no way does this provision grant the government access to individual bank accounts."" But some say the wording of the bill is ambiguous, and does appear to allow for the possibility of addressing electronic health payments from a patient's individual bank account. Robert Book of the Heritage Foundation pointed to a clause in Section 163 that states that it would ""enable electronic funds transfers, in order to allow automated reconciliation with the related health care payment and remittance advice."" Some interpret that as a vehicle to allow people to pay their health bills through automatic deductions from their personal bank accounts. And in an e-mail sent out by David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, in which he sought to debunk some of the ""lies and distortions"" that have circulated in e-mails about health care reform, he seems to suggest that's exactly what is being contemplated. ""No, government will not do anything with your bank account,"" Axelrod wrote. ""It is an absurd myth that government will be in charge of your bank accounts.  Health insurance reform will simplify administration, making it easier and more convenient for you to pay bills in a method that you choose.  Just like paying a phone bill or a utility bill, you can pay by traditional check, or by a direct electronic payment. And forms will be standardized so they will be easier to understand. The choice is up to you – and the same rules of privacy will apply as they do for all other electronic payments that people make."" On the White House Web site, Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform, spoke to the issue, saying,  ""Individuals, not the government, will be in charge of their bank accounts, just like they are today."" We read Section 163 and found nothing that would  require  patients to participate in electronic payments. So Limbaugh is wrong that the bill would allow the government ""the right to get into your bank account."" The choice would be up to the person if they'd like to allow electronic withdrawals from their bank accounts. John S. Hoff, deputy assistant secretary for Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, doesn't see much to support the critics' claims. But the bill was written in such an ambiguous way, he said, that it opens the door for this kind of speculation. Perhaps, he said, the provision is intended only to deal with standardizing electronic communication between health providers and insurance companies, he said. But the wording ""seems to contemplate getting money from (an individual's) account electronically."" Still, he said, ""I think there is something that would protect you, that would allow you to block access to your account. It doesn't say that they could force you to do it. Does this override your relationship with the bank? No, I don't think so. Suppose you didn't want electronic transfers, you could tell the bank not to do it."" Dr. Glenn Laffel, senior vice president of clinical affairs at Practice Fusion, which provides free, Web-based electronic health records, read the wording of the bill and came away confused. ""At best, it's vague and ambiguous,"" Laffel said. ""At worst, it would empower the government to do something that isn't right. It's something that needs to be addressed."" So in summary, some of the experts we talked to said the wording of the bill is ambiguous enough to allow speculation like Limbaugh's that the government might be able to tap into an individual's bank account to square health payments. But there's nothing in the bill that suggests this program would be required. And while it sounds ominous to say the government could get into your bank account, the same is true for utility and mortgage companies for whom customers have given permission to extract regular electronic payments directly from their bank accounts. The way Limbaugh says it, it sounds like the government would require this program (that it would ""have the right"") to get into your account, that the government could do it without your permission. And we find no basis for that claim in the bill. We also think Limbaugh exaggerates when he says the government could then transfer money in your account without you knowing it. If you sign up for electronic withdrawal, you know about it. And so we rate this claim Barely True.

"['National', 'Military', 'Duncan Hunter']","
Duncan Hunter says we have waterboarded our own military as part of training exercises
","In a discussion on MSNBC's  Hardball  program about whether the government ought to consider prosecuting people involved in enhanced interrogation techniques used on some terror suspects, former U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, argued that the issue really comes down to waterboarding.

""And,"" he said, ""waterboarding is not torture.""

In fact, said Hunter, a Vietnam veteran and former candidate for president, ""We waterboard, incidentally, hundreds of our own military personnel. They waterboard themselves in training to toughen themselves up.""

He added, ""The Geneva Convention .. .was analyzed by the lawyers in place, and they came to the conclusion, especially about waterboarding, because that's the primary thing, that, since we do it to our own soldiers, by the hundreds, incidentally, and it doesn't hurt them, and they — and it makes them tougher, and it doesn't hurt anybody — Khalid Sheikh Mohammed gained weight after he was waterboarded — we decided that, since we do that to our own soldiers in training... we‘re not going to consider that torture. ""

Hunter later challenged host Chris Matthews saying, ""But the point is, if we do it, are we torturing American soldiers? You have to answer yes if you consider waterboarding to be torture.""

Matthews said the difference is that U.S. service people know they are in training. They know they aren't going to be killed. ""That captured person who is one of our enemies has no idea what we‘re doing when we submit him to water torture.""

Said Hunter: ""If we use it with our own soldiers in training, as we do waterboarding, then it should be allowed with people who have killed thousands of Americans.""

We decided to examine Hunter's claim about waterboarding our service personnel as part of their training and found that he is right.

U.S. special operations troops have, in the past, sometimes used a form of waterboarding as part of survival exercises, called Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training. The idea is to prepare them in the event they are ever captured and interrogated with such means.

According to reports in the  New York Times  and  Vanity Fair,  the CIA adopted some of the interrogation techniques used on terror suspects from that SERE training, including the use of waterboarding.

According to the  Vanity Fair  story, three-week SERE training for the U.S. soldiers included waterboarding, forced nudity, extreme temperatures, sexual and religious ridicule, agonizing stress positions, and starvation-level rations. The story quotes Michael Rolince, former section chief of the FBI's International Terrorism Operations: ""You're not going to die, but you think you are.""

But while the techniques may have been derived from SERE training, a different, more intense brand of waterboarding was used on terror suspects, according to recently released CIA documents.

According to a May 7, 2004, CIA Inspector General special report on interrogation techniques used on terror suspects, which has some parts redacted, ""OIG’s (Office of the Inspector General's) review of the videotapes revealed that the waterboard technique employed at (redacted) was different from the technique as described in the DoJ (Department of Justice) opinion and used in the SERE training. The difference was in the manner in which the detainee’s breathing was obstructed. At the SERE School and in the DoJ opinion, the subject’s airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contest, the Agency interrogator (redacted) continuously applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee’s mouth and nose. One of the psychologists/interrogators acknowledged that the Agency’s use of the technique differed from that used in SERE training and explained that the Agency’s technique is different because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.""

The report also says the CIA's Office of Medical Services has characterized the SERE waterboarding as ""so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant."" The office said its frequency and intensity raised questions about whether it was effective or medically safe.

So we think Hunter misleads a bit by equating waterboarding in training of military personnel with the technique used on terror suspects. According to the CIA inspector general's report, the technique used on the suspects was more powerful and convincing. And in the case of one terror suspect, it was used 183 times, often in rapid succession. So to argue the technique isn't torture because it is used on American servicemen as part of training ignores that it was not used in the same way.

Still, Hunter is correct that the U.S. military has waterboarded servicemen as part of survival training. And so we rule his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9772C0>],/factchecks/2009/sep/04/duncan-hunter/duncan-hunter-says-we-have-waterboarded-our-own-mi/
