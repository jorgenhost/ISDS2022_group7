Two of three convicted in military commissions have been released
","The current and former vice presidents -- Joe Biden and Dick Cheney -- battled it out on separate Sunday morning talk shows on Feb. 14, 2010, debating the Obama administration's policies on bringing accused terrorists to justice.At times, their debate seemed more like a philosophical argument: Should terrorists be treated like vanquished military opponents or common criminals? If you believe the former, you would support trying the accused in front of military commissions at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. If you believe the latter, you would favor trying them in U.S. courts. Biden offered a full-throated defense of Obama administration plans to try Khalid Sheik Mohammed in U.S. courts, even though the administration supports commissions for some cases. One of Biden's arguments was that U.S. courts work better and result in tougher sentences.""Let me put this in perspective,"" Biden said on Face the Nation. ""There have been three people tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts. Two are walking the street right now. There have been over 300 tried in federal courts by the last administration and by us. They're all in jail now. None of them are out seeing the light of day.""We're looking into Biden's assertion that more than 300 people have been tried in federal courts and will post our findings soon.Here, we are examining Biden's assertion that three people were tried and convicted by the last administration in military commissions, and that two of three have been released.After consulting news reports and military documents, we discovered that Biden was correct. We also checked with experts who both support and oppose military commissions for various reasons, and no one disputed Biden's numbers.Before we summarize the three cases, we should point out a few things about military commissions, which Congress authorized in laws passed in 2006 and 2009. The commissions operate under rules that are more favorable to the government than the rules typically found in federal courts, and the jurors are all members of the military. But that doesn't mean prosecutors always get what they want. In some cases, juries refuse to convict, and a military judge can allow or exclude evidence. Here are the details on the three cases:• David Hicks of Australia was the first person convicted by a military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2006, according to the Department of Defense. A native Australian, Hicks was a convert to Islam who was in Afghanistan before Sept. 11, 2001, and was picked up by U.S. forces in December of that year. The government said he had trained in al-Qaida camps. Hicks' case gained prominence in Australia, with members of the public urging his release. In a plea deal, Hicks pleaded guilty in March 2007 to one charge of providing material support to terrorism, an offense with a maximum sentence of life in prison. The commission sentenced Hicks to seven years, though most of that was suspended in an agreement that sent Hicks back to Australia to serve out his sentence. Hicks left an Australian prison and returned home in December 2007. On his release, Hicks issued a statement saying he intended to honor a plea deal not to talk to the media for one year, though he did add, ""I would like to recognize the huge debt of gratitude that I owe the Australian public for getting me home."" Hicks married in 2009 and is reportedly writing a book. • Salim Hamdan was Osama bin Laden's driver. Prosecutors argued he was a dangerous terrorist, while his defense attorneys said he was a low-level aide. The military commission's jury found him guilty of providing material support for terrorism in August 2008, but sentenced him to little more than time served. The Bush administration sent him back to Yemen in November 2008. Reuters reported that the Yemeni government released him from jail in January 2009. (Hamdan was the petitioner in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, the U.S. Supreme Court case that overturned initial Bush administration efforts at setting up military commissions.) In August, he was living with his wife and two daughters in Sana'a, Yemen.• Ali Hamza al Bahlul made propaganda videos at the direction of Osama bin Laden. In November 2009, a military commission jury convicted him of 35 counts of conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and providing material support for terrorism. Not only did Bahlul not allow his attorneys to put on a defense, but he also told the jury he volunteered for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that bin Laden turned him down, according to press reports. The jury sentenced him to life in prison, and Bahlul remains in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.To be fair, we asked a supporter of military commissions about Biden's point, that there haven't been many convictions through military tribunals. Andrew McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney and a national security commentator for the conservative National Review, said that the commissions have been constantly challenged by liberal attorneys, which has hampered their progress. ""It is more than a little rich for the very people who moved heaven and earth to prevent the commissions from being completed now complain that we didn't complete very many commissions,"" McCarthy said.In the interview on Face the Nation, Biden said he believed traditional federal courts would provide the longest sentences to terrorists, based on their track record of convictions. Of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, Biden said, ""Looking at the evidence that's been made available to me as part of, in a generic sense, the executive branch and the prosecuting team, I am absolutely convinced he will be put away for a long, long time.""The debate on military commissions versus federal courts will no doubt continue. Here, we're checking Biden's statement that three people had been tried and convicted by the last administration in military courts, and that two are ""walking the street right now."" The facts support that, and we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC0840>],/factchecks/2010/feb/16/joe-biden/two-three-convicted-military-commissions-released/

Biden overstates role of Medicare, Medicaid in U.S. health care spending
","In an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Feb. 14, 2010, Vice President Joe Biden made the case for restraining costs through the administration's approach to health care reform and discussed the scope of federal spending on health care. ""I think the president made the right judgment in deciding that in order to bend the cost curve and prevent people from being victimized by health insurance costs that we had to move and we had to move aggressively,"" Biden said. ""And the president is still committed to making sure that we do three things: One, make sure that those whose premiums are now continuing to skyrocket in fact are brought under control; making sure that the money the federal government spends on health care, 46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid, that we bend that cost curve to gain control of the future, of our future fiscal situation; and making sure the insurance companies can't engage in the kind of practices they do with pre-existing conditions and limits on coverage, etc."" The 46-cents-on-the-dollar figure sounded high to us, so we decided to check. We looked at the Congressional Budget Office's June 2009, report, ""The Long-Term Budget Outlook."" The report says that in 2007, 54 percent of the $2.1 trillion spent on health care in the United States was financed privately. That leaves 46 percent (or, as Biden put it, 46 cents on the dollar) financed by public sources. So Biden used the right statistic -- but he was less than careful in his description of what the statistic described. According to the CBO report, federal spending on Medicare made up 21 percent of total U.S. health care expenditures in 2007, and the combined federal and state spending on Medicaid represented 16 percent. Given that the federal government on average pays 57 percent of the cost for Medicaid (the federal share varies state by state), the federal portion of spending on Medicaid actually represents 9 percent of U.S. health care expenditures. So when Biden specifically said that ""the money the federal government spends on health care, 46 cents on every dollar spent is through Medicare and Medicaid,"" he overstated the federal percentage for the two programs. It's actually 30 cents of every dollar, rather than 46 cents. So what accounts for the 16 percentage-point difference? The answer is federal money spent on health care programs other than Medicare and Medicaid (including veterans' health care, military health care and the State Children's Health Insurance Program) and funds spent on health care by state and local governments. ""What he really should have said was that 46 percent comes from public spending, rather than saying 46 percent comes from Medicare and Medicaid,"" said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. A spokesman for Biden conceded that the vice president should have been clearer. ""The vice president's list of federal programs should have been longer than Medicare and Medicaid -- he cited only these two largest programs in the interest of time,"" said Jay Carney, Biden's communications director. ""He should have said 'such as' or 'including.' ""  As a sidelight, Brookings Institution health care scholar Henry Aaron points out that even the 54 percent of health care dollars that are privately financed are indirectly supported by the federal government, through such policies as tax exclusions for employer-provided health care. The value of these supports is estimated to run into the billions of dollars. But that isn't what Biden was talking about. Essentially, the vice president cited an accurate number, but he failed to describe correctly what it meant, and he ended up making the share of federal Medicare and Medicaid spending seem half again as big as it actually is. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B5C80>],/factchecks/2010/feb/16/joe-biden/biden-overstates-role-medicare-medicaid-us-health-/
"['National', 'Homeland Security', 'Terrorism', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Dick Cheney']","
Cheney says Obama initially said Christmas Day bomber was an 'isolated extremist'
","In recent weeks, the Obama administration and its Republican critics have been sparring over how to deal with alleged terrorists. The latest round of arguments began Dec. 25, 2009, when a 23-year-old Nigerian national, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, allegedly tried to ignite explosives with material hidden in his underwear while sitting aboard a Northwest Airlines plane bound for Detroit. On Feb. 14, 2010, the former vice president and the current vice president -- Republican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe Biden -- appeared on the Sunday morning talk shows. Terrorism was a major topic for both. Cheney has often criticized President Barack Obama for not being forceful enough in responding to terrorism, and he has accused Obama of not considering the U.S. to be at war against terrorists (a claim we rated Pants on Fire!).   On ABC's This Week, Cheney brought up Obama's initial reaction to the news of the bombing attempt. Cheney charged that the president had at first hastily dismissed the Christmas Day bomb attempt as an ""isolated"" incident with limited relevance for the broader fight against terrorism:   ""Well, my reference to the notion that the president was trying to avoid treating this as a war was in relation to his initial response when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber up in Detroit, when he went out and said this was the act of an isolated extremist. No, it wasn't,"" Cheney said. ""And we found out over time, obviously -- and he eventually changed his assessment -- but that, in fact, this was an individual who'd been trained by al-Qaida, who'd been part of a larger conspiracy, and it was closer to being an act of war than it was the act of an isolated extremist. It's the mind-set that concerns me, John. I think it's very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and then looking at 9/11 and saying, 'This is not a criminal act,' not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole in the Pentagon. That's an act of war."" Here we're focusing on whether Cheney was correct to say that Obama's ""initial response"" to the incident was that it ""was the act of an isolated extremist."" Cheney was referencing Obama's first official statement after the bombing attempt, delivered to reporters on Dec. 28 while he was vacationing in Kaneohe, Hawaii.    In it, the president sought ""to take a few minutes to update the American people"" on the incident and explain ""the steps we're taking to ensure the safety and security of the country."" He recounted what had happened on the plane, what his administration was doing to investigate the incident, and what immediate steps would be taken to tighten airport security. Toward the end of his statement, Obama praised the the passengers of the Northwest flight for their quick action in stopping Abdulmutallab. Obama said: ""Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. Those plotting against us seek not only to undermine our security, but also the open society and the values that we cherish as Americans. This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist. As a nation we will do everything in our power to protect our country, as Americans we will never give in to fear or division, we will be guided by our hopes, our unity, and our deeply held values. That's who we are as Americans. And that's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they spend the holidays in harm's way, and we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in the New Year and beyond."" Whether Cheney's claim is accurate or not depends on how you interpret Obama's reference to ""an isolated extremist."" Is the president explicitly labeling Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ""an isolated extremist""? Or is this part of Obama's statement a more general attempt to laud bravery by ordinary Americans who find themselves sitting with an ""isolated extremist"" in their midst?   Cheney clearly argues that it's the former. And it's true that, when read literally, Obama did say that ""this incident"" -- that is, the one in Detroit -- involved ""an isolated extremist."" (When Obama refers to several other similar incidents that preceded it, we're assuming he's referring to the passenger-foiled ""shoe-bombing"" by Richard Reid in 2001 and possibly the fighting back by passengers aboard the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on Sept. 11, 2001.)   Still, we see several pieces of evidence that suggest Obama's point was general and rhetorical, rather than an attempt to characterize the nature of the specific Christmas Day bombing plot.   Earlier in the same Dec. 28 statement, Obama indicated that the investigation was still in an early phase. ""We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt,"" he said. This call for caution undercuts Cheney's contention that Obama was using his statement to tell Americans that it was definitively ""the act of an isolated extremist.""   Also, Obama said that ""a full investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable."" The reference to ""all who were involved"" also undercuts the notion that Obama viewed Adbulmutallab as ""an isolated extremist"" without connections to terrorist networks. And it's worth noting that two days earlier, an unnamed White House official was quoted in the Wall Street Journal saying, ""We believe this was an attempted act of terrorism."" The White House official said the suspect had informed investigators hat he had been given the device by al-Qaida operatives in Yemen, along with detonation instructions. ""This guy claims he is tied to al-Qaida, specifically in Yemen,"" the official said. ""He claims he was on orders from al-Qaida in Yemen. Who knows if that's true?""   Granted, the White House official expressed uncertainty about whether the claim was true or not. Still, the exchange amounts to an acknowledgment that the White House was considering the possibility that Abdulmutallab was connected to al-Qaida a full two days before Obama made his statement. That would seem to contradict the notion that Obama wanted his listeners to believe that the Christmas Day bomber was simply an ""isolated extremist.""   Ultimately, Cheney is correct that Obama did use the words ""an isolated extremist"" in his first statement addressing the Christmas Day bombing attempt. But we think it's a stretch for Cheney to say that the phrase signals  the president initially believed that Abdulmutallab had acted alone. Obama did expressly say that ""we do not yet have all the answers,"" and he reported that an investigation had been launched that would hold accountable ""all who were involved."" So we find Cheney is right that Obama used those words, but we find he exaggerates their significance by failing to take into account the other things Obama said. We find Cheney's statement to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809733D7C0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/15/dick-cheney/cheney-says-obama-initially-said-christmas-day-bom/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry says the TEA checks whether undocumented students are applying for permanent residency
","
In 2001, Gov. Rick Perry proudly signed legislation into law allowing illegal immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates.

The law lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify — if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so. As of 2008, 22,697 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates. More than 10,000 were enrolled in fall 2008 — the latest count available.

Tuition varies among Texas public colleges and universities, which make their own tuition policies and set their own rates on top of the base tuition set by statute: $50 per semester credit hour at four-year universities for Texas residents and $327 for non-residents.

Perry, responding to a reporter's question, recently said that the Texas Education Agency verifies that undocumented students are making good on their sworn promise to apply for permanent residency. 
We wondered if that was so.

During the second GOP gubernatorial debate Jan. 29, Len Cannon, KHOU-TV Houston news anchor, asked Perry: ""You pointed out that for illegal immigrants to get the in-state tuition they have to apply for legal residency, correct?"" 
Perry: ""Yes, sir.""

Cannon: ""According to the bill it says you have to promise to apply. Does the state then follow up to verify that the application has been made for residency?""

Perry: ""It is my understanding, yes, sir, absolutely.""

Cannon: ""And what agency?""

Perry: ""TEA.""

Twice, Cannon repeated the question, with the same result. He tried again one more time.

Cannon: ""TEA does that?""

Perry: ""Yes, sir. Texas Education Agency.""

Clearly, Perry believes the TEA follows up on public college students who enroll as illegal immigrants. But is it true?

Not according to Suzanne Marchman, TEA spokeswoman, who said the agency oversees primary and secondary public education.

""The law (at issue) applies to colleges and universities,"" she said of House Bill 1403, the measure Perry signed in June 2001 permitting undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at higher education institutions. ""Our agency doesn't oversee any of that.""

Catherine Frazier, deputy press secretary at the Perry campaign, immediately conceded the governor's misstatement. Frazier said: ""Each university is supposed to follow up on whether undocumented immigrants are pursuing citizenship and report to the (Texas) Higher Education Coordinating Board.""

That so? Not exactly, at least not at the University of Texas at Austin: ""There's no requirement in the law that we follow up on that,"" said Deana Williams, UT's assistant director of admissions.

Williams, a UT admissions official since before the 2001 law took effect, said the coordinating board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, has told the schools to collect undocumented students' affidavits and check their transcripts to confirm that they've lived in Texas for at least the three years required to be eligible for in-state tuition. Williams said UT keeps the affidavits on record indefinitely but it's ""never required to report or check"" whether those students are actively pursuing permanent residency .

Andy Kesling, the coordinating board's director of communications, said the board doesn't follow up with benefiting students at all. Indeed, there's nothing in the statute requiring it to. 
Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, carried the legislation in the Senate that had been authored in the House by then-Rep. Rick Noriega. Van de Putte told us: ""There's nobody checking, but they technically could — there's nothing prohibiting them from checking and there's nothing that mandates them to check.""

And while undocumented students can apply for permanent residency, current immigration laws generally preclude them from obtaining a green card without an employer's sponsorship. The DREAM Act, proposed federal legislation that has several times failed to pass Congress, would allow undocumented students to obtain permanent residency after two years of college or military service.

""It's almost like a Catch-22,"" Van de Putte said. ""There's so many hoops and barriers. Getting the education is just one part.""

For the moment, it appears that no state agency checks up on whether students benefiting from HB 1403 pursue permanent residency. We rate both Perry's claim — and his campaign aide's attempted correction — False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971848C0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/15/rick-perry/perry-says-tea-checks-whether-undocumented-student/

Farouk Shami says state of Texas has killed lots of innocent people
","
At a televised debate Monday, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Farouk Shami said he opposes Texas continuing the death penalty as things stand.

""If we are 110 percent that that person deserved death, I would support it, yes,"" Shami said. ""Not as it currently stands, absolutely not. We have killed lots of innocent people in the state of Texas.""

His declaration prompted us to take a closer look.

The state of Texas hasn’t admitted putting even one innocent person to death.

Still, Shami’s campaign suggested the candidate’s claim was backed up by the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse that has written reports critical of the death penalty. Online, the center lists five individuals executed by the state of Texas from 1989 through 2004 as ""possibly innocent.""

Shami spokeswoman Kelly Johnson said the list justifies Shami’s declaration that the state has put lots of innocent people to death. ""Farouk believes that one innocent man put to death is too many,"" Johnson said. ""Therefore the five listed on the deathpenaltyinfo.org Web site constitute ‘lots.’""

Of course, the center’s description is ""possibly"" innocent—not ""certainly.""

Steve Hall, who helms the StandDown Texas Project, a group that seeks a moratorium on executions in Texas, acknowledged: ""No executed Texas death row inmate has been proved innocent beyond anyone’s doubts.""

Still, Hall told us he believes innocent people have been put to death in Texas. He singled out post-execution investigations by journalists that suggest three men -- Todd Willingham, Carlos DeLuna and Ruben Cantu -- were not guilty of the charges that led to their executions.

News reports have aired questions about the original investigation leading to the conviction of Willingham of murder after a 2001 house fire killed his children. He was executed in 2004 after Gov. Rick Perry did not act on an outside expert’s challenge of the original investigation’s arson findings.

DeLuna was executed in 1989 for killing a convenience store clerk despite claims by his lawyer at trial that authorities had mixed him up with another man (who died in prison in 1999). The other man’s relatives and friends later recalled him boasting about getting away with the murder, according to articles published in The Chicago Tribune in 2006.

Cantu was executed in 1993 for a 1984 murder. News reports later quoted both the only eyewitness at trial and another convict saying Cantu, a juvenile at the time of the crime, was not the perpetrator. In 2005, The Houston Chronicle quoted Bexar County’s district attorney from the time of Cantu’s trial expressing second thoughts.

Sam D. Millsap Jr., who had made the decision to charge Cantu with capital murder, told the Chronicle he never should have sought the death penalty in a case based on the testimony of an eyewitness who identified Cantu only after police officers showed him Cantu's photo three separate times.

""It’s so questionable. There are so many places where it could break down,"" Millsap told the newspaper. ""We have a system that permits people to be convicted based on evidence that could be wrong because it's mistaken or because it’s corrupt.""

It's possible, as Shami said, that Texas has put innocents to death--conceivably ""lots"" of them. Nationally, the death penalty information center writes, ""there is no way to tell how many of the over 1,000 people executed since 1976 may also have been innocent. Courts do not generally entertain claims of innocence when the defendant is dead. Defense attorneys move on to other cases where clients' lives can still be saved.""

But without a state-approved review, perhaps, it’s a reach to say such executions have happened for a certainty.

Shami could have said it’s possible that innocent convicts have been executed or that the topic bears careful study. He asserted much more than that.

We rate his statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973C4240>],/factchecks/2010/feb/14/farouk-shami/farouk-shami-says-state-texas-has-killed-lots-inno/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry says Texas has a surplus in billions
","
Republican Gov. Rick Perry, running for re-election, claims the ""tough conservative decisions"" he’s made during his tenure have been a boon to the state, resulting in surplus revenue.

""Today, we have billions in surplus,"" he says in a TV ad that debuted Monday.

Is that right? Seems like just the other day — as in last month — Republican leaders including Perry asked state agencies to suggest possible budget cuts due to an anticipated revenue shortfall.

Perry’s campaign cites a Nov. 24 report by Texas State Comptroller Susan Combs forecasting the state would have $8.2 billion in its Economic Stabilization Fund by Aug. 31, 2011. The so-called rainy day fund, which voters created in 1988, held $7.6 billion as of Feb. 9.

The fund is fed almost exclusively by oil and natural-gas production taxes; revenue above a certain level is automatically diverted to it. That revenue soared during the past decade, allowing billions to accumulate.

So the state now has billions in reserve.

But a healthy rainy day fund doesn’t always mean there’s a surplus built to last.

Sherri Greenberg, a former Democratic state representative who served on the House Appropriations Committee, said that the excess oil and gas taxes are ""not the same as a surplus"" because they aren’t necessarily ""revenues coming in that exceed what our expenditures are going to be.""

Greenberg, who lectures at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, noted too that it’s not easy to tap the fund. In the 2011 session, Lawmakers will legally be permitted to dip into the fund for any reason by two-thirds' votes of the House and Senate. If they're faced with revenue running short of what's needed to fund the current (2010-11) budget, they can take money from the fund by getting three-fifths' votes of each body. The same reduced threshold applies to tapping the fund if state revenue for the 2012-13 fiscal years is projected to run short of revenue that comes in during 2010-11. Other fiscal decisions take simple majority votes.

Besides, experts expect lawmakers to be facing a revenue shortfall by the time they write the next two-year state budget in 2011. Factors at play include the need to continue covering the costs of a statewide school property tax cut approved in 2006 and the unlikelihood of fresh federal stimulus aid, some of which helped lawmakers balance the budget last year.

John O’Brien, director of the Legislative Budget Board, which advises legislators on budget matters, recently estimated that the current pace of spending will exceed incoming revenue by $11 billion by the time the 2012 fiscal year begins on Sept. 1, 2011.

State sales-tax collections are already running $1 billion behind what Combs projected they would be at this time. 
On Jan. 15, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus instructed state agencies to submit budget-reduction plans by Feb. 15 for the start of next fiscal year.

As they have done in the past, lawmakers could tap the rainy day fund to reconcile the gap. Faced with a similar $10 billion revenue shortfall in 2003, lawmakers also made painful budget and program cuts, including consolidating 12 health and human service agencies into five. 
""The point of the rainy day fund is to have it there in case there’s a need,"" Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. ""Just like we did in 2003, we’ll cut spending and take measures to balance the budget.""

The upshot: Perry’s correct for the moment in that the state has socked away billions in the Economic Stabilization Fund.

But his surplus claim implies Texas is awash in cash — suggesting at least enough to continue government operations.

He knows better. We rate Perry’s statement as Barely True. 
  
Update: The description above of how money can be spent from the so-called rainy day fund reflects a clarification from what we originally posted. In the 2011 session, Lawmakers will legally be permitted to dip into the fund for any reason by two-thirds' votes of the House and Senate. If they're faced with revenue running short of what's needed to fund the current (2010-11) budget, they can take money from the fund by getting three-fifths' votes of each body. The same reduced threshold applies to tapping the fund if state revenue for the 2012-13 fiscal years is projected to run short of revenue that comes in during 2010-11.

Obama claims Bush administration got 190 terrorism convictions in federal court
","As the debate rages over whether Guantanamo detainees ought to be tried in federal court, a lot of numbers are flying around that may appear confusing or conflicting.Often, the numbers are attached to one of two positions: You've got the Obama administration arguing that many of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ought to be tried in federal courts on American soil; while Republicans generally argue that the detainees ought to be treated as enemy combatants and tried in military courts in Guantanamo. The debate has put one statistic front and center: Just how many terrorists have been tried and successfully convicted in federal courts in recent years? It's a more difficult number to track than you might think. Consider these citations: • ""We know that we can prosecute terrorists in our federal courts safely and securely because we have been doing so for years. There are more than 300 convicted international and domestic terrorists currently in Bureau of Prisons custody including those responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the attacks on embassies in Africa."" -- Attorney General Eric Holder before a Senate Judiciary Committee on Nov. 18, 2009. • ""Since the Sept. 11 attacks, and as of Aug. 31, 2006, 288 defendants have been convicted or have pleaded guilty in terrorism or terrorism-related cases arising from investigations conducted primarily after Sept. 11, 2001."" -- a September 2006 Justice Department ""Terror Fact Sheet."" • ""Since 9/11, more than two dozen terrorists and supporters have been convicted in the United States of terrorism-related crimes."" -- ""Fact Sheet"" issued by President George W. Bush on Sept. 10, 2008. And then this from President Barack Obama in a Feb. 7, 2010, pre-Super Bowl interview with Katie Couric, who asked if he had ruled out trying confessed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Muhammad in New York City. ""I have not ruled it out, but I think it's important for us to take into account the practical, logistical issues involved,"" Obama said. ""I mean, if you've got a city that is saying no, and a police department that's saying no, and a mayor that's saying no, that makes it difficult. But I think that the most important thing for the public to understand is we're not handling any of these cases any different than the Bush administration handled them all through 9/11. ""They prosecuted the 190 folks in these Article III (federal) courts,"" Obama said. ""Got convictions. And those folks are in maximum security prisons right now."" So 300, ""two dozen,"" 190. How many Islamic-extremist terrorists have been convicted in federal courts? ""Everyone is cherry-picking their numbers,"" said Karen Greenberg, executive director of New York University's Center on Law and Security, which has compiled a comprehensive study of terrorism-related cases. It depends, for example, if you are talking about domestic and international terrorists; whether terrorism-related cases should include only charges of terrorism or also terrorism-related crimes that might include financing a terrorist organization or immigration fraud; or whether you're talking only about Islamic jihadist terrorists. In other words, there are a lot of ways to slice the numbers. For the purposes of this fact-check, we are specifically looking at Obama's statement. And while there are several organizations that track terrorism cases, administration officials said Obama got his 190 figure from a report by Human Rights First, a nonpartisan international human rights organization based in New York and Washington, D.C. The report, issued in July 2009, analyzes ""criminal cases arising from terrorism that is associated — organizationally, financially, or ideologically — with self-described 'jihadist' or Islamic-extremist groups like al-Qaida"" and concludes that 195 people who fit that description have been convicted in federal courts since 9/11. The report concludes that ""federal courts, while not perfect, are a fit and flexible resource that should be used along with other government resources — including military force, intelligence gathering, diplomatic efforts and cultural and economic initiatives — as an important part of a multipronged counter-terrorism strategy."" That figure of 195 jihadist terrorism convictions has been vociferously challenged as overinflated — particularly when compared to Guantanamo detainees — by Dana M. Perino, a former press secretary to President George W. Bush, and Bill Burck, a former federal prosecutor and deputy counsel to President Bush. It has also been picked apart in a series of stories from Andrew McCarthy of National Review. The Human Rights First report explains that it includes ""prosecutions that seek criminal sanctions for acts of terrorism, attempts or conspiracies to commit terrorism, or providing aid and support to those engaged in terrorism. We have also sought to identify and include prosecutions intended to disrupt and deter terrorism through other means, for example, through charges under 'alternative' statutes such as false statements, financial fraud and immigration fraud."" Those kinds of parameters, McCarthy notes, take in a lot of cases that aren't international terrorists, but often are would-be terrorists who have, for example, been convicted of relatively minor offenses such as immigration fraud or giving false information to federal authorities, or who have helped to finance a terrorist organization. Those may be important prosecutions in combating terrorism, but they aren't on the order of Guantanamo detainees. Human Rights First isn't the only group tracking terrorism cases. New York University's Center on Law and Security has been tracking such cases for years and throws a wide net. In its ""Terrorist Trial Report Card: September 11, 2001-September 11, 2009,"" it finds that the Department of Justice has indicted 828 defendants on terrorism-related charges. Of the 593 that have been resolved, 523 were convicted on some charge either at trial or by plea. Terrorism-related can be a broad definition, though, and can include immigration violations, giving false statements and other relatively minor charges. And so the report breaks out cases in which defendants are charged under core terrorism or national security statutes. Those are bona fide, serious charges. Now you're talking about 174 people convicted under those statutes; plus another 24 charged with those statutes, but convicted on lesser crimes. That also gets to the president's figure. But it's misleading for Obama to cite that 190 number as if the cases are equivalent to those faced by Guantanamo detainees, said Greenberg, editor of the report. There are probably less than a dozen cases against people in the Islamic jihadist framework who have been convicted in federal court of serious terrorism-related crimes comparable to many of the Guantanamo detainees, Greenberg said. Nonetheless, there are some, she said, including Richard Reid, the ""shoe bomber""; Bryant Neal Vinas, an American convicted of supporting al-Qaida plots in Afghanistan and the United States; Mohammed Jabarah, a Canadian who was active in al-Qaida and convicted of terrorism-related offenses; Shahawar Matin Siraj, a Pakistani-American who plotted to bomb Herald Square in New York; and Mohammed Junaid Babar, a Pakistani-American convicted of terrorist-related offenses in New York, and who testified in 2006 against a group of men accused of plotting bomb attacks in London. These cases, although far fewer than those cited by Obama, provide powerful evidence that federal courts can appropriately handle many cases involving Guantanamo detainees, Greenberg said. ""The trend lines demonstrate convincingly that federal courts are capable of trying alleged terrorists and securing high rates of conviction,"" Greenberg wrote in the report. ""Federal prosecution has demonstrably become a powerful tool in many hundreds of cases, not only for incapacitating terrorists but also for intelligence gathering. Much of the government’s knowledge of terrorist groups has come from testimony and evidence produced in grand jury investigations, including information provided by cooperators, and in the resulting trials."" In summary, Obama cited a legitimate figure for terrorism-related convictions in federal court. And we note that Bush administration officials cited even bigger numbers in some of their reports at the time. But when Obama cites this number in the same breath as Guantanamo detainees, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. We agree with Greenberg that only a fraction of those 190 cases cited by Obama could rightly be equated to the Guantanamo detainees. And while even that much smaller number might provide a powerful argument for Obama, that's not the number he used. And so we rate his statement Barely True. Update, Feb. 18, 2010: This story was updated, removing an inaccurately paraphrased quote attributed to Karen Greenberg. The Center on Law and Security report is comprised of mostly Islamic terrorism cases, but includes other groups as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a group of Marxist guerrillas. The Human Rights First report  focuses specifically on radical Islamic or Jihadist terrorist organizations.",[<zip object at 0x000002809719CC80>],/factchecks/2010/feb/13/barack-obama/obama-claims-bush-administration-got-190-terrorism/

Shami says poll workers request voters' driver's licenses to verify citizenship
","
Houston businessman Farouk Shami and former Houston mayor Bill White, both running for governor, politely sparred during the Democratic primary debate Monday but they agreed on at least one thing: A proposed law requiring voters to show a photo ID at the voting booth was a bad idea. 
Last May, House Democrats in the Texas Legislature effectively killed a Republican-backed bill that would have required voters to show photo ID — or two alternative kinds of non-photo identification, such as a utility bill — at the polls.

Shami said he was opposed to the bill because he thinks current ID requirements are sufficient.

Shami said: ""When we go to vote, they ask for driver's license and verify that you are a voter and a citizen in the state of Texas. So, I support what we have right now.""

Is that what we have right now?

According to Vince Leibowitz, Shami's campaign director and senior strategist, Shami was ""probably talking about"" Harris County, ""where the clerk's office was requesting driver's licenses for people to vote.""

Some background: Harris County started using a computerized system in 2008 where poll workers swiped driver's licenses in lieu of checking voter registration cards during the early voting period.

But Hector DeLeon, director of communications at the Harris County Clerk's office, said voters aren't required to show their licenses, nor does the clerk's office push one type of document over the other.

The program, designed to expedite the voting process for voters who want to use an ID or license instead of their voter registration card, is ""just an option when people show up,"" he said. ""A good number of people show up with their license.""

According to state law, voters are not required to show a photo ID during early voting or on election day. If you don't have your voter card but your registration is still current, you are required to sign an affidavit at the polls and provide one of seven documents — including a driver's license, a current utility bill, a bank statement or paycheck — that shows your name and address.

You can register to vote if you don't have a driver's license or a Social Security number, but you'll be flagged on the official voter registration list with an ""ID"" annotation, which cues poll workers to request another form of ID in addition to your voter card.

So state law doesn't require voters to show a driver's license, but do poll workers still ask for it?

Apparently, not in Harris County. ""When somebody shows up to vote, nobody asks for this first or this second,"" DeLeon said. He said the Harris County Clerk's office trains poll workers in what documents are acceptable.

Maybe somebody should tell the Secretary of State's election division. When we called that office, a representative told us (incorrectly) that we need a photo ID to vote — even if we have a voter registration card. She also said a driver's license is preferred.

Shami is correct that poll workers verify that voters are registered — and voters can use a driver's license as a substitute for their registration card. But state law doesn't require poll workers to ask voters for their license, and voters can use other forms of ID to cast their ballots.

We rate Shami's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1A9680>],/factchecks/2010/feb/12/farouk-shami/shami-says-poll-workers-request-voters-drivers-lic/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'John Boehner']","
Boehner says unemployment will stay at 10 percent this year
","Soon after the White House released the ""Economic Report of the President"" on Feb. 11, 2010, Republicans derided its boast that the massive economic stimulus championed by President Barack Obama may in time be viewed as ""one of the great triumphs of timely, effective countercyclical macroeconomic policy.""""Washington Democrats still don’t get it,"" House Republican Leader John Boehner wrote in a press release. ""Two days after the president brushed off Republicans' concerns that Democrats' job-killing policies are causing great uncertainty for small businesses, the White House is now declaring in a new report that the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' will be one of history’s 'great triumphs.' The very same report, however, notes that unemployment will average 10 percent for the rest of the year. The Obama administration promised the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' would create jobs 'immediately' and keep joblessness below 8 percent.""The report does, in fact, project that the unemployment rate will hover at about 10 percent through this year. With many press accounts of the economic report highlighting the forecast that job gains for 2010 will average 95,000 a month, those two facts may seem at odds. They are not.""A certain number of jobs need to be created every month simply to hold the unemployment rate stable,"" said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ""That's because the working-age population is growing.""In addition, as the job market improves -- or is even  perceived as improving -- some people who had given up on looking for work may get back in the game and be added to the unemployed ranks. So there would have to be about 100,000 jobs added a month just for the unemployment rate to tread water.Even still, the report says, there's evidence the labor market is stabilizing.That's because the economy shed 691,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2009, 428,000 in the second quarter, 199,000 in the third, and 69,000 in the fourth. So to have the number of jobs increasing even moderately is an improvement.But Boehner's statement includes an assumption masquerading as a fact: It's that the stimulus has failed if unemployment rates remain at 10 percent through the year. While Boehner and other Republicans have long cited rising unemployment as proof that the stimulus hasn't created jobs, many reputable and independent economists say it has, and that the unemployment rate would be even worse without it. The ""Economic Report of the President"" estimates the stimulus has already saved or created 1.5 million to 2 million jobs, and is on track to save 3.5 million by the end of this year. We gave President Obama a Half True when he claimed in his State of the Union address that the stimulus has already saved or created 2 million jobs, because that was on the high side of projections from his Council of Economic Advisers, the independent Congressional Budget Office and several other reputable economic forecasters. But we should note all of those forecasters put the number north of 1 million jobs.In other words, just because the unemployment rate may stay at a whopping 10 percent, ""doesn't mean that the stimulus didn't prevent an even worse catastrophe,"" Burtless said.As for the last bit of Boehner's statement, we gave a Barely True to House Republican Whip Eric Cantor and other Republicans who have continued to claim that Obama promised the stimulus would keep unemployment rates below 8 percent. That was a forecast based on where the unemployment rate was expected to go without a stimulus. That forecast was in line with other independent forecasts at the time, but proved overly optimistic, as Christina Romer, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged again in a press conference on Feb. 11, 2010.So Boehner is correct that the president's economic report forecasts the unemployment rate will remain at 10 percent through this year (even as jobs are added). But again, when Boehner cites that statistic as proof that the stimulus is having no immediate effect on jobless rates as promised, it ignores the possibility that if not for the stimulus the unemployment rate might be even worse. Many economic forecasters believe that's exactly the case. Still, projections about the number of jobs saved or created by the stimulus are just that, projections. And many economists believe it is still way too early to measure its effectiveness. But we think it's misleading to simply point to a stagnant unemployment rate as proof that the stimulus isn't working. And so we rate Boehner's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974E4140>],/factchecks/2010/feb/12/john-boehner/boehner-says-stimulus-no-triumph-if-unemployment-s/

Hutchison says public money paid for Perry's Vegas trip
","
An unlikely voice has been injected into the political struggle over the Republican gubernatorial nomination: Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas.
 
The pop/hip-hop singer’s ""Glamorous"" serves as the soundtrack for dueling videos from the Perry and Hutchison campaigns, each accusing the other of expensive travel habits.

We dealt with Gov. Rick Perry's video in a previous PolitiFact Texas item; now comes Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's video portraying the governor’s travel expenditures as contributing to ""a life of luxury."" 
The Web ad includes at least five claims about Perry's travel history. The one that immediately grabbed our attention was: ""Taxpayers even footed the bill for Perry’s trip to a bachelor party in Las Vegas.""

Did the governor experience Sin City on the taxpayers’ dime?
 
To support the statement in the video, the Hutchison campaign referred us to a Dallas Morning News item about a visit that Perry paid to Las Vegas in October. The Perry campaign confirmed that the governor made the trip to meet with a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Nevada and to attend a bachelor party dinner for his son, Griffin. But it disputes the Hutchison claim that taxpayers paid Perry's bills.

According to Perry’s office, the governor can use state funds to pay for state travel. The Nevada journey did not fit that bill, however, and Perry paid for it with a mix of campaign donations and money from the Republican Governors Association.

Mark Miner, a spokesman for Perry, said the governor arrived in Las Vegas on Oct. 24. He ate lunch with gubernatorial hopeful Brian Sandoval, had dinner with his son and others at the Venetian resort and casino, and then spent the night there.

Miner said that the governors group paid for the lunch and the hotel room but that he did not know what they cost. He also said he didn't know who paid for the dinner.

It appears that the Perry campaign paid for the commercial flight that the governor took to Las Vegas. A campaign finance report filed last month said Perry took a Southwest Airlines flight to Las Vegas on Oct. 24 and showed a $137.60 payment to the airline on the same date.

But the fact that others paid for Perry's flight, hotel and meals doesn't mean that public funds weren't spent. Taxpayers pick up the tab for the security detail that accompanies the governor when he travels. And according to the Department of Public Safety, which staffs the detail, the Las Vegas trip cost taxpayers $12,321. That includes overtime, car rentals, hotel, airfare and meals. 
And so, there is an element of truth to Hutchison's statement. Taxpayers paid a large portion of the cost of the governor’s trip to Las Vegas — the security detail that always travels with him. And while there, Perry attended a dinner for his son.

But Hutchison's statement in the video suggests that state money paid for Perry's personal travel and that his sole purpose of visiting Sin City was to party — neither of which is accurate. We rate Hutchison's claim as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3AF800>],/factchecks/2010/feb/11/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-public-money-paid-vegas-trip/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Pundits', 'Glenn Beck']","
Beck claims Obama has outspent even Franklin Roosevelt as a percent of GDP
","In the Feb. 8, 2010, edition of Fox News Channel's Glenn Beck Program, host Glenn Beck compared two Democratic presidents -- Franklin D. Roosevelt and Barack Obama -- on how much they spent on the federal government.
 
""When you look back in history, who do you think of when I say huge government programs?"" Beck told viewers. ""Hey, I know, how about FDR? Let me show you FDR spending compared to our GDP. Here's what FDR did. You see 10.7 [percent], 1934, OK? That's when FDR first said, 'Hey, we got to change everything because Hoover, he is stunk on ice.' The lowest was 7.7. The highest, if you see, in 1941, you might remember that date because it's supposed to live in infamy. 1941, 12 percent of GDP. Got it? ""All right. Now, let me take a look at President Obama's spending. This is what Obama is planning on spending. Whoa! Remember -- highest, 1941, was 12 percent. Here's the lowest at 22.8 percent."" We thought we'd check the comparison. We located the federal statistical table from which Beck appears to have taken his numbers. It's a historical table in the president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2011, which was released in early February. Specifically, it's ""Table 1.2 -- Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930–2015."" We can quickly confirm Beck's figures for Obama. Between 2009 and 2015, the percentage of GDP accounted for by federal spending (that is, the figures in the column ""total outlays"") is expected to hover between a maximum of 25.4 percent (for 2010) and minimum of 22.8 percent (for 2013). The only caveat is that the figures for 2010 through 2015 are projections. However, the projections from the president's budget are widely considered credible, so we have no quibble with them. The statistics in the table also jibe with many of Beck's numbers, including the 12 percent of GDP that Beck said FDR spent on the federal government in 1941. But take note: A viewer looking at Beck's chart on TV would see Roosevelt's numbers running from 1934 to 1941. If that was the extent of Roosevelt's presidency, Beck would be absoutely correct about his spending pattern. But contrary to the chart Beck showed viewers, Roosevelt served in the White House until his death in 1945. And the figures for 1942 to 1945 pose a problem for Beck's theory that Obama is spending more, proportionately, than Roosevelt did. Between 1941 and 1942, Roosevelt doubled what the federal government spent, reaching 24.3 percent of GDP for 1942. And it didn't stop there. For both 1943 and 1944, federal spending represented 43.6 percent of GDP. And for 1945 (a year when both Roosevelt and Harry Truman served as president) it was 41.9 percent. There's an obvious caveat: The United States' involvement in World War II began on Dec. 7, 1941, so the big rise in government spending primarily had to do with the costs of fighting a two-front world war. Still, we see problems with Beck's approach. First, Beck doesn't note for the viewer that he's only using pre-World War II statistics -- much less justify that decision. He simply shows a chart covering eight of the 12 years FDR spent in the White House. Second, while there's an argument to be made for excluding the years of World War II -- it was a singular, and singularly expensive, federal undertaking -- the contrast between Roosevelt's situation and Obama's is not black-and-white. Obama, too, is a wartime president, winding down a war in Iraq and expanding one in Afghanistan. There are additional reasons to be skeptical of a comparison of spending under Roosevelt and Obama. For instance, while the government has expanded greatly since Roosevelt's time, much of the increase has come from entitlements like Social Security, a program that was established under Roosevelt and has been driven more by demographics than individual presidents' policy choices. In fact, under conservative icon Ronald Reagan, federal outlays as a percentage of GDP ranged between 21.3 percent and 23.5 percent -- in the same ballpark as the rates projected for Obama's presidency. Also, Dean Baker, a liberal economist who co-directs the Center for Economic and Policy Research, noted that Roosevelt increased government's share of the economy at a much faster rate than Obama has. When Herbert Hoover was president in 1930 -- three budgets before Roosevelt's first -- the federal share of GDP was 3.4 percent. By 1934 -- when Roosevelt assembled his second budget in the midst of the Great Depression -- it had risen to 10.7 percent, or more than triple its level just four years earlier. By contrast, the equivalent comparison between President George W. Bush and Obama is much more modest. In 2006, under Bush, the federal government share of GDP was 20.1 percent. In Obama's second year, 2010, it's projected to be 25.4 percent, an increase of about one-quarter -- far smaller than the change under Roosevelt. ""The rate of change matters,"" Baker said. ""Imagine [the reaction if] Obama took the government to 40 percent of GDP"" or beyond. So there are a number of problems with Beck's comparison. But let's look again at what he said -- that federal spending under FDR peaked at 12 percent of GDP and under Obama it is projected to not drop below 22.8 percent. On Obama, he is correct. But Beck undermines his claim on FDR by his too-convenient framing of the statistics. If he had been transparent about excluding the World War II years, we might have given him the benefit of the doubt. Instead, he pulled a fast one on viewers. Beck's end date excluded rates of federal spending that were twice as high as what Obama is on pace to spend. So we rate his statement Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096947FC0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/11/glenn-beck/beck-claims-obama-has-outspent-even-franklin-roose/

E-mail claims 'In God We Trust' removed from dollar coins
","We're constantly reminded that falsehoods continue to ricochet around the Web long after they've been discredited. The latest example comes from a chain e-mail claiming that newly released dollar coins do not contain the words ""In God We Trust"". The e-mail has the standard ingredients of an Internet falsehood -- sloppy punctuation, an abundance of exclamation points, a plausible story (""I received one from the Post Office as change and I asked for a dollar bill instead""), a request to spread the e-mail far and wide (""Please send to all on your mailing list!!!"") and screaming capital letters (""'IN GOD WE TRUST' IS GONE!!!"") .The people forwarding the e-mail included some snarky comments such as ""Don't know anything about this, but it does not surprise me. Typical of todays (sic) government.""A simple Google search reveals the e-mail was debunked long ago by our friends at FactCheck.org and Snopes, a Web site dedicated to investigating Internet rumors. Judging from the comments in the latest e-mail, it appears that the bogus claim has been rekindled since President Barack Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009. So we'll add our voice to the debunkers.The ""new"" dollars actually aren't that new. The U.S. Mint says dollar coins have been minted intermittently since 1794, and there are three in production: the presidential series, the Sacagawea Golden Dollar, and the Native American dollar. The Sacagawea Golden Dollar was first issued in 2000; the presidential series began in 2007, and the Native American coin, which features Sacagawea on the front, was released in 2009. The chain e-mail includes a picture of a hand holding a dollar coin with a picture of President George Washington, so we'll begin with that series. Each year the U.S. Mint releases new coins to honor four U.S. presidents in the order that they served. (For 2010, Presidents Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan and Lincoln are featured.) The law that authorized the coins called for the U.S. president to be on the front, the Statue of Liberty on the back, and, on the edge of the coin, the year of minting and the inscriptions ""E Pluribus Unum"" and ""In God We Trust."" The law changed in 2007 and specified that ""In God We Trust"" appear on the front of the coin (the ""heads"" side) rather than the edge. That took effect with coins minted in 2009, starting with the release of the coin honoring President William Harrison. The U.S. Mint Web site says all of the subsequent coins will follow this design. We should note, that it is possible -- though extremely rare -- to find one of the original 2007 coins without the ""In God We Trust"" side inscription. According to a 2007 Associated Press story, due to what the U.S. Mint called complications in the quality control process, ""an unknown number"" of new George Washington dollar coins were mistakenly produced without their edge inscriptions, including “In God We Trust."" In a March 2007 press release, the U.S. Mint wrote that these coins were released inadvertently, and that it ""understands the importance of the inscriptions 'In God We Trust' and 'E Pluribus Unum,' as well as the mint mark and year on U.S. coinage. An expert who follows coin collecting estimated more than 50,000 coins were mistakenly minted that way. But that is of 300 million of the coins produced by 2007.""In God We Trust"" also appears on the front of the Native American and Sacagawea dollars. Since 2009, all of the coins in the presidential series have had ""In God We Trust"" inscribed on the front. The e-mail was as wrong in 2007 (except for those rare coins mistakenly minted with no inscriptions), and it is wrong in 2010. You can see ""In God We Trust"" on the presidential, Sacagawea and American Indian dollars.

O'Reilly claims poll shows that Fox News is the most trusted news operation
","Jon Stewart's first appearance on the O'Reilly Factor since 2004 was a mostly civil affair, with the most heated moments coming when the discussion turned to Fox News.

Stewart, the host of the Daily Show who has been highly critical of partisan boostering on Fox News, told host Bill O'Reilly that Fox News is a ""narrative-driven media arm"" of the Republican Party.

""Here's what Fox has done,"" Stewart said. ""Through their cyclonic perpetual emotion machine -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- they've taken reasonable concerns about the president and this economy and turned it into a full-fledged panic attack about the next coming of Chairman Mao.""

O'Reilly said that was the narrative of two other Fox News hosts, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck. When asked by Stewart if he really thought Fox News was nonpartisan, fair and balanced, O'Reilly said its hard news operation is, and that some of the other programs -- like his -- are opinion programs.

And O'Reilly cited a poll to back up his point, ""Are you shocked that a Democratic poll operation shows that Fox News is the most trusted news operations in the country. Forty-nine percent of Americans trust Fox News. Are you stunned?""

It's a poll that Fox News executives are apparently quite proud of. Fox recently took out full-page ads in both the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal in which they took a poke at the slogan of competitor CNN with an ad that boasted, ""The Most Trusted Name in News. More Americans Trust Fox News Than Any Other News Network.""

It's a survey conducted by Public Policy Polling. And as for O'Reilly's characterization of it as a Democratic poll operation, Public Polling Policy president Dean Debnam said that when it comes to polling work for political parties, the company deals exclusively with Democratic clients.

The national poll asked 1,151 registered voters on Jan. 18 and 19, 2010, whether they trust each of the major television news operations in the country. And Fox came out with the highest percentage who said yes -- 49 percent.

Here's how it broke down: Fox News (49 percent trust; 37 percent do not); followed by CNN (39 percent trust; 41 percent do not); NBC (35 percent trust; 44 percent do not); CBS News (32 percent trust; 46 percent do not); and ABC News (31 percent trust; 46 percent do not).

But as with so many polls, there's lots of ways to slice numbers when you examine specific groups.

For example, you could accurately say that among self-described moderates, Fox is also the least trusted network.

It probably would be more accurate to say that Fox News is overwhelmingly trusted by Republicans. Together, Democrats and independents trust other networks more than Fox.

Digging down into the numbers, there was a wide split along party lines. Some 74 percent of Republicans said they trusted Fox compared to just 30 percent of Democrats.

All of the major broadcast networks, and CNN, have the majority trust of Democrats; but the major networks are all trusted by less than 20 percent of Republicans (and only 23 percent of Republicans said they trusted CNN).

""A generation ago you would have expected Americans to place their trust in the most neutral and unbiased conveyors of news,"" Debnam said in a press release accompanying the poll results. ""But the media landscape has really changed and now they’re turning more toward the outlets that tell them what they want to hear.""

We spoke to Debnam and he said it's fair to say -- based on the poll -- that ""more people trust Fox news than trust anyone else.""

But he said that the numbers are propped up by strong Republican support.

""Republicans trust Fox News by an astoundingly large percentage,"" Debnam said.

In a blog posting that blasted the poll, Gary Langer, the director of polling at ABC News, argued the results were skewed because Republicans were overrepresented in the poll and young people were underrepresented. He further cited an October 2009 Pew poll that found more people believe Fox has an ideological slant than other networks.

But the question wasn't whether Fox or any other news channel has an ideological bent. It's whom you trusted. You could think Fox has a conservative slant and still trust it.

Langer points to another poll that runs counter to the one cited by O'Reilly. Performed in August 2008 by the Pew Research Center, respondents were asked to rate news sources on a scale from 1 to 4 (with 1 being ""believe almost nothing"" to 4 being ""believe all or most""). In that survey, Fox got fewer 3s and 4s than CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS. But we note that the poll is more than a year and a half old.

We also found one in November 2008, a Zogby poll commissioned by the Independent Film Channel which asked people to name the one network they trusted the most. Fox News came out on top with 39 percent; followed by CNN with 16 percent; MSNBC with 15 percent; and PBS with 10 percent. The major networks were each cited by less than 7 percent of respondents. But this survey only allowed people to pick just one choice. You couldn't say you trusted Network A and Network B. So that may simply mean that conservatives agree on Fox, but liberals split their votes among a number of networks.

And one last one, we swear. A September 2009 survey by the Sacred Heart University Polling Institute found that Fox was named most frequently as the television news organization most trusted for accurate reporting. It broke down Fox News (30.0 percent), CNN (19.5 percent), NBC News (7.5 percent) and ABC News (7.5 percent). Fox News was also most frequently cited as the least trusted television news organization.

What to make of all this?

In a Time blog posting, James Poniewozik wrote this about the poll cited by O'Reilly: ""I think what we're seeing here is that Fox viewers are more likely to believe that all news outlets are biased — and either they don't mind it, or they at least accept that such is the way of the world. And they either simply prefer to watch a channel they see as being biased in their direction, or they believe it is a necessary counterbalance to the (unacknowledged) liberal bias of all other TV news, or they believe other channels are hypocrites for denying being biased, or all of the above. Whereas the rest of the news audience either still sees neutrality as possible, or at least still values it as an ideal.""

Which brings us back to O'Reilly's statement. You may argue that Fox comes out on top because Republicans and conservatives really trust Fox while Democrats and liberals generally trust CNN and the major networks, but not as much as conservatives trust Fox. That's true. But O'Reilly said a Democratic poll operation showed that Fox News is the most trusted news operation in the country. And that's what it found. We rule his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B281C0>],/factchecks/2010/feb/10/bill-oreilly/oreilly-claims-poll-shows-fox-news-most-trusted-ne/

Congressman pitches new plan for transportation funding
","A Georgia congressman says there’s one major roadblock to states having more money to fund transportation projects: Uncle Sam. U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican from North Georgia, believes some federal regulations are driving up the costs of transportation here and across the nation. One part of his argument put PolitiFact Georgia on the road in search of whether his complaint is true. Georgia, like most states, is a ""donor"" state when it comes to federal transportation funding, the congressman said. ""They spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back,"" Graves said in his speech, explaining his definition of donor states. Graves says Georgians pay more money in gas taxes than the state receives from the federal government for transportation projects once you figure in  the ""red tape"" from two key federal regulations that have an impact on road construction costs. In the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2012, records show Georgia paid nearly $1.2 billion into the Federal Highway Trust Fund Highway Account and received nearly $1.27 billion from the fund. That would appear to put Georgia in the plus category. But Graves says the irksome regulations of the Davis-Bacon Act and the National Environmental Policy Act add huge costs for the state. Those costs turn the positive into a negative, he said, moving Georgia into the donor category.   Graves and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, have put together a solution they call the Transportation Empowerment Act. It would gives states greater authority to determine transportation needs. The legislation would also lower the federal gas tax over the next five years from 18.4 cents per gallon to 3.7 cents per gallon. The states, then, could make up the difference in any way they like — replace the gas tax, put in toll roads, create a new consumption tax such as T-SPLOST. The federal highway act is up for reauthorization this year, and the two lawmakers hope to race past competing plans with their proposal and get enough votes for adoption. Graves said in a recent speech that Georgia is projected to get an 84 percent rate of return this budget year for transportation projects because of these policies. John Donnelly, a spokesman for the congressman, said Graves’ 84 percent estimate is conservative. ""It is important to note that our calculation is actually generous because it includes the general fund subsidies as well. If we simply calculated the rate of return without a subsidy in play (i.e. gas taxes paid in vs. transportation spending attributable to gas taxes going back to Georgia), we'd be closer to 70 percent. If we then accounted for red tape in that calculation, we'd be closer to 56 percent,"" Donnelly said. So are the Davis-Bacon Act and NEPA a drain on federally funded transportation projects? The Davis-Bacon Act has long been a source of angst amongst conservatives and some business groups. It requires contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics working on nearly all federally funded projects at least the locally prevailing wages. It was created in 1931 to prevent employers from hiring cheaper labor during the Great Depression, and it has been amended several times. The wages are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. A team of four researchers from Suffolk University looked at the impact of the Davis-Bacon Act. In 2008, they released a study that found it costs U.S. taxpayers an additional $8.6 billion annually and adds 9.9 percent to construction costs. The study found federal officials calculated the prevailing wages by using numbers ""dictated"" from construction unions that are ""biased upwards."" ""Union workers earn a median weekly income of $833, compared to $642 for nonunion workers. The practice of basing the prevailing wage on a small minority of workers who have, on average, weekly earnings that are almost 30 percent higher than other workers guarantees that the reported wage is anything but the prevailing wage,"" the study found. U.S. Labor Department officials have said independent studies show the Davis-Bacon Act does not increase government contracting costs. ""The prevailing wage reflects the wage paid to construction workers in the local area — union or non-union. Moreover, Davis-Bacon Act designation does not inherently increase government contracting costs, as shown by a number of independent studies,"" Nancy Leppink, who was head of the Wage and Hour Division for the United States Department of Labor, wrote in a blog post in 2011. Our inquiries to the Labor Department were directed to an official who did not respond to telephone calls and emails for comment. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2012 report that wages for highway and heavy construction projects under the Davis-Bacon Act were higher than federal employment statistics about 60 percent of the time. The report did not calculate the difference. The report did note that the salary gap between union and non-union workers has decreased in recent years. It also noted the percentage of union workers in construction had decreased between 2000 and 2008. The CRS also noted another point: Federal projects may require workers to have more advanced skills. Thus, they may earn higher salaries. The National Environmental Policy Act, which became federal law in 1969, requires an environmental review for all highway and construction projects under the purview of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Critics say NEPA slows construction, raising project costs. Graves’ office sent us a 1997 report by researchers at North Carolina State University who found NEPA increased construction costs by 9 percent. Federal officials found several problems with the report. First, they said only 19 of 50 state transportation departments responded to it. Second, of the states that replied, the additional costs were less than the 10 percent. We also wondered whether the study, more than 16 years old, was too old to be considered for serious discussion. Graves’ camp followed up by sending us a 2006 Federal Highway Administration report that environmental costs for some construction projects averaged 4 percent and averaged 8 percent in some case studies. Our conclusion: Again, Graves says Georgia spends more in gas taxes and red tape than it gets back from the federal government. He says wage and environmental regulations add huge costs for the state. And studies show he has an interesting argument. Do these regulations result in Georgia getting a net result of less money back than it collects from gas taxes? It could be, but there’s no definitive data that show what the specific impact is in Georgia. Until we see some research specific to Georgia, we believe Graves’ claim requires some caution. With these caveats, we rate the Graves' claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0CB380>],/factchecks/2014/mar/07/tom-graves/congressman-pitches-new-plan-transportation-fundin/

Rick Scott touts 'record funding' for environmental protection in State of the State speech
","So we know Gov. Rick Scott likes to portray himself as the jobs-promoter-in-chief but what about tree-hugger-in-chief? During his fourth State of the state speech March 4, Scott began by reeling off a list of recent accomplishments. ""A lot has happened since I spoke to you last year. I can talk about how our unemployment rate is now down to 6.3 percent. How our crime rate is at a 42-year low. How we have invested record funding in protecting our environment....."" Some of those numbers sounded familiar to us. But we hadn’t heard Scott’s claim that during his tenure we have invested record funding to protect the environment, so we decided to fact-check that claim. Funding to restore springs We asked Scott’s spokesman to provide us with documentation to support his claim that during his tenure Florida had invested record funding on environmental protection. Spokesman John Tupps told PolitiFact Florida in an email that Scott was referring to his proposed budget that includes a ""record $55 million"" to protect and restore springs -- ""building upon last year’s investment of more than $37 million."" Funding for springs is only a subset of funding for environmental protection, but we’ll look at the status of springs funding first. As of early March, the Legislature hadn’t voted on the amount for springs protection. It’s possible the Legislature will set an even higher amount: A coalition of Senate committee chairs drafted a bill to raise $400 million for springs from documentary stamp taxes on real estate transactions. The state has more than 1,000 freshwater springs, and many are suffering from nitrate pollution that fuels the growth of toxic algae blooms. Geologists have found an increase in saltiness in a few freshwater springs, which could signal future problems with the state's drinking supply, the Tampa Bay Times reported. In 2013, the state asked water management districts for a list of projects essential to springs restoration and received a list of about $122 million. The Legislature set aside $10 million, but the total climbed to $37 million, once other sources including local government money was included. ""If the Legislature passes Gov. Scott’s $55 million springs recommendation it will be a record level of spending for Florida’s springs,"" Eric Draper, Executive Director Audubon Florida, told PolitiFact Florida. Annual DEP funding Though Scott’s spokesman said he was referring to money proposed for springs protection, his claim was more broadly about the environment, so we asked the Department of Environmental Protection, called DEP, for the bottom-line budget total for each year during Scott’s tenure. We found similar figures back to 2004, during the tenure of his predecessors, Govs. Charlie Crist Jeb Bush. Here is the bottom line total each year: 2004-05: $2.1 billion 2005-06: $2 billion 2006-07: $2.9 billion 2007-08: $2.4 billion 2008-09: $2 billion 2009-10: $1.3 billion 2010-11: $1.4 billion 2011-12: $1.8 billion 2012-13: $1.4 billion 2013-14: $1.3 billion These numbers come with some caveats: they are appropriation numbers, not actual expenditures, and they combine state and federal dollars. In several of those years, the numbers included debt service payments of more than $400 million. It’s no surprise that the dollar amounts were higher in flush financial times under Bush and part of Crist’s term and then plummeted along with the economy in the second half of Crist’s tenure and Scott’s tenure. We have seen the same pattern for other state spending priorities. Spokespersons for DEP and Scott also cited other environmental projects Scott has supported -- including an $880 million water quality plan to provide clean water to the Everglades. Facing the prospect of court-ordered cleanup, in 2012 the state reached a settlement with the federal government to end a long-standing dispute about Everglades cleanup. All of the $880 million won’t be spent this year; it is a 13-year agreement. For this year, Scott proposed $130 million for Everglades, which includes part of that $880 million, as well as other state and water management district sources. ""Scott has skillfully negotiated the Everglades deal with EPA, which gives him a talking point of boosting environmental programs in Florida,"" said Jerry Phillips, a DEP attorney in the 1990s who is now an environmental watchdog. ""But the reality is that Bush and Crist had been negotiating with EPA for years as well, on issues such as the Everglades."" Environmental cuts The total DEP budget doesn’t tell the full story because other agencies also do work that relates to protecting the environment. We interviewed several environmentalists who pointed to Scott’s lack of investment in protecting the environment. We will cite some of their examples: • In 2011 Scott and the Legislature abolished the Department of Community Affairs, which for decades reviewed development plans in cities and counties. • In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections. The South Florida Water Management District’s total budget dropped from about $1 billion in 2011 to $622 million in 2014. Water management districts handle planning for water resources and wetlands protection, among other environmental issues. • In December 2012, DEP laid off 58 employees. • The number of enforcement cases handled by DEP has dropped dramatically, from 2,289 in 2010 (Crist’s final year) to 799 in 2012, the Tampa Bay Times reported. As of the end of May, only 145 new cases had been filed. • For many years the Legislature invested $300 million a year in Florida Forever, a program to buy land with money from a tax on real estate transactions. During the economic downturn, the Legislature pulled back. In 2010, Crist’s final year, the program received $15 million. In 2011, Scott proposed zeroing out Florida Forever (it ultimately got $744,000), and then in 2012 he signed a budget that included about $8 million. In 2013, lawmakers approved $20 million and directed the state to sell off $50 million worth of land to generate additional dollars. In March, DEP scrapped the program without selling an acre. Scott has proposed $70 million for next year -- that includes $40 million from the sale of non-conservation lands. Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida, said Scott’s claim is ""disconcerting"" because of the various cuts. ""You have to take all that into account when you run budget numbers,"" he said. ""It sounds to me like Scott’s people are coming up with their own selective set of budget figures. ... He doesn’t have environmental creds as far as I am concerned."" Our ruling During his State of the State speech Scott said, ""We have invested record funding in protecting our environment."" After the speech, a Scott spokesman said he was referring to money directed toward springs restoration. Scott’s statement during the speech likely left  listeners with the impression that his investment in the environment in general is a record, and that would be misleading. Sorting out the total investment in environmental protection under Scott compared to predecessors is complicated because funding comes from state and federal sources and multiple state programs relate to the environment. However, under one way to compare funding - - the total for the Department of Environmental Protection -- Scott falls far short of Bush’s record. And Scott doesn’t beat Crist’s record, either. Scott tried to take his spending recommendation for one particular environmental project -- springs restoration -- and portray that as an overall record, and that’s not the case. We rate this claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809709BFC0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-record-funding-environmental-prot/
"['Oregon', 'Urban', 'Brian Clem']","
Has Oregon never before created a land-use plan for ""what it should look like for 50 years?""
","For more than 40 years, Oregon has maintained a national reputation for its comprehensive land-use system. However, political wrangling and costly, time-consuming lawsuits have frequently hamstrung the process. Mere mention of the words ""land use"" can divide many rooms down the middle. The Claim The Oregon Legislature just waded into a years-long attempt by the Portland region to create a 50-year supply of urban and rural reserves. Lawmakers jumped in after the Court of Appeals found parts of the plan fatally flawed. State Rep. Brian Clem, D-Salem, helped broker a bill, also with a 50-year horizon, that put into law significant parts of the plan the court tossed out. The bill trimmed the number of urban reserves, particularly in Washington County, and made a few other growth-boundary tweaks. Clem called the effort groundbreaking. ""This reserves effort is a big deal,"" he told reporters on Feb. 28, 2014. ""We’ve never tried this before -- beyond that five-, six-year cycle, what it should look like for 50 years."" There’s something new under the sun when it comes to Oregon land-use law? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The Analysis Clem’s claim hinges on both the 50-year time frame built into the new law -- is that a first? -- as well as the contents of the bill, the ""reserves."" Given the tricky legal landscape, we called veteran land-use attorney Ed Sullivan. Everything the state is dealing with today, he said, stems from Senate Bill 100, the 1973 law requiring cities and counties to prepare their own plans in accordance with statewide goals. Rules based on the law require the Portland area to maintain a 20-year supply of ""buildable land,"" Sullivan said. They also require a review every five years to determine whether the urban growth boundary needs expanding. Fast-forward to the mid-1990s, when the counties and Metro -- the regional planning agency -- wearied of the every-five-year review scramble. They tried something different. Using existing authority, they designated more than 18,500 acres for urban reserves -- enough to accommodate growth for 30 years, according to projections. So there was language in a 1997 plan outlining a time frame longer than five years, but not the 50 contained in Clem’s claim. However, the state Court of Appeals tossed that plan out,  and it never took effect. We called Dan Chandler, now strategic policy administrator at Clackamas County, who worked on the 1997 case. What’s different this time, he said, is the first-ever inclusion of rural reserves -- a classification of land that didn’t exist in the law until 2007. The bill creating rural reserves, he added, established the legal path to the deal just struck in Salem. We emailed Clem at his legislative office, and he called us a few minutes later. He knew about the legal existence of urban reserves but hadn’t realized the Portland area in the late 1990s -- in an ultimately doomed effort -- designated more than 18,500 acres for future growth. ""But what I was talking about in my claim,"" he said, ""was how no one has ever done both urban and rural reserves in one big effort. In fact, just before the quote you’re focusing on, I specifically mentioned SB 1011, which is all about urban and rural reserves together. Without both components, I don’t think we could have pulled this off."" We checked with Christian Gaston, The Oregonian reporter who has been writing about the Legislature’s land-use action. He confirmed Clem’s account. Dubbed the ""grand bargain,"" the new law has received near-universal acclaim. One Clackamas County commissioner has expressed misgivings, but all of the groups that mounted court challenges against the most recent Metro/counties plan, including watchdog land-use group 1000 Friends of Oregon, say they are satisfied with the outcome. The Ruling The Portland area now has a new way to plan where growth will and won’t occur, as well as a solution for avoiding those burdensome five-year periodic review cycles. Clem, in touting the law, said ""we’ve never tried this before,"" meaning no one has devised a land-use plan that looks out a half-century. That’s on the mark, since Metro and the three counties signed off on a plan 17 years ago that identified enough acreage to accommodate growth for three decades -- not five. It’s important to note, however, that since that plan died after successful legal challenges, it was never ""tried.""   Clem rightly notes that the 1997 plan did not address rural reserves. In addition, he gets points for context. In his claim, he used the words ""reserves"" in referring to the first-ever inclusion of both urban and rural reserves in the same bill. The reporter who wrote the story that included his claim backed Clem’s account. So while it’s true that a plan was developed nearly 20 years ago that looked out far more than five years, that rocky iteration of Oregon’s land-use history was never actually put into effect. We rate Clem’s claim True.

Sarah Eckhardt twice declined pay raises as county commissioner and twice accepted percentage raises that did not bring her salary to highest possible level
","Sarah Eckhardt, chosen by voters in March 2014 as the Democratic nominee for Travis County judge, earlier drew fire from her primary opponent, Andy Brown, for voting to increase her own pay several times. We wondered about that, especially after a political group favoring Eckhardt for the executive post sent an email blast declaring that Eckhardt had declined pay raises. ChangeAustin.org said in its Feb. 26, 2014, email blast that Eckhardt, who served as the Precinct 2 county commissioner from 2007 through May 2013 before resigning to run for judge, ""refused to take her own pay increases repeatedly."" By email, a founder of the group, Brian Rodgers, said that he knew Eckhardt did so because he closely observed the commissioners court during her time there. Genevieve Van Cleve, a consultant to Eckhardt’s campaign, suggested we asked Leslie Browder, who manages budget and planning for the county, about Eckhardt’s pay-raise history. By email, Browder sent us a chart showing each commissioner’s salary since 2007 plus several county public-notice advertisements related to pay raises approved by the commissioners court during Eckhardt’s tenure. Eckhardt, who won re-election in 2010, had her annual pay bump up twice in her tenure. According to the chart, her salary went from $83,716 to $86,646 in October 2008 and to $88,812 as of two years later through her resignation in 2013. Over the period, according to the chart, the commissioners court approved four pay raises for the four commissioners. If Eckhardt’s salary had risen along with that of two colleagues who similarly started at $83,716, Precinct 1 Commissioner Ron Davis and Precinct 4 Commissioner Margaret Gomez, it would have been $98,463 as of October 2013, nearly $10,000 more than it was. But Eckhardt didn't always say no to higher pay. The chart and the public-notice ads, which appeared in the Austin Chronicle, indicate that Eckhardt completely declined a raise in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2013. However, Eckhardt accepted percentage increases equal to the percentage increases approved for all the commissioners as of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2011, though she did not sign off on catching up to the highest commissioner salaries. Browder confirmed that analysis. Eckhardt’s pay actually varied a bit more, though we didn’t spot anything indicating she slipped in a pay raise extra. A chart and other documents emailed to us by the county auditor, Nicki Riley, show that Eckhardt’s annual pay in her years as a commissioner bounced from $83,716 to $90,109 to $79,890 and then $88,812. Some of this variation ties to the the auditor’s chart covering calendar years, combining different fiscal years, which begin in October. Also, Eckhardt told us by phone, she was mistakenly paid more than she wanted to receive in fiscal 2009. She said that she subsequently repaid the county to keep her pay through the fiscal year at $86,646. Van Cleve emailed us a copy of a Sept. 3, 2010, memo from Eckhardt to Charles Vaughn, then the county’s payroll manager,  stating: ""I was paid $90,108.76 in FY09 although my advertised salary was ($)86,646. I therefore include the enclosed check for the difference of $3,462.76 written to the county."" Per her past pay, Eckhardt otherwise deferred to Browder. Our ruling ChangeAustin.org said that as a Travis County commissioner, Eckhardt ""refused to take her own pay increases repeatedly."" In two fiscal years, 2008 and 2013, Eckhardt completely declined pay raises, while in fiscal 2009 and 2011, she accepted percentage raises equal to the percentage hikes approved for all commissioners, though Eckhardt's pay did not catch up to the highest level she could have reached.

Did Vladimir Putin call the breakup of the USSR 'the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century?'
","Russian President Vladimir Putin’s handling of the uprising in Ukraine is not surprising if you look at telling comments he made years ago, says former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations turned conservative television pundit John Bolton. A Fox News host asked Bolton if he agreed with Ukraine’s prime minister who said the country is ""on the brink of disaster."" Bolton, who served at the U.N. during George W. Bush’s time in the White House, said it seemed pretty accurate. ""I think Putin knows that he has the high cards, militarily, economically and politically, and he’s prepared to use them,"" Bolton said. ""He gave us notice of his strategy seven or eight years ago when he said, in what is now one of the most frequently repeated quotes from his leadership in Russia, when he said, ‘The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.’ ""It’s clear he wants to re-establish Russian hegemony within the space of the former Soviet Union. Ukraine is the biggest prize, that’s what he’s after. The occupation of the Crimea is a step in that direction."" We wanted to know if Bolton correctly characterized Putin’s comments. We reached out to Bolton through his political action committee and the American Enterprise Institute, where he is a senior fellow, but did not hear back. Putin’s 2005 speech to Russians Putin, a veteran of the Soviet spy agency called the KGB, made the comments Bolton cites in an April 2005 state of the nation address to the country’s top politicians and parliament. A version is available in English from the Kremlin archives. Putin’s words vary depending on the translation, but the idea remains the same. From the Kremlin:  ""Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century. As for the Russian nation, it became a genuine drama. Tens of millions of our co-citizens and co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself."" The Associated Press translation is a little differently, subbing ""catastrophe"" for ""disaster,"" and calling the breakup the ""greateast geopolitical catastrophe of the century."" That language is a little more in line with what Bolton said. Whatever the word choice, it’s clear Putin believed there were problems created by the breakup of the Soviet Union. Putin, who had revived some Soviet iconography as president, focused the rest of his speech on developing Russia as a free and democratic country, though he promised to be tough on popular uprisings inspired by surrounding countries. His speech came as President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offered public skepticism of the country’s ""managed democracy,"" leading Putin to declare Russia would ""independently determine"" its definition of democracy. Still, it was his lament for the dissolved Soviet Union that dominated news coverage. The remark was alarming to westerners, illustrating a deep contrast in perspectives of an event that many consider a glorious moment in time, said Dina Spechler, an Indiana University associate professor of political science who teaches Soviet and Russian foreign policy. Spechler said she did not find a problem with Bolton’s characterization, though she added Putin does not want a return of Soviet-era economic centralization. ""I think it’s quite legitimate and fair, and it’s been true for some time now that Putin wants to re-establish Russian hegemony,"" Spechler said. ""He calls it an area of primary Russian interest -- making sure that these countries remain loyal."" Spechler does not predict a full-scale escalation of force by Russia in Ukraine, she said, but she would not rule it out given the crisis between Russia and Georgia in 2008. Ukraine is a large country with strong cultural links to Russia looked upon as a Slavic brother, she said. ""What we’re seeing today is the most significant step Russia has taken, and it is likely to take a while, to fulfill the agenda that was heralded when he called the breakup a tragedy,"" she said. The ""upshot"" of the speech was that if the greatest geopolitical tragedy was the breakup of the USSR, the greatest geopolitical achievement should be the reformulation of a Russian superstate, said Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Heritage Foundation. He wasn’t pining for a new USSR That’s not the only view of Putin’s remarks, however. Other scholars we consulted say there is more nuance in the meaning of Putin’s words. Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin, a 2013 book by Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution, addresses the ""often misquoted line"" about the demise of the USSR: ""Most references to this line have suggested that Putin was bemoaning the loss of the communist economic and political system,"" the book reads, ""but Putin has since frequently underscored that he was talking about the collapse of the Russian state itself."" Gaddy elaborated in an interview with PunditFact, saying Putin is not eager to re-establish the USSR, partly because it would be costly for Russia, which subsidized many Soviet countries during that era. He does, however, want to make sure surrounding countries are not used against Russia. Gaddy said Putin does not see Ukraine as a prize, as Bolton suggested, but as a potential liability and realm for anti-Russian activity. ""His nightmare has long been that Ukrainian instability would be used to sap Russia’s attention and strength, or worse — that it would be used to entrap Russia into intervening militarily and getting bogged down,"" Gaddy said. ""The nightmare is coming real."" Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University’s history and government department, challenged Bolton’s assertion that Putin’s remarks in years past foreshadowed the modern events in Ukraine. It’s more complicated, he said. Yes, Russia moved aggressively into Chechnya, South Ossetia and Crimea, but it was not on a whim -- it was to prevent instability along the border after years of NATO expansions, Janda said. Plus, Russia would not have worked in recent years to stabilize its dealings and cooperation with Western countries if it had planned to invade Ukraine all along, he said. ""All Putin meant when he said in 2005 that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a catastrophe was that it launched protests and uprisings and sectarian violence, which is true,"" Janda said. ""Those of us in the West are okay with that because we saw in those uprisings the birth of new nations and greater freedom, but that doesn’t mean it came without cost or that the Russians were thrilled by it."" Our ruling Bolton told a Fox News host that Putin once said, ""The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century."" Putin did say those words, or at least words close to that, in a 2005 address to Russian political leaders. Bolton went on to tell a Fox News host those words are evidence Putin wants to expand Russia’s influence to where it was in the Soviet days. The record there is not as clear. We found some experts who agree with Bolton’s interpretation, while others who say Bolton is extracting a quote that does not quite mean what he says it does. Bolton’s statement is accurate but needs clarification.

R.I. psychotherapist says marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more cancer-causing chemicals than tobacco
","In the ongoing battle over liberalizing marijuana laws, key questions focus on the risks posed by smoking the psychoactive substance. In the past year, PolitiFact affiliates looked at claims that marijuana is less toxic than alcohol (Mostly True), whether today's marijuana is ""genetically modified"" to have far more THC than in the 1970s (also Mostly True) and whether nobody's addicted to marijuana (False). In a Feb. 20 commentary in The Providence Journal, psychotherapist Michael Cerullo made several arguments against marijuana legalization but this one caught our attention: ""Marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco,"" he said. Tobacco is deadly enough. We wondered if marijuana was that much worse. Cerullo said the statement came from the 2007 edition of the Drug Guide for Mental Health Professionals, a specialty edition of the widely-respected Physician's Desk Reference. It says, ""Marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco."" But it offers no source and a spokesman for the publisher said the guide is too old to check the source. We also found references to the factoid in material from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and National Institute on Drug Abuse. But none indicated who had actually done the test or where it had been published. Actually, the statement is ambiguous. It could be saying that marijuana smoke has 50 to 70 percent MORE cancer-causing chemicals or has a 50 to 70 percent greater CONCENTRATION of cancer-causing chemicals. On the first point, we couldn't find a comprehensive tally of cancer-causing chemicals in marijuana smoke. It's not even easy to find a list for tobacco smoke, with different sources giving different estimates. (The National Cancer Institute, on its website, pegs the number at ""at least 69."" A 2010 Surgeon General's report gives a similar number, and lists 62.) Without evidence, we would rate that reading of the statement as False. In our quest to see if the concentration of cancer-causing chemicals is greater in marijuana smoke, we consulted Dr. Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a leading researcher on marijuana and tobacco. Only a few studies have compared the smoke content of the two, he said in an email. One was from 1975, the other from 1982. They both found that two of the carcinogens in marijuana smoke were higher than in tobacco smoke. Both are hydrocarbons. In the 1975 study, one was roughly 50 percent higher; the other about 70 percent higher. In other words, they supported Cerullo’s claim. But there's more to the story. The concentrations of other cancer-causing chemicals was lower by as much as 73 percent in marijuana smoke, the studies found. Tashkin said the most recent study, published in 2008, found that the concentrations of carcinogenic chemicals were consistently LOWER in marijuana smoke. ""These differences could be due to changes in the strains of marijuana studied in 2008 compared to those studied in 1975 and 1982,"" Tashkin wrote. (This applies to smoke inhaled directly. In contrast, the 2008 study found that the concentration of cancer-causing chemicals was higher in second-hand marijuana smoke than in second-hand tobacco smoke.) Robert Melamede, a medical marijuana advocate and biologist at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, said the carcinogenic content ""depends on how thoroughly it's burned"" and anyone who says the level of carcinogens is much higher in marijuana ""is using meaningless information to make a meaningless point. A lot of people use vaporizers, and vaporizers don't give you any burnt hydrocarbons."" Ultimately, the most important question is whether smoking marijuana, on top of its other potential hazards, increases the risk of cancer the way tobacco does. The short answer for now is no. Researchers have been looking for evidence that it does, but they've come up empty-handed. The latest marijuana fact sheet from the National Institute on Drug Abuse says, ""It is not yet known whether marijuana smoking contributes to (the) risk for lung cancer."" Tashkin said there is speculation that THC, the active ingredient in marijuana ""could counterbalance the impact of the carcinogens present in marijuana smoke."" Our ruling When Michael Cerullo said, ""Marijuana contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco,"" he was quoting a reputable source. But we could find no evidence that marijuana smoke contains more kinds of cancer-causing chemicals. And evidence on whether marijuana smoke has higher concentrations of cancer-causing chemicals is hazy at best. It depends on whether you are talking about smoke inhaled by the user, or second-hand smoke. On this burning issue, because the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Hagel says Congress responsible for defense cuts, not Obama
","President Barack Obama released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2015 on Tuesday. One point of contention is that the budget he proposed will reduce the army to its smallest size since 1940. On CBS’ Face the Nation on Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told host Bob Schieffer that he’s not responsible for those cuts. ""It isn’t me cutting the budget,"" he said. ""It’s the Congress’ decision on sequestration. So it isn’t the secretary of defense or the president doing this, and I think we should clear that up a little bit here, too."" At first glance, Hagel attributing defense cuts to Congress contradicts Obama’s proposed budget, which itself cuts Department of Defense funding levels. PolitiFact wanted to review how the cuts came to be, and how that affects the defense budget. How the sequester came to be Congress passed the Budget Control Act in August 2011 to resolve the debt ceiling crisis. Republicans and some Democrats insisted that the Obama administration offset an increase in the debt ceiling, the amount of money the treasury can borrow, with a plan to reduce the nation’s debt. Had Congress not passed this law, the United States could’ve defaulted on payments like Social Security and Medicare for the first time in history. The Budget Control Act included $1.2 trillion in cuts and formed a joint House and Senate super-committee to find another $1.2 trillion by Nov. 23, 2011. Since the super-committee failed to do this, the law called for sequestration, or across-the-board spending cuts, to go into effect in 2013. Each year, budget cuts are split evenly between non-war defense spending and discretionary domestic spending. Lawmakers in both chambers passed this act with bipartisan support, and then Obama signed it into law. We’ve reported before that the Obama administration originally proposed the sequester as a tactic to get Congress to come up with more targeted spending cuts. Since both Democrats and Republicans stood to lose funding for things they supported, it was widely thought that they would work out a deficit reduction and stop the sequester before 2013. Essentially, Congress and Obama both approved a measure they’re now unhappy with and forced to work around. ""It’s always entertaining to me to see everyone trying to run away from (the sequester),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget studies senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""Everyone agreed to it except for the Pentagon."" How Obama pushed back against the sequester The White House and Congress jointly established the sequester in 2011. But as Harrison noted, there’s a contradiction here. Recently, both groups have taken some action to exceed the sequester’s cap on defense spending. The budget caps for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 were set in December with a bipartisan budget agreement from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that rolled back the sequester in favor of more specific cuts. The 2015 defense spending cap was set at $496 billion, about $7 billion more than the sequester would have allocated. The Ryan-Murray deal left it up to Congress and the Department of Defense to determine how the cuts would be distributed. Again, this bill had support on both sides of the aisle. Obama signed it into law Dec. 26. Obama’s 2015 main defense budget proposal doesn’t exceed the $496 billion approved defense spending cuts he and Congress set up. However, he also proposed giving the Pentagon an extra $26.4 billion as part of a separate budget package, a $56 billion, paid-for investment fund called the Opportunity, Growth and Security Initiative. He proposed giving the Department of Defense funds for weapon systems modernization, readiness restoration and facilities improvement. In fiscal year 2014, the Department of Defense effectively didn’t see any cuts because funding above the cap was moved to the war budget, a separate fund for Afghanistan, Harrison said. The White House hasn’t yet proposed a 2015 war budget, because that’s dependent on how many troops will stay overseas. Obama’s 2014 and 2015 proposals show that his ideal figure for defense spending is higher than what the sequester caps allow for. That said, since 2011, Obama’s defense proposal figures have come down slightly, while the Budget Control Act’s have come up. So although the Obama administration wants defense spending to exceed the caps, he’s not necessarily advocating for pre-sequester level spending. Our ruling Hagel said it wasn’t he or Obama that made defense cuts, it was Congress in passing the sequester. Hagel himself wasn’t working in government at the time, so he has no tie to the cuts. Obama literally signed Congress’ defense cuts into law in both 2011 and 2013. At the same time, his budgets have proposed funding defense spending at a level above what the caps call for, showing that he doesn’t fully support the very agreements he signed. Hagel’s claim omits two instances where Obama supported defense spending cuts on record. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F2F40>],/factchecks/2014/mar/05/chuck-hagel/hagel-says-congress-responsible-defense-cuts-not-o/

Russia-backed American news network offers its own facts on Ukraine situation
","While it would be easy, and maybe even largely accurate, to see Russia’s moves in the Crimean Peninsula as a power-play pure and simple, Moscow gives other reasons. All of them have to do with protecting Russian citizens or ethnic Russians in Ukraine. Russia Today, a Kremlin-financed news organization, offered this brief explanation at the very end of its article on the Russian troops stationed at bases in Crimea. ""Authorities in the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic of Crimea – where more than half the population is Russian – requested Moscow’s assistance after the self-proclaimed government in Kiev introduced a law abolishing the use of languages other than Ukrainian in official circumstances."" We thought we’d check the last part of that sentence. Did the new Ukrainian government introduce ""a law abolishing the use of languages other than Ukrainian in official circumstances?"" The quick answer is, yes -- with a big but. We’ll walk you through it. The 1996 Constitution and situation in Crimea In 1996, the Ukraine Constitution made Ukrainian the country’s official language. Ukraine is a polyglot nation. About two-thirds of the people speak Ukrainian, about a quarter speak Russian, and another 10 percent speak Hungarian, Romanian, Polish and Tatar. Not surprisingly, each language tends to cluster in particular places. The Constitution, however, also included protections for other languages including Russian: ""Free development, use, and protection of Russian and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine shall be guaranteed in Ukraine."" In 1998, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea got its own constitution that placed Russian as a second official language. Article X held that ""Russian, being the language spoken by the majority of the population and the language acceptable for purposes of interethnic communication, shall be used in all spheres of public life."" That included legal documents, court proceedings and public services. Bill Bowring is a Britsh legal scholar who studied the language laws in Ukraine and visited Crimea with European monitors. He was last there in 2010 and found Russian used in all official business. ""You could go in to a government office or courtroom and you would only hear Russian,"" Bowring said. ""Anyone who says the Russian-speakers were in any way suppressed would be talking nonsense."" Even a 1999 ruling from Ukraine’s Constitutional Court that affirmed the predominance of Ukrainian included this exception: ""Local government bodies, bodies of Crimean Autonomous Republic and local self-government bodies may use Russian and other languages of national minorities along with the state language."" So at least since 1999, Russian was considered an official language of Crimea, but other parts of Ukraine had less protection. More recent developments Fast forward to 2012. Parliamentary elections grew close and then-President Viktor Yanukovych worried that his Russian-leaning party would lose ground. Ahead of the elections, Yanukovych pushed for and won passage of a new language law. It gave local and regional governments the power to give any language official status so long as at least 10 percent of the people spoke it as their native tongue. This had widest resonance for Russian speakers, but it also made a difference for communities where other languages were common. Nearly half of Ukraine’s regions, 13 out of 27, made Russian a second official language. That law afforded language protections to even more people, but when Yanukovych was ousted last month, the new Ukranian parliament also voted to roll back the 2012 law. ""In the first parliamentary session, that tolerant 2012 law was revoked, which meant that the country reverted to the earlier legislation,"" said Keith Darden, a professor of international relations at American University. The parliament voted on Sunday, March 2. By Wednesday, a backlash had begun, but not solely in Russian quarters. That day, the western city of Lviv, a center of Ukrainian nationalism, protested the repeal of the 2012 law and declared a day of speaking Russian. The government of Hungary slammed the move as well. By Friday, Russian troops had taken positions at the airports and other key centers in Crimea. On Sunday, the interim President Oleksandr Turchynov, stepped in and said he would not sign the repeal into law. ""He said that he wasn’t going to approve the repeal of the law,"" said Olga Oliker, an Eastern Europe security analyst at the RAND Corporation. Oliker believes that Turchynov would have vetoed the parliament’s action under any circumstances, but the sequence of events is clear. The parliament attempted to reassert the sole official status of Ukrainian and then the Russian troops moved in. We reached out to Russia Today and did not hear back. Our ruling Russia Today said the Ukrainians introduced a law abolishing the use of any language except Ukrainian for official business. The Ukrainian parliament did vote to repeal a 2012 law that allowed for more official languages in parts of the country. But the repeal vote was not signed into law by the Ukraine’s interim president. Also, Crimea -- the center of the crisis currently in Ukraine -- has long held a special status whereby both Russian and Ukrainian could be used in official business. The recent vote would not have changed that, experts told us. We make no determination as to whether the parliament’s move triggered a call for aid from officials in Crimea. But on the question of the official language, the statement omits significant context.

Do Bill Clinton and George Bush support the Keystone XL pipeline?
","March 7 is the last day the U.S. Department of State will hear public comments on Keystone XL, a proposed pipeline that would carry diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. With the closing of the 30-day comment period, six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters is expected to come to a head when President Barack Obama makes a final decision on whether to proceed. In an attempt to sway public opinion, the American Petroleum Institute relaunched an ad campaign backing the pipeline. The 30-second spot, which is airing in the District of Columbia, Montana, New Mexico and North Carolina, claims that in the land of deadlock, the pipeline is one of few projects to win support from both sides of the spectrum. ""Washington. It’s gridlock, division, bitter partisanship,"" the ad says. ""But one jobs plan brings both sides together. Bill Clinton and George (W.) Bush both say build the Keystone XL."" A ringing endorsement of the Keystone pipeline from 42 and 43? That sounds like something worth looking into. Bush backs it The American Petroleum Institute ad clearly identifies sources backing up their claim for viewers. For Bush, the ad references an article from Bloomberg published in March 2012, in which the former Republican president calls the pipeline ""a no-brainer,"" according to the report. ""The clear goal ought to be how to get the private sector to grow,"" Bush said. ""If you say that, then an issue like the Keystone pipeline becomes an easy issue."" We weren’t surprised Bush supports the plan. Republicans have been overwhelmingly supportive of the proposal and Bush has ties to the oil industry. Heck, he made the aforementioned remarks during the keynote speech of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers conference. But what about Clinton? Clinton’s backing of Keystone did cause us to raise an eyebrow. The ad points to a Feb. 29, 2012, article from Politico. In it, Clinton calls for Americans to ""embrace"" the pipeline. We tracked down the original speech. It was given at the 2012 ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit, a conference held by the U.S. Department of Energy. Here’s what Clinton had to say: ""One of the most amazing things to me about this Keystone Pipeline deal is that they ever filed that route in the first place since they could've gone around the Nebraska Sandhills and avoided most of the danger, no matter how imagined, to the Ogallala (aquifer) with a different route, which I presume we'll get now, because the extra cost of running it is infinitesimal compared to the revenues that will be generated over a long period of time. ""So, I think we should embrace it and develop a stakeholder-driven system of high standards for doing the work modeled on what was done with auto mileage agreement."" Clinton’s remarks are somewhat hard to follow. But he seems to say that Americans should ""embrace"" the Keystone pipeline and the government should work with the oil industry and environmentalists to develop standards for implementing and overseeing the project, similar to how all the stakeholders got together to develop higher standards for gas mileage in new vehicles. That’s how media reports characterized his comments, and Clinton made no attempt to correct them in the two years since. Within a year, Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman approved a new route for the pipeline that largely avoided the Nebraska Sandhills, as Clinton predicted. If he was not placated by the route change, Clinton never said so publicly. In fact, we couldn’t find any more public statements by Clinton regarding the Keystone XL pipeline. Several environmental groups we contacted said they had no recollection of Clinton speaking on the issue since 2012. We reached out to Clinton through the Clinton Global Initiative to see if his position had changed or could be affirmed for us. We didn’t hear back. Putting Clinton’s speech in context So we’re left with one public comment made two years ago. But we can deduce a few things based off what he said. First, in his remarks, Clinton was largely endorsing an all-of-the-above energy approach that focused on greener and sustainable methods. And while he expressed support for the Keystone project, he also said that tapping into homegrown natural resources was not a panacea. ""There are some hazards to the innovation project, right now,"" Clinton said. ""We have massive new recovery technologies in oil and gas which could lead us down the primrose path of thinking we don't have to keep using less energy and developing clean energy and technologies."" But Clinton’s call to ""embrace"" the pipeline also came as the U.S. State Department was deciding whether to recommend the project’s approval. The State Department, at that time, was headed by his wife. Indeed, not hours after Clinton gave his speech in 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was testifying before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where she fielded questions about the State Department’s oversight of the pipeline proposal. In the hearing, Secretary Clinton was even asked about her husband’s comments from earlier that day. Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fla., noted, ""Even the former President, Bill Clinton, says, ‘Embrace it and we need to move forward with the Keystone XL pipeline.’ "" Clinton respond, ""He is a very smart man,"" inciting laughter. She then added, ""But unfortunately he is not bound by the laws and regulations and longer of the United States to make decisions that follow a certain procedure. And that is what we have to do."" ""So is it a mistake for the former president to say, ‘embrace it’?"" Mack then asked. ""Of course not,"" Clinton replied. ""This is America. People say they embrace it, people say they hate it. Our job is to take a very clear-eyed look at what the facts are."" So not only did Bill Clinton come out in favor of the pipeline in 2012, he did so during a public speech hosted by the U.S. Energy Department just hours before his wife, who oversaw the administration’s review of the pipeline, was set to testify in front of a Republican-controlled House committee. For her part, Hillary Clinton has gone back and forth on the pipeline. In 2010 she said she was ""inclined"" to approve the project. But under her command, the State Department also recommended Obama deny approval of the pipeline in 2012 after congressional Republicans forced a decision from the White House within 60 days. At the time, Clinton said the window was too short to review the environmental impact of the project. Our ruling The American Petroleum Institute ad says, ""Bill Clinton and George Bush both say build the Keystone XL"" pipeline. While their evidence is two years old, it’s not fabricated. Since voicing support of the pipeline in 2012, Clinton has not publicly weighed in on the controversy. But his backing of the project was not an offhand comment. It came during a publicized energy speech on the same day his wife was testifying before Congress. It seems unlikely he would endorse the proposal on such an occasion if he did not mean it. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097072C80>],/factchecks/2014/mar/05/american-petroleum-institute/do-bill-clinton-and-george-bush-support-keystone-x/

Republican group ties Wisconsin job loss to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke
","The political playbook calls for campaigns to define their opponents before they can introduce themselves to voters. The Republican Governors Association is calling that play in the early downs of the 2014 Wisconsin governor’s race, attacking Democrat Mary Burke in her bid to unseat Republican Scott Walker. In one TV spot entitled ""Backward,"" the RGA asks: ""Who’s Mary Burke?"" It’s answer: ""Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs, and a $3 billion budget shortfall."" The ad concludes:  ""Mary Burke would take Wisconsin backwards."" Did Burke, as state Commerce secretary under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, throw Wisconsin for a six-digit jobs loss? As backup for the jobs claim, the RGA spot cites a very familiar source: A September 2013 item from PolitiFact Wisconsin. But in that item, we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that Doyle’s policies cost the state 133,000 jobs in his second term, from 2007 through 2010. Walker, we noted, got the number right. But experts said the national economic crash had far more to do with Wisconsin’s job losses during that period than any state policies. Indeed, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country. The claim in the RGA ad carries a subtle, but important difference. It does not mention Doyle’s second term as its timeframe. Rather, it makes an open-ended statement that those watching from their couch may likely hear as referring to Doyle’s full tenure in office. Beyond that, Burke worked for Doyle as Commerce secretary over parts of both his terms, but not nearly for the entire eight-year period. She started in February 2005, about halfway through Doyle’s first term, and left in November 2007 -- 10  months into Doyle’s second term. And the private-sector jobs picture changes dramatically if you look at Doyle’s full tenure or narrowly at Burke’s time as Commerce chief. We ran the numbers using US Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly census of employment and wages data, considered the most accurate measurement: -- Burke’s state tenure: Gain of more than 55,000 jobs. -- Doyle’s full eight-year tenure: Loss of 47,413 jobs (gain of 86,530 in term one, loss of 133,943 in term two). To expand our analysis, we looked at two other scenarios: -- Start of Burke’s tenure to end of Doyle’s: loss of 77,267. -- Start of Doyle’s tenure to end of Burke’s: gain of at least 94,000. It’s apparent from these figures that the RGA ad cherrypicks the worst outcome for Burke by ignoring numbers from nearly two years she worked in Doyle’s first term -- even though that represented the majority of her time in state government. Indeed, the state’s private sector employment actually grew during Burke’s specific  time as Commerce secretary. (Data note: because of limitations stemming from how the data is reported, we had to slightly adjust the time frames covering Burke’s state tenure. But those adjustments do not alter the trends we found.) There’s something for the RGA to hang on to here, though, in that Burke was a holdover member of Doyle’s administration for a small part of a second term during which more than 130,000 jobs were lost in four years. RGA spokesman Jon Thompson defended the 130,000 figure, saying Burke had a hand in Doyle’s second term, but added that it is a ""fair comparison"" for others to look at all eight years of Doyle’s record. ""Wisconsin is still worse off when all is said and done, and has turned that corner under Walker,"" he said. Blame game The historical backdrop here is that until mid-2008, employment in Wisconsin was rising, as it had for years. In June 2008, seven months after Burke departed, the total employment count started a big slide that was part of the Great Recession that swept the United States. The slide ended in mid-2010, in Doyle’s final year, and the monthly gains that started then have generally continued under Walker. In reality, neither Walker nor Burke deserve much of the credit or blame for job trends, particularly ones driven by an event as sharp as the Great Recession, economists have told us repeatedly. No governor -- much less a department head -- has much influence on the state jobs picture in the face of strongly negative national economic trends, they said. To be sure, Burke highlights the job gains during her time while skipping over the recession. That omission earned her a Half True when in October of 2013 she picked an entirely different time frame and said her actions as Commerce secretary brought the state 84,000 more jobs than we have today. Our rating The Republican Governors Association charged that ""Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs."" There’s an element of truth, but the ad ignores the critical fact that Burke also worked in half of Doyle’s first term, when 86,000 jobs were gained. Employment also rose in the narrower time frame when Burke worked for Doyle over parts of his two terms. And in any event, the role of these two officials in those losses and gains is very limited, given national economic realities of the time. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3A1BC0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/05/republican-governors-association/republican-group-ties-wisconsin-job-loss-mary-burk/

Gun bill claim under fire
","The Georgia House passed and sent to the state Senate last month a controversial and sweeping bill that would lift restrictions on guns in houses of worship, bars, airports and college campuses, and it would allow schools to beef up security by arming front office staff, teachers and other employees. Passions are running high for and against House Bill 875,  which supporters have named the ""Safe Carry Protection Act"" and critics call the ""guns everywhere bill."" But debates about measures such as this are often filled over-heated rhetoric Among those lobbying to kill the bill is Americans for Responsible Solutions, a national group that former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, founded after her near-fatal shooting in January 2011. In a press release and Iinternet video released Feb. 26, Giffords’ group urged Georgians to appeal to the state Senate and Gov. Nathan Deal to defeat the bill. ""Georgia lawmakers are now considering passing the most extreme gun bill in America,"" Pia Carusone, the group’s executive director, said in the release. Knowing the many and varied gun measures that exist or are proposed across the nation, could Georgia really be looking at ""the most extreme gun bill in America?"" We wondered. We decided  to run the statement through the Truth-O-Meter. On its website, the National Rifle Association calls HB 875 by state Rep. Rick Jasperse, R-Jasper, ""the most comprehensive pro-gun reform legislation introduced in recent state history."" We began by circling back to Giffords’ group to explain the claim that it is the most extreme legislation out there. Carusone said her group is tracking 200 gun bills in legislatures across the country, many of which ""weaken common-sense gun violence prevention policies."" But none of the bills has ""as many extreme provisions as we see in this one Georgia bill,"" she said. ""Not only does the bill invite guns into virtually every public space, reversing 100-year-old regulations, it allows teachers to carry guns while teaching class and airplane passengers to attempt to bring guns through (Transportation Security Administration) security without consequence,"" Carusone said. ""It also would allow guns to be in courthouses. State legislation typically focuses on one of these issues, not all of them."" Experts we checked with said there’s no evidence that, if the bill passes, Georgia would be considered to have the most lax gun laws. Four states, Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming, don’t even require a permit to carry a concealed weapon, they said. Jasperse, the bill’s chief sponsor, said labeling his bill as the nation’s ""most extreme"" is a typical tactic of  groups that survive on fundraising and headline-grabbing. ""That’s what they are supposed to do, I guess,"" he said. He said the provision of the bill dealing with airports is meant to help the licensed gun owner who forgets she has her gun in her purse until she’s going through TSA screening. With proof that she has a license, she’ll be turned away but not arrested, Jasperse said. Unlicensed gun carriers will still face arrest and a misdemeanor charge, he said. Giffords’ group questions why Georgia lawmakers would ease restrictions on guns at airports, especially when Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport had the highest number of firearms intercepted by the TSA in 2013, at 111. The airport is the world’s busiest. Carusone said it is viewed as a threat to public safety based, in part, on a provision allowing people who have been convicted of threatening others with guns to become permitted concealed- carry license holders. Other groups also oppose the bill. Area religious leaders, the Georgia chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and the Georgia Gun Sense Coalition are among its opponents. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and one of several experts we contacted, said ""any claim of most extreme seems very hard to defend."" David Mustard, an associate professor of economics at the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business who has done research on crime, sentencing and, gun control, agreed. Carusone’s statement is ""a pretty hard one to test because to do so one would need to know all the laws on all these different issues in every single state,"" Mustard said. We did a cursory review of bills pending in five other states, including Idaho’s campus-carry bill and didn’t see any that appeared to go far beyond the weapons-carrying laws in many of the other 49 states. One provision of HB 875 would lower the age for active duty military in Georgia to carry a concealed weapon from 21 to 18. But the majority of Georgians would still fall under the age 21 requirement, and some states, including New Hampshire and Iowa, allow residents to obtain a concealed weapons permit at 18 or younger, Vokokh said. And the provision to allow places of worship and bars to decide whether to allow licensed gun owners to bring guns into their establishments is moving to the ""national norm,"" said David Kopel, the research director at the Independence Institute in Denver. ""Part of what has motivated this initiative in churches is that there have been some very interesting and important cases where someone with a carry license has disarmed ([a person)] who entered a house of worship or organization with a distinctly Christian purpose with the intent to kill many people and commit a mass public shooting,"" Mustard said. ""To my knowledge, there are no examples of congregants using the guns in inappropriate ways in church."" State Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said none of the provisions in HB 875 ""are not already law in some other states."" The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in 2013 gave Georgia an 8 on a 100-point rating scale based on 30 policies on gun and ammunition regulation. That placed the state 28th in the group’s ranking, a spokeswoman said. Jasperse and others sponsored a similar bill last year that ran out of time in the state Senate. Provisions of the current bill would: Jasperse said the bill addresses ""those law-abiding Georgians who are rule followers and have went through our process of obtaining a license."" ""Always remember the segment of our society that wishes to do you and me and our families harm does not care what we write in the paper or [what] laws we create,"" he said. NRA spokesman Jacqueline Issacs said all provisions are in bills across the country. The viewpoint of Giffords’s group is ""out of the mainstream and in line with radical gun ban supporters such as billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who incidentally is a major benefactor to this particular group."" Officials with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence echo the concerns of Americans for Responsible Solutions. ""Of all the bills pending right now in state legislatures, this is the most sweeping and most dangerous,"" said Laura Cutilletta, a staff attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Among her group’s specific concerns is the change allowing a person to carry a concealed weapon after being convicted of a misdemeanor for pointing a gun at another person, Cutilletta said. Brian Malte, the senior national policy director for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said Georgia’s bill is ""extreme in its scope of allowing loaded, hidden guns in sensitive areas."" But he said Arizona’s law also fits into the extreme category. ""No permit is required [in Arizona] to carry a loaded, hidden gun in public,"" Malte said. ""Not even a background check is required."" So where does this leave us? Georgia’s bill clearly would include a large number of changes, which is a flag-raiser for gun safety advocates. But there are pitfalls to calling anything the worst, the first or, in this case, the ""most extreme."" The biggest being: ""Can you prove it?"" All we really have is Carusone’s statement that her group is following 200 bills acros the country and hasn’t  seen any that have as ""many extreme provisions"" as Georgia’s. Supporting evidence is lacking. We rate the statement Mostly Ffalse.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972D17C0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/05/americans-responsible-solutions/gun-bill-claim-under-fire/

'Hardball' host Chris Matthews says Russian troops aren't wearing uniforms in Ukraine
","Hardball host Chris Matthews is, like the rest of us, keeping up with what’s going down between Ukraine and Russia from half a world away, piecing together storylines from news stories, social media, TV clips and photos. His impression is both sides are treading lightly as they anticipate the other’s next move, he said during a March 3, 2014, episode of Hardball on MSNBC: Watching it from a distance, it’s amazing, you see a couple things. I noticed that a lot of people in the new government in Kiev were walking around the palace and the presidency over there in Kiev wearing ski masks. They weren’t confident at all they weren’t being provocative to Moscow. And secondly I noticed the Russians didn’t wear uniforms when they came in (to Ukraine). Both sides seem to be aware that this is going to go on for a while and they’re hedging their bets a bit. It’s fascinating. The insiders seem to know that this isn’t going to be over for a while. We were interested in Matthews' claim that ""The Russians didn’t wear uniforms when they came in"" to Ukraine. Over the weekend, reporters for the New York Times, Reuters and Guardian wrote of Russia unloading troops in the Crimea region of Ukraine, a peninsula that includes many people who identify themselves as Russian. Crimea was part of the Soviet Union until 1954, when Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave the territory to Ukraine (more history in this fact-check). Russia maintains a military base in the Sevastopol under a post-Soviet breakup treaty between Russia and Ukraine. News outlets wrote of Russian-speaking, armed soldiers unloaded from armored vehicles whose service uniforms ""bore no insignia"" though their vehicles featured Russian military plates of the country’s Black Sea force. The troops ""swarmed the major thoroughfares of Crimea,"" wrote the New York Times, shutting down the area’s main airport and surrounding government buildings. Despite their lack of traditional military ID, ""there was no doubt among residents they were deployed from the nearby Russian base to take up position outside a Ukrainian border guard base,"" Reuters wrote. The Guardian estimates 16,000 ""pro-Russian troops"" are controlling Crimea and blockading Ukrainian bases. In a March 4 news conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied Russian troops were occupying Crimea as he said that Russia would only resort to military action ""for the protection of the Ukrainian people."" Putin chastised the U.S. government for interfering in Ukraine’s affairs like a scientist with rats. ""There are many military uniforms. Go into any local shop and you can find one,"" Putin said of the so-called pro-Russia ""local defense forces,"" according to a translation in the Times. Foreign journalists have challenged Putin’s claims, often just by asking talkative, possibly bored soldiers if they are Russian military. Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker tweeted the soldiers were ""forced to keep up ‘volunteer’ charade,"" though one ""chatty chap"" admitted he was from Russia ""to defend against ‘terror’ "" in a video. Experts we consulted said there’s no doubting the troops are Russian. ""It’s clear these are Russian special forces in terms of their performance and in terms of their bearing,"" said Ariel Cohen, a senior research fellow in Russian and Eurasian studies at the Heritage Foundation. Cohen said he was born in Crimea and has friends there who have told him the military men have identified themselves as Russian elite troops. So why wouldn’t Putin say so? Or why won’t Russian soldiers wear patches identifying them as Russian? Plausible deniability, Cohen said. ""Russians can still deny these are forces that are working under their direction, so it may facilitate walking this back,"" Cohen said. There would be nothing new for Russian special forces to be out of uniform in Crimea in an effort to blend in with the locals, said Lance Janda, chairman of Cameron University's Department of History and Government, adding the U.S. military does that to operate secretly as well. But since it’s cold over there, he is also seeing pictures of Russian soldiers bundled up in winter clothes, which are less likely to have unit insignias than combat uniforms, he said. ""It's also possible that they were ordered to take off unit insignias in order to either confuse the Ukrainians initially or to try and appear a bit less threatening,"" Janda said. ""In any case, I think it's an overstatement to stay the Russians were not wearing military uniforms. The safer, more accurate statement would be that some Russian soldiers appear to have not been wearing uniforms."" Janda said the size of the Russian military presence in Crimea ""has surely been augmented"" since the original reports of 16,000. From a distance, it’s hard to tell. Janda agrees with Matthews’ overall assertion that neither side wants a war, and the Russians ""are going in as ‘light’ as they can. ... They just aren't going to risk losing access to the Crimea."" Our ruling Matthews said, ""the Russians didn’t wear uniforms when they came in"" to Ukraine. To be certain, they are wearing uniforms. But we think a reasonable person would infer Matthews  was talking about uniforms that identified them as Russians. That does require a bit of clarification. So we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097639C80>],/factchecks/2014/mar/04/chris-matthews/hardball-host-chris-matthews-says-russian-troops-a/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Scott says all 4-year state colleges offer $10,000 degrees
","In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Rick Scott criticized the high price of a college degree. ""Parents saving for their children to get a four-year degree from a public university today have to save $53,000. $53,000,"" he said before pivoting to brag about Florida schools. ""We can’t celebrate how successful higher education is until we can celebrate that it’s affordable. That’s why I’m proud that all of our four-year state colleges now offer bachelor’s degrees for only $10,000."" We decided to check Scott's claim that each four-year state college offers degrees for $10,000? First a note, four-year state colleges do not include Florida’s large universities such as Florida State University, the University of Florida or the University of South Florida. You can't get a $10,000 degree at any of those places. Florida's state college system make up what were previously called community colleges. Back in November 2012, Scott issued a challenge to four-year state colleges to offer $10,000 bachelor degrees. All of the state colleges that offer bachelor's degrees -- 23 of them -- accepted, according to a press release from the governor’s office. A 24th school, Pasco-Hernando Community College, also accepted Scott's challenge, but isn't yet offering any type or price of bachelor's degree. So how's it going? Not as well as Scott let on. At least yet. A spokeswoman for the Florida College System said that out of the 23 eligible schools, only 10 had students enrolled in $10,000 degree programs as of the fall 2013 semester. The spokeswoman said three more schools were scheduled to begin enrollment this spring. That's only about half of the schools overall, short of what Scott said, and even those schools have other caveats in place that restrict who is eligible for the $10,000 degrees. What degrees students can receive for $10,000 vary by college. Many institutions will only enroll students for $10,000 degree programs in a few specific majors, such as technology development, supply chain management and mathematics education. Some colleges are considering the change for all areas of study, but none are offering every major to current students. The Tampa Bay Times reported that for St. Petersburg College, eligible students must have 12 to 15 accelerated credits before enrolling. Students have to take classes during fall, spring and summer semesters and earn Cs or better. Also, the $10,000 doesn't really get you a degree. That price only covers tuition costs for students -- not books, housing, meals, fees and other expenses that can add up over four years. Our ruling Scott said, ""All of Florida's four-year state colleges now offer bachelor's degrees for only $10,000."" The schools that make up the state college system have accepted a challenge from Scott to offer $10,000 degrees, but only about half currently do. Also, there are several other caveats as to who can get a cheap degree and in what major. Lastly, the $10,000 degree doesn't cover books, housing, meals, fees and other expenses. Scott left out important context in his remarks at the State of the State address.

Four of the nation's top 10 high schools are in Florida, Rick Scott says
","Gov. Rick Scott has positioned himself as a public education cheerleader as he prepares to face the voters in November. After facing criticism for slashing school spending in 2011, Scott later called for education funding increases and teacher raises. Now in his fourth State of the State address on March 4, 2014, he boasted about the national rankings of our high schools. ""Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States,"" Scott said. We wanted to determine if Scott was correct about the ranking of our high schools. Rankings of high schools Scott’s claim comes from Newsweek’s ranking of ""America’s Best High Schools,"" which looked at public schools and was released in May 2013. Four Florida high schools ranked in the top 10: • No. 2: International Baccalaureate School at Bartow High, Bartow • No. 6: School for Advanced Studies, Miami • No. 9: Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach • No. 10: Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville Newsweek invited more than 5,000 high schools to participate and about half responded. The rankings are based on graduation and college acceptance rates, and average SAT/ACT scores based on data from 2011-12 school year. Other factors include scores and enrollment in certain classes such as advancement placement and international baccalaureate. Another often-cited ranking, though, comes from U.S. News and World Report, which uses a different methodology -- and not surprisingly that leads to different results for Florida schools. This ranking, based on data from the 2010-11 school year, shows only one in the top 10 from Florida: Pine View School in Osprey. U.S. News rankings, done together with the American Institutes for Research, cover more than 21,000 public high schools. This analysis takes into account several factors that relate to how a school’s students perform on reading and math tests, including taking into account economically disadvantaged students and minorities. It also examines Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test data.   Education Week, a respected publication in the education field, gives an average grade to each state as a whole. Education Week gave Florida a ""C"" for K-12 achievement, ranking the state at seventh in the country. Education experts We sent Scott’s claim to several education experts to ask their opinion on the Newsweek and U.S. News rankings. None of them embraced these rankings, and they offered several criticisms and caveats. Matthew Di Carlo, an education policy at the Albert Shanker Institute, cautioned that Newsweek’s data from schools is self-reported and only takes into account a small portion of the nation’s high schools. The indicators measured such as graduation and college acceptance rates are predominantly a function of student background. Jeffrey Henig, a Columbia education professor, said that the Newsweek rankings don’t control for certain factors such as socioeconomic status and whether the schools have competitive entry requirements -- as does the school from Miami on the list. ""All 'best school' lists have flaws and most have serious ones,"" Henig said. ""Ranking systems that look at test scores or graduation rates or similar outcome measures, without considering the characteristics of the student populations they serve, tell us little about whether listed schools are good ones, and tell us absolutely nothing about the quality of the state systems in which they are located."" Our ruling Scott said that ""Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States.""  Newsweek’s rankings released in 2013 support Scott's claim. But education experts say there are several caveats about using that ranking, which is based on self-reported data for a fraction of the nation’s schools. There also are other rankings under which Florida doesn’t fare as well -- for example, the U.S. News rankings include only one Florida school in the top 10, while Education Week gave Florida a ""C"" for K-12 education statewide.

Larry Pressler recalls role rejecting Abscam bribe in new campaign ad
","American Hustle -- a movie based on the story of Abscam, the late-1970s FBI sting that ensnared more than a half-dozen politicians for accepting bribes -- got shut out at the Oscars despite snagging 10 nominations. But the movie is living on as an issue in a 2014 U.S. Senate race. Larry Pressler, a former U.S. senator from South Dakota now running as an Independent for another term in the chamber, is airing a campaign ad touting his role in the Abscam scandal. The twist is that Pressler is touting his honesty in the face of illegal offerings. ""American Hustle shows the FBI making real-life bribes to Washington politicians,"" Pressler says to the camera in the ad. ""I know, because as your U.S. senator, I turned them down."" Pressler left office in 1997; since then, he's worked as an attorney and taught at universities. In his current race, he's widely considered an underdog to the Republican frontrunner, former Gov. Mike Rounds. Given all the attention American Hustle has been attracting since its release, we couldn’t resist taking a second look at the decades-old scandal. First, let’s recap what happened in Abscam. The case involved representatives of ""Arab sheiks"" -- actually, undercover FBI agents -- offering politicians payoffs that were intended to secure them casino licenses in New Jersey. The operation resulted in the convictions of Sen. Harrison Williams, D-N.J., six members of the U.S. House, and a number of local officials. The movie tells the somewhat fictionalized story of how the operation was undertaken on behalf of the FBI by a con man whose name in real life was Mel Weinberg. (Here’s an article about the real-life events that inspired the movie.) So how does Pressler fit in? It turns out that his role was largely happenstance. Pressler, then a first-term Republican who had weighed a run for president in 1980, was ""presented to the agents as a sudden substitute for the legislator they expected, who had decided against attending such a meeting,"" according to John Good, the FBI supervisor who oversaw the Abscam operation, in a July 23, 1982, New York Times article. Here’s how Pressler recalled what happened, in a first-person article published last year in the Huffington Post. In the fall of 1979, shortly after I concluded my dark-horse candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, a prominent Washington, D.C. socialite, who was serving as one of my volunteer fundraisers, informed me that some wealthy people were eager to meet me and talk about contributing to my campaign deficit. As a relatively unknown first-term senator from South Dakota, I had few deep-pocketed supporters, and so I jumped at the chance to follow up on my fundraiser's promising lead. However, since it was illegal for a member of Congress to discuss fundraising on federal property, I agreed to meet the prospective donors in a home they were renting a short distance from the Capitol. On the appointed day, we arrived at a two-story redbrick colonial home on fashionable W Street. Inside, the house was furnished with exquisite antiques, elegant chandeliers and, as I would later learn, a battery of hidden television cameras and microphones. … One of the FBI imposters I met that day was a swarthy man who appeared to be from the Middle East. He told me that he represented a prominent sheik who was seeking entry to the United States for himself and a number of his associates and who needed special bills passed by Congress to allow them to avoid the usual immigration procedures. He then offered to make an under-the-table payment if I would play ball. ""Wait a minute!"" I said. ""What you are suggesting may be illegal. I would never do anything in exchange for a campaign contribution."" And with that, I stormed out of the house. Ultimately, Pressler was never charged in Abscam, since he was one of the few officials approached who rejected a bribe outright. His actions won him plaudits from Federal District Court Judge George C. Pratt in upholding the convictions of seven Abscam defendants: Neither Pressler nor another target ""apparently knew he had been brought before the sheik's representatives to be offered money in return for a promise of favorable legislative action,"" Pratt wrote. ""However, neither one was overwhelmed by the circumstances, and each declined the offer. Pressler, particularly, acted as citizens have a right to expect their elected representatives to act. He showed a clear awareness of the line between proper and improper conduct, and despite his confessed need for campaign money, and despite the additional attractiveness to him of the payment offered, he nevertheless refused to cross into impropriety."" CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, at the time the epitome of credibility in the media, singled out Pressler’s actions for praise. And U.S. Senate historian Donald Ritchie told PolitiFact that he considered the ad’s claim to be correct. Syndicated cartoonist Jim Berry even drew a cartoon of Pressler being greeted by the Greek philosopher Diogenes, who was known for carrying a lantern in the hopes of finding an honest man somewhere in the world. The caption was, ""Senator Pressler? I am Diogenes. I've been looking for you."" Our ruling Pressler said that ""American Hustle shows the FBI making real-life bribes to Washington politicians. I know, because as your U.S. senator, I turned them down."" Pressler’s retelling fits with the description of the facts published in the media at the time -- actions that drew praise from a federal judge who wrote that Pressler ""showed a clear awareness of the line between proper and improper conduct"" and ""refused to cross into impropriety."" We rate Pressler’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CD9980>],/factchecks/2014/mar/04/larry-pressler/larry-pressler-recalls-role-rejecting-abscam-bribe/

Palin: I predicted Obama's win would trigger a Russian invasion into Ukraine
","Plenty of people criticized Sarah Palin as a foreign policy lightweight in 2008. But do the developments in Ukraine vindicate the former Republican vice presidential candidate? That’s at least what Palin suggested in a Facebook post to her audience of 4 million people. ""I could see this one from Alaska. I'm usually not one to Told-Ya-So, but I did,"" she posted on her Facebook page Friday. Within a few days, more than 71,000 people had ""liked"" the post. Palin went on to describe her ""accurate prediction,"" quoting herself from the 2008 campaign trail:   ""After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Sen. Obama's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage Russia's (Vladimir) Putin to invade Ukraine next."" Palin also took a victory lap Monday on Fox News. ""Anyone who carries the commonsense gene would know that Putin doesn't change his stripes,"" Palin, the former governor of Alaska, told Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""He hearkens back to the era of the czars, and he wants that Russian empire to grow again. He wants to exert huge power and dominance. So he has to get to those border areas and he has to capture them."" A reader on reddit asked us to look into Palin’s prediction and to see if things played out as she said they would in 2008. We did not hear back from Palin, but we'll update this item if we do. Palin’s 2008 statement in context Palin’s comments about Ukraine came during an Oct. 21, 2008, speech in Reno, Nev. (You can watch them for yourself here.) Palin first mockingly thanked Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden, who days earlier said that Americans need to ""gird your loins"" for an international crisis if Obama was elected. ""Watch, we’re gonna have an international crisis, a generated crisis, to test the mettle of this guy,"" Biden said. Palin then turned to Obama’s foreign policy positions, criticizing Obama for: Saying he would negotiate with Iran without preconditions; Saying that he was ready to send American forces into Pakistan without that country’s approval; Wanting to withdraw American troops out of Iraq, ""meaning our troops would have to go back to Iraq."" At that point Palin turned to Ukraine, and uttered the quote she referenced in her Facebook post. ""After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Sen. Obama's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage Russia's Putin to invade Ukraine next."" Palin said that day, ""I want a president with the experience, judgment, wisdom and truthfulness to meet the next international crisis, or better yet, to avoid it."" A prediction? And the connection between Georgia and Ukraine It is clear Palin suggested Russia might invade Ukraine. But did she predict it? And did it happen because of Obama’s reaction to Russia’s incursion into another former Soviet republic, Georgia, in 2008? Back then Obama wasn't president, George W. Bush was. ""Palin did not predict anything; she laid out a possibility,"" said Mark Beissinger, director of the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies at Princeton University. ""Her exact words are not exactly a prediction, but a comment that suggests it raised the probability that Putin would act against Ukraine in the future,"" said Mark Brawley, professor of international relations, McGill University. Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington academic center, had similar reservations. But he doesn’t quibble that she pointed to Ukraine as a geopolitical flash point. ""She did raise the scenario,"" O’Hanlon said. ""So I'd give her half credit."" Trickier, our experts said, was Palin’s 2008 words linking Obama’s ""indecision"" about Georgia and forthcoming aggression in Ukraine. It’s a point where a definitive answer is not possible. When fighting broke out between Russia and Georgia, both Obama and his Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain, condemned the violence. Obama told reporters, ""Russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of Georgia. There is no possible justification for these attacks."" McCain was quicker to blame Russia than Obama. At first, Obama left room to criticize both sides in the conflict, largely because Georgia had been the first to attack, which then drew an overwhelming Russian response. However, Obama soon toughened his rhetoric against Russia. Setting aside Palin’s desire to characterize Obama’s words to the advantage of the McCain campaign, Beissinger told us that Palin could have just as easily aimed her words at Bush as at Obama. ""Bush was president at the time of the August 2008 Russian invasion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia,"" Beissinger said. ""The U.S. essentially did nothing at the time."" If Putin was thinking of Georgia before he sent troops into Ukraine, it wasn’t necessarily due to anything Obama had said or done. The pattern of the American response in 2008 might have spoken louder than any policy pronouncement. The topic was debated Monday on Erin Burnett OutFront on CNN between liberal political pundit Peter Beinart and Mark Wallace, who served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Bush. Wallace was critical of Obama for some of his moves vis a vis Russia. But he said, ""Certainly we're not responsible for Putin's intractable actions in Russia and invading Crimea."" Beinart, a political science professor at City University of New York, said the relevant history goes back a lot further than Georgia. ""When the Soviets went into Budapest in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower did not risk U.S. lives. When the Soviets went into Prague in 1968, Lyndon Johnson did not risk U.S. lives,"" Beinart said. ""This is a tragic situation. We have to do whatever we can for Ukraine. But it has been a long-established fact that the United States is not going to risk significant U.S. casualties to fight a war with Russia near Russia's soil. And that fundamental reality, as much as we can try sanctions, as much as we can try diplomacy, is a fact before Barack Obama and after Barack Obama."" Still, this has happened on Obama’s watch and there is the question of how to characterize his foreign policy. O’Hanlon sees two faces in the Obama record. ""(It) included some elements of resolve, such as troop increases in Afghanistan and killing bin Laden, and some of restraint or passivity, as in Syria,"" O’Hanlon said. Finally, Palin’s statement has little to do with the particular events that led up to the Ukrainian crisis. Putin firmly backed his political ally, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, and faced a stinging defeat when protests and broad dissatisfaction led the Ukrainian parliament to unseat him. Keith Darden, a professor at the School of International Service at American University, said Palin turned out to be correct but for the wrong reasons. In Ukraine, Darden said, Russia’s vital interests are at risk. ""It was not a lack of U.S. credibility that is implicated here, certainly not because of our actions on Georgia,"" Darden said. ""Indeed, if the Georgian war had never happened, we would still see what happened this week."" One last note, while Palin was eager to celebrate her Ukraine ""prediction,"" the other items on her check list have not materialized as she warned. Among other things, Iran now is working within a 6-month pilot treaty to back off its nuclear program and when the U.S. did send troops into Pakistan, it was to kill Osama bin Laden, a move generally supported across the American political spectrum. Iraq remains violent and unstable, but American forces have not returned. Our ruling Palin said she predicted that Obama’s response to Russian military action in Georgia in 2008 would encourage Russia one day to invade Ukraine. The outside experts we reached did not find her words in 2008 to be a clear prediction, but they give her credit for accurately highlighting a place where a crisis in fact emerged. They did not agree with the logic behind her claim, however, and said there's a lot more to the story -- namely a history of America avoiding confrontation with Russia in its direct spheres of influence. Ultimately, whether Obama's actions somehow encouraged Putin and Russia to invade Ukraine is something Palin cannot prove. Her claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968977C0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/04/sarah-palin/palin-i-predicted-obama-win-would-trigger-russian-/
"['City Government', 'Virginia', 'Dwight Jones']","
Mayor Jones says Redskins training camp deal ""generated $40 million in new private investment""
","Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones says the development deal that brought the Washington Redskins’ summer training camp to the city has paid off in a big way. ""The plan generated $40 million in new private investment in the city,"" he said in his Jan. 30 State of the City Address. We wondered whether Jones’ figure is correct. The deal, signed at the close of 2012, set up a series of agreements between the city, the Redskins and Bon Secours Richmond Health Systems involving three properties. The Redskins camp opened last summer on a 17-acre parcel on West Leigh Street that the city’s Economic Development Authority is leasing from the state. The city shelled out $10 million for construction of a two-story office building and practice fields. Bon Secours agreed to pay the city $3.2 million for the naming rights to the facility, and that’s why it’s officially called The Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center. The hospital system also is leasing the first floor of the new building for use as a men’s health center when the Redskins are not in their three-week training camp, a deal that could generate another $3.1 million for Richmond over six years. So Bon Secours will invest as much as $6.3 million in the training facility over the next six years. The city is hoping to generate more money by finding tenants for the vacant second floor of the building.   In exchange for being the major sponsor of the Redskins camp, Bon Secours was given a 60-year lease to the city-owned Westhampton School site on Patterson Avenue to house its School of Nursing and School of Imaging. The final part of the deal calls for Bon Secours to expand Richmond Community Hospital in the city’s East End, which needs medical facilities. Jones’ claim that the plan has generated $40 million in private investment ""is based on taxable improvements"" from the development of the three properties, according to Tammy Hawley, the mayor’s press secretary. The figure comes from adding the projected construction prices for the improvements on each site: That comes to a total of $42.5 million. Jones spoke in the past tense, as if the investments already have been made. But in fact, very little private money has been spent so far. Construction at the Westhampton School and Richmond Community Hospital has not begun. Both projects are in planning stages with no firm dates set for start or completion, according to Charlotte Perkins, performance management officer for Bon Secours. In addition, the contracts for these two projects can be voided. Bon Secours can pull out of the Richmond Community Hospital expansion if it is unable to acquire needed properties. It would have to pay a $2.5 million penalty to the city over 10 years. Bon Secours can withdraw from the Westhampton School project if it is unable to meet zoning requirements. As for the Redskins camp, the $10 million construction cost was paid by the city, not private investors. Jones, in his speech, said Richmond has largely recouped that money through selling naming rights and leasing office space in the building to Bon Secours. But by the end of March, the city is due to have received only about $1.82 million. According to contracts, Bon Secours will have paid seven months rent totaling $160,400 and made the first two of four annual installments of $831,250 for the naming rights. We’ll mention again that Bon Secours could be obligated to make as much as $6.3 million in total rent and naming rights payments to the city through the summer of 2019. Richmond is hoping to add to its take by leasing the vacant second floor of the building at the training site. The Redskins do not pay rent for use of the building and fields during their summer training. If the Westhampton School project pans out, the city will receive $5,000 in annual lease payments from Bon Secours over 60 years. That comes to a total of $300,000. In addition, the hospital system has agreed to pay the city $1 million over 10 years to help public schools. Our ruling Jones said the three-part development deal that brought the Redskins training camp to Richmond ""generated $40 million in new private investment in the city."" The mayor offered a solid estimate of the total construction costs. But he spoke in past tense, as if the money already has been spent. For the most part, it hasn’t. No start dates have been established for two of the projects totaling $32.5 million: Bon Secours’ expansion of Richmond Community Hospital and its redevelopment of Westhampton School. Important contractual conditions first must be fulfilled. The Redskins training facility, which opened last summer, was built with $10 million of city money. Richmond, at the end of March, will have recovered $1.82 million of that money through the sale of naming rights and the leasing of office space at the facility to Bon Secours. That number could grow to as much as $6.3 million over the next five years. No doubt, the three projects have the potential to generate $40 million in private investment. But the mayor is counting the checks before they’ve been written.
