PAC blames Ted Strickland for Iran deal he didn't vote on
","A conservative group that supports gay rights accused Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland of supporting the Iran deal despite the country’s cruelty to women, Christians and gays. As the video flashes images of women wearing hijabs and children in distress, the words ""Ted Strickland: $150 billion for Iran"" appear. The script says, ""In Iran, a woman’s life is worth half her husband’s. Christians, persecuted. It’s illegal to be gay. People stoned, beaten and hanged for what they believe, how they were born, and who they love."" Then the ad pivots to Strickland, and says that he ""supported giving billions to that regime -- without concessions for human rights violations -- when we had leverage."" The kicker: ""Ted Strickland didn’t stand up for the vulnerable. That’s why we can’t trust him to stand up for us."" The digital ad is paid for by American Unity PAC, a group that describes itself as ""focused exclusively on protecting and promoting candidates for U.S. Congress who support freedom for all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity."" Considering that Strickland was not in an elected office when Congress voted to approve the Iran nuclear deal in September 2015, it seems like an odd jab. We took a closer look at Strickland’s role. American Unity PAC did not respond to our inquiry. Strickland favored Iran deal The purpose of the Iran nuclear agreement was to reduce the likelihood and ability of Iran to develop weapons-grade nuclear material, and to prevent development of nuclear weapons. In exchange, the U.S. agreed to end its freeze on Iranian assets. What did Strickland have to do with the agreement? He was not in office at the time, having served as governor from 2007 to 2011. In August 2015, his Senate campaign released a statement in favor of the deal. ""Everyone agrees we must prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and there is no question that this strong, enforceable agreement with the support of the UN Security Council is a far better way to achieve that goal than war,"" Strickland said. But the ad goes further to say Strickland supported $150 billion to Iran. PolitiFact visited this topic in August 2015, after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Iran gets ""$150 billion"" in the deal. PolitiFact rated that claim Half True. Much of the money Iran gets in the deal was Iran’s to begin with, but it was inaccessible due to international sanctions, said Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University. And the commonly repeated $150-billion figure is too high of an estimate. Sutton told PolitiFact Ohio, ""The U.S. agreed to end the freeze on Iranian assets that was imposed after the 1979 Iranian revolution and hostage crisis. It totals, at most, $100 billion, not $150 billion."" Leverage The ad says that the Iran nuclear deal gave the country billions ""without concessions for human rights violations, when we had leverage."" But there are separate, existing sanctions in place with regard to Iran’s human rights abuses. As the White House clarified, after the deal, ""U.S. statutory sanctions focused on Iran’s support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and missile activities will remain in effect and continue to be enforced."" The National Iranian American Council reported that even after the lifting of sanctions in the nuclear deal, ""Iran will remain one of the most sanctioned jurisdictions in the world."" The concessions that were made in exchange for constraints on Iran’s nuclear program ""in no shape or form"" diminish the U.S. ability to confront human rights violations in Iran, they said.   ""Supporting this agreement does not imply that Strickland supports all of the egregious, unjust practices of Iran highlighted in the ad,"" Sutton said. ""By comparison, the United States under all presidents has maintained an alliance with Saudi Arabia, including weapons sales, but that does not imply sanctioning or support for gender segregation and the harsh punishments used in Saudi Arabia, like stoning adulterers."" Sutton pointed out that several countries that have political and diplomatic relationships with the United States -- such as like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nigeria -- and are places where female genital mutilation has been documented. Maintaining those ties does not equate to a nod in support of female genital mutilation. Our ruling An American Unity PAC digital ad claims that Strickland supported giving $150 billion to Iran without a commitment from that regime to stop its harsh treatment of Christians, gays and women. Strickland said he supported the Iran nuclear deal last year during his campaign, but he didn't hold federal office when the deal was completed and he didn't vote in favor of it. There are other problems with the ad. For one, the $150 billion estimate is too high, experts say. Also, separate U.S. sanctions for human rights violations remain in place and continue to be enforced. And Strickland’s symbolic support of the deal wasn’t tacit approval of Iran’s persecution of women, non-Muslims, and homosexuality. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/86ba6f86-061f-4d6a-aece-53fb53453cc0",/factchecks/2016/sep/15/american-unity-pac/pac-blames-ted-strickland-iran-deal-he-didnt-vote/

Marco Rubio's ad says Patrick Murphy embellished University of Miami college degree
","Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio says that U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy ""has trouble with the truth."" In a TV ad, Rubio said that his Democratic opponent misled voters about his work experience and educational background. The ad includes a clip of a WPTV news anchor Michael Williams on May 23 saying: ""Murphy embellished, according to reports, his University of Miami academic achievement."" Rubio’s ad -- the first during the general election -- makes several other claims about Murphy’s resume and record in Congress which we have previously fact-checked -- and we will explain those in more details later. Here we will focus on whether Murphy embellished his college record. Murphy’s college degree The ad is largely based on findings by the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times on May 23 about how Murphy had characterized his educational background. The Herald/Times reported that Murphy's congressional office and Senate campaign websites claimed he graduated with ""degrees in accounting and finance"" from the University of Miami. But in reality, he had a single degree based on two areas of study. In 2006, Murphy graduated with a bachelor’s in business administration, with his major areas of study being accounting and finance. Murphy’s campaign spokeswoman, Galia Slayen, told the Herald/Times in May that the embellishments were unintentional. After the Herald/Times pointed it out to the Murphy campaign, it  changed the language to reflect a single degree on both websites. But this wasn’t the first time he had claimed dual degrees, the Herald/Times found. On his campaign website during his first U.S. House race in 2012, Murphy claimed ""earning dual bachelor’s degrees."" In January 2013 as he started his first term, Murphy told Port St. Lucie local access TV, ""I got a dual degree, actually, in finance and accounting."" After he won his Treasure Coast seat, Murphy’s House and re-election campaign biographies cited a single bachelor’s degree. Then the claims about ""dual degrees"" surfaced when he announced his U.S. Senate campaign in 2015. For example, on March 24, 2015, his House website stated: ""He earned his B.S. in business administration from the University of Miami, graduating with dual degrees in accounting and finance."" A University of Miami spokeswoman, Megan M. Ondrizek, told PolitiFact Florida that Murphy earned a bachelor of business administration in 2006. ""He had double majors—one in Finance and one in Accounting,"" she said. ""It is a single degree with a double major. A double major completes the requirements for one degree but two majors."" Alexandra Bassil told the Herald/Times in May that although the university offers separate degrees in accounting and finance, students ""are not permitted to pursue dual degrees in those two subjects."" ""Often, students who double-major make the mistake of saying they have two degrees,"" Bassil said. Murphy’s campaign spokesman Joshua Karp told PolitiFact Florida that the website language was ""an innocent mistake."" ""Previous versions of the biography were accurate,"" Karp said. ""Of course Patrick has a dual major in finance and accounting. The ad doesn’t provide the context: this was fixed and we owned up to it."" Other claims in Rubio’s ad Rubio’s ad also includes clips from a CBS4 Miami report that ""Murphy has never been a licensed CPA in Florida"" and that ""Murphy was not a small business owner."" That is similar to attacks made in a TV ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee that Murphy ""never worked as a CPA"" and was ""never a small business owner."" Although Murphy has oversold his resume, it’s an exaggeration to say he ""never"" worked in those capacities so we rated that claim Mostly False. But Rubio’s wording about Murphy’s CPA record is slightly different because he refers to where he got his license. Murphy obtained his CPA license from Colorado while working at Deloitte and Touche in Florida. That means Murphy could still work on audits but couldn’t sign them since he didn’t have a Florida license. Rubio’s ad also says, ""No wonder a non-partisan study ranked Murphy one of the least effective members of Congress."" An American Future Fund ad said that ""Murphy was named one of America's least effective congressmen,"" which we rated Mostly False, because it was based on a much-criticized analysis. (The ad cites a Tampa Bay Times blog about a ranking by InsideGov in 2015.) Our ruling Rubio’s TV ad says, ""Murphy embellished, according to reports, his University of Miami academic achievement."" Murphy has described his University of Miami record in conflicting ways in recent years. On his congressional office and U.S. Senate campaign websites he said he had ""dual degrees"" when in fact he had a single degree with a double major in two areas of study: accounting and finance. When the Herald/Times pointed out the inaccuracy, his campaign said it was an error and fixed it. Murphy had also referred to ""dual degree"" at times in the past while other times his websites reflected a single degree.

Greg Abbott says if Texas were a country, its economy would rank 10th in world
","CORRECTION, 2:50 p.m., Sept. 15, 2016: After this fact check posted, readers pointed out we'd presented Texas and California GDP figures in billions of dollars when relevant figures actually reflected productivity in the trillions of dollars. We made appropriate changes. Our rating of the claim didn't change. In a tweet adorned with images of a rocket, a wind turbine, a steer, a factory and a microscope, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared: ""If Texas were a country, it would have the 10th highest GDP in the world."" If so, that’s gained ground. When we looked into a 2012 claim comparing productivity in Texas versus the nations of the world, Texas ranked 14th internationally. So, we decided to put Abbott’s statement to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. The fine print in Abbott’s tweet states that it's based on information from Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, and from the International Monetary Fund and Bureau of Economic Analysis. When we asked, Lauren Willis of the comptroller’s office emailed us its chart indicating that in 2015, Texas had a gross domestic product of $1.59 trillion -- placing it 10th among countries behind the U.S. ($17.95 trillion) and eight countries including Brazil ($1.77 trillion). The chart shows Texas ahead of No. 11 Canada ($1.55 trillion) as well as Korea, Russia, Australia, Spain, Mexico and four other countries. GDP, the most-used measure of national economic output, is defined as the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in country.  SOURCE: Email, Lauren Willis, director of communications, Office of Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Sept. 6, 2016 For our part, we found 2015 GDP figures posted in April 2016 by the International Monetary Fund matching the GDP figures in the comptroller’s chart. Willis also pointed out a World Bank breakout of GDPs by nation for 2015; the presented figures didn’t perfectly align with the comptroller’s chart, we found, though the ranking of the top 10 countries did.  Willis also sent a web link to the bureau’s U.S. and state-by-state GDP figures for 2015 and previous years. From the BEA, we downloaded figures indicating that in 2015, Texas had the GDP of $1.59 trillion that Abbott relied on. Then again, more populous California had a GDP of $2.46 trillion, which would have placed the Golden State No. 6 in the world if it were a nation, nudging Texas to No. 11. We recently found too that California in 2015 had greater per-capita productivity than Texas.  SOURCE: Website, ""Regional Economic Accounts, Gross Domestic Product, Interactive Tables"" Bureau of Economic Analysis, last updated June 14, 2016 (GDP figures downloaded Sept. 6, 2016) Our ruling Abbott said that if Texas were a country, its economy would rank 10th in the world. That’s so, figures show, if you leave out a bigger state, California. Considering California, in fairness, Texas would rank 11th in the world. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Old stat on girls, schooling and infant mortality falls short
","In development circles, no one quibbles that it’s good to educate girls. There’s plenty of evidence that it helps them and if they become mothers, that it helps their children. The head of the United Nations' World Food Programme Ertharin Cousin was in Armenia on Sept. 5, 2016, to talk about the importance of child nutrition and in the course of her speech, she mentioned a talking point on this topic that has been in play for decades. ""One extra year of schooling for girls reduces infant mortality rates among their children by up to 10 percent,"" Cousin said. It turns out, there are problems with Cousin’s claim. As often happens, this is a statement that has morphed over time, shifting from a more cautious assertion to a more definitive one. We’ll give you the highlights. The origins, changes to the 10 percent claim Staff at the World Food Programme told us they got their figure from UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. It was part of a 2011 collection of illustrations and talking points called Education Counts and this graphic was among them.  It reads: ""Each extra year of a mother’s schooling reduces the probability of infant mortality by 5% to 10%."" Before we jump into stat forensics mode, it’s important to say that UNESCO has retired this talking point. The way they put it now in their 2016 global education monitoring report is, ""Achieving universal secondary schooling would make a meaningful contribution to reducing infant and child mortality."" In short, the new statement drops the precision of the old. Yet there are numbers that come along with that new, broader statement. ""If all women in sub-Saharan Africa had upper secondary education by 2030, it would prevent 3.5 million deaths from 2050-60,"" UNESCO spokeswoman Katharine Redman told us. UNESCO’s wording clearly changed between 2011 and 2016 and it’s useful to note the details. They moved from talking about infant mortality to infant and child mortality. That’s important because the research on the tie between a mother’s education and the health of her children looked at the number of children who died before they turned 5 years old (child mortality), not the number who died before their first birthday (infant mortality). That research includes a seminal article from 1993, and a key 2010 survey of data from 175 countries that UNESCO in particular has relied on. Both found that more education for women is associated with lower child mortality rates. They did not measure infant mortality. So strictly speaking, UNESCO’s 2011 statement was a bit off when it came out. Does the distinction between infant and child mortality matter? It depends on who you ask. Health statistician Michael Stoto at Georgetown University said the two are highly correlated, so as one changed, so would the other. But Jishnu Das, a World Bank economist who studies both education and health, said in countries such as India, infant and child mortality rates take different paths. ""The child mortality rate has consistently declined while the infant mortality rate is roughly the same over a fairly long time period,"" Das said. The difference has implications for the role of maternal education. Deaths in infancy, Das told us, tend to come from complications that hit within the first few days after birth. On the other hand, deaths up to the fifth birthday relate more to ""what’s going on with the household."" While the education level of the mother can improve the odds in both cases, Das said her decisions have a bigger impact on the health of older children. Knowing the importance of getting kids vaccinated and recognizing the danger of diarrhea are just two ways that can play out. UNESCO’s latest claim also backed away from the simple equation that each additional year of schooling would cut the child mortality rate. Instead, the agency now looks at the effect of blocks of education -- primary, lower secondary (middle school) and upper secondary (high school). So Cousin’s statement is relying on data that is no longer supported by its authors. But you can still find the organization’s old material on the Internet. Similarly, we noticed how the claim has morphed over time. In 1993, a Yale economist wrote ""An added year of maternal education tends to be associated with a fairly constant percentage decline in child mortality rates .. between 5 and 10 percent. By 2004 researchers cited that work as ""An extra year of girls’ education can reduce infant mortality by 5–10 percent."" And by 2015, the same 1993 chapter was cited as saying ""an extra year of girls’ education cuts infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent."" The differences are subtle, but they all change the meaning of the statistic and the validity of supporting research. It’s not all education Researchers Das and Stoto both emphasized that so many aspects of life can be in flux as schooling increases that it’s tough to untangle the underlying dynamics. At the same time a country opens more classrooms for young women, it might also be building new health clinics and improving the local water supply. All those changes would give newborns and toddlers better odds of survival. Emily Hannum, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist, told us there can be many reasons for the association. ""These could range from delayed marriage and increased age at childbearing, to lower fertility, to better access to or greater utilization of health care, to improved access to information about healthy parenting practices,"" Hannum said. Emmanuela Gakidou at the University of Washington is a key researcher in this field. Gakidou oversaw the 2010 research that supplied UNESCO with much of its data. Gakidou speaks cautiously about the impact of schooling on mortality rates. ""It’s hard to ascribe causality, but the data and analyses on this topic are robust enough that I think we can say that education among women of reproductive age leads to improved child survival,"" she told us. ""Other factors are also important, of course."" Gakidou’s research did find that across the globe, one additional year of schooling is associated with a 10 percent decline in the child mortality rate, but Gakidou cautioned against thinking that would apply in any particular country. ""That’s the average effect at the global level and across all levels of education,"" she said. Our ruling The head of the World Food Programme said that one extra year of schooling for girls reduces the infant mortality rates among their children by up to 10 percent. Broadly speaking, the association between more education of young women and better odds for their offspring is real. But this claim suffers from several flaws. It speaks of infant mortality when the underlying research addressed child mortality. It asserts a causal link when the data, while very suggestive, don’t fully prove the point. And it treated every year of schooling the same. Perhaps most important, UNESCO, the source that the World Food Programme relied on, has distanced itself from this statistic. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/15/ertharin-cousin/old-stat-girls-schooling-and-infant-mortality-fall/

Kaine accurately recalls the time Gadhafi had a tent put up on Trump's estate
","Tim Kaine says Donald Trump has a fondness for dictators, including the late Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. During a speech in Wilmington, N.C., Kaine said Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, even was willing to host to the Libyan president, in 2009, two years before rebels killed Gadhafi during a NATO air campaign in that country. ""When Moammar Gadhafi was set to visit the United Nations, and no one would let him stay in New York, Trump allowed Gadhafi to set up an elaborate tent at his Westchester County (New York) estate,"" Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said on Sept. 6. Sarah Peck, the Virginia communications director for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign, pointed us to a June 7 article in BuzzFeed News about the tent episode. BuzzFeed examined Trump’s rental of his estate to Gadhafi during the Libyan leader’s September 2009 trip to New York City, where the dictator gave a rambling address to the U.N. General Assembly. BuzzFeed noted that when Gadhafi traveled, he often did so with a North African-style tent where he could stay overnight. Before the New York trip, Libyan officials sought permission to put a tent in Central Park in Manhattan, but the North African dictator’s request was denied, according to press reports. They also sought to put the tent in Englewood, N.J., just outside the city, but local officials there balked. The tent instead was erected on Trump’s 213-acre Seven Springs estate in Bedford, a suburb north of New York City. The Journal News, a local newspaper covering that town, reported in a Sept. 24, 2009, article that Gadhafi’s plans were to entertain guests at Trump’s estate. The Libyan campsite there included the camel-patterned tent, a couch, chairs, a satellite dish and a fire pit. Those living quarters were put up without any approval from Bedford officials, who were miffed at the possibility that the notorious dictator was going to visit their town. Amid the controversy, the news media descended on the upscale neighborhood surrounding Trump’s estate to chronicle the tent flap. Bedford officials ordered the tent taken down, saying it violated zoning laws. Trump, through a spokeswoman, said in a statement that he had asked the Libyans to take down the tent. The Libyans complied but only for a while. They put it back up amid reports Gadhafi was planning to visit the estate. Town officials, under police escort, went onto the property and ordered the tent struck yet again. The tent was taken down again and hauled away the next day. Joel Sachs, Bedford’s town attorney, told us there’s no indication Gadhafi ever made it to the property. Local news reports said the Libyan leader never got to see the estate. Sachs told The Journal News in 2009 that officials at the estate said one of Gadhafi’s sons did venture to Seven Springs. Gadhafi ended up staying at Libya’s U.N. mission in midtown Manhattan. Sachs told us this week that Trump, in 2009, denied to town officials that he knew Gadhafi was the one renting space on his property, telling the town he thought it was being leased by some of his Middle Eastern business associates. Sachs said he didn’t find the denial plausible and told us that officials at the estate indicated Trump was aware of Gadhafi’s plans to use the property. The Associated Press has noted that in in the years after the episode, Trump acknowledged he rented the property to Gadhafi. ""I made a lot of money with Gadhafi,"" Trump said in a June 5, 2016, interview on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""If you remember, he came to the country, and he had to make a deal with me because he needed a place to stay. And he paid me a fortune, never got to stay there. And it became sort of a big joke,"" Trump said. During an interview five years earlier on Fox News, Trump made similar comments. ""I rented him a piece of land … and then I didn’t let him use the land,"" Trump said, according to the transcript of the March 21, 2011, Fox interview. ""I don’t want to use the word ‘screw,’ but I screwed him. That’s what we should be doing. I rented him a piece of land in Bedford, New York. I rented him a piece of land. He paid me a fortune, and I didn’t let him use the land."" Trump also addressed the issue in a 2011 CNN interview. ""What did I do with Gadhafi? I leased him a piece of land for his tent,"" Trump said. BuzzFeed reported in its article that a Libyan entourage had stayed at Trump’s estate for weeks before Gadhafi’s visit to New York, as did members of a public relations firm representing Libya. Our ruling Kaine said, ""When Moammar Gadhafi was set to visit the United Nations, and no one would let him stay in New York, Trump allowed Gadhafi to set up an elaborate tent at his Westchester County (New York) estate."" There’s no doubt Gadhafi rented space at Trump’s estate to put up his tent. Trump acknowledges now that he leased land to Gadhafi, although he couches it as a boast to show he snookered the Libyan leader out of a lot of money.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that Hillary Clinton 'has no child care plan'
","In a Sept. 13 campaign event in Aston, Pa., Donald Trump unveiled a new, multi-pronged child care agenda. Trump’s plan would exclude child care costs up to age 13 from the federal income tax, including costs for both stay-at-home family members and paid caregivers. Those who don’t pay income taxes would be eligible to wipe out 50 percent of one parent’s payroll taxes through the earned income tax credit. Trump would also allow dependent-care savings accounts with a 50 percent government match on some contributions, as well as six weeks of paid leave for new mothers. But Trump didn’t stop with his policy offering. Trump accused Clinton -- who started her career at the Children’s Defense Fund and who’s considered child care a signature issue of her political career -- of not having any proposals for parents worried about their child care challenges. ""While critical, meaningful policy work has been done in this area, my opponent has no child care plan,"" Trump said. ""She never will. They'll never evolve into a plan. They'll never get done anyway."" Trump wasn’t the only member of his campaign to make this point. His daughter Ivanka -- who became the first person involved in the campaign to publicly focus on child care policy when she gave an address at the Republican National Convention -- echoed that point in an interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. ""There’s no policy on Hillary Clinton’s website pertaining to any of these issues -- child care, elder care, or maternity leave or paternity leave, for that matter,"" Ivanka Trump said. Ivanka Trump was incorrect about elder care policy not being on Clinton’s website (it’s here) and also wrong about parental leave being absent (it’s here). But since the candidate himself specifically mentioned ""child care,"" we’ll focus on that in this fact-check. Fairly quickly, we found two headings on the issues page of Clinton’s website that seemed to address the question -- one labeled paid family and medical leave and the other titled early childhood education. When we asked the Trump campaign to reconcile these headings with his comment, they responded that those two topics are separate and distinct from ""child care."" The campaign argued that ""child care"" refers to ages 0 to 4 -- before ""early childhood education"" begins at age 4 with preschool. The campaign also said that paid maternity leave is a policy area that’s separate from child care policy. Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who was cited favorably in Trump’s policy proposal, said he has ""never before heard of ‘child care’ being defined as limited to ages 0 to 4."" He added that the Trump campaign’s decision to include children up to age 13 suggests that ""the campaign does not itself define child care in that odd manner."" Still, let’s set aside whether the Trump campaign’s definitions are widely accepted. Instead, let’s use the campaign’s definition to see whether Clinton really has no policies relating to child care for those age 0 to 4. As long as you look deeper than the section headings on her website, Clinton does have policies addressing that age range. Specifically, she says: • ""No family in America (should have to) pay more than 10 percent of its income to afford high-quality child care,"" a goal to be accomplished by ""by significantly increasing the federal government’s investment in child care subsidies and providing tax relief for the cost of child care to working families."" • ""Double our investment in Early Head Start and the Early Head Start–Child Care Partnership program."" (Early Head Start serves infants, toddlers, and pregnant women.) • ""Award scholarships of up to $1,500 per year to help as many as 1 million student parents afford high-quality child care."" • ""Hillary will work to dramatically increase access to child care on campus by increasing funding for campus-based child care centers."" So there are policies on Clinton’s website that address child care for ages 0 to 4. The Trump campaign didn’t respond after we forwarded them these examples. Viard agreed that the Clinton campaign ""clearly has proposals for many aspects of child care, as commonly defined, and even under the odd 0 to 4 definition. Her 10 percent plan would apply to children in that age range, as well as to older children, and Early Head Start is targeted to children under the age of 3."" Our ruling Trump said that ""my opponent has no child care plan."" Even under the campaign’s unusual, age-related definition of policies for children aged 0 to 4, Clinton has several policies to offer on her website. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

Patrick Murphy has voted against 'every' Zika funding bill, Marco Rubio says
","While the Senate bickers over Zika funding, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s campaign says Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has been playing partisan politics over the issue in the House. The same day the Senate failed to approve emergency public health funding to deal with Zika for the third time in three months, Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said Murphy has been an obstructionist. ""Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika,"" she said on Sept. 7, 2016. (By ""only,"" she meant the only general election Senate candidate, comparing Murphy to Rubio.) That doesn’t sound like the position a Florida congressman facing a Zika outbreak would take in an election year, so we checked the record. We should note Rubio has supported high-level funding for Zika efforts, even co-sponsoring a bill with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Perez-Cubas was speaking for Rubio, so we are putting Rubio on the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out Murphy has opposed plenty of Republican-backed funding proposals, but ""every"" is putting it too strong. He still has voted for some measures. Funding malaise President Barack Obama first asked Congress for $1.89 billion in funding in February 2016 to deal with a potential outbreak of Zika. The virus has been linked to cases of infant microcephaly, or babies born with abnormally small heads. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, so focus has been on prevention. There are at least 771 cases of Zika in Florida, including several local transmissions in the Miami area. But that count may not always be the most accurate. Murphy has been involved with other Zika-related bills, including acting as a cosponsor for a Democrat-favored measure (HR 5044) that provided the full amount Obama requested. Those bills have not left committees in the House. A deeply partisan Congress, meanwhile, has fought all year over finding the money for mosquito control, vaccine development, diagnosing the disease, public education campaigns and more. There have been several measures introduced to deal with the disease, but the main focus this summer has been on some legislative wrangling over appropriations bills. House Republicans on May 18 passed a measure (HR 5243) that would have provided $622 million for Zika. With Obama threatening to veto the measure, Murphy voted no on that one with other Democrats. It was not taken up in the Senate. The next day, Murphy voted yes for a bill (HR 4974) that would have allowed the White House to repurpose leftover funding to deal with the 2014 Ebola outbreak and use it for Zika. Rubio’s campaign said this bill didn’t count, because there was no specified dollar amount, and didn’t guarantee the money would be used for Zika, only that it could. But that’s splitting hairs, because HR 4974 still would have provided at least one option to fund Zika-related programs. Now it’s time for a civics lesson, because what the House did next wasn’t covered on Schoolhouse Rock. The House then passed another bill (HR 2557) that was originally about funding for transportation and other agencies. Instead, the bill became a vehicle for Zika funding using language from HR 5243, the Republican measure. The House wanted $622 million for Zika, but cut that money from other programs in order to stay budget-neutral, a process known as recission. The House also added provisions restricting contraception services that Democrats opposed. The Senate wanted $1.1 billion in new funding. The bill went to conference in June to iron out differences. The House agreed to $1.1 billion in funding, as long as about $700 million was found through cutting other areas. Murphy voted against final passage of HR 2577, and against adopting the conference report instituting the changes. The Senate is currently battling over the bill. Senate Democrats have so far blocked a vote three times in three months, wanting a ""clean"" bill with no contraception provisions and the full $1.89 billion originally requested. That’s not the end of the line, however. On June 16, Murphy voted for HR 5293, a bill that would allow the administration to shift money in the Defense Department to help with Zika efforts through that agency. Again, there was no set dollar amount or guarantee that’s how the money would be used, but it was another option in the Zika toolbox. It passed the House but is stuck in the Senate. ""Murphy did vote in favor of two efforts to transfer funds in support of Zika efforts and opposed the major effort in hopes of gaining more funding than the Republicans offered,"" said Steven Smith, a Washington University in St. Louis political science professor. Our ruling Rubio, through a spokeswoman, said, ""Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika."" Murphy, like most congressional Democrats, has opposed Republican-led efforts to conditionally fund anti-Zika efforts at less than what Obama has requested. But he has offered other solutions and voted against his party for two bills that would have allowed unspecified amounts of money to be repurposed for Zika programs. So the campaign was wrong to say he voted against ""every"" measure. We rate Rubio’s statement False.",/factchecks/2016/sep/14/marco-rubio/patrick-murphy-has-voted-against-every-zika-fundin/

No, Donald Trump's foundation money does not come from him
","Donald Trump is facing questions about the work of his personal foundation. Campaigning for Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama accurately said Trump’s charity purchased a six-foot-tall painting of himself. A day before Obama’s speech, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway touted Trump’s altruism in an interview with CNN’s Alisyn Camerota: Conway: ""Donald Trump has been incredibly generous over the course of his life."" Camerota: ""With his own money?"" Conway: ""With his own money, and his foundation's money — which is his money."" Camerota: ""No, the foundation's money are other people's. Conway: ""Okay. He's been incredibly generous. I mean, are we going to actually question -- Hillary Clinton and her husband made almost a quarter of a billion dollars and we're supposed to just question -- and that's okay."" Conway made a point to tell Camerota and viewers that the Donald J. Trump foundation’s money comes from Trump. But that’s at odds at reporting we’ve seen, so we wanted to take a deeper look. Trump has yet to release his tax returns or provide evidence of his charitable giving, so it’s impossible to know how much he’s directly donated. The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold has been trying to track down Trump’s donations for months with little success. Fahrenthold has determined, however, how much money Trump has donated to his foundation by reviewing the foundation’s IRS documents. Based on his reporting, Conway’s claim is inaccurate. ""Donald J. Trump Foundation is Trump’s money, his campaign manager says. No,"" Fahrenthold wrote in a Washington Post article. We reviewed the Trump Foundation Form 990s ourselves and verified Fahrenthold’s conclusion. From 1987, when Trump created the foundation to donate some of his Art of the Deal proceeds, to 2006, Trump was its main contributor. In those three decades, his gifts averaged about $250,000, with the largest one reaching $1 million in 1989. In 2007, Trump gave $35,000, which accounted for about 0.9 percent of the total donations received that year (World Wrestling Entertainment alone gave $4 million). In 2008, he gave $30,000. And then he stopped giving altogether. Here are two charts showing how Trump’s donations to his foundation compare to others’ gifts:  What about the possibility that the money the foundation currently has still belongs to Trump? Fahrenthold told us that doesn’t add up. ""Trump Foundation began 2007 with just $4,238 in the bank. That wasn’t all Trump’s money, but for the sake of argument let’s assume it was. Since then, the available tax records show Trump has given just $65,000, and nothing since 2008. Other donors have given $8.9 million in that time, covering 2007 to 2014,"" he said. By 1995, a year after the foundation received its first non-Trump donation, the Republican nominee’s own money actually stopped being enough to cover his foundation’s charitable giving. And by 2014, the Trump Foundation had given a total of $13.5 million dollars while Trump himself had given it a total of $5.4 million.  It’s possible that Trump gave more of his own money to the foundation in 2015 and 2016, but the tax forms for those years are not yet available. Fahrenthold told us he’s asked the Trump campaign for clarification but hasn’t received a response. We asked as well and haven’t heard back. The ruling Conway said the Donald J.Trump Foundation's money ""is his money."" That may have been accurate several years ago, but no longer. Tax records show Trump hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.

Clinton ad: Trump Management was charged with discriminating against black people
","Black Americans have ""everything"" to lose if Donald Trump becomes president, says a recent ad out of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. ""Trump management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law,"" the ad’s narrator says. The Clinton campaign has run the ad on cable television in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. There has been a lot of reporting on the subject of the Republican nominee’s discrimination lawsuits, so we decided it was about time we looked, too. We found that the government did, in fact, charge Trump and his real estate company with discrimination, in violation of the Civil Rights Act. Back in 1973, Trump was president of his father’s realty company, Trump Management, which operated nearly 40 apartment buildings comprised of about 14,000 residences total, mostly in New York City. In October of that year, the federal government filed a complaint against Trump, his father Fred Trump, and Trump Management. The complaint alleged that the Trumps violated the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, by discriminating against tenants and potential tenants based on their race. ""The defendants, through the actions of their agents and employees, have discriminated against persons because of race in the operation of their apartment buildings,"" the complaint reads. Trump and the government eventually settled the claim, so Trump never admitted guilt, but documents prepared by the government describe numerous allegations of race-based discrimination at more than 15 different Trump Management properties. Many of the incidents involved a black person being told the complex had no availability when apartments were in fact available. For example, one black man asked about two-bedroom apartments at Trump’s Westminster complex in Brooklyn, and a superintendent told him nothing was available. That was March 18, 1972. On March 19, 1972, the black man’s wife, who was white, visited the complex and was offered an application for a two-bedroom apartment on the spot. The government lawyers also interviewed several people who said executives for Trump Management discouraged rental agents from renting to black people. In one case, the government claimed the Trump Management comptroller instructed one rental agent to attach a sheet of paper that said ""C"" for ""colored"" to every application submitted by a person of color. Another rental agent said Fred Trump told him to encourage black tenants to find other housing in order to decrease the black population at that particular complex. Donald Trump called the charges ""absolutely ridiculous,"" according to the New York Times article that originally reported the charges back in 1973. Trump and his company filed a countersuit the following December, claiming the government made baseless charges and asking for $100 million in damages. The court dismissed the countersuit. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment, but they have continued to deny the charges in recent comments to other news outlets. Trump and the government settled the case in 1975. Trump Management agreed to train employees about their obligations under the Fair Housing Act and to launch a two-year marketing program to inform the community about their fair housing practices, including giving a weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, among other requirements. Trump saw the settlement as a success, writing in his 1987 memoir, Art of the Deal: ""In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up taking a minor settlement without admitting any guilt. Instead, we agreed to do some equal-opportunity advertising of vacancies in the local newspaper. And that was the end of the suit."" Experts told us that settlements don’t mean the parties involved are innocent, though. The government settles ""north of 98 percent"" of these kinds of housing discrimination cases, and often fairly quickly, said Robert Schwemm, law professor at the University of Kentucky and an expert in housing discrimination law. And in every settlement, the agreement allows the defendant to say they’re agreeing to take voluntary action to remedy the problem without admitting guilt. ""That doesn’t mean there wasn’t lots of evidence"" against Trump, Schwemm said. The government brought their suit against Trump five years after the Civil Rights Act went into effect. There was plenty of race-based housing discrimination nationwide at that time, Schwemm said. But the government had limited resources dedicated to this issue, so government attorneys prioritized bringing complaints against big ""pattern"" cases that they believed would have a broader impact. Schwemm said of the 20 to 30 Fair Housing Act cases the government brought against fair housing providers in the first five years, he’s only aware of two in New York, including Trump’s, and very few others in cities outside the southern United States. A lot of the housing discrimination at that time was subtle — like taking a black person’s rental application and just never looking at it. The more blatant sort of discrimination alleged in Trump’s case, that they coded applications based on race, was ""not unheard of"" but ""pretty extreme,"" Schwemm said. In 1978, the government wrote a letter to Trump’s lawyers saying they believed the company had violated the settlement by steering black tenants to specific properties, according to the New York Times. But the government ultimately didn’t pursue the case before the settlement terms expired. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Trump Management was charged with discriminating against African-Americans and breaking federal law."" The government in 1973 accused Trump, his father and Trump Management of violating the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The case alleged Trump’s realty company discriminated against non-white tenants and potential tenants at numerous apartment complexes. The government settled the lawsuit, after Trump waged a years-long legal battle, so Trump never admitted guilt. But the company did agree to comply with extensive requirements intended to stop housing discrimination at its properties. Clinton’s claim is carefully phrased. For that, we rate her claim True.",/factchecks/2016/sep/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-ad-trump-management-was-charged-discrimina/

Ted Cruz incorrect about Obama giving control of internet to UN-like body
","Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas says the federal government is about to give away control of the internet. Really? A shift has been in motion, we found, yet not a handoff of all things web. As of October 2016, that is, contractual federal oversight of the California nonprofit that’s managed website domains since 1998--the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers--is set to end in what proponents including ICANN and administration officials describe as a long-planned shift to the greater world community. The transition plans accelerated, according to a March 2014 New York Times news story, in the wake of revelations in documents made public by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the U.S. had been intercepting internet traffic as part of global spying efforts. This summer, Cruz and a fellow Republican, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act to bar any handoff of the internet-related duties unless Congress gives approval. Talking up the proposal, Cruz said in Sept. 8, 2016, floor remarks: ""In 22 short days, if Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations."" Cruz went on to say the administration is ""pushing through a radical proposal to take control of internet domain names and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries."" Cruz warned too that this will empower countries such as Russia, China and Iran to censor speech on the web. Cruz’s backup We sought the basis of Cruz’s statement about the administration giving away control of the internet. By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack noted ICANN is slated to no longer be under contract with the federal government. His email said that under the slated-to-go arrangement, ""only the United States can authorize any changes to the authoritative root zone file, which is used to operate the internet and is essentially the master address book. By giving up those contracts, the United States is, in a very real sense, giving up control of the internet."" By ""root zone file,"" Novack was referring to the nonprofit’s coordination of the domain name system, meaning a text file of the top-level domains that form part of web addresses. Contrary to Novack's characterization, though, the root zone file is not the ""master address book"" of the Internet, Milton Mueller, a professor in the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Public Policy and author of a book on ICANN’s creation, cautioned when we asked. Rather, Mueller said by email, the root zone file ""is just a list of top level domain names (like .COM, .ORG or .EDU)."" Mueller presents a longer description in this September 2015 blog post. Mueller told us the domain name system solely ensures ""that the domain names we use for websites and emails are globally consistent – if you type in an Iranian domain your browser knows where to find it. A lot of other aspects of Internet operations, such as routing, are completely separate from this."" And generally, Mueller said, the internet consists of about 50,000 different private networks worldwide that use the Internet protocols to interconnect. ""All of them operate their part of the Internet,"" Mueller wrote. ""All of them could bypass ICANN if they needed to or wanted to. They all use a common domain name root because it makes the system globally compatible."" Novack further excerpted a 1998 agreement reached by the U.S. Department of Commerce stating, in part, that written direction from a government official shall be requested before ""making or rejecting any modifications, additions or deletions to the root zone file."" By the government giving up that authority, Novack suggested, free speech on the web is at risk. Advocates declare flaws in claim Experts supportive of the pending changes told us there’s a lot wrong in Cruz's claim. First, we connected with ICANN officials who told us the plan is to sever the corporation from its Commerce Department contract as of October 2016, leaving the ""global multistakeholder community""--meaning the private sector, in consultation with technical and intellectual property experts and government representatives--to guide and handle established duties, without a particular country holding oversight. Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of Homeland Security supportive of the shift, wrote in June 2016 that the federal ""stewardship has greatly diminished as the organization (ICANN) has matured from a small operation on a shoestring budget to a large, professional corporation with more than 350 employees in seven offices around the globe. Global stakeholders, including U.S. businesses, end users, technical experts, public interest organizations and academics, oversee ICANN,"" Chertoff wrote. We inquired into the countries that, with the U.S., advise the corporation’s 20-member board, which was chaired as of September 2016 by Steve Crocker, the CEO and co-founder of Shinkuro, Inc., a start-up; he’s also one of the originators of the internet. Samantha Eisner, an ICANN lawyer, confirmed that the 171 countries advising the board include Russia, China and Iran as well as the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. ICANN spokesman James Cole emailed us the full list of participating countries. When we checked, the chair of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee was from Switzerland, its vice chairs from Argentina, Spain, Namibia, Thailand and Turkey. GAC membership, per the web page, stretched to include national governments ""and distinct economies recognized in international fora; and, usually in an observer capacity, multinational governmental and treaty organisations and public authorities (including all the U.N. agencies with a direct interest in global Internet governance such as the ITU, UNESCO and WIPO)."" And according to an advisory committee web page, the panel’s advice must be taken into account by ICANN’s board, which includes a single non-voting Governmental Advisory Committee liaison, ""and where the board proposes actions inconsistent with GAC advice it must give reasons for doing so and attempt to reach a mutually acceptable solution."" So, we asked, might the advisory panel add up to a kind of United Nations? David Conrad, ICANN’s chief technology officer, told us the advisory panel isn’t a mini-UN in part because it’s not a ruling body and any recommendation it makes must be unanimous--meaning any country can stop movement--though the committee can offer information or make suggestions to the board without a consensus. More broadly, Conrad and other ICANN officials stressed, it doesn’t make sense to suggest a country controls the internet which, Conrad said, ""is comprised of a set of privately operated networks which agree to exchange traffic using a common set of protocols. There is no central point of control of the internet at all. So, the idea that the U.S. is somehow giving up control through a contract that its entire purpose is to allow the administration of a set of identifiers is just sort of ludicrous."" Mueller, asked if Cruz’s claim holds up, said by phone: ""There’s no legitimate way for him to get to that conclusion. What he’s doing is fear-mongering and trying to create a bogeyman, which is the United Nations."" Mueller said the whole point of the approaching shift is to keep domain names’ governance away from direct government oversight. Daniel J. Weitzner, an MIT official who told us he worked on the ICANN transition as an Obama administration adviser in the White House and Commerce Department, also responded to our inquiry by phone, saying the push for years has to been to ensure that no one country land the power to oversee the internet. Weitzner called Cruz’s claim ""completely off base. There is no turnover to some nefarious organization."" Separately, Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor expert on ICANN, said by phone the U.S. government can’t give away what it doesn’t own--the internet--and Cruz’s invocation of the U.N. seemed ""rather grandiose"" in that the duties at issue will continue to be overseen by the nonprofit whose board is advised only occasionally, Froomkin said, by the GAC. That said, he noted, the U.S. government will no longer independently contract with ICANN and so it will have less influence that way. Cruz's recommended authorities Novack, apprised that the experts we reached found Cruz’s claim short of factual, urged us to consult others including Phil Kerpen, who heads the conservative American Commitment advocacy group and chairs the Internet Freedom Coalition, which opposes any UN attempts to manage the internet. By email, Kerpen said that in context, Cruz’s claim is accurate; he said Cruz’s reference to control of the internet refers to the about-to-go federal oversight and the UN mention reflects on the GAC which, Kerpen said, can only be overruled by a supermajority of the ICANN board. That’s correct: ICANN’s Cole told us that under revised bylaws, it’ll take 10 (rather than the current nine) of 16 voting board members to spurn GAC advice while, Cole noted, it’ll take even more votes to reject advice from the corporation’s private sector policymaking body, the Generic Names Supporting Organization. Novack also pointed us to Brett Schaefer, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation. By email, Schaefer suggested that while the intended transition wouldn’t lead to ""government ‘control’ of ICANN as would be the case in a UN body, governments will have more authority in ICANN than they do currently."" Schaefer and others said in a Sept. 8, 2016, white paper that governments will also be voting members of the new Empowered Community, which is vested with the power to dismiss the board or individual directors or reject or approve individual bylaw changes. ""Governments have not had a say in these matters before,"" the paper says. By email, ICANN spokeswoman Emily Crane Pimentel confirmed the fresh role for government representatives. Then again, she pointed out, other interest groups also will play new roles per a February 2016 document adopted by the ""multistakeholder community"" and, she said, governments won't end up with more power than other stakeholders. Our ruling Cruz said: ""If Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the internet to an international body akin to the United Nations."" As of October 2016, the U.S. government is set to no longer have a contract to oversee certain internet-related duties having to do with all of us finding websites. The tasks will continue to be handled through a California nonprofit that’s been in place since 1998. Upshot: There’s no pending government handoff of control of the internet that we can see. Also, the member-countries of an advisory panel to the nonprofit’s board can only make a recommendation if every nation agrees; that’s not U.N.-like. We rate this statement False.

Comparing the medical histories of Clinton, Trump, Romney and Obama
","Hillary Clinton's near-collapse at a Sept. 11 memorial service and the subsequent revelation that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier has people wondering about the health of the two major presidential candidates. The Clinton campaign promised more medical data on her health, and Republican Donald Trump pledged to release details of a recent checkup. Both candidates have already released letters from their doctors saying they are healthy enough to be president. Clinton’s team argues that Trump has released less information about his health than Clinton. In an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, Clinton said her two-page 2015 letter from her physician is consistent with what presidential candidates have released in the past. ""You know, you've got a medical report on me that meets the same standard as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama"" when the two ran for president, Clinton said. ""Donald Trump's doctor said he'd be the healthiest president in history. That's just not even serious."" When Cooper asked what additional information she would be supplying, Clinton did not offer any details. ""Well, we're going to be releasing more information, and I think it's fair to say, we've already met the standard of disclosure of past presidential candidates like Mitt Romney and President Obama."" Actually, there is no ""standard"" for the type of medical information that should be released. The experts we consulted agreed. But Clinton's disclosures are on the same level as Obama and Romney in previous elections.  ""There is no 'standard' of medical disclosure, just whatever the voting public is comfortable with,"" said Jerald Podair, professor of history at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. ""This means, of course, that as much secrecy as possible has been the historical norm."" Thus, he said, the public didn't know about Grover Cleveland's cancer, Franklin Roosevelt's paralysis or John Kennedy's Addison’s disease. ""All kept the true nature of their illnesses secret from the American public. Obviously, is is harder to do so today, but as Hillary (‘darn these allergies’) Clinton has shown, the system can still be gamed."" ""This is an imaginary standard set up by candidates,"" said Brooks Simpson, a presidential historian at Arizona State University. Interest in candidate medical records has varied over time. There was a lot of interest when John McCain ran against Obama in 2008. McCain was 71 and had a history of skin cancer. He released 1,173 pages of records going back to 2000. In contrast, medical records were not much of an issue in 2004 when George W. Bush, then 58, sought re-election against John Kerry, then 60. Both were known to be big fitness enthusiasts. Bush had received regular checkups as president but that year decided to have his physical after the election. As CNN reported at the time, ""Neither President Bush nor Senator Kerry have released their full medical records, but there isn't much public pressure for either man to release more details. Americans may want a healthy commander-in-chief, but 61 percent say the president has the same rights as other citizens to keep medical records private, compared to just 38 percent in favor of releasing all information that might affect his ability to serve."" It's more of an issue today, in part, because both candidates are so old. ""These people are in the Ronald Reagan category,"" said Simpson. Trump, if elected, would be the oldest person to assume the presidency. Clinton would be the second oldest behind Reagan. ""Maybe 70 is the new 60, but these people are old,"" Simpson said. ""Neither one has really satisfied issues of disclosure in the public mind,"" although Clinton has been more forthcoming, he said. ""Trump's efforts have been pretty feeble. But the incident on Sunday and the cough just illustrated a personal attack narrative and has given traction to an accusation that her health is less than ideal. This is a way not just to raise questions about candidate health, but about candidate transparency."" When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin acknowledged that there is no real standard. He said the candidate was simply referring to the examples of Obama and Romney as a relevant point of comparison. How do their medical summaries compare?   Candidate Obama Romney Clinton Trump Year 2008 2012 2015 2015 Words in doctor letter 280 535 578 174 Blood pressure 90/60 130/80 100/65 110/65 Heart rate 60 40 72 Not mentioned Triglycerides 44 179 69 Not mentioned Total cholesterol 173 169 195 Not mentioned Good cholesterol 68 Not mentioned 64 Not mentioned Bad cholesterol 96 Not mentioned 118 Not mentioned Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 0.6 Normal Not relevant .015 Allergies mentioned? No Yes Yes No Past health problems detailed? No Yes Yes Yes Family history mentioned? Yes Yes Yes No Because there is no standard, the doctors of different candidates included different levels of detail. The letters for all four candidates gave blood pressure. The letters for Obama, Romney and Clinton offered at least some blood test results, such as total cholesterol. Trump's does not. Family history, a key factor for predicting a person's lifespan or potential health problems, is missing from Trump's letter. The doctors for Clinton and Romney go into more detail about the candidate's past health problems, but that may be because they had some issues in the past. We don't know about Trump's history, but the detailed 2014 health report for Obama once he became president says he's had no significant medical problems, including no surgeries. The most detailed template was Obama’s annual presidential physical. The 2014 report contains far more information than he released when he first ran in 2008. It talks about immunizations. It lists medications (without giving doses), a fasting blood sugar level and cholesterol counts. There's also discussion of the status of his heart, lungs, eyes, head neck, bones, muscles, nerves and skin. ""Probably Hillary is about right since the standard is that most politicians conceal their debilitating illnesses or fabricate (maybe exaggerate) how wonderfully healthy they are,"" said Bert Rockman, professor emeritus of political science at Purdue University. Because of their age, ""there is bound to be something wrong with each of them despite Trump's likely-dictated note to his doctor, which meets the standard of a school boy note."" ""Of course, some candidates are in terrific shape — Romney and Obama, for example, and Carter,"" he said. ""And you likely wouldn't run for president if you were seriously (physically) debilitated,"" putting the cases of Kennedy and Roosevelt aside. ""In other words,"" said Rockman, ""the bar is really low, and Hillary likely met it by historical standards."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""You've got a medical report on me that meets the same standard as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama."" If Romney and Obama exemplify a standard, then the information Clinton has provided to the public is on a comparable level. But Clinton's statement implies a standard that doesn’t really exist, according to the experts. And both the quality and quantity of information on presidential candidates has varied widely. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/166c35be-09a0-4fb1-87c0-ec2491afc7ed",/factchecks/2016/sep/14/hillary-clinton/comparing-medical-histories-clinton-trump-romney-o/

Trump says 1 million legal crossings along U.S.-Mexico border
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump broke from his tough talk on immigration recently to highlight a more positive exchange between Mexico and the United States: legal border crossings. ""The United States and Mexico share a 2,000-mile border, a half a trillion dollars in annual trade and 1 million legal border crossings each and every day,"" Trump said during his visit to Mexico Aug. 31. ""We are united by our support for democracy, a great love for our people and the contributions of millions of Mexican Americans to the United States."" Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto during that same press conference also cited legal crossings, saying, ""We share the most travelled border through which every day, legally, more than a million people cross it and over 400,000 vehicles."" Given the focus on illegal crossings, we decided to take a look at the flip side: Do 1 million people cross the border legally every day? Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for information. Border patrol processings We couldn't find definitive figures pointing to the 1 million estimate. But experts said it sounds reasonable based on figures we do have for U.S. entries and how intertwined cities are in the border region. A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told us that along the southwest border, the daily average number of inbound legal crossings of pedestrians, passengers and crew into the United States has increased in recent years. Legal crossing were 462,793 in fiscal year 2013, 483,501 in 2014, and 507,767 in 2015. CBP said 1 million daily crossings seemed accurate when taking into account outbound crossings, which the agency does not track. An entry is recorded for every visit into the United States from Mexico, so one individual could represent multiple crossings in one day. Transportation Department data, compiled from the Homeland Security Department, reflect similar border flows. Pedestrians and passengers on buses, trains and personal vehicles accounted for about 474,686 entries into the United States per day in fiscal year 2014, according to the department’s border crossing/entry data. In fiscal year 2015, that grew to about 496,660. Reasons for travel The border region includes four U.S. states (California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) and six Mexican states and is home to about 14 million people, according to December 2014 data from the Mexican government. The 2014 figures also say one million people cross the U.S.-Mexico border daily. Border cities like El Paso/Juarez and San Diego/Tijuana ""are really single urban entities divided by an artificial border,"" said Douglas S. Massey, sociology and public affairs professor at Princeton University and director of the university’s Office of Population Research. ""People often live on one side of the border and work on the other and vice versa, with huge movement in both directions,"" Massey said. ""There are also many, many daily trips in both directions for shopping, business and recreation."" The U.S. government also allows Mexican citizens to use Border Crossing Cards to enter the country from Mexico ""by land, or by pleasure vessel or ferry."" Border crossing cards allow people to go back and forth at will, Massey said. Many of the entries from Mexico to the United States also are Americans coming back into the country, Massey said. Crossings have increased since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, he said. ""Legal border crossings at the dozens of ports of entries located along the U.S.-Mexican border significantly benefit both the U.S. and Mexican economies, which is why the numbers continue to rise,"" said Noe Garcia, president of the Border Trade Alliance, a nonprofit advocating for improved border affairs and trade relations among Canada, the United States and Mexico. Trade between the United States and Mexico in 2015 totaled about $583.6 billion, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Commerce Department figures show United States exports of goods and services to Mexico also supported about 1.1 million jobs in 2014. We emailed Mexican officials for their entry tallies, but didn’t get a response. Our ruling Trump said the U.S.-Mexico border has ""1 million legal border crossings each and every day."" Border patrol and Transportation Department data show there are around half a million daily border crossings from Mexico into the United States. While that number doesn’t necessarily represent unique individuals (rather total crossings), the border region is home to about 14 million people, many who cross back and forth between the nations to go to school, work and for recreational purposes. So while there isn’t a hard number pointing to the 1 million total crossings, experts believe it’s a plausible estimate given the needs of the millions of people who live in the border region.

No evidence to back claim that top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has ties to Muslim Brotherhood
","Interviewed on CNN as a Donald Trump surrogate, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy attacked Hillary Clinton for several minutes for having coughing fits and then took aim at one of her longtime aides, Huma Abedin. After the Aug. 23, 2016 exchange turned testy, the Wisconsin Republican told host Brianna Keilar she was the one who raised the coughing issue. Then this back-and-forth about Abedin ensued: Duffy: Why aren’t we talking then about Huma and her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood? Why aren’t we talking about the fact that she was an editor for a pro-Sharia newspaper? Keilar: She doesn’t have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Duffy: The information is out there that she does have these ties. Keilar: Uh, no. The Washington Post Fact Checker has already knocked down Duffy’s allegation. And, when we asked for backup, Duffy’s office cited to us only a New York Post column that didn’t directly allege any ties between Abedin and the Muslim Brotherhood. What is Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brotherhood for years has been cast in a negative light by some Republican politicians. In 2012, then-U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sent a letter to the deputy inspector general of the State Department. At the time, Clinton was secretary of state and Abedin was her deputy chief of staff. Bachmann (now a Trump campaign adviser) asked for an investigation, citing information that claimed Abedin’s mother, brother and late father were ""connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations."" In March 2016, when Trump and then-presidential candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich appeared in Milwaukee for a CNN Republican Town Hall event, Cruz called the Muslim Brotherhood a ""terrorist organization."" But a CNN news report debunked the Texas senator’s claim. The report pointed out that the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist organization with active branches in many Middle Eastern countries that was founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion, but a way of life and advocates for a move away from secularism -- and that it has never appeared on the U.S. State Department’s list of terrorist organizations, although Egypt and several other countries have put the group on their lists. Earlier that month, Cruz and other Republicans had tried to have the Muslim Brotherhood designated as a terrorist group. At the time, U.S. News & World Report described the group as an Egyptian Islamist organization dedicated to instilling Islamic law (Sharia) based on the teachings of the Quran and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. Experts said the group has not been involved in terrorism, rather it has functioned as a social organization and a political organization that participates in elections -- a description similar to one provided in a 2015 article in the Middle East Journal, an academic publication. Recent Abedin references Duffy’s staff cited a Paul Sperry column published two days before Duffy’s CNN interview. The column said that from 1996 to 2008, Abedin was an editor at the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs working under her mother, Saleha Abedin, who remains editor-in-chief. The column called the journal ""a radical Muslim publication that opposed women’s rights and blamed the US for 9/11."" But the column made no mention of the Muslim Brotherhood. An opinion piece by Trump supporter Kenneth Timmerman in The Hill, which  piggybacked on the Sperry column, did mention the brotherhood -- but in a roundabout way, in relation to Abedin. The piece said Abedin’s father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs; that the institute was supported by the Muslim World League; and that the league has been called ""perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world."" The piece also said Abedin’s mother, Saleha Abedin, sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da’wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi. A fact check The Washington Post Fact Checker, after interviewing a number of experts, called the connections ""so tenuous as to be obscure,"" and concluded: Duffy asked why the alleged Muslim Brotherhood connections to Huma Abedin are not being talked about. Perhaps it’s because they are bogus. Abedin has lived in the United States for 23 years, working in the White House, the Senate and the State Department. Vague suggestions of suspicious-sounding connections to her parents don’t pass the laugh test, even at the flimsiest standard of guilt by association. The Fact Checker gave Duffy four pinocchios -- its lowest rating. And we’ve found no evidence to support Duffy’s claim, either. Our rating Duffy says Clinton aide Huma Abedin has ""ties to the Muslim Brotherhood."" Duffy made the claim in the context of stories in the presidential campaign that get relatively little media coverage. But he cited no evidence to back his statement, and we couldn’t find any.

COVID-19 vaccines are not gene therapy and a Forbes article doesn’t say they are
","After an opinion column was published by Forbes, glee emanated from people who believed it to prove an often-disproven claim: that COVID-19 vaccines are actually gene therapy.  ""Pretty sure I got fact-checked for saying this months ago. It’s fine, it’s just a little gene therapy,"" tweeted New Jersey gym owner Ian Smith on Dec. 1, sharing a screengrab of the headline of the Forbes piece that read ""Yes, The Vaccine Changes Your DNA. A Tiny Bit. That’s A Good Thing."" Smith soon added a ""fact-check"" to his post that debunked the claim that the vaccine is gene therapy. But not before a screenshot of Smith’s tweet — and other screenshots of the Forbes headline — took off on social media, with posters claiming the Forbes headline provided proof that the COVID-19 vaccines are gene therapy and/or alter your DNA.  ""WE TOLD YA!"" read one published Dec. 2. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We have repeatedly debunked claims that the vaccines are gene therapy.  In this instance, the article cited was a Nov. 29 opinion piece written by a genome expert, Johns Hopkins University biomedical engineering professor Steven Salzberg. And shortly after it was published, numerous scientists weighed in, highly critical of the headline choice and article.  Salzberg, who says he is ""fighting the anti-vax movement through my columns,"" soon changed the headline to read, ""Covid Vaccines Don’t Alter Your DNA – They Help Choose Cells To Strengthen Your Immune Response."" What’s more, a full reading of the article would have made it clear that Salzberg was not suggesting anti-vaccine activists were accurate in their claims that the vaccine alters your DNA or that it’s gene therapy. Rather, he stated they were wrong — and argued in part that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention oversimplified its explanation of what the vaccines do. ""Totally different from gene therapy,"" Salzberg said about the COVID-19 vaccines in a phone interview with PolitiFact. ""Apples and oranges. Completely unrelated. The vaccine is not going in and making a change to your DNA."" Salzberg told PolitiFact the original headline was misinterpreted and he changed it within a couple of hours. ""I was trying to draw people in with this headline,"" so that people understand that changes that occur as a result of the vaccines are good for their health, ""but the message was lost on some people.""  ""It’s kind of a technical point and I was being perhaps a little too cute,"" he said. Salzberg told PolitiFact that the point he was trying to make was that in tiny quantities, the mixture of DNA in the body is different after vaccination just as it is different after a viral infection, but the vaccine is not mutating DNA. ""But that's kind of a subtle point,"" he said. ""I’m just trying to educate people on what immunity is. There is something that had to change. If nothing changed, you wouldn’t have immunity.""  The article itself makes the case that the vaccines do not alter DNA. Here’s how it begins: ""One of the common tropes among anti-vaxxers lately is that the Covid-19 vaccine ‘changes your DNA.’ Oh, the horrors! ""Do they even know what they mean by that? Almost certainly not. Anti-vaxxers generally have no idea how biology works; often they are so confused that I’m tempted to say they are not even wrong. Even when they are right about something, it’s for the wrong reasons."" Later, the article makes a distinction: ""It’s true that COVID-19 vaccines don’t directly alter your DNA, and it’s true that they don’t invade the cell nucleus, where your DNA resides. But that’s not the full story…. ""Remember that the whole point of a vaccine is to prevent future infections. That means that something in your body has to change, right?... ""So back to our original question: does the Covid-19 vaccine change your DNA? Not directly, no. But yes, thanks to your own immune system, the overall mixture of DNA in your body is a tiny bit altered after you get any vaccine. Your DNA is also changed every time you recover from an infection, including the common cold. But the only change is in the DNA of a tiny number of immune cells, which hang around as guardians against future infections. And that’s a good thing."" As we’ve reported, the mRNA technology used by the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines does not amount to gene therapy. Gene therapy involves modifying a person’s genes to cure or treat a disease. The COVID-19 vaccines do not alter your DNA. ""It's absolutely incorrect to say that vaccines are really gene therapy,"" Cindy Prins, clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, has told PolitiFact. ""Vaccines don't make any changes to your own DNA, so they don't edit your own DNA like gene therapy does. They also don't replace any mutated genes in your body."" Social media posts claimed that COVID-19 vaccines are gene therapy and a recent Forbes article proves that. The vaccines do not amount to gene therapy. Gene therapy involves modifying a person’s genes to cure or treat a disease. The COVID-19 vaccines do not alter your DNA. The original headline on the Forbes article said ""the vaccine changes your DNA a tiny bit,"" but was quickly changed by the author, a Johns Hopkins University gene expert, who said it was misinterpreted.

Why the GOP talking point about ‘government takeover’ of child care is wrong
","Democrats are hoping that the $1.75 trillion social spending plan that passed the House can win Senate approval by Christmas. But it continues to face universal opposition from Republicans, who have concerns about the price tag and certain provisions. One of those provisions would spend nearly $400 billion to expand child care and fund universal prekindergarten. During a marathon floor speech against the bill on Nov. 18, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the legislation, known as the Build Back Better Act, would represent a ""government takeover of child care.""  Denouncing the child care provisions of the bill as a federal ""takeover"" has become a talking point among critics, including by some Republican senators and conservative groups. The phrase ""government takeover"" of child care communicates the notion that the federal government would nationalize day care facilities, owning and directly running the industry. But that’s not what the bill calls for.  The bill does expand the federal government’s role in child care, not just providing more funding but also potentially establishing new restrictions on religious institutions that offer child care programs in exchange for federal support. States that want to participate will have to submit plans to the federal government that include how they will use the money to expand access to child care and improve the quality of child care providers. However, states will oversee how the rules are implemented.  ""States will be able to make a lot of the policy decisions and to design the program in response to the needs of families in their states,"" said Hannah Matthews, deputy executive director for policy at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a group that supports the legislation. ""The bill builds on the current federal-state partnership of our existing child care system."" Backers of the child care expansion point out that the federal government has already been subsidizing child care for decades with little backlash. ""All 50 states have an existing child care program that is primarily funded using federal dollars, and 44 states and the District of Columbia fund pre-K programs,"" said Lauren Hogan, managing director for policy and professional advancement with the National Association for the Education of Young Children, which supports the legislation. Imposing a degree of federal regulation on child care facilities is not a government takeover, any more than it is for federal regulation of banks, airlines, or manufacturing companies. The government sets rules on all sorts of programs it funds. And crucially, states don’t have to participate in the new program if they don’t want to. Nor do parents or child care facilities. ""Since states must opt in to both the child care and pre-K provisions, that defies any reasonable definition of a takeover,"" said Elliot Haspel, author of a book about child care and a supporter of the provisions in the bill.  Critics may have legitimate concerns about the program’s structure and reach, but calling it a ""government takeover"" is a mischaracterization. Preschool children eat lunch at a day care facility on Oct. 25, 2021, in Mountlake Terrace, Wash. (AP) Democrats designed the bill to reduce the costs of child care for parents who are working or in school, making more subsidies available to middle-class parents. Child care can cost around $10,000 a year for each child, depending on location and age. For families with multiple children in child care, and for low- and moderate-wage earners, child care costs can eat up a substantial portion of their income. While there are existing federal programs to help eligible parents pay for day care, those are intended for low-income earners.  If the bill passes this year, the child care provisions could start in 2022, ramping up to full enactment over three years. The preschool program for 3- and 4-year-olds would be free, and eligible parents who need to pay for extended hours of care could get a subsidy.  For younger children, parents would pay no more than 7% of their family income, a provision that would cover nearly all families earning up to $300,000, according to Democrats’ calculations. And families who earn 75% or less of their state’s median income could send their children for free.  In exchange for increased federal funding, the bill requires child care centers to pay ""adequate"" wages, in order to drive up supply of child care workers to meet demand. The amount of the wage is left undefined in the bill. ""States will determine payment rates that allow for the provision of such wages,"" Matthews said. In all, the bill is meant to give parents the ability to choose the child care that fits their needs, said Karen Schulman, director of state child care policy at the National Women’s Law Center, a group that supports the legislation.  ""Certificates are issued to parents, and they can use the provider of their choice, which may include a center, family child care home, or faith-based provider,"" Schulman said. Pre-K teacher Vera Csizmadia teaches 3-and 4-year-old students at the Dr. Charles Smith Early Childhood Center in Palisades Park, N.J., on Sept. 16, 2021. (AP) How the bill affects day care provided by religious institutions is a centerpiece of the debate over Build Back Better.  As evidence for the claim that the bill is a ""government takeover of child care,"" McCarthy spokesperson Michele Exner cited the portion of the bill that would require states to submit applications for funding to the secretary of health and human services. ""By design, this will hand over control to the federal government to decide who does and does not qualify for the funding, which will include discriminating against faith-based centers,"" Exner said. But while there are questions about how religious day care facilities would fit in with the new programs, that doesn’t mean that the federal government is taking over the industry. The legislation includes explicit language that allows parents to choose from a variety of day care options, including those offered at centers, homes, or religious institutions such as churches or synagogues. ""Nothing in this section shall preclude the use of such certificates for sectarian child care services if freely chosen by the parent,"" the bill states. Some religious groups argue that this language is not sufficient, due to the inclusion of other provisions, such as one that says federal grants to remodel facilities may not be used for ""buildings or facilities that are used primarily for sectarian instruction or religious worship."" This policy would keep the government from funding purely religious efforts and spaces, while allowing a day care center at a church to get remodeling money to expand classrooms. Religious groups and conservatives have raised concerns that this may prevent them from accessing the new federal money, but exactly how this standard would be applied remains to be seen. The bill would also require compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other federal laws.  Another concern raised by some religious groups is that requirements to follow nondiscrimination laws could impede their ability to receive the new federal funding. They argue that religious entities would need to choose between adhering to their religious principles and accepting the new federal funds. This would mark a break from existing federal subsidy programs for child care: block grants for child care do not currently enforce such compliance. (A few religious organizations are among the groups that wrote a letter to Democratic leaders in support of the child care programs.) For example, the bill requires compliance with Title IX, the law that bans gender discrimination. Nathan Diament, executive director for the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, a Jewish group, said he’s asked whether that means that a synagogue-based day care center could not have separate classrooms for boys and girls. He said he hasn’t gotten an answer. ""We want the currently existing rules that govern federally supported child care"" through block grant programs, Diament said. Diament said other questions remain, such as whether a religious day care could give preference to members of its own congregation for slots, and whether it could include lessons about religious holidays. Orthodox day care centers have participated in existing state or federally supported day care programs, and despite their concerns, they don’t want to torpedo the bill, Diament said. ""We want to be supportive of this but we need these issues to be clarified and resolved properly so that we can be supportive of the bill,"" he said. Collectively, critics argue, these concerns could mean that religious organizations are squeezed out of the child care sector. The major influx of money into the sector could have impacts on those who don’t take the new federal funds, but to what extent religious entities could be impacted is currently unknown. Teacher Beth Fusco works with children at Educational Playcare in Glastonbury, Conn., on Aug. 27, 2020. (AP) The debate over the bill’s impact on religious organizations will likely go to the courts if the measure passes. It’s also possible that the Senate could rewrite these sections to provide more clarity or greater deference to religious organizations before the bill is enacted. Beyond the concerns over religious matters, however, backers of the bill point to several reasons why the ""takeover"" argument is undercut by other elements. For starters, the federal government is leaving most of the decision making to states. ""States will operate child care assistance programs, set child care licensing requirements and standards and monitor for compliance with standards,"" Matthews said. ""They will make decisions about how to invest in quality improvement, raise wages for providers, and build the supply of child care."" By the end of a phase-in period, the bill says, child care providers that receive subsidies through the new program need to be ""licensed to provide child care services under state law"" and to participate ""in the state’s tiered system for measuring the quality of child care providers."" Such requirements, Schulman said, ""are aimed at protecting children’s basic health and safety and giving providers opportunities to improve quality."" By contrast, there is nothing in the bill that ""gives the federal government any authority to dictate programs’ specific curricular choices, Haspel said. The notion of the federal government funding child care or preschool education is hardly a new one, and it typically hasn’t prompted ideological objections. Head Start, a federally funded early learning program for low-income children, has been operating since 1965. Some states or cities have chosen to offer free preschool on their own. In his 2020 State of the Union address, then-President Donald Trump boasted that he had ""overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care."" In 2018, Congress approved an increase of $2.37 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which provides federal funding to benefit low-income families. Trump, who had originally proposed cutting the program, signed the increase into law. Congress boosted the program by about $550 million in the 2020 appropriations bill. McCarthy said the Build Back Better Act would represent a ""government takeover of child care.""  The bill does expand the federal government’s role in child care, including potential new restrictions on religious institutions that take the new federal funds for child care programs. But calling it a ""government takeover"" is a mischaracterization. The bill puts states — not the federal government — primarily in charge of overseeing the effort, and nothing in the law suggests that government officials will micromanage curricula, staffing, or other key features. In addition, the federal government has long been involved in funding child care and pre-kindergarten, through block grants and Head Start. Perhaps most importantly, neither states, child care centers nor parents are forced to accept the new federal funding, which means that it lacks the mandatory nature of a ""takeover.""

Hannity falsely claims U.S. ‘didn’t import a single barrel’ of Saudi oil pre-pandemic under Trump
","Rattling off a list of praises for former President Donald Trump during an interview with Donald Trump Jr., Fox News host Sean Hannity falsely claimed that under Trump, the U.S. completely scrapped its reliance on oil imports from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. ""If you look pre-COVID, your dad, he got us to energy independence,"" Hannity told the younger Trump during the Dec. 1 episode of ""Hannity,"" his primetime TV show. ""We didn’t import a single barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia, the Middle East.""  Sean Hannity said in this clip that “if you look pre-COVID"" under Trump, ""we didn't import a single barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia.” That’s False. In 2019, the U.S. imported 500,000 barrels of crude oil from Saudi Arabia per day. https://t.co/K3eadpBMPK pic.twitter.com/E78uCAEzQK At the end of Trump’s presidency, PolitiFact rated his promise to achieve energy independence as a Compromise, noting that the U.S. was moving in the right direction but not there yet. But it’s inaccurate for Hannity to claim that ""pre-COVID"" under Trump, the U.S. ""didn’t import a single barrel of oil from Saudi Arabia.""  In 2019, the last year before the pandemic, the U.S. imported about 500,000 barrels of crude oil from Saudi Arabia per day, and over 182 million barrels in total, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Imports also came from other countries in the Middle East. In 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first two years as president, the U.S. imported about 949,000 and 870,000 barrels of crude oil per day, respectively. In 2020, when demand crashed in the middle of the year because of the pandemic, the number was down to about 498,000 barrels per day. ""It’s wrong,"" Mark Finley, the fellow in energy and global oil at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, said of Hannity’s claim. Experts told PolitiFact that the U.S. still relies on imported oil, including from the Middle East, even as it moves toward greater energy independence. ""In the last few years, the U.S. has come very close to producing as much oil as it consumes,"" added Severin Borenstein, the faculty director of the Energy Institute at Haas at the University of California, Berkeley. ""But that does not mean we don't import oil. We still import and export to match crude locations and types most efficiently with refineries."" Canada and Mexico are currently the U.S.’s main sources of imported oil due to cheaper transportation costs. But oil imports and net oil imports from Saudi Arabia and other countries have been steadily falling for over a decade, driven in part by a domestic boom in shale oil, experts said.    ""The underlying causes predate the Trump presidency by many years,"" said Arthur Van Benthem, associate professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. In the final week of 2020, the U.S. imported no crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Van Benthem said, citing a report from Bloomberg based on the EIA's weekly data.  Through a Fox News spokesperson, Hannity said he was referring to the Bloomberg article, and the spokesperson cited other times he spoke of the topic with slightly more accuracy. Most recently, on Nov. 25, he claimed, ""Donald Trump, at the end of his presidency, wasn't importing one single barrel from Saudi Arabia.""

Joe Biden incorrectly describes statistic on small-business growth
","During remarks designed to report his administration’s progress on unclogging the nation’s supply chains, President Joe Biden touted another positive economic indicator on his watch: growth in small businesses. ""We’re the only leading economy in the world where household income and the economy as a whole are stronger than they were before the pandemic,"" Biden said on Dec. 1 from the White House complex. ""You know, there are other signs of strength, too. The number of small businesses is up 30% compared to before the pandemic."" We were surprised to hear that statistic about small businesses, given that a pandemic-induced recession clobbered restaurants and other small companies. So we dug into it, and found that Biden had misstated a real statistic. The White House referred us to Census Bureau data that tracks how many Americans are applying for employer identification numbers, a step in the process of starting a new payroll. Economists often use this as a proxy for small business creation. In the most recent month for which data is available, October 2021, the data shows that 52,277 applications were made. Two years earlier, in October 2019, there were 39,105 applications. That’s just over a one-third increase, which roughly tracks with the number Biden cited.   However, this data does not support his assertion that ""the number of small businesses is up 30% compared to before the pandemic."" That’s because the data in question measures the number of new small businesses being created, not the increase in the total number of small businesses there are in the country. Notably, it doesn’t account for the number of businesses that have failed. (The latest available government data on the total number of businesses is a couple of years old.) ""The president should have said something like, ‘The number of new small businesses created in recent months is up 30% compared to the months immediately before the pandemic,’"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. When we shared this feedback with the White House, they pointed to a speech the previous week where Biden said the talking point correctly. Economists said that Biden’s poor phrasing in his Dec. 1 remarks effectively stepped on a positive message for the administration: Small business creation has indeed been strong recently. ""The recovery from the pandemic has been associated with a surge"" in new small businesses, said John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist. That includes entities that expect to hire staff, which is the statistic the White House was using, and those that expect to remain one-person operations. Still, we don’t know how strong this small business growth is on net without knowing how many small businesses shuttered during the pandemic. Biden said, ""The number of small businesses is up 30% compared to before the pandemic."" Biden was citing a real statistic, but he described it incorrectly. In reality, there has been a 30% rise compared with late 2019 in a certain type of tax-related applications that are widely used as a proxy for small business formation. This statistic shows that the number of newly created small businesses is up 30%, not the total number of small businesses.

US southern border 'completely open'? That’s False
","Travel bans ordered by President Joe Biden in response to the new coronavirus variant triggered an article from the conservative Gateway Pundit website that carried this false headline: ""Due to the Seriousness of the New Omicron COVID Variant the Biden Admin Has Decided to Leave the US Southern Border Completely Open.""  The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline links concern about the variant, which the article mocks, with the Biden administration’s border policy. The administration ""was so shaken by the news that they decided to completely leave open the U.S. southern border with Mexico,"" the article said. Has the U.S.-Mexico border been left completely open for anyone to cross? No. And we’ve been here before. In March, we rated False a claim that the border ""is now open to anyone from anywhere in the world who wishes to enter our country."" In April, we rated False a claim that the U.S. is locked down and there’s ""a wide open border."" And in July, we rated Mostly False a claim that Biden ""is restricting travel for Americans into Mexico, but is keeping the border wide open for illegal aliens to walk right into our country."" Here’s what is happening now. Biden has continued a policy — initiated by former President Donald Trump — to restrict Americans’ travel to Mexico, as a way to fight the spread of COVID-19. On Nov. 26, after omicron was identified in South Africa, Biden banned travel from South Africa and seven other African countries. Most people trying to cross at the border into the U.S. are being turned away, under a March 2020 order by the Trump administration to curb the spread of COVID-19. The Biden administration is still enforcing that policy, although it’s exempting children who arrive alone, as well as some families. The Mexico border is not ""completely open"" for entry into the U.S. Far from it. ""Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection are on the border and doing their jobs every day,"" said Theresa Cardinal Brown, managing director of  immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The vast majority of what are known as enforcement encounters result in U.S. immigration officials turning people away at the border. The idea that Biden has ""decided to leave"" the border open suggests that it has been open for some time. That is contradicted by immigration enforcement figures, which record enforcement actions prior to omicron. Encounters data includes people who are placed in immigration proceedings and people who are quickly expelled. Encounters at the southern border rose each month since Biden took office through July, before dropping the next two months. The latest U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures show there were more than 1.7 million encounters during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.  In September, the last month for which data was available, there were 192,001 encounters, 102,673 of which resulted in expulsion. No policies have been changed that would make the borders more open, said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute. Biden also moved to limit border crossings in another way. Homeland Security announced July 26 that it would quickly turn back migrant families that immigration officials determine do not qualify for asylum during a fast-tracked screening process. On Dec. 2, after the Gateway Pundit article was posted, the Biden administration announced it would reimplement the Migrant Protection Protocols. Also known as Remain in Mexico, the Trump-era policy required people seeking asylum without proper documentation to wait in Mexico for their immigration court date. The U.S. would also send migrants back to Mexico while their asylum claims are considered.

China and India’s carbon dioxide emissions, in context
","Are China and India wildly outpacing the U.S., United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on emissions of carbon dioxide? A chart shared on Facebook shows a staggering increase in carbon dioxide emissions in China and India since 1990, while showing declines for the U.S. and other developed countries over the same time. On Facebook, a user sharing the chart asked: ""Why are we weakening our economy?"" They cited the New York Post as the source. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is the image from the Facebook post, which originated from a New York Post opinion article. It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t. It’s important to know what the chart shows, and what it doesn’t. While the headline on the graphic says ""Per capita CO2 emissions,"" what the lines on the chart show is the percentage change in CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2019 for China, India, Japan, the U.S., Germany and the United Kingdom.  It appeared alongside an Oct. 26 opinion article in the New York Post headlined ""Why destroy our economy to cut emissions — when China and India are spewing away?"" The piece ran ahead of the international climate change conference of world leaders in Glasgow, Scotland, called COP26.  The opinion article, written by Eddie Scarry, sourced the data in the chart from Our World in Data, a project of Oxford University. So we asked Hannah Ritchie, a senior researcher for Our World in Data, to tell us more about it.  Ritchie offered a simple explanation: Because China and India had very low levels of per capita emissions in 1990, when their economies were far less developed, their emissions have grown a lot since then. Readers wouldn’t know it from this graphic, but the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions, which didn’t change very much over the same period. A different way of looking at the data provides more context.  Our World in Data provided a similar chart looking at per capita CO2 emissions for the same countries and time periods. The difference in this chart is that it shows not the percentage change, but rather the actual change in per capita emissions over time, measured in tons. This version of how the data is presented shows the U.S. and Japan leading in per capita CO2 emissions.  The difference in charts from Our World in Data depends on whether the ""relative change"" option was selected. Checking this box shows the percentage change over time and makes it appear as though China and India are leading in CO2 emissions compared with other developed nations.  The Facebook post is missing context because it shows the change in emissions per person, but not the actual emissions.  The United States is responsible for the largest share of historical emissions with about 509 gigatons of carbon dioxide released since 1850. China has the second-largest share of historical emissions with more than 284 gigatons. Simon Evans, deputy editor for Carbon Brief, analyzed why cumulative CO2 emissions matter in an Oct. 5, 2021, article. He wrote:  ""There is a direct, linear relationship between the total amount of CO2 released by human activity and the level of warming at the Earth’s surface. Moreover, the timing of a ton of CO2 being emitted has only a limited impact on the amount of warming it will ultimately cause. ""This means CO2 emissions from hundreds of years ago continue to contribute to the heating of the planet — and current warming is determined by the cumulative total of CO2 emissions over time.""  A Facebook post shows China and India leading in per capita CO2 emissions compared to the U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan between 1990 and 2019.  The chart is missing some context, and the headline is misleading. When looking at the percentage change in per capita CO2 emissions from 1990-2019, China and India have seen the largest increases. Both countries had relatively low emissions in 1990, and they have grown a lot since then. The U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan already had high levels of emissions in 1990, and they have remained at high levels, with the U.S. leading the pack.

Heart complications aren’t yet a ‘listed’ symptom of omicron variant
","Very little is yet known about the omicron variant of the coronavirus, which was identified in November. Yet an article widely shared on Facebook claims that heart complications are reported as a ""listed"" symptom — and that what’s really going on is an attempt to cover up cardiac deaths caused by the COVID-19 vaccines. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Heart complications are not a ""listed"" symptom of omicron. And we found no evidence to support the claim of a cover-up. It’s not yet known what potential omicron has to cause serious illness. The early reports about omicron are that its symptoms are mild. Heart complications associated with the COVID-19 vaccines are potentially serious, but rare. The omicron variant rapidly overtook the previous reigning variant, delta, in parts of southern Africa in November. As we’ve reported, it will take a few weeks to know for sure whether omicron is significantly more transmissible and whether it causes worse illness. On Nov. 28, two days after declaring omicron a ""variant of concern,"" the World Health Organization said that ""the likelihood of potential further spread of omicron at the global level is high,"" but that there are ""considerable uncertainties."" Those uncertainties include ""how well vaccines protect against infection, transmission, clinical disease of different degrees of severity and death; and does the variant present with a different severity profile."" The U.S. government made its ""variant of concern"" declaration on Nov. 30. On Dec. 1, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the first U.S. omicron case was identified in California in a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22. The person was fully vaccinated and had mild symptoms that are improving, the agency said. The article we’re checking appears on a website called Alberta Nationals, which offers anti-vaccine content. The headline is: ""Symptoms of the Omicron Variant Used To Cover Up Effects of Covid Vaccines.""  The article goes on to claim that ""one of the symptoms listed"" for omicron is ""heart-related complications,"" including heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation and blood clots. ""This happens to be one of the primary negative effects of the COVID vaccines among men especially, which has led to a five-fold increase in sudden and unexplained cardiac deaths in FIFA (soccer) players in 2021. … It looks like bureaucrats are already using the omicron variant to disguise the rapid increase in sudden and unexplained cardiac deaths in the vaccinated, just as they did with the delta variant,"" the article states.  We’ve fact-checked similar claims about athletes experiencing cardiac symptoms because of the vaccine and found them unsupported.  Dr. Angelique Coetzee of South Africa, who is credited as being among the first physicians to discover the omicron variant, has said in news interviews that its symptoms are mild. Coetzee told CNN that extreme fatigue is the primary symptom and that other symptoms include a scratchy throat and a dry cough. She told Reuters the symptoms could be treated at home. She told The Telegraph that symptoms in patients she treated with the new variant ""were so different and so mild from those I had treated before,"" though she was worried it could hit unvaccinated older people with illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease much harder. She made no mention of omicron causing heart problems. We weren’t able to reach her. Other experts say it’s too early to fully understand the symptoms or severity of infection from the omicron variant. Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said in a National Geographic interview: ""There's not enough information available yet to make a conclusion about the severity of omicron in comparison to other variants."" Dr. Matthew Laurens of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, reiterated how little is known about omicron. ""We are still in the very early stages of characterizing the omicron variant. I have not yet seen reports of cardiac complications associated with omicron,"" he told PolitiFact.  ""At the same time, we know that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with cardiac complications including myocarditis, and this is consistent with what many other viral infections can do. SARS-CoV-2 can also cause vascular inflammation and cardiac arrhythmias. I would expect that the omicron variant acts like other variants of SARS-CoV-2 regarding potential risk for cardiac complications."" COVID-19 vaccines have been associated with certain heart problems, but these are rare.  Cases of heart inflammation (myocarditis and pericarditis) have been reported after vaccination with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, according to the CDC. The CDC says that it’s actively monitoring reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination, but that most patients who received care for these conditions ""responded well to medicine and rest and felt better quickly."" Experts say that COVID-19 itself presents much more danger to the heart than vaccines do. An article widely shared on Facebook claimed that heart complications are a ""listed"" symptom of the omicron variant of the coronavirus and are being ""used to cover up effects"" of COVID-19 vaccines. Heart complications are not a ""listed"" symptom of omicron. And we found no evidence to support the claim of a cover-up. Little is known about the variant, including its potential for causing serious disease.

But in a statement to PolitiFact, Nextstrain said the post is an example of its charts being distorted by ""a few people who want to interpret them to further their misinformation claims."" The post makes it sound like public health officials are sitting on a long list of fake variants and announcing new ones every time fears about the others subside. That’s not the case. There are thousands of COVID-19 variants in existence, as is to be expected with any virus that mutates. But that doesn’t mean omicron and the other named variants that public health agencies have sounded alarms about are fake or planned. The variants that get elevated in this way are not selected at random or ""to keep the fear going,"" experts said. Viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, can evolve over time. RELATED VIDEO  A variant of the coronavirus is one that differs from the original strain that emerged in Wuhan, China. The changes arise via random mutations, especially when circulating at high rates. The chart featured in the Facebook post ""plots the data we have on SARS-CoV-2 genetic code sequences over time,"" Nextstrain said in its statement. ""It's a little like a virus family tree."" But while there are thousands of coronavirus variants, most fade out over time or never become widespread strains, so they are not concerning in the context of the pandemic. ""New variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are detected every week,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine’s Dr. Stuart Ray added in an article on the university’s website. ""Most come and go."" Public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization monitor mutations and watch for changes that could make evolving strains more transmissible, dangerous, or resistant to testing, vaccines and treatments.  Broadly speaking, the agencies designate variants as ""variants of concern"" when there is observed evidence that the variants behave this way. The agencies label variants as ""variants of interest"" if they display genetic markers that could potentially send them down this path. These are the variants scientists warn about — like the delta variant, which has for months accounted for more than 99% of all coronavirus infections in the U.S. The WHO currently lists five variants of concern: alpha, beta, delta, gamma and omicron. ""The reason that we only hear about a few of the variants is because they are not all of equal importance,"" said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida. The ones we hear about on the news ""are the ones that have the potential to have a greater effect on public health."" Despite the Facebook post’s claims, the variants are not rolled out at random or to ""keep the fear going.""  Instead, they are designated as variants of interest or concern according to public health agencies’ working definitions and a process that is ""scientific, well thought-out, and designed to focus only on those that need to be prioritized,"" Prins said. Omicron is only the 13th variant to receive a Greek alphabet name under the WHO’s classification system. ""They are very much not picked at random,"" Nextstrain said in its statement. ""Scientists and public health agencies definitely do not just pick the next variant and try to scare people with that,"" Prins added. ""Even with omicron, scientists and public health agencies are urging the public not to panic because we still need to learn more."" A Facebook post said, ""Don’t be fooled by the next ‘Variant’!

The earliest references to Black Friday followed events in 1869, when two financiers bought up gold in an effort to drive prices higher. Their efforts ended in a gold market crash on a Friday, which led to the Black Friday moniker, the Associated Press reported. Decades later, in the 1960s, the phrase ""Black Friday"" became associated with shopping after Thanksgiving. In Philadelphia, an annual Army-Navy football game held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving drew tourists to the city, and local retailers tried to woo them. Police referred to it as Black Friday because of the headaches the large crowds caused for them.

The author also said that while researching the photo, he did not see any reference to the phrase Black Friday. A Facebook post says Black Friday originated in 1904 when enslaved people were sold at a discount to boost the economy. There is no evidence that Black Friday originated or is associated with the sale of enslaved people. Slavery was abolished in the U.S. in 1865.

Fact-check: How Mississippi’s abortion law compares with laws in Europe
","The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of a pivotal Mississippi abortion law Dec. 1. With a conservative majority on the court, the future of Roe v. Wade, the rule that has guided abortion laws for five decades, is in question. The Mississippi law makes most abortions illegal after 15 weeks, about two months earlier than the 24 weeks that the courts have generally approved.  The statute provides narrow exceptions for abortion beyond 15 weeks. It would be allowed to protect the life of the woman, or if there was ""a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."" A major bodily function includes ""functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, and digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.""   In an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said the law is actually more permissive than the laws across Europe. ""In Europe, there are 42 countries that allow elective abortions,"" Reeves said Nov. 28. ""If Roe is overturned and this 15-week ban in Mississippi is allowed to go into effect, Mississippi will still have a law on the books in which 39 countries — 39 out of 42 — in Europe have more restrictive abortion laws than what I believe to be one of the most conservative states in the United States."" We decided to see if Reeves had his numbers right. We found that there are different ways of categorizing abortion laws in Europe. Reeves relied on one analysis, but that study made no allowances for broad exceptions in countries’ laws that could extend the cutoff point for a legal abortion well past the 15-week mark. We counted at least 15 countries where that could happen, with potentially 11 additional ones. Reeves’ numbers are not as solid as he suggests. Reeves’ office told us his data came from a report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion study center. Chief Justice John Roberts referred to it during oral arguments. The authors made it clear that they weren’t looking at every European nation, just those that they consider to allow elective abortions. Elective is the key word. As the Lozier Institute defines it, it means when a woman can seek an abortion without meeting certain conditions. This definition eliminated eight countries, including Britain (with a 24-week cutoff) and Finland (with a range of cutoffs from 12 to 20 weeks), because, the authors argued, the laws there required women to provide ""some"" justification for an abortion beyond it being their choice. But their definition of ""elective"" can be subjective. In Britain, two medical professionals have to agree that a woman’s mental or physical health is at risk. In the Netherlands, a doctor has to agree with the woman’s claim that she faces a ""distressed situation."" The Lozier Institute study counts the Netherlands, but excludes Britain.  (Northern Ireland, the other part of the United Kingdom, is included.) That said, within the group of countries they selected, the authors looked at the cutoff point for legal abortions before considering any special factors, such as profound fetal abnormalities, or factors affecting the woman. ""Out of the 42 European countries that allow elective abortion, 39 countries limit elective abortion to 15 weeks’ gestation or earlier,"" the report said. Contrast that with an assessment of a group of European law professors in their amicus curiae brief on behalf of the woman’s abortion clinic in the Mississippi case. ""Abortion is permitted through at least 22 weeks of pregnancy in 37 states and through 18-21 weeks in a further three, either on request, or on broad socioeconomic grounds, or on a ... criterion that does not entail a risk to her life,"" they wrote. So, which analysis is correct? ""As always, the devil is in the details,"" said Federico Fabbrini, professor of law at Dublin City University School of Law and Government.  For example, the great majority of European countries — 27 by our count — have a basic cutoff point of 12 weeks. But nearly all of those countries have exceptions that extend the period, often as long as 22 weeks. What one makes of those exceptions influences the comparison between Mississippi and Europe. ""On its face, a 15-week limit is more permissive than a shorter limit,"" said Carter Snead, a law professor at University of Notre Dame. ""Some have suggested that the European laws are more permissive because of their various exceptions, but this strikes me as mere speculation, because to assess that claim we would need to compare how such exceptions are interpreted and enforced alongside the Mississippi law's exceptions."" The Lozier Institute took a narrow approach. Its study looked at one part of each country’s law — the baseline period during which elective abortions are legal. It didn’t factor in the reasons that period could be extended or for how long.  ""Looking at abortion laws in their broader context reveals that comparable countries which, on their face, set shorter time limits on abortion access than the United States, often provide greater flexibility in obtaining abortions after those limits pass, with exceptions for a broad range of circumstances,"" according to a brief from a group of law professors in support of the abortion clinic. Two of the most flexible terms are socioeconomic conditions and the mental health of the woman. With the help of several databases — one from the United Nations, one from the World Health Organization, and a list from the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard — we examined the text of the laws of the countries the Lozier Institute examined, sometimes using Google Translate for our research. The base cutoff periods for legal abortion in these countries broadly fall into three categories: 10 to 12 weeks’ gestation, 12 to 14 weeks, and 15 or more. In the most restrictive category, 10 to 12 weeks, are 24 countries, including Northern Ireland. But 15 of those countries have exceptions for specific economic or mental-health reasons that extend the cutoff to 15 weeks or more. The middle category, 12 to 14 weeks, includes 15 countries. All but four of these countries have exceptions for the health of the mother. Their laws don’t say if health is limited to physical health, or if it extends to mental health — a more subjective criterion. But if the exceptions apply broadly, they can extend the legal period for an abortion to the 15-week point or beyond. Just three countries — Iceland, the Netherlands and Sweden — are in the least restrictive group. (Britain is excluded, as we noted above.) Martha Davis, a law professor at Northeastern University, cautioned that text of any law alone fails to capture the full picture of abortion availability in Europe. It also depends on how those laws are applied. Based on the text, there could be as few as 13 countries with shorter cutoff periods than Mississippi’s 15 weeks. Depending on how laws are applied, though, there might be 24 in that group. The gap between what’s written and what's practiced creates a gray zone. Some studies suggest that Belgium offers more flexibility than meets the eye. Even with those uncertainties, it is difficult to get to Reeves’ claim of 39 nations once laws with exceptions for the life circumstances and mental well-being of the woman are taken into account. Supporters of abortion rights argue that this sort of quantitative legal analysis comes with inherent limits. ""More than just exceptions to the abortion limitation itself, a country’s laws and policies on access to comprehensive sex education, modern contraception, paid parental leave, paid child care also are part of the context of abortion laws,"" said Mindy Roseman, director of International Law Programs at Yale University. Reeves said that ""39 out of 42 (countries) in Europe have more restrictive abortion laws"" than Mississippi. He relied on a study that looked only at one part of each nation’s law — the part that defined the initial time period for elective abortions. Folding in the exceptions that many countries allow, the actual number could be one-third of what Reeves said. But it’s hard to be precise with the count or the comparison. Abortion laws are subject to interpretation, and our point is that the study Reeves relied on is just one possible approach to making the comparison.

No evidence that Biden canceling an oil pipeline caused higher U.S. gas prices
","A post that blames President Joe Biden for higher gas prices in the United States cites lower prices in three other major oil-producing countries, saying: ""Gasoline in Russia $2.10, Kuwait 78 cents, Saudia (sic) Arabia 98 cents. Nobody shutting pipe lines down there."" It ends with an abbreviation that is known to be a taunt directed at Biden. The Nov. 19 post, which alludes to Biden’s Jan. 20 decision to revoke permits for the Keystone XL oil pipeline project in the Plains, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gas prices are lower in those three countries than in the U.S. But the post goes too far in suggesting that the canceled pipeline project is to blame, or that the project would have made much difference in gasoline today’s prices if it had continued.  Experts say the recent increases in U.S. gas prices are due mainly to a lack of oil production, much more than any actions taken by Biden, such as canceling the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.  ""The pipeline shutdown has absolutely nothing to do with gas prices,"" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for  GasBuddy. ""Prices are higher because production has lagged behind, not because there isn't enough pipeline capacity — there is."" RELATED VIDEO:    The post doesn’t cite a source or a date for the prices it quotes. It understates the current price of gasoline in the three foreign countries by 18% to 58%. Here were the average prices for a gallon of gasoline as of Nov. 22, according to GlobalPetrolPrices.com: U.S.: $3.758
Russia: $2.560
Saudi Arabia: $2.351
Kuwait: $1.314 The price tracking site notes that while crude oil prices drive global trends in gasoline prices, retail prices for fuel vary widely from country to country because of taxes and government subsidies.  Unlike the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait provide subsidies that reduce the cost of gas to consumers.  As we’ve reported, De Haan recently calculated the year-over-year price change in gasoline going back to 2002. The 66.1% increase earlier this year ranks as the fastest year-over-year increase during that period. This is not surprising, experts say. During the coronavirus pandemic, when travel and commuting were sharply curtailed, the demand for gasoline declined significantly, and so did the price. So year-over-year figures compare today’s prices to an unusually low level a year ago, exaggerating the jump. Since the initial economic wallop from the virus in the spring of 2020, demand for gasoline has risen steadily as business activity has increased. Yet supply hasn’t been able to recover as quickly, thanks to delays in restoring drilling capacity, higher transportation costs, and sluggish production increases. American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Scott Lauermann said that ""first and foremost, higher crude oil prices are the main cause of higher gasoline prices."" He agreed that the price of crude, the biggest component of gasoline prices, is higher this year because demand is rising while supply is constrained. John Stoody, a spokesperson for the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, said that Biden has restricted supply by canceling the Keystone XL project and by steps such as suspending leasing and drilling permits on U.S. federal lands. The pipeline industry lobbying group opposed Biden’s Jan. 20 decision to cancel the Keystone XL permit. Other experts have said that canceling the Keystone, which was not operating yet, would not have an impact on U.S. gas prices for at least a period of years.  A Facebook post alludes to Biden’s decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and claims, ""Gasoline in Russia $2.10, Kuwait 78 cents, Saudia (sic) Arabia 98 cents. Nobody shutting pipe lines down there,"" suggesting a link between the pipeline project and rising U.S. gas prices. The post understates the gas prices for other countries and goes too far in suggesting that cancellation of the Keystone pipeline is to blame for the recent rise in U.S. gas prices, or that the project would have made a difference if it had continued.  Experts say rising gas prices are due to an imbalance of supply and demand, and aren’t affected by the pipeline project.

Most military veterans get a boost from Social Security, but not in the form of monthly payments
","A Facebook post that says people who served in the U.S. military before 2002 are entitled to additional monthly income from Social Security is based on a real policy that gives veterans a Social Security boost. But the post gets crucial details wrong. The viral post says, ""If you were in the military before 2002 you get an additional $1,200 a year, ($100 per month) in Social Security. But you have to ask for it and almost no one knows about it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Many U.S. military veterans who served from 1940 to 2001 are eligible to have extra Social Security wage credits added to their earnings record. A person’s lifetime earnings record is what monthly Social Security benefits payments are based on, so extra wage credits that increase the earnings record might result in higher monthly Social Security payments, though it is not guaranteed. ""This program adds to your overall income factor and may have little effect on your actual monthly Social Security benefit, because the increased earnings do not automatically mean an equal increase in monthly benefits,"" according to Military.com, a site with military news and resources. The claim says that those who served before 2002 ""get an additional $1,200 a year, ($100 per month),"" but that is inaccurate. The amount of extra credits added to the earnings record varies depending on the length of military service and which years the person was in the military. Those who served from 1940 through 1956 didn’t pay Social Security taxes but received special credit for some of their service. Those who served from 1957 through 1977 get $300 in additional earnings credit for each calendar quarter in which they received active-duty basic pay; and people who served from 1978 through 2001 get an additional $100 in earnings credit for every $300 in active-duty basic pay up to $1,200 per year, according to the Social Security Administration. The confusion appears to come from the $1,200 annual cap on the earnings credit that can be applied for those who served from 1978 through 2001. That’s not the amount added to the monthly Social Security benefit, as the Facebook post implies. The Social Security Administration notes, ""In all cases, the additional earnings are credited to the earnings that we average over your working lifetime, not directly to your monthly benefit amount."" The post includes a photo of an undated memo marked ""DD 214 Increased Social Security benefits for vets,"" and one part of the document reads, ""You must bring your DD-214 to the Social Security Office and you must ask for this benefit to receive it!"" Form DD214 is issued to veterans by the Defense Department and shows details of a person’s discharge from the military. No one has to specifically request the extra credits in order to receive them. People who served from 1957 through 1967 have the extra credits added to their record when they apply for Social Security benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. People who served from 1968 through 2001 had the credits automatically added to their records. The extra earnings credit is not available to anyone who served in the military after 2001. A Facebook post says, ""If you were in the military before 2002 you get an additional $1,200 a year, ($100 per month) in Social Security. But you have to ask for it and almost no one knows about it."" The claim is based on a real policy, but it gets crucial details wrong. Many people who served in the military from 1940 to 2001 are eligible for extra wage credits that are added to the earnings record used to calculate monthly Social Security payments. But the extra credits do not necessarily result in higher monthly Social Security payments. The amount of the credit depends on when the person served in the military and for how long. And for veterans who served from 1968 to 2001, it’s applied automatically. We rate the claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2021/dec/01/facebook-posts/most-military-veterans-get-boost-social-security-n/
