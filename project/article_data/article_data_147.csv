Donald Trump wrong about crime in Germany
","President Donald Trump regularly tells Americans that people seeking to enter the United States without permission bring crime and violence with them. In a morning tweet, Trump said Germany faces the same risk. ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition,"" Trump tweeted June 18. ""Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!"" The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture! We looked at whether crime in Germany is on the rise. We contacted the White House press office and did not hear back. According to the latest government numbers that came out in May, crime in the European Union’s largest economy is down by about 9.6 percent from 2016 to 2017. It is also down nearly 4 percent compared to 2012. This chart shows the percentage drop in all crime, violent crime, and the three most common crimes of street crime (a catchall category that spans offenses from sexual harassment to extortion to gang violence), theft and property damage. In a May press release, German minister for Interior, Development and Community Horst Seehofer crowed about the latest figures. ""The number of criminal offenses committed in Germany is the lowest since 1992,"" Seehofer said May 8. ""This drop in crime is even more apparent in relation to the total population: fewer than 7,000 offenses per 100,000 residents. That is the lowest rate in more than 30 years!"" Not every type of crime went down. Those involving drugs went up about 9 percent in the past year, and weapons violations rose by 10 percent. Since Trump tied crime to immigration, we looked at the numbers of German and non-German suspects. The number of people arrested (the statistics count arrests, not convictions) who were not German rose between 2012 and 2017, starting at 502,000 and reaching 736,000. There are two ways to read that. Over the six years, more immigrants have been suspected of crimes. On the other hand, it’s also true that as the number of non-German suspects rose, the number of crimes fell. And it’s not as though native Germans stopped committing crimes in droves, leaving all the violations to immigrants. The number of Germans arrested dropped, but at roughly the same rate as the number of crimes. A study in one German state linked immigrants to a rise in violent crimes in 2016, with a third of those committed against other immigrants. These numbers back up what experts have said before: Cause and effect are complicated, and rising numbers of immigrants does not translate into an broader increase in crime. Trump said that crime in Germany is ""way up."" The opposite is true. Crime in Germany is down from 2016 by over 9 percent, and since 2012 by about 4 percent. The numbers don’t link a rise in the number of immigrants to a rise in criminality nationwide. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096771E00>],/factchecks/2018/jun/18/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-crime-germany/

False headline wrongly links Hillary Clinton to former government shortcomings on immigration
","One conspiratorial news website recycled a years-old Senate report in an effort to link former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to negligence by the Department of Health and Human Services between 2013 and 2015 that led to the abuse of migrant children. ""Senate report admits Clinton ‘gifted’ children to human traffickers,"" read a June 17, 2018, headline from Your News Wire, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online. The Your News Wire story cited 2016 articles from The New York Times and New York magazine, as well as a Jan. 28, 2016, Senate report based on an inquiry into the role of HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement in protecting unaccompanied migrant children from human trafficking and other abuses. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story said: ""Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an ‘unknown number’ of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called ‘caregivers,’ according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media."" This statement is wrong or misleading in several ways — starting with its attempt to frame a Senate report from 2016 as a new and shocking release that the media ignored. Casual readers could have thought the Your News Wire story related to the recent FBI Inspector General’s report, which concerned Clinton’s use of personal emails and was released Thursday, June 14, 2018. In reality, the Senate’s findings were widely reported in 2016, and the many contemporary news stories — including an Associated Press investigation that overlapped with the Senate report — made our fact-checking job easy. The Senate report said that HHS placed more than a dozen migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced into labor. The report did not say anything about Clinton playing a role in that process. Both the Senate report and AP investigation discovered that HHS, which is responsible for finding adult sponsors to temporarily house and care for unaccompanied immigrant children pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings, neglected to comply with federal law requiring that the children be protected from human trafficking and other forms of abuse. As unaccompanied children surged across the southern border toward the beginning of the decade, the department slashed several safety standards in order to quickly transfer the new arrivals from government shelters to sponsors’ homes. Caseworkers who had previously followed strict guidelines for placing children with sponsors — guidelines that required background checks, fingerprints, home studies and signed agreements to bring the children to immigration court — were instructed by agency officials in November 2013 to stop fingerprinting. Shortly after that, they were also instructed to stop requesting original copies of birth certificates, seeking personal and identifying information, or checking criminal history. The hastened process saw several children placed in households with sponsors who forced them into labor or otherwise abused them, according to the Senate and AP reports. It is unknown exactly how many of the approximately 90,000 migrant children placed into sponsor custody between 2013 and 2015 experienced trafficking or other abuse. But neither report mentioned Clinton or used the term ""gift"" in reference to the placement of children with human traffickers. We could not find any evidence that Clinton, who led the Department of State during President Barack Obama’s first term in office, played a part in the rollback of the safety standards governing the protection of migrant children. Not only are the State Department and HHS separate executive agencies, but Clinton also stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, months before HHS decided to stop fingerprinting in the first of many decisions that led to the children’s mistreatment. Your News Wire tried implicating Clinton in an old but otherwise real Senate report. The website did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this statement False.

Are greenhouse emissions down under Donald Trump, as EPA says?
","On the campaign trail and as president, Donald Trump has expressed his skepticism about global warming. So it was a bit of a surprise when a reader asked us to check a statement issued by his Environmental Protection Agency that touted the administration’s record in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which scientists say are the main driver of global warming. ""The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down, Superfund sites are being cleaned up at a higher rate than under President Obama, and the federal government is investing more money to improve water infrastructure than ever before,"" the EPA said in a statement when contacted for a June 13 article by Bloomberg titled, ""Researchers Argue Proposed EPA Changes Could Cause 80,000 More Deaths a Decade."" Here, we’ll focus on the first assertion in the EPA’s statement — that ""the science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down."" We found that to be a stretch. When we asked the EPA for supporting evidence, they pointed us to a report titled, ""Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks."" This includes data collected and released regularly by the EPA, most recently in April 2018. The report found that the amount of greenhouse emissions by the United States fell in the most recent year. But there’s a problem: Due to the lag in data collection, that decline occurred during President Barack Obama’s final year in office, 2016, not under Trump. Here’s a chart of the EPA data on greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2016, most of which consisted of carbon dioxide: We found other data sets that more directly address the Trump era. The first is a comprehensive study issued every year by the energy company BP, called the Statistical Review of World Energy. It uses a different methodology but produced similar findings as the EPA data — a 0.5 percent decline in emissions for the United States in 2017 (Trump’s first year) over 2016 (Obama’s last). The study found that it was the third consecutive year that emissions in the United States had declined, ""though the fall was the smallest over the last three years."" In other words, emissions declined under Trump, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the late Obama era. (The BP study was released on the same day as Bloomberg published the EPA statement, so it’s not clear that the agency could have known about it when it made its statement.) A second set of data from the Energy Information Administration, a data-collecting unit of the federal Energy Department, showed a similar pattern. The EIA data covers 2017 and the first two months of 2018. However, it totals only the emissions from the energy sector, which is a significant source of emissions, but not the only one. Like the BP report, EIA found that that carbon emissions from energy declined between 2016 and 2017. But the annual decline slowed on Trump’s watch in the EIA data, too. In 2017, when Trump was president, emissions fell by less than 1 percent. That was a smaller decrease than for either of Obama’s final two years. In 2016, emissions fell by 1.64 percent from their 2015 level, and for 2015, they fell by 2.68 percent over their 2014 level. In addition, the EIA estimated that emissions will actually rise over the next two years. In 2018, the agency forecasts a 1.1 percent increase, and in 2019, it projects a 0.2 percent increase. The following chart shows annual declines in emissions almost every year from 2007 to 2017, followed by EIA’s projected increases for 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, if you look at the EIA data on a monthly basis, emissions have moved in a fairly narrow band in 2016, 2017 and 2018, with emissions actually higher in January 2018 than they were in January 2016 under Obama. Here’s the chart showing monthly data. Bottom line: Emissions did fall in Trump’s first year, but the rate of decline slowed compared to the Obama era. Whatever impact Trump’s policies may ultimately have, their environmental impact won’t show up much in the data over such a short period. ""Most variations in emissions are due to the combination of long-term trends in energy use and efficiency and short-term variations in weather, with exceptional winter cold or summer heat leading to increased energy use and resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University atmospheric sciences professor. One example of a long-term shift would be the transition from coal to natural gas in electricity generation, said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The shift to natural gas has been driven by competitive pricing, greater access to natural gas supplies, and changing long-term environmental strategies by utilities. Other factors that could have had an impact include falling prices for renewable energy, consumer preferences for lower-emission power, and Congress’ extension of tax credits for renewable energy resources, according to the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group. The second reason for skepticism is that, whatever the merits of Trump’s policies in other ways, his signature policies are eventually expected to increase carbon emissions, not lower them. ""His stated goals are to increase coal use,"" Reilly said. ""His proposed plan to keep coal and nuclear plants from shutting down would have the opposite effect on emissions"" from what the EPA touted in its statement. Trump’s effort to roll back fuel vehicle standards would also tend to boost emission levels, though this initiative is so new that it hasn’t had an impact on the data yet. Experts credited Obama for policies and investments over eight years that nudged some utilities toward lower-emission fuels. ""This is the result of actions of the previous administration, and perhaps even more importantly, of economic and technological progress that are making renewables cheaper than fossil fuels,"" said Robert J. Brecha, a professor in the department of physics and the renewable and clean energy program at the University of Dayton. Some utilities have stated that they will be continuing the emissions-reducing efforts they began under Obama, including American Electric Power Co., Duke Energy, Southern Co., and Xcel Energy. The EPA said, ""The science is clear, under President Trump greenhouse gas emissions are down."" Emissions did fall slightly between 2016 and 2017. But the rate of decline slowed under Trump and the month-to-month changes have been modest. Whatever decline has occurred on Trump’s watch is unlikely to stem from his own policies. Changes to emissions levels tend to come either from changing economic incentives, government policy over the long term, and factors beyond human control, such as the weather. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809764C640>],/factchecks/2018/jun/18/environmental-protection-agency/are-greenhouse-emissions-down-under-donald-trump-e/

Story says poll shows Trump tied to Obama at same point in presidency
","A story on Facebook celebrates President Donald Trump’s approval rating and boasts that it is better than two of his predecessors, Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan. ""Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies,"" said a June 9 headline on The Gateway Pundit, a pro-Trump website. The story said that Trump’s approval rating is at 45 percent, which it claims is nearly equal to Obama and Reagan at the same point of their presidences. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. Is it true? We looked at the polls cited in the story as well as additional polls to provide a more complete picture. We found that The Gateway Pundit cited the early June polls that were the most favorable to Trump: a Fox News poll showed that 45 percent of respondents approved of Trump while Rasmussen Reports showed 47 percent approval for Trump.  A compilation of polls by Real Clear Politics in early June showed that five other polls, including Gallup, all had slightly less favorable results for Trump. For Obama, The Gateway Pundit cited a Rasmussen poll that showed Obama’s approval was at 46 percent on June 9, 2010. Some experts have raised questions about Rasmussen’s polls, because they are based on likely voters, which is a smaller sample than most other polls; historically, Rasmussen has tended to report more favorable results for Republicans generally and Trump in particular. So we looked at one other poll from the same time, Gallup, and also found Obama had the same approval rating. We also found the comparison between Trump, Obama and Reagan in a story about a poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. The story said that Trump’s approval was 44 percent in early June, matching the results for Reagan (in June 1982) and Obama (in June 2010) ""before both presidents saw their parties lose a significant number of House seats in the midterms."" Historically, the president’s party usually gets shellacked during the midterms. The Gateway Pundit did not cite this NBC/WSJ poll, which has some warning signs for Republicans in general, including that Democrats were far more enthusiastic than Republicans about the upcoming midterms. Also, 48 percent of voters indicate they’re more likely to support a congressional candidate who promises to provide a check on President Trump, compared with 23 percent who say they’re less likely to support such a candidate. Karlyn Bowman, a polling specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, cautioned against drawing conclusions about what the polls in early June mean for the midterm election in November. ""Although polls have more predictive value as we get closer to Election Day, we are still more than 100 days out,"" she said. Steven Smith, a Washington University political scientist, said that there is considerable variation in presidential job approval ratings across survey organizations. These differences are due to variation in sampling frames, question wordings, weighting, and other factors. ""Consequently, claims like the Gateway Pundit claim that depend on differences of a few percentage points using different survey organizations’ findings are questionable. The comparisons simply are not reliable,"" he said. The Gateway Pundit said, ""Trump approval rating better than Obama and Reagan at same point in their presidencies."" The story cited a Fox News poll in early June that found Trump’s approval rating at 45 percent and a Rasmussen poll showing Obama was at 46 percent at the same point in his presidency. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that Trump’s approval was 44 percent in early June, matching the results for Reagan (in June 1982) and Obama (in June 2010). These poll results show that Trump, Obama and Reagan had similar polling results for early June in the second year of their presidencies. These results are a snapshot in time, and other polling results show warning signs for Republicans headed into the midterms. That said, the numbers cited are correct.

Rauner’s Legionnaires’ claim misses the mark--and the point
","Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration has faced a barrage of criticism for its response to a series of deadly Legionnaires’ disease outbreaks at the state-run veterans home in downstate Quincy. Speaking last week to a group of state employees and lawmakers about the state budget in downstate Marion, Rauner tied extreme weather conditions in 2015 to the outbreak that killed 12 Quincy Veterans’ Home residents that year and sickened dozens of others. Subsequent Legionnaires’ outbreaks at the home sickened more residents. ""In 2015, we had massive floods and tornadoes,"" the governor said. ""The Mississippi River got a bunch of flooded water into it, a lot of dirt, and a whole bunch of Legionella bacteria, which are nasty water bugs … The Mississippi River is where the Quincy Veterans’ Home gets its water. And bacteria got in all the old plumbing and we’ve been treating it and heating it and filtering it and you can’t get rid of all the bacteria, so now we’ve got to rebuild it."" Rauner has been on the defensive over the Quincy situation ever since WBEZ, Chicago’s public radio station, disclosed late last year that his administration kept residents of the home as well as the public in the dark for several days after that 2015 outbreak was first detected. The flood theory isn’t the first time Rauner has sought to deflect blame for the deaths on to an Act of God out of his control. And that raises two complementary questions we thought worth checking out: Could he be right? And if he is, so what? The Quincy story continues to unfold against the backdrop of a heated election battle between Republican Rauner and Democrat J.B. Pritzker, so it stands to reason that the incumbent would be sensitive to allegations of fatally dropping the ball. Early this spring, we rated as Mostly False a claim by Pritzker seeking to connect a recent outbreak at Quincy of stomach flu-like norovirus with the earlier Legionnaires’ problems. A few months earlier, we rated as Half True an attempt by Rauner to explain away the Legionnaires’ problems at Quincy by stressing that the bacteria lurks in most Illinois water systems. Experts said such contamination usually presents no threat unless water systems are poorly maintained. Rauner’s argument about floods and tornadoes comes in the same spirit as his water systems comment, but experts say it is even less grounded in fact. WBEZ followed up by reporting that neither Rauner nor his public health administration were able to cite any analyses directly linking flooding to the outbreaks, which returned in 2016, 2017 and again this year. An array of experts, including federal health officials investigating the Quincy situation, also did not back up any flooding connection to the veterans’ home problems. So we asked Rauner’s office for any further evidence. We also sought an explanation for why attempting to pinpoint a cause for the initial outbreak mitigated criticism of how the administration handled the crisis once it was discovered. Spokeswoman Rachel Bold said the administration is exploring various theories for both the cause of, and remedy to, the outbreaks, and pointed to several studies on the correlation between increased rainfall and a heightened risk of Legionnaires’ disease. But she did not address our second question about the relevance of raising the flooding issue. Which underscores a different, and likely more important, point. Former President George W. Bush clearly was powerless to stop Hurricane Katrina from slamming into New Orleans in 2005. The problem for Bush was how slowly his administration reacted to a tragedy with broad and fatal consequences once winds subsided and the devastation became clear. Similarly, not even Rauner’s harshest critics have suggested he could have prevented the initial Legionnaires’ outbreak in 2015. But lawmakers from both parties and political opponents have blasted his administration for delays in responding to the crisis and possibly making it worse. Rauner vehemently disagrees, and it’s not our purpose here to weigh in on who is right or wrong on that score. What is significant, however, is whether the trigger for the outbreak in any way affected the response, and the governor has provided no evidence for that being the case. While speaking to state employees and lawmakers about Illinois’ budgetary priorities, Rauner claimed ""massive floods"" led to a deadly Legionnaires’ disease outbreak that hit the Quincy Veterans’ Home during his first year in office. His administration was unable to cite any analysis specific to Quincy to demonstrate that link, and federal health experts who have investigated the Quincy situation have made no such connection, either. More to the point, criticism of the governor in respect to Quincy centers not on what led to the initial Legionnaires’ outbreak but how slow his administration was to respond while seniors were sickened and many died. The governor’s statement appears to be an effort to deflect blame. Rauner’s Act-of-God claims about the source of Legionnaires’ are unverified and off-point. For that, we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ADE840>],/factchecks/2018/jun/18/bruce-rauner/rauners-legionnaires-claim-misses-mark-and-point/

Tweeted photo inaccurately indicates boy 'caged' by federal government
","A photo made us wonder if a small boy was placed in a cage with other youngsters as part of federal authorities cracking down on families trying to cross from Mexico into the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced April 6, 2018 that Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would hence go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied and subject to being housed separately by the government. Toward the end of May 2018, The Washington Post reported that the government lately had custody of more than 10,700 children in shelters. That story didn’t mention any children getting held behind bars or inside cages.  Also that month, President Donald Trump accurately said in a tweet that Democrats had just mistakenly depicted four-year-old photos of children behind bars as if the children were recently confined in such conditions. The photo that drew our attention appeared in a June 11, 2018, tweet showing the boy in a cage with what looks like three other children, his fingers gripping the enclosure’s wire frame, his face fretful. By the time we saw it, the debunkists at Snopes.com had concluded that the photo was ""miscaptioned"" because it was snapped at a protest staged in Texas, Snopes said. Tweet features photo The tweet showcasing the photo was posted by Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and filmmaker, and it doesn’t say where the photo was taken--whether at a protest or inside a facility. Vargas’s tweet otherwise says: ""This is what happens when a government believes people are ‘illegal.’ Kids in cages."" Vargas further said, in a tweet responding to his photo tweet, that he’d pulled the image from a friend’s Facebook page and hadn’t determined its precise origin. ""I shared it,"" Vargas tweeted, because ""when I was detained in McAllen in 2014, I was with boys who were locked up. It wasn’t okay then; it’s not okay now."" Snopes.com specified that the photo was taken at a Texas protest June 10, 2018, though we saw that a string of protest photos posted on Facebook as noted by Snopes did not include the specific photo of the boy caged. Utah journalist identifies photographer Nothing we saw on Facebook from the organization credited by Snopes with posting the photo, the Texas chapter of the Brown Berets de Cemanahuac, presented the photo. But our online searches yielded a June 12, 2018, declaration directed at Vargas on Twitter. ""This photo,"" the tweet at Vargas says, ""was taken by Leroy Peña as part of a protest with the Brown Berets on June 10th, presumably in Texas."" That nudge, which we spotted in a June 13, 2018, post about the photo on the Twitchy website, was attributed to Utah journalist-activist Kaz Weida. Yet by the time we saw Weida’s tweet, we noticed the web link Weida offered to the original photo didn’t lead to a live web page. We also didn’t spot the photo in scrolling through Peña’s public Facebook posts from what looked to us like the June 10, 2018, protest in Dallas that included children standing inside a four-sided open-topped enclosure erected outside a building. Next, we sought help from Weida, who suggested by email that we plug the link she’d tweeted into the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which compiles and saves web posts. Following that guidance, we saw that the archive on June 12, 2018 saved what appeared to be a copy of Peña’s since-deleted 7:46 a.m. June 11, 2018 Facebook post featuring a message atop two versions of the photo showing the unhappy boy fenced in. Peña opened that Facebook post: ""This was part of our protest yesterday, but this is actually going on right now, at this very moment, in child detention centers throughout this country."" Dallas resident says he took photo Next, we connected with Peña, who responded to our Facebook message by giving an interview by phone in which he said he’d taken and posted the photos of the boy. At the moment he took the photo, Peña said, the boy had just followed his older brother through a gate into the enclosure set up for the protest outside City Hall in Dallas. Peña said that after getting behind the fencing, the boy spotted his mother outside the space--which explains his wrenched look. Peña, who said he lives in Dallas, said the boy’s mother quickly fetched him. ""He was only in there 30 seconds,"" Peña said.  We reached out about the tweeted photo to Homeland Security and the Administration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services, which has oversight of children transferred into government custody when adults are detained, and didn’t hear back. Our ruling A photo tweeted in opposition to federal authorities separating children from parents detained at the U.S.-Mexico border showed what looked like an unhappy boy in a cage. The photo wasn’t taken of a boy in custody, we found. Rather, the child was in an open-topped enclosure temporarily erected for a June 2018 Texas protest of the separation of children from parents.

"['Congress', 'PunditFact', 'Fareed Zakaria']","
Yes, the Democratic Party is at nearly its weakest point in a century
","While the Democratic Party held the White House for two terms during Barack Obama’s presidency, much of the country was turning a deeper shade of red. Republicans made dramatic down-ballot gains over the past decade, a trend that may have been overlooked somewhat given Democratic control of the executive branch for most of this time. But as the party vies to recapture the House and Senate from the GOP in upcoming midterm elections, the roots of Democrats’ recent losses are being reexamined. ""Unless Democrats face up to this reality and devise a strategy to reverse this tidal wave of defeat, they might find themselves surprised one more time this November,"" said CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. ""When you tally up their representation in Congress, state legislatures and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years."" This stat, from the June 10 broadcast of his CNN show, was depicted in a graphic showing each of the two major parties’ power shifts since 1920 in Congress, governorships and state legislatures.  (Source: CNN) The chart shows an ebb and flow of the parties’ power over roughly the past 100 years. The high-water mark of Democratic representation came during the New Deal era. But overall, the century is bookended with Democrats in positions of relative weakness. Zakaria is right: The Democratic Party is at nearly its weakest point in a century. Zakaria’s broader point was that center-left politics are in decline not only in the United States, but across the Western world. He cited a book by Barnard College Sheri Berman, ""Why the Left Loses,"" which posits several explanatory factors: center-left parties field weak leaders; they shoulder the blame (fairly or not) when the post-World War II liberal order fails, as in the 2008 global financial crisis; and they’ve embraced a politics of identity that alienates large swaths of the electorate. A central premise to Zakaria’s argument was the statistic about Democrats’ near-historically low influence in Congress and at the state level. A CNN spokeswoman said Zakaria had been relying on a Real Clear Politics analysis of more than a century of data, as well as a piece in 538.com. We contacted the RCP researchers Sean Trende and David Byler (who is now with the Weekly Standard), who shared their dataset with us. Zakaria deviated slightly from their methodology (he omitted partisan data on presidents), but the down-ballot numbers seem to back up his point about Democrats’ waning power. ""Zakaria’s chart doesn’t include presidential performance, which is included in our original metric,"" Trende said. ""That wouldn’t, however, alter the basic conclusion, and his findings are a fair representation of our research."" To establish their partisan power index, Trende and Byler devised a points system for Democrats’ and Republicans’ performance in five electoral categories: president, House, Senate, state legislatures and gubernatorial performance. They added the five metrics together for each party, at two-year intervals. The party with the higher number had more power relative to the other. Byler noted a couple caveats. For starters, the dataset ends at the 2016 election. Furthermore, the researchers made certain judgment calls that resulted in the index not tracking exactly with election results. For example, Janet Napolitano won the 2006 Arizona gubernatorial election, but left relatively soon after the 2008 election to join the Obama administration. That meant Jan Brewer, a Republican, was in office for much of 2009-11. Under the RCP index, we found three historical instances where Democrats held a weaker position, relative to Republicans, than they did following the 2016 election: in 1920, 1926 and 1928. Given Zakaria’s hedging — he said Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years — we think his claim passes muster. The RCP data shows the Democrats’ Senate representation was weakest in 1920 during the Republican presidency of Warren G. Harding. At that point, the GOP held a 59-37 seat advantage — with Democrats holding 10 fewer seats than they do today. (Technically, Democrats currently hold 47 seats, though two Independent senators — Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine — caucus with the Democrats, giving Republicans a razor-thin 51-seat majority.)  To get another view of the historical data, we turned to the Brookings Institution’s Vital Statistics on Congress, which tracks election results (again, the RCP data is not precisely pegged to election results). According to Brookings, there were nine other instances where Democrats held fewer Senate seats than they do today: 1921 (37), 1923 (43), 1925 (40), 1929 (39), 1947 (45), 1997 and 1999 (45 each), 2005 (44) and 2015 (44). As in the Senate, the 1920s were a rough decade for House Democrats. The party’s weakest showing in the House was in 1920, when Democrats held 131 seats to Republicans’ 303, according to RCP data.  Brookings data shows six other instances when Democrats held fewer than the 193 seats they boast today. At the state legislative level, Democrats have ceded enormous power to Republicans over the past decade. In 2008, Democrats controlled twice as many legislatures as the GOP (24-14). But Democrats’ fortunes began to reverse with their 2010 midterm ""shellacking"" (to borrow Obama’s phrase).  John Mahoney, a policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said it was accurate to say Democrats are at near-historical lows in this arena. ""There are currently 3,125 Ds serving in state legislatures, which is the lowest since 1928 when there were 3,057 Ds serving,"" Mahoney said. ""The lowest ever (since 1900) Democratic representation in the states was in 1920 when only 2,545 Ds were serving in state legislatures."" A look at Democrats’ standing in governships over the past decade shows a similarly declining trend, placing the party in one of its weakest positions over the past century. Democrats now hold 16 governors mansions, compared to 33 controlled by Republicans. (Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska is an Independent.)  According to RCP data, the only time Democrats had a weaker standing in the past 100 years was in 1920, when they controlled a mere 14 governorships. As we have noted in the past, the Democratic decline under Obama that produced the current low point was unusually big, but it was hardly unprecedented. Since World War II, no two-term president (or presidential tag team) has ever gained Senate seats, House seats, governorships, or state legislative chambers over an eight-year period. Rather, every single presidency has suffered substantial losses in each of those categories over the past seven decades. There has literally been no upside in down-ballot races for presidents as far back as Franklin D. Roosevelt. Zakaria said, ""When you tally up their representation in Congress, state legislatures and governorships, the Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years."" Democrats wield less power than Republicans in each of these offices. In the 1920s, they had an even weaker standing relative to the GOP than they do today. But Zakaria hedged his bets by saying Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years — and the numbers appear to back him up. We rate this True.

Republican PAC misleads in ad about Sen. Bill Nelson's record on Social Security, Medicare
","A new ad portrays Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a career politician who doesn’t have the backs of senior citizens. The New Republican PAC, which is backing Gov. Rick Scott in Florida’s closely watched Senate race, released a 30-second ad criticizing Nelson’s voting record in Congress. The ad juxtaposes Nelson’s mugshots from the 1970s to the 2000s with claims about his votes on Medicare and Social Security, two federal programs that largely benefit seniors, at the time.  ""Politician Bill Nelson continues to run for public office, leaving few footprints behind,"" a narrator says. ""Votes with Hillary Clinton 89 percent of the time. And raises taxes again. Cuts to Medicare providers, weakens Social Security protections."" Nelson’s team quickly raised objections, criticizing Scott for having ""refused"" to expand Medicaid, the federal health care program primarily serving the very poor. ""Here's the truth: No one is more committed to protecting Medicare and Social Security than Bill Nelson,"" said campaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel. We wanted to get to the bottom of the ad’s claim: Did Nelson vote to cut Medicare providers and weaken Social Security protections? The New Republican PAC cited a few votes Nelson took while in the U.S. Senate, but experts questioned whether the measures really lived up to the consequences the ad described. All in all, these were not votes geared toward making substantive, structural changes to the Social Security and Medicare programs. The PAC cited two measures that Nelson supported in 2011 and 2013 affecting Medicare. The 2011 vote was for the Budget Control Act, and the 2013 vote was for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Understanding how those votes can be characterized as ""cuts to Medicare providers"" requires a lot of context and a little history lesson on the 2011 sequester. Let’s start with Nelson’s vote on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, spearheaded by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. The budget passed the Senate 64-36, and every Democrat, including Nelson, voted in favor. The legislation averted a government shutdown in January 2014 by funding federal agencies and providing some relief from the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration in 2011. Here’s the relevant background: In the summer of 2011, President Barack Obama and Congress were engaged in a high-stakes standoff over the debt limit. House Republicans insisted on spending cuts before increasing the debt limit. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner tried unsuccessfully to reach a ""grand bargain"" to put the federal budget on more stable footing. When that failed, they arrived at the much less ambitious Budget Control Act of 2011. That law included about $1.2 trillion in future budget cuts, but it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion via a bipartisan ""supercommittee."" As further incentive, the law had a threat: If a supercommittee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted down the supercommittee proposal, a ""sequester"" — or across-the-board cut — would automatically go into effect, with half coming from defense. Sequestration was enacted when Congress passed the Budget Control Act in August 2011. The 2013 budget extended a 2 percent spending cut to Medicare provider and plan payments. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the 2 percent cut translated to a reduction of $11.1 billion for Medicare providers in fiscal year 2013. ""That means that doctors, hospitals, and providers will continue to bill Medicare in the normal way but will be reimbursed at 98 cents on the dollar, as will per-capita premium payments made to health insurance plans on behalf of Medicare participants,"" the center wrote in its analysis. So that’s a cut, but experts suggested the ad is overplaying it. First, the cut was intended as a short-term bridge to a more permanent solution to spiraling Medicare provider costs. Second, the provision was a stopgap alternative to a much larger cut that would have gone into effect if nothing else was passed, said Stuart Guterman, a senior health care scholar at the Commonwealth Fund, which supports expanding health care access for the poor. The final Medicare physician fee schedule rule called for a 20.1 percent reduction in the fee schedule update for 2014. By passing the legislation cited in the ad, Congress was also able to block the 20.1 percent cut and replace it with a small increase for services provided through March 31, 2014. All in all,  Joe Antos, a health policy specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said ""Two percent is clearly a minor reduction."" The last point we’ll make about both bills is that they were bipartisan and passed by significant margins. And 28 Republicans including Mitch McConnell, who leads the Senate GOP majority that Scott hopes to join, supported the 2011 measure. To push back on this claim, Nelson’s camp said that he opposed cuts to Medicare in 2017 when the November GOP tax plan threatened to make cuts to Social Security (At the time, the CBO predicted the plan could cut $25 billion from Medicare.) They also pointed to legislation he sponsored such as measure to end a Medicare policy that causes seniors to be charged unknowingly with high costs after receiving medical care.   The ad hammers Nelson for harming Social Security in the 1980s and again in the 2000s, first with a ""cut"" and then by weakening its protections. We’re focused on his Senate actions for this fact-check, but we’ll explain his 1983 vote below. To support its claim, the pro-Scott group cited two votes Nelson took in 2006 and 2007. It’s misleading to characterize those as votes in favor of ""weakening Social Security protections."" The votes involved essentially the same measure and were introduced by the same lawmaker, then-Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. DeMint’s amendments aimed to create a reserve fund for Social Security. So, the vote wasn’t explicitly looking to weaken Social Security protections. By voting against it, Nelson opposed adding something to the existing program. The amendment failed both times, with Nelson and every other Democrat voting against the measures. According to the Democrats who voted against it, the amendment was a step toward Social Security privatization, which critics argued would worsen solvency, not strengthen it.   Supporters of the amendment, including DeMint, argued that setting up a reserve fund would stop Congress from borrowing money from the Social Security Trust Fund. Andrew Biggs, a Social Security policy specialist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the claim about Nelson ""iffy."" ""The DeMint proposal was a stalking horse for personal accounts, in the sense of setting aside money that DeMint and others would have wished to be invested in personal accounts,"" Biggs said. ""It’s not unreasonable that someone who opposed Social Security personal accounts, as Sen. Nelson did, wouldn’t favor (those) amendments."" So Nelson could counter-argue that his vote instead served to keep privatization at bay. In addition, in 2015, Nelson cosponsored legislation to boost Social Security and other critical benefits for seniors and more recently, he filed legislation to waive the 30-day requirement with respect for Social Security to ensure that residents of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands affected by hurricanes would have immediate access to Social Security benefits. He also was endorsed by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare in April. ""Sen. Nelson has been a staunch advocate of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid since taking office in 2001,"" they wrote. ""His voting record on these issues has consistently earned him a 100 percent rating from the National Committee. The pro-Scott PAC reaches into the early years of Nelson’s time in Washington as further evidence that he made ""cuts"" to Social Security. In 1983, Nelson voted for the Social Security amendments, which were passed by bipartisan majorities and signed into law by Republican Ronald Reagan. Before the amendments passed, actuaries warned that Social Security payments would be unable to continue paying benefits in July 1983 unless Congress acted. The law raised payroll taxes, taxed Social Security benefits for some higher earners and gradually increased the full retirement age. The New Republican PAC ad said that Nelson voted for ""cuts to Medicare providers"" and voted to ""weaken Social Security protections"" as a senator in the 2000s. This claim is misleading. The votes neither weakened Social Security nor eroded the position of Medicare providers, experts said. The budget act in 2013 actually prevented a larger cut to Medicare providers, and the Social Security votes in the 2000s can just as easily be portrayed as a ""stalking horse"" for personal accounts.  In addition, the ad ignores other actions Nelson has taken to protect Medicare and Social Security. We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C14C240>],/factchecks/2018/jun/15/new-republican-pac/republican-pac-misleads-ad-about-sen-bill-nelsons-/

How Scott Walker's rejection of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare cost Wisconsin $1 billion
","Health care is the most important thing the state does, Eau Claire state Rep. Dana Wachs declared, before launching into an attack on Gov. Scott Walker. ""Governor Walker has turned down a billion dollars in Medicaid money over the course of his tenure,"" Wachs claimed in a WisconsinEye TV interview on April 11, 2018. That’s a reference to additional federal money made available to do a ""full expansion"" of Medicaid under Obamacare, a law frequently attacked by the Republican governor, who is running for a third term in 2018. Wachs has previously made the $1 billion claim. And it’s likely he or one of the nine other Democrats running for governor will make it again. So, let’s check it. Nonpartisan scorekeeper To back Wachs’ claim, his campaign cited an April 2017 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. We confirmed that the memo contains the nonpartisan state agency’s most recent estimates on expanding Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor. More governor’s race fact checks: How Walker and the Democratic candidates for governor stack up on the Truth-O-Meter. According to the memo: Had Wisconsin done the full expansion of Medicaid, people earning an income up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level would have been eligible for Medicaid. (In 2018, the poverty level is $12,140 for individuals and $25,100 for a family of four.) With that full expansion, Wisconsin would have gained enough additional federal funding that it would be spending an estimated $1.07 billion less in state money on Medicaid, over roughly a five-year period. The estimate is through the current, 2017-’19 state budget cycle, and assumes the state had done the full expansion when it could have in April 2014. In responding to Wachs’ claim, Walker’s campaign did not challenge the $1 billion figure, but offered a statement that said in part: Taking the Medicaid funding under Obamacare would require the state to expand eligibility for Medicaid beyond those living in poverty. The people pushing for Wisconsin to take the Medicaid expansion are really advocating for putting more able-bodied, working-age adults onto a new form of welfare. Walker has also argued in rejecting the full expansion that because of persistent U.S. budget deficits, the federal government eventually would reduce the money available for the expansion, putting a financial burden on states. Partial expansion It’s important to point out that Walker did do what is called a ""partial expansion"" of Medicaid. As a result of that change, for the first time in state history, essentially everyone living in Wisconsin at the federal poverty level is eligible for Medicaid. In other words, in Wisconsin, you’re eligible for Medicaid if your income is at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, rather than the 133 percent with the full expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. Walker’s move did push Wisconsinites living slightly above the poverty level off of Medicaid. They in turn became eligible to buy, with federal subsidies, private health insurance in the Obamacare marketplace. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Our rating Wachs says Walker ""has turned down $1 billion of Medicaid money over the course of his tenure."" Leaving aside whether Walker chose good policy or not, his decision not to do a ""full expansion"" of Medicaid means the state is spending about $1 billion more in state money on Medicaid than if it had accepted additional federal money that would come with a full expansion. With the caveat that the figure is an estimate from the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, covering roughly 2014 to 2019, Wach’s statement is accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967A2640>],/factchecks/2018/jun/15/dana-wachs/how-scott-walkers-rejection-medicaid-expansion-und/

Lupe Valdez says 1 in 4 Texas clinics closed after lawmakers cut family planning aid
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez tied state spending cuts on Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s watch to a plummet in women’s health services. In an online survey that came our way from Valdez on May 7, 2018, respondents were asked to mark their level of worry in response to this query: ""Over the past decade, the GOP in Texas and across the country have been destroying women’s healthcare in every way they can in order to appease their special interest donors. After Texas cut their two-year family planning budget by $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors."" Those figures sounded familiar. We checked on whether they hold up. We previously noted that actions set in motion by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature drove down family planning spending in the state budget by more than $70 million from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million to $37.9 million budgeted for 2012-13. To our refreshed inquiry this year, Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, confirmed the spending reduction. Mann told us by email, though, that the commission ""cannot confirm the number of clinics that may have closed."" Another HHSC spokeswoman, Carrie Williams, noted that programs and patient eligibility requirements also changed in subsequent years. A 2015 study Meantime, Oliver Bernstein of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for services to low-income Texans, reminded us by email that the 1-in-4 figure initially appeared in a study published in April 2015. That study, undertaken by entities including the Population Research Center at the University of Texas, estimated that 25 percent of Texas family planning clinics closed in the wake of the 2011 cuts. Researchers said they reached that percentage based on surveys and in-depth interviews of leaders of organizations that had previously fielded state family planning grants. The researchers summed up: ""82 clinics closed or discontinued family planning services because of decreased funding. Many providers reported reduced hours and the elimination of evening or weekend hours. Reduced funding also led organizations to implement or expand systems requiring women to pay fixed fees (vs. as sliding scale) for services,"" the researchers said. The year before the cuts took effect, the study says, 217,884 women received family planning services funded by state-awarded block grants through Texas clinics overseen by 72 organizations while another state program served 119,083 women with incomes of up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level. On a related front, the researchers said: ""In 2011, 71% of organizations widely offered long-acting reversible contraception; in 2012– 2013, only 46% did so. Organizations served 54% fewer clients than they had in the previous period."" The study says: ""In-depth interview respondents reported that they did not know what had happened to their former clients but suspected that they simply were not seeking reproductive health care."" The study’s lead author, Dr. Kari White of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, elaborated at the time: ""The 2011 funding cuts really had a dramatic impact on services for many organizations–including those who were not the targets of the legislation. They were simply unable to serve many women in need in their communities, and it will probably take some time before they are able to rebuild those connections and level of service."" Lawmakers also targeted abortion providers The study further notes that lawmakers in 2011 also voted to bar state family planning aid from going to health care providers affiliated with organizations that perform or promote abortions such as Planned Parenthood; its clinics had been the Texas program’s biggest provider of contraceptive care and cancer screening, serving more than 40,000 women a year. Any rebound? Unsaid in Valdez’s survey question: State-budgeted family planning aid later escalated, programs were reorganized and, the HHSC says, there’s been an uptick in clinics. In 2015, we found True a claim that the 2013 Legislature increased spending on women’s health to record levels. The White-led study acknowledges that increase yet says programs backed by the fresh funding had yet to be implemented. Such measures would prove successful, the researchers said, ""only if funding goes to organizations with necessary experience and training for efficient delivery of family planning services and if all Texans in need of services are eligible."" In May 2018, we asked the researchers if the number of family planning clinics had turned around. In a statement sent by email, White reaffirmed the study’s finding that 25 percent of clinics initially closed or stopped providing family planning services. White said that while the research team hadn’t tallied clinics that subsequently opened, an April 2018 CPPP issue brief took note of the Texas HHSC allocating more aid to family planning for the fiscal year that ran through August 2017 ""and,"" that brief says, the commission ""re-opened contracts for the program for the first time in years, increasing clinic participation."" That  brief says more than 300,000 Texas women fielded government-supported family planning services in 2010-11, before the actions by the 2011 Legislature took effect, while about 215,000 women drew on such services in the fiscal year running through August 2016. According to the brief, the number of ""Family Planning-contracted clinics"" in Texas rose from 89 in 2016 to 258 clinics in 2017. ""In comparison,"" the center wrote, ""before the huge funding cuts that took effect in"" fiscal ""2012, about 290 clinics were contracted in the program in both 2010 and 2011."" Put another way, it looked like Texas clinics with government-funded family planning services were lately down by 32, or 11 percent, from the clinics offering such services before the legislative moves of 2011. We asked the center if its 2018 analysis demonstrates a substantial rebound in clinics. By email, Bernstein pointed again to the 2015 study reporting the 25 percent decrease. He otherwise said HHSC figures show state-contracted family planning clinics escalating from as few as 89 in 2016 to 258 in 2017 and 246 in 2018. We also tried to gauge any rebound in Texas women getting state-supported family planning help. On April 26, 2018, a little more than a week before Valdez made her claim, the HHSC posted a report stating that in the fiscal year that ran through August 2017, 219,396 low-income Texans received family planning services through state-supported programs. (Earlier, the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights, estimated in a 2016 report that as of 2014, nearly 1.8 million Texas women needed publicly funded contraceptive services and supplies.) A day later, the CPPP said in a blog post about the report that in ""good news,"" the number of Texas women fielding family planning services with state aid escalated 29 percent from 2016 to 2017. But, the center said, the number of women served still trailed--""by tens of thousands""--women served by government-backed family planning programs before the 2011 actions. We also queried the Texas Women’s Health Care Coalition, a nonpartisan group that says it’s dedicated to improving the health and well-being of women, babies and families by assuring access to preventive care for women. The group’s chair, Evelyn Delgado, said by phone there’ve been significant increases in women served by state-backed family planning programs though she and Erika Ramirez, the coalition’s director of policy and advocacy, said Texas has yet to serve the number of women who fielded such services before the 2011 actions. Williams, the HHSC spokeswoman, separately counseled by email against comparing 2016 or subsequent state counts of women drawing on state-supported family planning to past tallies because, she said, the older figures include double-counting due to patients drawing on multiple programs. Our ruling Valdez said that after Texas cut family planning spending $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors. A 2015 study found that after Republicans made that cut--also barring such aid from entities associated with abortion providers--one in four family-planning clinics closed. But this statement also lacks information in that there was subsequently a burst of state family planning aid, a reorganization of programs and a rebound in clinics though, it appears, not a full catch-up in women getting services. We rate Valdez’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

In February, network spokeswoman Irena Briganti told the AP that the story that Smith has been let go was ""completely false."" Smith has drawn the ire of some Trump fans because he has criticized the president on air. Newsflash included an accurate quote by Smith in which he said Trump made a false statement that the media frequently under-reports radical Islamic terror attacks. ""In short, the president’s assertion is false,"" Smith said in February 2017. ""The White House knows that it was false or could have learned that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth."" Smith told Time in an article published in March that he’s not bothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox’s opinion slate: ""We serve different masters.

""Trump’s (Department of Homeland Security) secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders,"" said an undated headline on flashnewss.club, operating under the banner ""Newsflash."" Sanctuary cities refers broadly to jurisdictions with policies that limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials.

We found that there is an element of truth to the claim, but it is also a sweeping exaggeration of what’s been said. At a Jan. 16 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about a comment made by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official on Fox News. The official, Thomas D. Homan, said on TV that he asked the Justice Department to look into criminal charges for elected officials with sanctuary policies, Harris said. The comment was made specifically about California elected officials after the enactment of the California Values Act, according to Harris. Harris: ""My question is whether DHS is currently working with the Justice Department to bring section 8-USC 1324 charges or any criminal charges against state or local officials."" Nielsen: ""I believe the request was made. The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available. The context of this is, of course, not only putting my ICE officers at risk but also finding an efficient and effective way to enforce our immigration laws."" Harris: ""So, you are aware of cases in which this code will be used to criminally charge elected officials?"" Nielsen: ""I am not aware of any cases, no ma'am. I believe it was just a request to look into it."" At the hearing, Nielsen acknowledged that the Department of Homeland Security had asked the Justice Department to look into the issue, but did not confirm, as Newsflash claimed, that they are already preparing to make arrests. The website also presented a revised version of what Nielsen said, quoting her as saying ""The Department of Justice is looking into what roads might be accessible."" (She said: ""The Department of Justice is reviewing what avenues might be available."") DHS referred PolitiFact to the January hearing but did not say what avenues, if any, the Justice Department had determined to take — or if it had responded to DHS’ request.

The story offers a more toned-down version, saying DHS ""has asked federal prosecutors to see if they can lodge criminal charges against sanctuary cities."" Newsflash claimed, ""Trump’s DHS secretary confirms they are preparing to arrest sanctuary city leaders."" While DHS has asked the Justice Department to look into what charges could be pursued against elected officials from sanctuary cities, DHS’s top official did not go far enough to say arrests were coming.

Did Nevada's Heller back bill to cut pre-existing conditions protections?
","When the U.S. Justice Department asked a federal judge to overturn guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions in the Affordable Care Act, Democrats pounced. The department filed a brief on June 7, and the next day, Nevada Democratic Senate candidate Jacky Rosen tied Republican incumbent Dean Heller to the administration's move. ""Last year, after Sen. Dean Heller broke his promise to protect Nevadans’ health care and caved to President Trump, he wound up helping craft a partisan repeal bill that also would have slashed coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions,"" Rosen’s campaign posted June 8. The attack from team Rosen concerns the 2017 Graham-Cassidy bill that would have turned federal health care programs into block grants to the states. The bill never came up for a vote, but Heller was an original co-sponsor. (The press release that unveiled the bill came with the headline ""Senators introduce Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson."") So the question is, would Graham-Cassidy have definitively ""slashed"" protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, as the Rosen campaign said? We dug into the bill to see. While the claim pushes too far, the legislation did open the door to a loss of the ironclad guarantee under Obamacare. The Heller campaign disagreed with Rosen’s characterization of the health care bill. Heller’s team highlighted that Graham-Cassidy left the current law on pre-existing conditions untouched. ""Insurance companies would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and would still be required to ensure patients can renew their coverage regardless of their health,"" said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper. But the bill’s rules for state waivers from many regulations in the Affordable Care Act created some ambiguity. A state would gain access to billions of dollars in block grants if it describes how (see page 11) it ""shall maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."" Heller’s office emphasized the word ""shall,"" saying it created an imperative to retain access. But the same waiver would give states the power to allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones (page 145). Under the current rules, insurance companies can’t do that. They can’t factor in health, period. In addition, current Affordable Care Act rules limit the range for premiums and say companies can’t charge an older person more than three times what they charge a younger person. The waiver does away with those limits (starting at the bottom of page 144 in the bill). A state’s commitment boils down to maintaining ""access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage."" ""That’s not nothing"" in terms of protecting people with pre-existing conditions, Indiana University health care law professor David Gamage told us in 2017. But beyond that, Gamage said the protection for pre-existing conditions gets murky. ""The bill says states have to do something, but what that something is is unclear,"" Gamage said. ""And it’s overwhelmingly likely that what some states do won’t be as robust as what people have now."" Heller’s staff told us that while the bill gave discretion to Washington administrators to set rules for what it meant by adequate and affordable coverage, the intent was to follow existing law. Looking at the first version of the bill, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 35 states plus the District of Columbia would see net funding cuts under the legislation. The health consulting firm Avalere, with funding from the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress, had a similar finding. One way or another, it costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it under the senators’ proposal. On top of that, Gamage said, Affordable Care Act regulations spread some of the costs across the private sector. Those regulations would go away, too, meaning it would be up to the states to make up the difference. Less money could push states to leave patients with less protections than they enjoy today. We looked at how Nevada might have fared under the bill. The Heller camp said, based on an analysis from Cassidy's office, the state would get more money than under Obamacare in the 2020-2026 period. On the other hand, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated a loss of $1.2 billion lost over the period. The Avalere analysis showed the Silver State getting $2 billion less by the year 2026. When we looked at the losses compared to the number of state residents, Nevada would not have been hit as hard as some of the big losers, such as California and Minnesota. But at the end of the day, the independent estimate from the Kaiser Family Foundation still said Nevada would face constraints on how much it could do for people. ""The terms ‘adequate’ and ‘affordable’ are very much subject to interpretation,"" said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein at DePaul University. ""What is adequate and affordable for one person may not be for another. And it almost certainly doesn’t mean that those with pre-existing conditions have to be charged the same as those without."" If states fell short, Epstein said Washington regulators could try to hold their feet to the fire and press them to do better with their federal money, but ""we can anticipate a whole lot of litigation."" And even a win for Washington might not mean much in practice. ""Folks who are sick and need health insurance coverage now don’t have the luxury of time to let these legal debates play out,"" Epstein said. Both Epstein and Gamage said in theory, states might find ways to squeeze much more health coverage out of each dollar. Or failing that, they might decide to put much more of their own money into health care and re-establish rules modeled on the Affordable Care Act. But they said neither outcome is likely. Epstein said there’s an underlying disagreement on what it means to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Under the Affordable Care Act, those people got the same kind of coverage at the same price as others. Under Graham-Cassidy, ""insurers will have to continue to cover people, but not at the same rates. And the policies don’t have to provide the same coverage."" Rosen said that Heller backed a bill that would have ""slashed coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions."" The legislation included language to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but it opened the door to insurance plans that might be more limited or less affordable than exist today. How much protection would be lost is impossible to predict. The proposal told states they had to plan to keep coverage accessible and affordable for people with pre-existing conditions. But it didn’t define those terms and that falls short of an ironclad guarantee. A full reading of the bill’s text shows that protections for pre-existing conditions would be less certain, but the statement pushes beyond the known impacts of the Graham-Cassidy bill. We rate this claim Half True. Clarification: After we published this fact-check, Heller’s office provided updated materials on the Graham-Cassidy legislation. We included that information, as well as a description of the Avalere study’s funding. The rating remained unchanged.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D7C040>],/factchecks/2018/jun/13/jacky-rosen/did-nevadas-heller-back-bill-cut-pre-existing-cond/

Donald Trump said Chrysler is leaving Mexico. It isn't
","Several automakers have unveiled hefty plans to expand in the United States in recent weeks. Toyota and Mazda teamed up to open a $1.6 billion factory in Alabama by 2021. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced it would put $1 billion into its Warren, Mich., factory to make heavy duty versions of its profitable Ram pickup trucks. Speaking at women’s event in Washington, President Donald Trump pointed to this good news as proof of his policies. ""We’re making incredible progress,"" he said Jan. 16. ""Toyota is now moving back. Mexico — it’s very interesting — Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan. You haven’t heard that one in a while."" In this fact-check, we looked at whether Chrysler is leaving Mexico and returning to Michigan. To cut to the chase, Chrysler is shifting truck production to the United States, but not at the expense of jobs or plants in Mexico. From Saltillo to Warren Saltillo, Mexico, is a nexus of Fiat Chrysler production. It has five plants in the area, doing everything from building engines to assembling finished vehicles. Over 4,000 workers at its truck assembly plant turn out several variations of the Ram truck line. On Jan. 11, the company said that truck production was headed to Warren, Mich., in 2020. ""To support the increased volume at the Warren facility, 2,500 new jobs will be created,"" the company said in a news release. And what would happen at the Saltillo truck plant? It would be ""repurposed to produce future commercial vehicles for global distribution,"" the release said. The company’s spokesman in Mexico, Miguel Ceballos, told reporters – and the company’s American press office confirmed – that the automaker expected no change in the number of Mexican workers. So under the plan, the United States gains workers and Mexico holds steady. Kristen Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research, a government-and-industry-financed research group in Ann Arbor, Mich., told us the move doesn’t mean Fiat Chrysler is leaving Mexico. ""The plant in Mexico stays open,"" Dziczek said. ""Chrysler has a very profitable truck product and only two plants in the United States where it makes them. This allows them to retool while keeping production rolling so they can avoid down time."" The move is part of Fiat Chrysler’s longer term shift away from making cars to making trucks and SUVs in the United States. In 2016, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told investors, ""By the time we finish with this, hopefully, all of our production assets in the United States will be producing either Jeeps or Ram."" The company’s press office said over 90 percent of Ram trucks are sold in America. Industry experts note that trucks are more profitable to Fiat Chrysler than cars. The last 200 model, a passenger car, rolled off the assembly line at Fiat Chrysler’s Sterling Heights, Mich., plant in 2016. Soon after, the company announced that facility, not far from the Warren plant, would start making Ram trucks. Marchionne credited the recent tax bill for spurring the latest move. He also argued it was the ""right thing to do"" given that Ram trucks had always been made in the United States. But concerns over the fate of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, might well have played a role too. Under NAFTA, pickup trucks made in Mexico face no tariff when they cross the border. If NAFTA is scuttled, the tariff would shoot up to 25 percent. Dziczek noted that moving truck assembly to the United States is a hedge against that risk. ""If you’re going to put a billion dollars down, why would you put it into a plant that’s on the wrong side of the border?"" she said. Our ruling Trump said that Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan. The company does plan to spend $1 billion to shift production of Ram trucks from Saltillo, Mexico, to Warren, Mich. However, this is no zero-sum game where a U.S. gain is Mexico’s loss. The Mexican plant will start making another kind of vehicle, and the company expects no change in the number of workers. There is no question though that the company’s billion dollar investment will add many new jobs in Michigan where Chrysler has long had a presence. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097202740>],/factchecks/2018/jan/18/donald-trump/trump-said-chrysler-leaving-mexico-it-isnt/

Would the military shut down if the federal government does?
","As a possible government shutdown loomed, President Donald Trump preemptively blamed Democrats for any negative fallout. Trump charged that Democratic intransigence about how to renew Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was preventing an agreement on federal spending that would keep the government open — including the country’s defense forces. ""Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards,"" Trump tweeted on Jan. 12, 2018. ""The Dems will threaten ‘shutdown,’ but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" ....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! We won’t wade into the question of who would be to blame for the shutdown. However, we wondered whether Trump was correct that a government shutdown is tantamount to ""shutting down our military."" When we checked with the White House, they said that Trump was not using the term literally, to suggest that the entire military will cease to operate. In other tweets, Trump used less sweeping language. In one, for instance, he warned against moves that would ""stop paying our troops and government workers."" Still, the less cautiously worded tweet attracted nearly 23,000 retweets and almost 91,000 likes, so we thought it was worth a closer look. What is a shutdown? Federal government shutdowns occur when spending bills expire, and Congress and the president find themselves at an impasse. A law known as the Antideficiency Act requires suspending a federal agency’s operations until an appropriation bill is enacted. But there is some leeway to continue certain federal activities deemed essential. A two-week shutdown occurred most recently in 2013, when Barack Obama was president, Democrats controlled the Senate, and Republicans controlled the House. Prior to that, there were two shutdowns in the mid 1990s, when President Bill Clinton squared off against a new Republican majority in the House and Senate. One was for five days in November 1995, and the other was for 21 days, from December 1995 to January 1996. Who works and who doesn’t During the 2013 shutdown, as many as 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, or about 40 percent of the federal workforce (not counting active-duty military personnel and U.S. Postal Service workers). The longstanding guidance is that ""employees who are performing emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property"" remain on their jobs during a shutdown. The determination of who works and who doesn’t has traditionally been made by senior executives and legal advisors at each agency. This means that the president, as the head of the executive branch, could theoretically order which federal workers must continue to show up for work, said Stan Collender, a budget specialist at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP. During a shutdown, national parks typically shut their doors, government-funded scientific research is halted, and various health and safety inspections — by agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration — are put on hold. (Some government functions are not reliant on congressional appropriations, and these can usually continue unimpeded in the face of a shutdown.) But workers responsible for human safety and security will typically remain on the job, and that includes many members of the military. How the military is affected Active-duty military personnel have always been required to work through shutdowns. Army troops don’t abandon their posts and naval ships don’t all return to port. In addition, many civilian workers in the Defense Department have been required to work through shutdowns. Other civilian workers in the Defense Department, however, hold jobs that do not meet the urgency threshold to keep working. In 2013, the government furloughed about half of its civilian workers, or about 400,000 employees, leaving a patchwork of various permissible and impermissible activities, according to Federal News Radio. ""We can and will continue to support key military operations,"" former Defense Department comptroller Bob Hale told Federal News Radio in 2013. ""We’re allowed to do that by law, but the law would force us to disrupt many of our support activities. We wouldn’t be able to do most training, we couldn’t enter into most new contracts, routine maintenance would have to stop, and we couldn’t continue efforts to improve contracting and financial management including our audit improvement efforts."" The Defense Department, like other parts of the government, will experience some consequences from a shutdown. But experts we interviewed agreed that Trump’s language in this tweet amounted to an exaggeration, especially because the Defense Department is hurt less by a shutdown than most agencies. ""All critical military functions will continue,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""There would be some wrinkles, but nothing like other areas of government."" Todd Harrison, a defense budget specialist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the ""biggest impact is probably on defense contractors, who will have to stop working."" But ""troops that are in harm’s way overseas will continue operating as normal and won’t be at any increased risk,"" he said. Paychecks could be delayed One way that even active-duty troops could feel the shutdown is in their wallets. Employees who are required to work are not paid until a new spending bill is passed— effectively working for free, at least temporarily. Workers who are furloughed have historically been compensated for back pay through subsequent congressional action, though there is no requirement that such a bill be passed. In 2013, the Office of Management and Budget estimated that $2.5 billion in pay and benefits was paid for hours not worked government-wide, said Tyler Evilsizer, research manager for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Usually, paychecks have been sent after a shutdown is over, but for the Defense Department in 2013, Congress and the president agreed to a bill in the middle of the shutdown that paid all active-duty and many civilian Defense Department employees. This enabled Defense Department employees to return to work while the shutdown was still going on for workers in other departments. Delayed paychecks are just one downside of government shutdowns. ""A shutdown is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars, disruptive of government operations, and simply bad management,"" said John Palguta, a former federal human-resources official who is now an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Public Policy Institute. ""A shutdown, however, will not put the U.S. in harm’s way by shutting down our military."" Even just planning contingencies for a possible shutdown divert time and effort from the government’s duties, said Mallory Barg Bulman, vice president of research and evaluation at the Partnership for Public Service. Our ruling Trump said that in a government shutdown, ""what they are really doing is shutting down our military."" This is an exaggeration. Based on historical precedent, the Defense Department does stand to see a substantial fraction of its civilian workers furloughed, and employee morale would likely suffer if paychecks are held back. But experts agreed that core military functions would remain operational, including all active-duty military personnel and many essential civilian workers. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809731CB80>],/factchecks/2018/jan/17/donald-trump/would-military-shut-down-if-federal-government-doe/

Mostly True: California ranks 41st on per student spending but No. 1 per prisoner
","Democratic candidate for governor Delaine Eastin wants to reduce California’s high poverty and incarceration by investing more in students. Eastin, a former state legislator and superintendent of public instruction, recently said California doesn’t spend enough on students at its K-12 schools but spends more than any state in the nation on its inmates. ""Ladies and gentlemen, you are living in the most expensive state in the union, but you are 41st in per pupil spending,"" Eastin claimed at a Los Angeles town hall for six gubernatorial candidates on Jan. 13, 2018.  ""You should be in the top 10 not the bottom 10,"" she added. ""But guess what, you’re No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure. That’s a disgrace. Budgets are statements of values. And to look at our budget, you’d think prisons were more important than education.""   Eastin makes her claim at about the 46:00 minute mark in the town hall.  Was Eastin right about those rankings? We decided to fact check her per student vs. per prisoner spending comparison. 41st in per student spending? To support the first part of the statement, Eastin’s campaign pointed to a January 2017 report by the California Budget and Policy Center. The nonprofit, which is described in some media reports as left-leaning, analyzes how budget and tax policies affect low- and middle-income Californians. Its report found ""California ranked 41st among all states in spending per K-12 student after adjusting for differences in the cost of living in each state."" It used data from the 2015-16 fiscal year. California schools spent $10,291 per K-12 student that year, or about $1,900 less than the $12,252 per student spent by the nation as a whole, the report said. Notably, California’s per student spending was up about $2,000 from the 2012-13 fiscal year, when the state ranked 50th in the nation. Jonathan Kaplan, the report’s author and a senior policy analyst at the center, told us the report applies a wage-based index to account for California’s high teacher salaries. This adjustment, he said, allows for a valid spending comparison between states that pay employees much less. Clarifications missing Eastin’s statement does not clarify that the 41st in the nation ranking includes an adjustment for cost-of-living. Nor does she mention that California’s per pupil spending has moved up the rankings in recent years.   The budget center is not the only group that ranks per pupil spending. EdWeek, a publication that covers K-12 education, ranked California 46th in per student spending, also using a cost of living adjustment. It’s most recent ranking, however, uses older data, from 2013-14, that doesn’t account for recent state spending increases. By contrast, the National Education Association conducts a straight spending comparison. It placed California’s per pupil spending at 22nd for 2015-16. In February 2017, EdSource.org published an in-depth look at the ways California’s per pupil spending has been ranked by different groups. It summarized its findings this way: ""Since 2011-12, the low point in funding following the 2007-08 recession, California has increased K-12 funding by more than $20 billion. As a result, its average per-student spending has significantly increased, and its ranking among the states has improved in the three most frequently cited studies. But there’s a big variation in the state’s ranking among the three because they use different methods and different data. California has moved up some but continues to be in the bottom fifth of states, according to Education Week and the California Budget and Policy Center, while the National Education Association places California near the middle."" Per prisoner spending To support Eastin’s claim that California is ""No. 1 in per prisoner expenditure,"" her campaign directed us to a June 2017 Associated Press article that describes those costs as ""the nation’s highest."" It said California’s per-inmate cost was expected to  climb to $75,560 in the next year. ""Since 2015, California’s per-inmate costs have surged nearly $10,000, or about 13%. New York is a distant second in overall costs at about $69,000,"" the AP reported. In August 2017, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True Sen. Kamala Harris’ claim ""it costs $75,000 per year"" to lock up an inmate in the state, based in part on the AP article and state budget estimates. We found several reasons for the dramatic cost increase. Most notable is California’s sharp drop in inmates combined with higher corrections spending, resulting from greater state contributions to prison employee pensions. The inmate drop is driven by a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. California’s prison population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year. Meanwhile, there’s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate number have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced. ""So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent"" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said. Prisoner cost to keep climbing Looking ahead, the per inmate cost is expected to go up again -- to $80,729 -- under Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposed 2018-19 budget released this month. PolitiFact California could not immediately obtain current per prisoner cost estimates for the state of New York. Various rankings have listed New York as No. 1 for per prisoner costs, including a Vera Institute of Justice report using the earlier 2015 data. Christian Henrichson, research director at the Vera Institute, told us by email that California and New York ""are neck and neck on this measure, and the answer may depend on the year studied."" California’s continued per prisoner cost spike ""would place CA in the top spot,"" Jon Murchinson, Eastin’s campaign spokesman, asserted in an email. While we don’t have all the exact figures, that’s a fairly safe bet. Though per capita inmate costs continue to climb, that doesn’t mean California spends more on prisons than K-12 education, as some might take from Eastin’s claim. The reverse is correct: Gov. Jerry Brown’s current general fund budget projects spending 42 percent, or $55 billion, on the K-12 system. Meanwhile, it proposes spending 9 percent, or about $12 billion, on the prison system. Our ruling Candidate for governor Delaine Eastin recently claimed California ranks 41st in per pupil K-12 spending but is ""No. 1 in per prisoner"" spending. She relied on a January 2017 policy center report that backs up the per pupil spending ranking, after adjusting for cost of living. Another ranking that makes a straight spending comparison puts California at 22nd for per pupil spending. Eastin did not make this clear in her statement nor did she note that California’s per student spending has increased in recent years. Eastin’s claim that California is No. 1 for per prisoner costs is backed up by a 2017 Associated Press report, which listed New York a distant second. While we could not immediately find current figures for New York, we discovered that California’s per prisoner costs are expected to again rise -- to more than $80,000 -- in the next fiscal year, several thousand dollars higher than in recent years. Overall, Eastin’s comparison is supported by recent studies. But her statement could use clarifying information. We rate it Mostly True.

Andrew White says he misspoke in saying half of new Texas teachers lack college degrees
","Andrew White, a Democratic candidate for Texas governor who’s called for $5,000 pay raises for public school teachers, declared that half of the state’s newest teachers lack college degrees. White, a Houston investor, said, ""I know this: One way to fix education is to pay teachers more, so that we can attract the best teachers and keep the best teachers. So, we have a problem in this area right now. Fifty percent of our new teachers don’t have college degrees. Right?"" Not right, according to information we obtained from the Texas Education Agency, though figures backed up an alternate claim we fielded from White’s campaign. After a reader brought White's claim to our attention, White's campaign spokeswoman, Desi Canela, told us that White misspoke in the Jan. 11, 2018, public interview with Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune. By phone, Canela said that White, drawing on information from a teacher advocacy group, had intended to stress the increased rarity of newly certified teachers in the state having bachelor’s degrees in education. Canela said that White, whose late father, Gov. Mark White, shepherded into law a 1984 overhaul of state education laws, ""wants to mandate a uniform pathway to be certified to teach"" including, as a ""good first step,"" a focus on educators majoring in education. Let’s cover whether incoming teachers have college degrees, then turn to the alternate statement. Teachers without degrees? TEA spokeswoman Lauren Callahan told us by email that, with minor exceptions, state law requires anyone seeking a state teaching certificate to have a bachelor’s degree. Also by law, Callahan wrote, almost all teachers in open-enrollment charter schools must hold bachelor’s degrees. Callahan said that of ""over 25,000 newly certified Texas teachers in 2015-16, a maximum of 1.5 percent could’ve been certified without a baccalaureate degree."" She added: ""It’s likely the number would’ve been less."" The agency reached the 1.5 percent estimate, Callahan said, by comparing the 382 individuals newly certified in the two school subjects that don’t require a teacher to hold a bachelor’s degree—""health science technology"" and ""trade and industrial workforce training"" -- with the 25,451 total newly certified teachers for that year. Alternate claim Canela told us White had intended to echo a claim specific to education degrees included in a candidate questionnaire he’d fielded from the Texas State Teachers Association, an affiliate of the National Education Association that advocates for teacher-members. Canela emailed us a photo of part of the questionnaire, which says in part: ""A majority of incoming teachers no longer graduate from college with education degrees; they are certified via ‘alternate certification’ programs.’ Some have suggested that reducing the standards for becoming a certified teacher could alleviate the teacher shortage."" The questionnaire then asks if the candidate is for or against reducing teacher certification standards. To our request for elaboration, TSTA’s Clay Robison emailed us a document, attributed to the State Board for Educator Certification, which oversees the preparation, certification and standards of conduct for Texas public school teachers. The document, dated March 2017, breaks out the ways that new Texas teaching certificates were earned from 2011-12 through 2015-16. In the latter year, the document says, 12,553 individuals gained certificates by taking an alternate route while 8,366 did so by meeting state requirements through an undergraduate program. That makes for a 60-40 split between teachers certified by alternative means and those who went through undergraduate programs though if you also consider individuals certified by coming from out of state or attaining advanced degrees, then people certified via the alternate route comprised 49 percent of newly certified teachers. By email, we drew more recent figures from the TEA’s Callahan indicating that 33 percent of the state’s 32,795 newly certified teachers in 2016-17 were certified through undergraduate education programs--with 52 percent succeeding via alternative certification. Our ruling White said 50 percent ""of our new"" Texas ""teachers don’t have college degrees."" In fact, very few newly certified teachers lack college degrees. White's camp told us he meant to refer to teachers who don't get certified through undergraduate education programs. We rate what he said False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Labor', 'Unions', 'New York', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
Unions would suffer but not end because of Supreme Court decision
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in his State of the State address that a Supreme Court decision could end public labor unions. Cuomo said the case would be a blow to workers in New York state, which is home to the highest percentage of union workers in the country. ""A case before Washington’s Supreme Court seeks to effectively end public labor unions,"" Cuomo said. ""We will await the decision in the Janus case, but we must do all in our power to protect collective bargaining, the right to organize, and preserve workers’ rights."" Cuomo did not say what actions the state would take to protect unions if the Supreme Court rules against them. The case he referred to will be heard by the court next month and decided later this year. It involves a state employee in Illinois and the union that represents him. Is Cuomo right that the court’s decision on the case would end public labor unions? Details on the case The case involves Mark Janus, an Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services employee, and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. AFSCME represents workers at the agency where Janus works. He is not a member of the union, but money is still taken out of his paycheck to support it. He believes forcing non-members like him to pay union fees violates their constitutional right to free speech. ""I’m forced to pay money to a union that then supports political causes I don’t agree with,"" Janus said in an interview with Illinois Policy, a conservative think tank. If the court sides with Janus, non-members would no longer have to pay those fees. The decision would only apply to public sector unions. Unions are allowed to charge non-members a fee less than the amount of full dues because of a different Supreme Court decision in 1977. The court ruled in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that non-members can still be required to make some payments to unions because the union negotiates for all workers, not just those who pay dues. Money from non-members may not be used for any of the union’s political campaigns. AFSCME spends millions of dollars each election cycle supporting Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. The union also lobbies lawmakers on issues it believes important to workers, like paid family leave. Analysis by experts Unions would suffer financially from the decision, but not end altogether, experts said. ""No, it doesn't mean the end of unions, and I certainly disagree with the governor about it,"" said Lee Adler, a senior extension associate at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. ""It’s a very serious challenge to unions, there’s no question about it."" Public unions would have to do the same amount of work with fewer resources. Non-members would no longer have to pay fees, but unions would still have to represent them in contract negotiations and grievances. ""Unions are no different than any other organization,"" said Celine McNicholas, labor counsel at the Economic Policy Institute, an economic research organization. ""It’s very difficult for an organization to be required to provide services to people who do not provide payment for those services."" That may limit the power of what unions can accomplish, but the decision would not end collective bargaining or worker representation. It would just make those services harder to provide. ""There is that core of truth to what Cuomo is saying,"" said Vin Bonventre, professor of law at Albany Law School. ""Claiming that it is going to destroy unions is far too broad a statement."" Some states have already passed laws to prevent unions from collecting payments from non-members. Public employees still organize in those states.

Unemployment inching up in almost every county outside New York City
","New York Republican State Committee Chairman Edward F. Cox claimed the unemployment rate is rising in upstate counties, something Republicans intend to remind voters about in the 2018 race for governor. ""Of all the 62 counties in New York state, all of them, unemployment is going up except for the five counties of New York City,"" Cox said in a radio interview. The claim is in direct contrast to a rosier picture of the economy painted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The governor touted a decline in unemployment statewide during his State of the State address this month. ""Every region has seen a drop in unemployment and underemployment,"" Cuomo said. Is Cox right that unemployment is up everywhere outside New York City? Cox’s numbers Cox based his claim on a press release on unemployment from the state Department of Labor, his spokesperson said. The release showed the jobless rate for the state’s 15 metro areas in November 2016 and November 2017, the latest data released by the department. The release does not break down unemployment by county, though it links to that data. Albany, Schenectady and Troy are all counted as one area even though the cities are in different counties. Each of the 14 metro areas outside New York City had a higher unemployment rate in November 2017 than the year before, the data showed. The rural parts of the state, lumped into one category, also had a higher unemployment rate. The New York City metro area was the only place where unemployment went down. A short-term rise in unemployment isn't always bad news. As was the case in Massachusetts last year, a higher unemployment rate could mean more people have decided to enter a growing workforce, but have not landed a job yet. All but five of the state's metro areas added private sector jobs last year. The labor force, meanwhile, increased in all but two counties in New York state. Unemployment by county The state Department of Labor also tracks the unemployment rate for each county. Our analysis of the data shows Cox is mostly correct in his claim, with a few exceptions. • The unemployment rate in Lewis County decreased from 6.1 percent in November 2016 to 5.9 percent a year later. The county’s labor force and the number of people working increased during that time. • Seneca and Clinton counties saw no change in unemployment during that time. The labor force and the number of people employed increased in those counties as well. Unemployment in every other county outside New York City went up between November 2016 and November 2017. Unemployment in each of New York City’s five boroughs went down.  The rates for each county and metro area are not seasonally adjusted. That means they don’t adjust the data for major shifts in employment during retail holidays seasons, or construction in the summer. A market analyst from the state Department of Labor said the agency does not calculate seasonally adjusted numbers at the county level. Since 2011 While unemployment has inched up in most counties outside New York City recently, the trend has been very different since Cuomo took office in 2011. The unemployment rate is lower in every county since Cuomo took office in 2011, according to state data. Hamilton County, which recorded the largest one-year increase in unemployment in 2017, still has a lower unemployment rate than it did in 2011. Other counties, like Clinton and Columbia, now have an unemployment rate less than half of what it was when Cuomo took office. Some analysts believe drops in unemployment upstate have been inflated by a shrinking population. Monroe County had more than 13,000 fewer people in the labor force in November 2017 than January 2011, for example. During that time, the county’s unemployment rate decreased from 8.3 percent to 5.1 percent. Our ruling ""Of all the 62 counties in New York state, all of them, unemployment is going up except for the five counties of New York City,"" Cox said. Cox was comparing unemployment figures between November 2017 and November 2016. The figures showed unemployment up in almost every county outside New York City. One county had a lower rate, and two other counties had no change in their unemployment rates. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C14F080>],/factchecks/2018/jan/17/edward-cox/unemployment-inching-almost-every-county-outside-n/

How much has the NYC graduation rate increased since mayoral control began?
","Schools in New York City have one feature the rest of the state’s schools do not: They’re under the exclusive control of the mayor. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed graduation rates have soared since that power was granted. ""Since mayoral control of education came in, the graduation rate in New York City has increased by 50 percent in 13 years,"" de Blasio said at a news conference in Albany. The New York State Legislature gave then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg control over the city’s schools in 2002. Only about half of students graduated before 2002.  The change allowed Bloomberg to appoint a manager of the school system to replace the Board of Education. The legislature has since renewed mayoral control four times, with a sunset scheduled for 2019 unless lawmakers extend control again. De Blasio has been unable to convince Republicans in the State Senate to give permanent control to the city’s mayor. Is de Blasio right that the graduation rate has increased by 50 percent since then? Graduation rates About 17,000 more students graduated from New York City schools in 2016 than 2005, according to the New York City Department of Education. The graduation rate was 46.5 percent in 2005. The state changed the way the graduation rate is calculated that year, so numbers prior to 2005 are not comparable. The graduation rate increased each year until 2011, when the rate dropped from 61 percent to 60.9 percent. The rate also decreased in 2012, but has increased each year since. The most recent data shows the graduation rate for New York City schools at 69.6 percent in 2016. The rate for 2017 had not been released.  The 2016 rate is about 23 percentage points higher than the rate for 2005, a 50 percent increase between the two years. The numbers count students who graduate in June of their fourth year of high school. The state also began tracking the graduation rate for students who graduate in August after their fourth year of high school in 2008. The graduation rate was 72.6 percent in 2016 when the August graduates are counted. The same success has not been felt in every district. District 8 in the Bronx still had a June graduation rate of 50 percent in 2016, up slightly from 44.6 percent in 2005. Our ruling De Blasio said ""the graduation rate in New York City has increased by 50 percent in 13 years."" The increase between 2005 and 2016 is about 50 percent.

No, Uranium One investigation has not led to an indictment
","Several news websites have reported that the investigation of wrongdoing involving Uranium One and Hillary Clinton bagged its first indictment. Facebook users flagged a post from a site called Republican News as suspicious and possibly fake. The website’s Jan. 13 headline said, ""First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama-era Uranium One deal."" That post echoed similar reporting by the New York Post, which announced ""there’s an indictment in the FBI probe of the Uranium One scandal,"" also on Jan. 13. The next day, The Hill repeated the Post report. There was an indictment, but the Justice Department doesn’t tie it to the Uranium One deal. Instead, the charges come out of a 2014 investigation of an American-based kickback scheme that defrauded millions of dollars from a subsidiary of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom. The kickback scheme and Rosatom's 2010 purchase of a controlling interest in the Canadian company Uranium One were entirely separate. The kickback plan locked in contracts for an American firm to import Russian uranium. The other deal involved buying Uranium One stock. They involved different Rosatom subsidiaries and different activities. The news reports tied the two together, but none gave details on the connection. ""The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One deal,"" Republican News said. ""THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up."" But it provided no evidence. Let’s unpack this. Mark Lambert is the former co-president of Transport Logistics International, a Maryland company that arranged the transport of nuclear materials to the United States. According to the Jan. 12 indictment, between at least as early as 2009 and 2014, Lambert and his partner funneled money to a Russian official with Tenex, the company in charge of exporting Russian uranium. Through an elaborate kickback scheme, the Maryland firm got the contracts to ship Russian uranium to the United States. Tenex paid handsomely for the firm’s services, and the Maryland firm shared some of the proceeds with the Russian official. In short, Tenex paid for the bribery. Lambert’s indictment on Jan. 12, 2018, was just the most recent step in a long-running case against his company. That investigation made no mention of Uranium One. In 2014, the Justice Department charged Lambert’s business partner, the Russian Tenex official and two others (including the wife of the business partner) with bribery, fraud and money laundering. All told, about $2.1 million ended up in overseas bank accounts controlled by the Russian. For the record, the indictment of the Russian official said the scheme started in 2004. That’s six years before the Uranium One sale was on the table. Lambert’s business partner and the Russian had pled guilty in 2015. The Russian is serving a two-year prison term, and the business partner is awaiting sentencing. In 2010, the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom wanted to become the majority owner of the Canadian firm Uranium One. Uranium One had holdings in the United States, so the deal had to win approval by a number of state and federal agencies. That group included the State Department, then led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Our summary of the case gives plenty of details, but the gist is some of the owners of Uranium One had given millions to the Clinton Foundation. One in particular gave the foundation between $1.3 million and $5.6 million while the sale was under review. On the 2016 campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump cast the donations as a payoff to grease the skids for approval. There is no evidence that Clinton had a hand in the vetting process, an undertaking that involved eight federal offices in addition to the State Department. Recently, Republicans have called for a fresh investigation of the matter. The Justice Department has made no official comment. The department recently allowed an FBI informant in the Tenex bribery case to testify before a Senate committee investigating the Uranium One transaction. It is unknown what if anything new that informant might provide. How does the recent indictment link to the Uranium One sale? Aside from the tie to Rosatom, not in any obvious way. The Maryland firm was in cahoots with Vadim Mikerin, a Russian national who was the general director of Tenam USA, the American arm of Tenex. Tenex is a subsidiary of JSC Atomenergoprom, which in turn is a subsidiary of Rosatom. Rosatom bought the controlling share in Uranium One through another subsidiary. There is no evidence that the kickback scheme that defrauded Tenex overlapped with Rosatom’s efforts to buy Uranium One. None of the news reports that claimed a connection provided any evidence. In fact, the New York Post article incorrectly said, ""The federal investigation grew from charges that the Obama administration covered up an FBI probe of the uranium business — and thus allowed the Russian firm Tenex to buy a stake in Uranium One."" But Tenex was not the buyer. As a subsidiary of Rosatom, its role was to export Russian uranium, a very different business activity. The Rosatom subsidiary that bought the stake in Uranium One was Atomredmetzoloto. Law professor Michael Koehler at Southern Illinois University School of Law is an expert on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has written about the Tenex prosecutions. He reviewed the indictment and saw no tie between the two matters. ""Last week’s case concerns the same core conduct the Justice Department brought action on in June 2015,"" Koehler said. While any FBI investigation of the Uranium One deal lies behind a veil of secrecy at the department, Koehler said the idea that it might have spurred the latest indictment is ""highly unlikely."" A website called Republican News said a recent bribery indictment is tied to the Uranium One deal. There was an indictment, but the Justice Department did not connect it to the sale of shares of Uranium One to Rosatom. The indictment was the latest step in a 2014 investigation of a kickback scheme that defrauded a Rosatom subsidiary. That investigation had already secured two guilty pleas. The reports that tied the indictment to Uranium One offered no evidence of a connection. If new information from the Justice Department emerges, we’ll revisit this. But for now, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE9940>],/factchecks/2018/jan/17/republican-news/no-uranium-one-investigation-has-not-led-indictmen/

Millions more spent to defeat Tammy Baldwin than all other incumbent Democrats in Senate combined
","Moneywise, the most important U.S. Senate race in the country might be for the seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. At least that’s the suggestion from Martha Laning, chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. Laning was interviewed on the ""Devil’s Advocates,"" a liberal radio talk show based in Milwaukee, on Jan. 5, 2018 -- 10 months ahead of the general election. Co-host Dominic Salvia said the Huffington Post reported that conservative groups had already spent $3 million against Baldwin. He asked Laning how Baldwin and the state Democratic Party could counteract that. Laning replied with an even more eye-catching money claim, saying: Well, I want you to know, first, that it's $5 million that's been spent against Tammy -- and it is five times more money spent against Tammy Baldwin, our senator, than all of the other U.S. Senate candidates up in 2018 combined. So, they are coming after Tammy Baldwin like no other. That means Laning is claiming $5 million has been spent against Baldwin -- five times more than has been spent, in total, against all of the other Senate Democrat incumbents who are up for re-election in 2018. The stakes It won’t be known until after the August 2018 primary election which GOP opponent that Baldwin, who was elected in 2012, will face. So far, two suburban Milwaukee Republicans are running: State Sen. Leah Vukmir and political newcomer and former Marine Kevin Nicholson. Including Baldwin, Democrats are defending 25 U.S. Senate seats in 2018 (two seats are held by independents who caucus with the Democrats). The New York Times says it’s a ""tossup"" as to whether Democrats can wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which has a two-seat edge. Noting the Huffington Post article that was referenced in Laning’s interview, the political news website Axios made this observation about the Senate races and President Donald Trump: There are 10 Democratic senators [including Baldwin] up for re-election this year in states that Trump won. But if conservative groups’ spending is any indication, Wisconsin might be the hardest seat for Democrats to keep. The numbers The Huffington Post article was based on data collected by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which is based on reports made to the Federal Election Commission. So, we went to the center’s website to produce this breakdown on how much conservative groups have reported spending so far against Baldwin: Expenditures against Baldwin during the 2018 election cycle Group Affiliation Amount Spent Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce Arlington, Va.-based hub for spending by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch $1.66 million Americas PAC Marion, Iowa,-based super PAC $703,500 Restoration PAC Suburban Chicago-based super PAC $527,499 Committee to Defend the President Hybrid PAC/super PAC that supports Donald Trump $130,680 Stars & Stripes Forever PAC Alexandria, Va,.-based super PAC $17,569 Restore American Freedom & Liberty Denver-based hybrid PAC/super PAC $14,000 Conservative Freedom Fighters Denver-based hybrid PAC/super PAC $12,000 Conservative Liberty Coalition Denver-based super PAC $2,000 Wisconsin Right To Life Victory Fund Milwaukee-based super PAC $800 Total $3.07 million By comparison, a total of $599,688 has been spent against other incumbent Senate Democrats (only 12 of the 25 have had groups spend against them, the Center for Responsive Politics told us). So, the $3 million spent against Baldwin is five times as much as has been spent against the other Democrats. But what about the $5 million that Laning claims? To reach that, you have to add in how much conservative groups have spent in support of Nicholson, the GOP newcomer (so far, none have reported expenditures in support of Vukmir). Here’s that breakdown based on the Center for Responsive Politics data: Expenditures for Nicholson during the 2018 election cycle Group Affiliation Amount Spent Restoration PAC Suburban Chicago-based super PAC $1.14 million Americas PAC Marion, Iowa-based super PAC $868,843* Solutions for Wisconsin Austin, Texas-based single-candidate super PAC that supports Nicholson $209,056 John Bolton Super PAC Bolton was U.S. ambassador to United Nations under GOP President George W. Bush $196,860 Club for Growth PAC Anti-tax group $18,568 Club for Growth Action super PAC $11 Total $2.43 million And that figure is seven times more than the $758,101 that’s been spent against the other Senate Democrat incumbents, or for their opponents, according to the center. It’s worth noting that the pro-Nicholson money, largely for ads promoting his personal background, are not against Baldwin in the same way as the money spent attacking her positions or votes. But the pro-Nicholson money clearly is aimed at helping Nicholson win Baldwin’s seat. A closing note In defending Laning’s statement, the Wisconsin Democratic Party told us that a consultant for Baldwin’s campaign had determined that $5.5 million has been spent on ads directly against Baldwin -- $4.5 million on TV ads and $1 million on web ads. (Baldwin's campaign would not identify the consultant to us.) This approach takes in additional spending, since not all the groups have to report to the Federal Election Commission. But the consultant could not provide a comparable tally for the other Democratic incumbents. Laning says conservative groups have spent $5 million ""against"" Baldwin -- five times more than against all other Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents up for election in 2018 combined. Based on reports to the Federal Election Commission that were analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, the total exceeds $5 million and is actually seven times more than what has been spent against the other Democrats. The only caveat is that $3 million has been spent directly attacking Baldwin, while the rest has been spent in support of one of her opponents. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809749EF40>],/factchecks/2018/jan/17/martha-laning/millions-more-spent-defeat-tammy-baldwin-all-other/

DNC offers one-sided view on who gets tax bill's benefits
","The Democratic National Committee said one of President Donald Trump’s proudest achievements from his first year is really a giveaway to the country’s wealthiest people. ""Trump and his party spent the better part of the year trying to take away health care from tens of millions of Americans to pay for a tax cut for the rich, and when that failed, they passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent,"" said a Medium post that the party published Jan. 16. A reader asked us to look into a couple of claims from the post. In this fact-check, we wondered whether it is correct that the Republican tax bill ""gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent."" The source footnoted in the post is an analysis of the final version of the tax bill by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The Tax Policy Center analysis found that by 2027, the tax bill would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different. For instance, in 2018, according to the center’s analysis, the bill would deliver 20.5 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent — vastly less than the 83 percent figure the DNC touted. And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent. The main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on. ""How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1 percent income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center. Our ruling The DNC said that the Republicans ""passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent."" That’s the case by 2027, due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. The DNC is cherry-picking by focusing on the tax bill’s impact by 2027, rather than the impact for the nearly a decade leading up to then.

DNC strains to find problems with current job market
","As the first anniversary of Donald Trump’s presidency drew near, the Democratic National Committee published a Medium post critical of Trump’s tenure. A reader suggested that we look at the Jan. 16 post, which was titled ""Trump At One Year: President For The 1%."" In focusing on Trump’s economic record, the post at one point said, ""In Trump’s first year as president, job growth slowed to a six-year low."" The DNC has a point, but it carefully chose the talking point to shine a poor light on what, by most measures, is an impressive period of job growth. The following chart summarizes the yearly growth in nonfarm employment since 2008. Years under President Barack Obama are in blue, while the one year under Trump is in red. Using this measure, the DNC actually undersold its point a bit. The annual job gains in 2017 — 2,055,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — are the smallest since 2010, or seven years. (Important technical caveat: The figures for November and December 2017 are preliminary and could be adjusted either up or down in the next few months to account for new data. We are rating this statement based on what was known at the time of the DNC’s post.) That said, the DNC is straining to portray a favorable job market as a disappointment. Some additional context to consider: • An annual job gain of more than 2 million is impressive in its own right. ""In four of the previous six years under Obama, U.S. job creation was not much faster than it was in 2017,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Specifically, annual job gains in four years — 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016 — were close to what Trump saw in 2017. Equally important, that pace of job creation is ""well ahead of what the economy needs to keep up with slow working-age-population growth,"" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com. • The job gains under Trump are especially impressive because they came at a later point in the recovery. Rapid employment gains are generally easier early in a recovery because more people are unemployed or underemployed. That means there will be a surplus of possible applicants for new job openings, which generally means the jobs can be filled quickly. By contrast, after seven years of improving employment prospects, ""there are fewer unemployed and out-of-the-labor-force workers who are willing to take jobs than was true when the unemployment rate was higher,"" Burtless said. This made it ""harder to achieve rapid job gains in 2017,"" he said. • Other measures make 2017 look more impressive. Consider the unemployment rate, the other key jobs-related metric. (In this chart, a negative gain is ""good"" since it means that unemployment is heading downward.) The improvement under Trump in 2017 (0.7 percent) exceeded the improvement in all but two of the years under Obama. Kolko added that several other measurements of the labor force were better in 2017 than in 2016, including the U-6 rate (which uses a broader definition of unemployment than the usual rate cited above) and the percentage of the population between 25 and 54 years old that is employed. Our ruling The DNC wrote that ""in Trump’s first year as president, job growth slowed to a six-year low."" This statistic is carefully chosen to make what is actually a strong job market appear disappointing. Experts say the gain of more than 2 million jobs in 2017 was healthy, especially coming at a later point in the recovery, and it was similar in scope to half of the years during Obama’s presidency.

Oprah's comments about race in 2013 BBC interview distorted
","Oprah Winfrey gave a speech at the Golden Globes Jan. 7 that focused on race, gender, injustice and the importance of speaking the truth, all of which fueled talk about Winfrey running for president in 2020. The speculation has led to numerous claims about her past statements recirculating on Facebook including her alleged comments about white people in 2014: ""Oprah tells Fox News host ‘all white people have to die,’ "" stated an Oct. 12, 2014, headline on American News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the headline distorts what Winfrey said — and where she said it. While the headline said that Oprah made the comment about white people on Fox News, Winfrey’s comments came in an interview with the BBC. Winfrey was interviewed by the BBC’s Will Gompertz on Nov. 13, 2013, to coincide with the release of her film The Butler in which she played Gloria Gaines, the wife of a White House butler. Gompertz asked Winfrey to weigh in about whether racism still exists. Winfrey said that society has evolved on race relations, but there are still places where people are terrorized because they are black. ""As long as people can be judged by the color of their skin, the problem is not solved. There is a whole generation -- I said this for apartheid South Africa, I said this for my own community in the south -- there are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in that prejudice and racism and they just have to die."" Winfrey’s overall point during the interview is that race relations have improved from decades ago, but there are older people in the United States and other countries who grew up surrounded by racism. The inference of her comments is that when older racists die out, that particular type of racism will die out. Note that Winfrey didn’t say ""all white people have to die"" — she didn’t say ""white people"" at all. While some on the left have shown some support for Winfrey’s 2013 statement, her comments drew criticism from conservatives. About a week after her BBC interview, her comments were criticized on Fox News' The Kelly File by former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., a Fox News commentator. West criticized Winfrey and Obama for trying ""to use the race card to talk about the failures and the faults not in his racial content but in the content of his character and the failure of his policies."" We emailed American News and did not get a reply. Our ruling A headline on American News said that ""Oprah tells Fox News host ‘all white people have to die.’"" We found multiple versions of this story circulating with similar headlines. The headline gets key details wrong and twists Winfrey’s words. She did not say that all white people have to die. What Winfrey actually told a BBC interviewer in 2013 was that some older people grew up surrounded by racism. When she said ""they just have to die,"" she seemed to be suggesting that a certain type of racism will have to die out when this generation dies. We rate this claim False.

Rauner says 'Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois'
","In 2015, during Bruce Rauner’s first year as governor, a virulent outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease at the state-run Illinois Veterans’ Home in downstate Quincy killed 12 residents and sickened dozens of others. Since then, according to recent news reports, the facility has been plagued by more illness and deaths from Legionnaires’, which experts say is usually linked to the inhaling of a bacteria that thrives in poorly maintained water systems. It was also reported by WBEZ that Rauner administration officials delayed public disclosure of the 2015 outbreak for nearly a week after discovering it. Critics claim the governor’s failure to act quickly to safeguard the water at Quincy after the initial incident displayed an indifference to the fate of the elderly military veterans who live there. Family members of victims have filed suit against the state over their deaths. Meanwhile, one potential Democratic challenger to Rauner’s re-election, J.B. Pritzker, began running TV spots attacking the Republican incumbent’s handling of the Quincy situation. Rauner insists his administration did not drop the ball, and recently spent seven days living at the home to make a public show that it was safe. He also took aim at the media for casting blame his way without telling the whole story. In an interview with the editorial board of the Joliet Herald-News, Rauner said news reports failed to explain that the source of the disease is basically everywhere. ""The reality is, and this is what’s not getting into the reports, the Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois,"" Rauner told the paper. ""There were just two infections of Legionnaires at Northwestern Hospital, which is not even an old facility and I think is regarded as a really well-run facility. These things happen."" We wondered if the governor is right. Are bacteria that can cause Legionnaires’ disease lurking in most building water systems? And, if so, what public health danger does that pose? Legionnaires’ disease is a severe and sometimes deadly form of pneumonia that derives its name from its first recognized outbreak in 1976 at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Most at risk are the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, cited by state officials as one reason why the outbreaks at the Quincy facility proved so serious. Legionnaires is spread through aerosolized water drops inhaled into the lungs, with showers, faucets, hot tubs and mist from large building air-conditioning units serving as common sources for spreading the infection. The disease is unlikely to be spread from drinking contaminated water. Rachel Bold, a spokeswoman for Rauner, cited explanations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the scientific journal PLOS One to reinforce his claim that bacteria that can cause the disease are widespread. However, none of those sources contained information confirming that a majority of Illinois building water systems contained the bacteria, known as Legionella. Erik Olson, health program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Legionella likely can be found in many water systems. Even so, Olson said it was ""misleading"" for Rauner to attempt to frame the danger so broadly. Trace amounts of the bacteria don’t pose a threat unless allowed to grow due to poor building maintenance, Olson explained. He likened the phenomenon to that of coliform bacteria, which are also widespread in the environment. Many forms of coliform bacteria are harmless, he said, while some can lead to potentially deadly E. coli in food if proper sanitation procedures are not followed. The CDC also stresses that poor building maintenance — rather than the widespread presence of low-level bacteria — is the main culprit in Legionnaires’ outbreaks. Legionella is naturally occurring and is present at low levels in water sources such as lakes and rivers. Therefore, it’s assumed by government officials that the bacteria makes its way into building systems. However, there’s no quantifiable data. ""We don’t actually have an exact number or even proportion,"" CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said in an interview. State health departments report annual incidents of Legionnaires’ cases to the CDC. There were 6,000 cases reported nationwide in 2015. An estimated 9 to 10 percent of all cases result in death, Nordlund said, though the agency doesn’t ask states to report numbers of deaths from the disease. In 2015, the city of Chicago advised building owners to check and clean water supply systems to guard against the spread of Legionnaires. ""Legionella bacteria are present at low levels in many water systems,"" the city letter stated. ""Background levels of Legionella are not known to be a significant risk when associated with proper water quality management of water systems."" Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokesman Christopher King confirmed Rauner’s claim that two patients treated at the hospital within the past six months tested positive for Legionella. The hospital is working with state health officials and conducting its own review ""to determine if these two cases are related,"" he said, declining to comment further. Rauner says news reports about his administration’s response to recurring incidents of Legionnaires’ disease at the Illinois Veterans’ Home in Quincy leave out a key part of the story: ""The Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois."" The governor’s statement glosses over the reality that any such contamination is likely present at low and non-threatening levels. The use of the word ""most"" is also questionable since there’s no real quantifiable evidence. The CDC avoids quantifying the presence of the bacteria, which thrives on slime in poorly maintained internal water systems. The governor has a point that the bacteria lurks in a number of water systems. But his statement makes an unprovable claim about the extent of the contamination. The governor’s claim is overbroad and lacking in context. We rate it Half True.      ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097331780>],/factchecks/2018/jan/16/bruce-rauner/rauner-says-legionella-bacteria-most-water-systems/

Little gas behind claim that every year, keys left inside nearly half of stolen Texas vehicles
","A Central Texas sheriff posted a warning that led us to check--and find faulty--key facts. Republican Robert Chody, elected the sheriff of Williamson County in 2016, said in a Dec. 27, 2017, tweet: ""65,000 vehicles stolen in Texas each year. Almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year had keys left inside. That’s a lot of preventable thefts #TakeKeysWithYou #LockDoors,"" his tweet said. Chody made us wonder about the share of vehicles stolen in Texas that have had keys left inside. Our inquiries didn’t prove out the claim and the responsible state agency removed the ""almost half"" statement from its website. Sheriff cites state agency For starters, Chody told us in a Twitter message that he drew his claim from a web page overseen by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. That page, ""Auto Burglary and Theft Prevention Authority,"" said toward the top: ""It doesn't matter what kind of car you drive, all vehicles are a potential target of theft. Nearly 65,000 cars and trucks are stolen in the state of Texas each year, and thousands more are burglarized. Almost half of all vehicles stolen had the keys left inside."" When we asked TxDMV about the basis of its ""almost half"" finding, spokesman Adam Shaivitz provided statements by email from the anti-theft authority’s director, Bryan Wilson, who noted first that according to information collected and posted by the Texas Department of Public Safety, more than 65,000 motor vehicle thefts were reported each year from 2013 through 2016, when the agency noted 68,461 such thefts. Wilson also shared a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publication, ""Vehicle Theft Prevention: What Consumers Should Know,"" attributing 40 percent to 50 percent of vehicle thefts nationally ""to driver error, which includes leaving vehicle doors unlocked and leaving keys in the ignition or on the seats,"" the publication says. Also, Wilson pointed out, the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an Illinois-based nonprofit that says it’s dedicated to fighting insurance fraud and crime, published an October 2016 report stating that over several years, Texas ranked second only to California by having 11,003 vehicle thefts with keys inside--a figure drawn from the bureau’s review of theft reports compiled by the federal National Crime Information Center. The bureau’s report says: ""Vehicle thefts with keys were identified by using the NCIC text fields available to NICB. Terms indicating the vehicle was stolen with the keys were used as search criteria."" Wilson, asked about relevant statewide data, said there hasn’t been a systemwide ""science-based empirical study to measure the sometimes surreptitious activity of leaving keys in the car or doors unlocked."" A rough calculation We made our own run at gauging the prevalence of Texans leaving keys in stolen vehicles by dividing the 11,003 Texas vehicle thefts with keys inside as noted by the crime bureau into the 200,503 vehicle thefts in Texas tallied by the DPS through the study period. That comparison suggests that 5.5 percent of vehicle thefts in the state from 2013 through 2015 involved keys left inside. Next, we sought to fine-tune our results by asking the bureau to sort its count of Texas vehicles stolen with keys left inside by each of the years. A spokesman, Frank Scafidi, emailed us a chart indicating 3,079 Texas vehicle thefts with keys left inside in 2013; 3,547 in 2014; and 4,377 in 2015. We compared those counts with total vehicle thefts tallied by the DPS for each of the years--an indication the share of stolen vehicles with keys left inside ranged from 4.7 percent in 2013 to 6.5 percent in 2015. Scafidi also offered a caution by telling us to consider the bureau’s counts of thefts with keys left inside to be on the low end of what likely occurred because ""we have to rely on reporting officers indicating keys were a factor in the text field of each NCIC record. They don’t always provide that extra bit of information,"" he wrote. By phone, meantime, Scafidi expressed skepticism at the idea of nearly half of Texas thefts involving keys left in vehicles. Scafidi further noted by email that the bureau does not make that kind of claim in its handout about auto theft that’s made available to police departments. We also asked NHTSA and the FBI about available national data showing how often victims of vehicle theft leave a key in place. In emails, Jose Ucles of NHTSA and Stephen Fischer of the FBI each told us his agency didn’t have such data. Local police agencies Shaivitz separately told us the authority’s tracking of vehicle thefts with keys left inside came from reports submitted by 24 regional task forces or local police agencies awarded grants by the authority to combat vehicle thefts and burglaries. Shaivitz also provided a December 2017 press release from the Amarillo Police Department stating that 762 of the 922 cars and trucks reported stolen locally from December 2016 through Dec. 21, 2017, had the keys left in them--a figure confirmed by the department’s Cpl. Jeb Hilton, who told us by phone that he couldn’t guess why so many motorists had left keys in their vehicles. Shaivitz also forwarded an email from Austin Police Department Sgt. Chris Vetrano stating that 51 percent of locally reported vehicle thefts in December 2017 involved keys left in vehicles. We asked the Austin department to elaborate. By email, Anna Sabana advised that through 2017, approximately 32 percent of vehicle thefts reported to the department ""had keys available"" when the thefts occurred--compared with about 41 percent the year before. Broadly, Shaivitz said, more than half the authority’s grantees said a major factor in vehicle burglary and theft cases is ""people leaving their vehicles unsecured and leaving keys in the interior, although they don’t all report percentages."" He specified that authorities in Paris reported that 80 percent to 90 percent of stolen vehicles were due to keys being left inside or available and Potter County officials said 90 percent  of stolen vehicles had the keys left in them and the Victoria Police Department reported that in the last quarter of 2017, 69 percent of local vehicle thefts involved keys left inside. Claim removed While we were researching this fact-check, Shaivitz told us the TxDMV had amended the authority’s anti-theft web page by removing the declaration that almost half of vehicles stolen in Texas had keys left inside. Revised text on the web page says: ""Many jurisdictions report that keys left inside and doors unlocked are major factors in stolen and burglarized vehicles."" Our ruling Chody said that almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year have the keys left inside. Surely some instances of keys left in stolen vehicles go unreported. Yet we identified no statewide data supporting this ""almost half"" assessment while our calculations rooted in a national group’s research indicate that less than 1 in 10 reported Texas vehicle thefts from 2013 through 2015 involved keys left in vehicles.

Trump wrongly faults Obama for London embassy move
","President Donald Trump isn’t going to London any time soon. Planning was under way for a February visit, when it was thought Trump would officially open the new U.S. embassy in London. Trump scuttled those plans in no uncertain terms. ""Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‘peanuts,’ only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 11. ""Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!"" Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! Whether the new embassy is in a good or bad location is matter of opinion. But Trump was off the mark in putting this deal on the shoulders of the Obama administration. The wheels started turning early in the second term of President George W. Bush, and the deal on a new location was announced Oct. 2, 2008, before Bush left office. With an eye on thwarting terrorist attacks, the State Department’s Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations under Bush aimed to harden America’s diplomatic facilities. The embassy in London dated from 1960 and in 2006, the bureau estimated that it would take $550 million and seven years to improve it, and even then it would not meet security needs. In October 2008, then-Ambassador Robert Tuttle, who led the search for a new site, announced the move to a site on the other side of the Thames River from the old location. ""We looked at all our options, including renovation of our current building on Grosvenor Square,"" Tuttle said. ""In the end, we realized that the goal of a modern, secure and environmentally sustainable embassy could best be met by constructing a new facility."" The State Department announced that the United States had signed a preliminary contract for the new location, contingent on the sale of the existing chancery. The project had a budget of $1.02 billion. When the plan was announced, officials said the entire cost would be financed by the sale of three State Department properties in London -- the Navy Annex, the existing chancery, and the Marine Security Guard quarters.   In 2015, the head of the State Department’s bureau, Lydia Muniz, told lawmakers the building was on time and on budget. Money from the sale of the old embassy (technically, the sale of the 999-year lease the United States held on the property) came in August 2013, during the Obama administration. The final terms were not public, but a BBC report estimated the value at somewhere between £300 million and £500 million, or about $400 million to $680 million. A Qatari real estate group bought the lease with plans to turn the property into a hotel. Trump said Obama sold the otherwise fine American embassy in London and relocated at a cost of $1.2 billion. Actually, the Bush administration put the plan in place after concluding that the existing embassy could not meet security requirements. The cost was about $200 million less than Trump said, $1.02 billion rather than $1.2 billion, and was financed through the sale of the old embassy and two other State Department properties in London. While he is correct that the sale occurred on Obama’s watch, the wheels were turning and preliminary contracts had been signed earlier. Trump’s tweet blows past those key details. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB78C0>],/factchecks/2018/jan/12/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-faults-obama-london-embassy-move/

Atlanta's finances: Really the best in 40 years?
","In her inaugural speech, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told the crowd that the city was well-positioned to move forward in the coming years. ""We came back from the Great Recession and worked hard for eight years to put Atlanta’s finances in a good place,"" Bottoms said. ""Atlanta is on its strongest financial footing in 40 years."" Four decades is a long time, and we wanted to give that assertion a harder look. In large measure, the claim holds up. But there are some caveats about the exact numbers that support it. Plus, measures of financial strength are always somewhat subjective. A few key indicators give a broad picture of how well any municipality is doing. There is the bond rating, which companies such as Moody’s and Standard & Poor's use to indicate the risk of lending money to the city. The rating firms bumped up Atlanta in 2016. Standard & Poor’s raised its rating to AA+ from AA. Moody’s raised its rating to AA1 from AA2. Fitch increased its rating to AA+. As far as anyone can tell, those are the best ratings the city has ever enjoyed. Fiscal analysts also look at pension fund exposure. As the number of retirees grows, live longer, and the cost of health care continues to rise, the future costs have become much larger than the cash in the pension fund needed to cover them. One of the mavens of municipal finance data, Richard Ciccarone at Merritt Research Services, gave Atlanta a mediocre grade on its pension position. ""Their funding ratio is only 65.9 percent, which is not that good,"" Ciccarone said. ""It’s been worse. It has been low as 55.4 percent in 2006."" City spokeswoman Jenna Garland said the decision in 2017 to merge three pension boards into one would tighten up fund management and increase investment returns. ""Improved pension fund performance will result in a reduced need for the city to fund pension benefits, freeing those funds for use for city services,"" Garland said. Not so fast, said Katherine Willoughby, professor of public administration at the University of Georgia. ""I would be in a wait-and-see mode,"" Willoughby said. ""These are volatile things, and you hope the money will come in, but you don’t know until it happens."" The pension fund issue was not a significant factor in the late 1970s. Perhaps the biggest feather in the city’s cap is the hefty balance of the general fund at the end of 2017. The general fund is Atlanta’s main account to pay for everything from fixing potholes to keeping police on the beat. It went from $153 million in 2016 to $200 million in 2017. Measured against the city’s $553 million budget, the percentage — 35.8 percent — had never been higher ""Never before in the city’s history have we both had a AA+ credit rating alongside record reserves and a record percentage of the budget in reserves,"" Garland said. ""We believe the historical record would reflect that at no point from 1978 until 2016 when the city’s credit was upgraded was the City in a stronger financial position than today."" The city’s fiscal team dug into the financial archives of old Consolidated Annual Financial Reports and sent us a spreadsheet. This table is an excerpt showing four key years.: 1978, 1979, 2016 and 2017. (Other financing resources include one-time dollars that flowed in or out of the general fund apart from the usual revenues or expenses. The total budgeted number is the amount city leaders approved at the start of the year. Total expenditures are the actual spending for the year.) Year Beginning Fund Balance Total Revenues Total Expenditures Other resources End Fund Balance Total Budgeted Expenditures Percent of budget 1978 31,213,421 101,955,596 95,055,812 (1,451,941) 36,661,264 141,848,805 25.85% 1979 36,661,264 113,507,631 110,880,579 (833,375) 38,454,941 162,465,755 23.67% 2016 38,454,941 530,310,000 545,822,000 17,647,000 40,589,941 543,311,000 7.47% 2017 153,149,000 572,908,000 597,180,000 71,205,000 200,082,000 558,379,000 35.83%   The city’s main yardstick to make comparisons across 40 years is to look at the general fund’s ending balance as a share of the total budget at the start of the year. In those terms, 2017 is much stronger than 1978, 35 percent compared to 25 percent. Michael Pagano, dean of the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said it’s difficult for large cities to enjoy the margin that Atlanta has. ""To have 35 percent for a city the size of Atlanta is remarkable,"" Pagano said. On the other hand, while it’s fair to compare the fund to the original budget, Pagano said it’s equally fair to compare to the actual spending. ""If you are asking how well you performed, then you want to compare to the actual expenditures,"" he said. Willoughby agreed, saying the budget is more theoretical, and ""it’s more anchored in reality to look at the actual spending."" When we did that, the results flipped and the early years looked better than the recent ones. Year Total Expenditures Fund Balance Percent of Expenditures 1978 95,055,812 36,661,264 38.57% 1979 110,880,579 38,454,941 34.68% 2016 545,822,000 153,149,000 28.06% 2017 597,180,000 200,082,000 33.50% At the same time, after correcting for inflation, the shear size of the fund is larger today than in the past 40 years. Neither Pagano nor Willoughby took anything away from the gains Atlanta has made, particularly in the way it has risen from the fiscal wreckage of the Great Recession. Their point was that there are different ways to crunch the numbers. And they also offered several cautionary thoughts about what lies beneath the data. In the mid-1980s, Pagano collected surveys from financial officers at the 100 largest cities. The numbers he got from Atlanta for those years (included in the full spreadsheet, but not in the excerpt above) didn’t match what the city sent us. Conclusion? Pinpoint accuracy is not in the cards. Numbers that are broadly correct are about the best you can expect, especially when looking across several decades. Willoughby and Pagano cautioned against reading too much into the one-time $71 million bolt of cash that came in 2017. Our research found that money came from the decision to liquidate two city funds, with tens of millions from the Underground Atlanta project accounting for the bulk of it. ""It was a benefit for this year,"" Willoughby said. ""But you can’t count on it happening again. To pin your good fiscal health on one big drop of money is probably not appropriate."" All of the experts we reached told us that there’s always a subjective element in municipal finance. ""This is more of an art than a science,"" said Tracy Gordon, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. ""How you combine the metrics and how you rate them involves some value judgments."" Bottoms said the city was on the strongest financial footing in 40 years. Several indicators point in that direction, though the weakest factor centers on pensions. Atlanta faces significant challenges in funding its future pension obligations. That was not a factor in 1978. However, the situation is better than a decade ago. More promising is the city’s bond rating. It is higher than ever. The relative size of the general fund also falls in the plus column. In constant dollars, the 2017 general fund is larger today than it was 40 years ago — one long-time researcher called it ""remarkable."" The fund did rely on some one-time cash infusions and a different, also reasonable, approach shows that the situation was a little better in 1978. There are factors that detract from the claim’s accuracy but the facts support the general thrust. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C437EC0>],/factchecks/2018/jan/12/keisha-lance-bottoms/atlantas-finances-best-40-years/

Was Ron DeSantis the 'deciding' vote against the state's right to protect Florida's coast?
","Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gwen Graham called out her newest Republican opponent Ron DeSantis for going to bat for oil drilling off Florida’s coast. Her Jan. 4 tweet came as the White House prepared to announce a new offshore drilling plan that originally included Florida among states that would see expanded drilling. (The White House later walked it back to exempt Florida at the urging of Gov. Rick Scott.) When DeSantis had the opportunity to keep drilling out of Florida, Graham said, he went against it. ""In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling,"" Graham tweeted. ""Will Congressman DeSantis stand up for Florida or is he too scared of losing @realDoanldTramp's endorsement?"" In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling. Will Congressman DeSantis stand up for Florida or is he too scared of losing @realDoanldTramp's endorsement? https://t.co/6pgiXY1gFp The tweet included a link to a close vote on a 2013 amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act (HR 2231), which never became law. Was DeSantis, whose district includes several east coast beaches, really ""the deciding vote"" on an effort to keep drilling out of the state? The short answer: It’s hard to say there is ever such a thing as ""the deciding vote"" with close calls in Congress.  DeSantis’ specific position on drilling is squishy. Most recently, DeSantis embraced Scott's opposition to Trump's plan. ""In Florida our coastline is so important to our economy, it’s important to property values, it’s important to tourism,"" DeSantis said on Fox & Friends. ""And we need to protect our coastline."" Other actions speak to support for the coast, including a December 2015 letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management against seismic airgun exploration and a letter in opposition to the 2017 Interior Department executive order that advanced offshore oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean.   There’s also his vote in favor of a failed amendment that would have banned seismic testing in areas bordering Florida. He was one of 24 Republicans to vote for the testing ban. He also voted for a Graham amendement that would have restricted funds being used for the research, investigation, or study of offshore drilling.  But that's not to say that DeSantis has always voted against drilling.  The 210-209 vote in Graham's tweet happened years earlier. In the summer of 2013, then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, proposed an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act pushed by House Republicans. The larger bill aimed to expand U.S. offshore energy production by directing the U.S. Interior Department secretary to implement a five-year oil and gas leasing program off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Grayson’s amendment would have ensured the ability of Florida or any state to prohibit the use of drilling within its boundaries. At the time, Grayson said the amendment would have avoided the possibility of the federal government overriding states' rights to decide. When it came to a vote, Grayson’s amendment failed by one vote, and DeSantis voted against the amendment. The larger bill passed the House but did move past the Democratic-controlled Senate. Does that mean he was the ""deciding vote?"" There’s no doubt that DeSantis’ vote was crucial. But as we have concluded in fact-checks of similar attacks, the ""deciding vote"" label could just as easily be applied to any other lawmaker who voted on his side — making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the narrowly passed Affordable Care Act, for example.) That’s the general rule. We wondered if DeSantis did anything to justify being singled out, such as holding his support until the last moment. We couldn’t spot from C-SPAN footage whether DeSantis was one of the members who changed his mind at the literal last minute. Even if he were, however, he would not have been the only lawmaker to do so. Graham spokesman Matt Harringer argued it is noteworthy that DeSantis was in the minority of Florida Republicans who voted against this amendment. Seven Florida Republicans, including DeSantis, voted against the amendment, while nine Republicans voted for the amendment. DeSantis’ team didn’t argue his vote, but they did take issue with Graham’s framing of the measure as a vote ""against our state’s right to protect Florida waters from drilling."" Many Republicans didn’t see it that way, arguing Grayson’s measure would not have actually changed Florida’s control of its coast. ""Since the underlying bill did nothing to alter the existing relationship between the federal and state governments, the amendment itself contained no substantive policy that would have changed the ability of Florida to prevent development of waters within its jurisdiction,"" said DeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick. Fusick said the balance of power between the federal and state government was already determined by the Submerged Lands Act (which sets federal government ownership of submerged lands after the first three miles from the state’s coast) and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (which also applies to land beyond three miles offshore), which were both enacted in 1953. Holly Parker, the Florida regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation, said that if Grayson’s amendment only applied to state waters, then it would seem to be a duplication of an existing right. However, she said it’s possible that the broader failed legislation would have changed that.   ""Now, if the underlying legislation somehow impeded those state rights and this amendment was an attempt to clarify or delineate the rights of a state to regulate those submerged (lands), that would be different,"" Parker said. Athan Manuel, the director of the Sierra Club’s Land’s Protection Program, said he thinks it's possible that the bill could have changed the separation of powers. Regardless, he said, the point of Grayson’s amendment was to be ""extra clear"" that Florida had a say in what happened. ""Maybe it wasn’t as necessary, but it's important to send the right message,"" Manuel said. ""If he wanted to vote against drilling, he should have voted for the Grayson amendment."" Graham said DeSantis casted the ""deciding vote against"" the state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling. There’s no question that DeSantis’ vote on an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was crucial, but saying DeSantis was the deciding vote goes too far. Technically, any of the 209 other people who voted against the bill could be considered the ""deciding vote."" Furthermore, the significance of Grayson’s amendment is a subject of debate. Democrats saw it as securing Florida’s right to protect Florida waters, whereas Republicans say the amendment wouldn’t have changed the powers of the state. With everything considered, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4337C0>],/factchecks/2018/jan/12/gwen-graham/did-ron-desantis-cast-deciding-vote-against-legisl/
