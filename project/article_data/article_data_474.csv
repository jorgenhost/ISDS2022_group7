President Barack Obama says the unemployment rate for those who have never attended college is almost double what it is for those who have
","
Yes, the unemployment rate is still high. But those without a college degree are hurting even more, according to President Barack Obama, who was in Austin last week to raise money for fellow Democrats. 
""Now, I know some folks argue that as we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression, my administration should focus solely on economic issues,"" he said during a side speech at the University of Texas at Austin on Aug. 9. ""But as I said the other week to the National Urban League, education is an economic issue. It may be the economic issue of our time. It’s an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who’ve never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have."" 
Almost double? 
Matt Lehrich, a White House spokesman, pointed us to employment data kept by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking at labor force statistics from the Current Population Survey, the unemployment rate for those with at least a bachelor's degree was 4.5 percent in July 2010, while 10.1 percent of high school graduates who didn't attend college were without jobs. Add those who never graduated from high school, and the unemployment rate creeps up to 11 percent. 
That's more than double the unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's, master's, doctorate or professional degree. Include those who attend attended ""some college"" or earned an associates degree, and the jobless rate for the college crowd is 6 percent. So, as of July, the unemployment rate for those who never went to college is almost double what it is for those who have. 
How did the two unemployment rates shake out historically? The data during the last two years show similar ratios. 
In 2009, on average, about 10.9 percent of those who never attended college were unemployed, while 6.1 percent of those with at least some college were unemployed. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent for those without college, and about 3.1 for those who had.

Barnes said he ran positive TV campaign in primary
","
The day after last week's nasty primary runoff for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, the Democratic contender, former Gov. Roy Barnes, emerged unbruised.  

It had been a rancorous couple of weeks for the GOP. Candidate Nathan Deal accused opponent Karen Handel of running an entirely negative campaign, a claim PolitiFact Georgia ruled Mostly True in an earlier item. Handel called Deal ""a corrupt relic of Washington, D.C."" Supporters of Deal, who won the runoff, claimed Handel supports aborting children with Down syndrome. We ruled that Pants on Fire.  

Barnes, who won his party's primary without a runoff, took full advantage of the rival party's ugliness during a Channel 2 Action News interview. He called his Republican opponents ""honorable people"" and said that it's possible to run a campaign without calling names.

""Well, you know, I think that we were proud that we ran the Democratic primary without ... one negative TV spot,"" he told anchor Carol Sbarge.

Really? Not a single one?

As the front-runner, Barnes didn't need to go negative, Emory University political science professor Merle Black said. Polls consistently indicated Barnes could win the Democratic primary without a runoff. That allowed him to stay on the sunny side of politicking, Black said.

""It was not in his interest to run anything negative because he was so far ahead of everybody else,"" Black said. ""One of his main goals is to unify his party, and you don’t do that by going negative.""

To make sure Barnes played a clean game, we examined his eight 30-second TV campaign spots for evidence of negative campaigning.

""Providence"" 
In this commercial, Barnes sits on a pew in a sunny church. A harp plays in the background, and Barnes gives a 'mea culpa' for the sins he committed during his term as governor. At the time, critics complained he was heavy-handed. Voters ousted him in 2002 in favor of Sonny Perdue.

""As governor, my heart was in the right place, but I didn’t listen or slow down to explain why I had to make some difficult decisions. For that, I apologize,"" Barnes says.

Barnes' only swipe was against the Georgia General Assembly, which, he says, ""plays its games.""

""Taxes""

Sitting before the front porch of a bungalow, Barnes says he has a record of lowering taxes for homeowners.

Once again, Barnes' bogeymen are ""the politicians under the Gold Dome"" who ""took away our tax cut"" to give money to special interests, he says.

""It’s not right. It’s not fair. And when I’m governor, it won’t stand,"" he finishes.

""Chalkboard"" 

This commercial starts with Barnes pointing over a hilly vista, holding what appears to be architectural drawings. 

""Roy Barnes will make Georgia work again,"" a male announcer says. The voice adds that the number of jobs in the state grew during Barnes' term as governor, a claim we ruled Half True in a previous item. He also promises to end teacher furloughs ""forever"" and to ""scrub corruption.""

The commercial reserves its harshest words for the state Legislature and ""big business."" 

""Foreclosure""

Barnes returns to the bungalow in ""Taxes"" to plug his plan to ease the suffering of homeowners by ensuring banks negotiate before foreclosing on homes. The commercial features a crying mom, a boy clutching a stuffed elephant and a law enforcement officer who helps the woman carry possessions from her home.

The bad guys? Bankers and their lobbyists.

""They slapped you on the back to lend you the money and slapped you in the face when you got in trouble,"" Barnes says. 

""Education""

Barnes sits with ordinary people at a diner and tells them his plans on education. He promises he won't furlough teachers or ""cut the school year in order to pay for special-interest tax breaks."" 

""I will make smaller classes. I will increase teachers pay. I will make education No. 1,"" he says. 

""Pine Pellets"" 

Sun shines through thick stands of pine trees. Birds twitter and a slide guitar sighs.

An announcer pitches Barnes' plans to get Georgia into the renewable energy business and calls the state the ""Saudi Arabia of pine trees,"" a claim we ruled Barely True in a separate item. 

""When I’m governor, we’ll turn our renewable forests into a job-creating industry,"" Barnes says. The ad says nothing negative.

""State Buildings""

This ad featured Roy Barnes' plan ""to put people to work -- immediately,"" as an announcer says.

Barnes tells a group of men and women wearing hard hats that he can put tradespeople in jobs retrofitting state buildings for energy independence or efficiency.

The group nods in agreement. ""I think a paycheck would be great,"" one man replies. Again, nothing negative.

""Travel for Jobs""

Barnes walks through an airport, meets with people in a boardroom and concludes ""we can’t bring jobs to Georgia with the rest of the country laughing at us.""

Once again, the General Assembly is the problem, but Barnes doesn't single out any particular legislator. The commercial says the Legislature passed goofy laws about microchips in the brain and stem cell research and talked about seceding from the union, a claim we ruled Mostly True.  Those actions make Georgia look too weird for businesses interested in relocating, he says.

So did Barnes run an all-positive TV campaign?

While Barnes took quick jabs against special interests, banks, lobbyists and the General Assembly, these were mainly brief asides in otherwise positive commercials. The ads focused on his record and campaign promises and made no attacks against specific primary rivals.

Two of Barnes' key opponents in the primary agree with Barnes' contention that he kept things positive -- at least on TV -- in the Democratic primary.

Russ Willard, a spokesman for state Attorney General Thurbert Baker, said Baker agrees that Barnes kept it clean in the primary.

""He [Baker] agreed with that Roy did not run negative TV ads during the primary campaign,"" Willard said.

Another Barnes opponent in the primary, state Rep. DuBose Porter, D-Dublin, said Barnes had such massive statewide name recognition that Barnes did not have to go on the attack.

""I think that’s probably correct,"" Porter said of Barnes’ positive-campaign pronouncement. ""He just kept stealing all of my ideas.""

Still, Barnes' commercials were no love fest. Although he did not target candidates, he bad-mouthed special interests and big business. He also threw some punches at the state Legislature.

"['National', 'Oil Spill', 'Carol Browner']","
Carol Browner says three-quarters of the oil spilled in the Gulf is gone
","
With the oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico finally stemmed, Carol Browner, special adviser to the president for energy and climate change, delivered what she said was some more good news: that a government report showed the vast majority of the oil spilled in the gulf is ""gone."" 
Browner delivered the news in several forums, but we decided to check her claim on NBC's Today Show on Aug. 4, 2010, when she said, ""I think it's also important to note that our scientists have done an initial assessment, and more than three-quarters of the oil is gone. The vast majority of the oil is gone."" 
The pronouncement drew immediate and sharp criticism from a number of environmental scientists who said Browner's claim presented too rosy a picture and was based on a good bit of scientific speculation rather than hard fact. We decided to investigate. 
Browner's claim comes from the newly released ""BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Budget Calculator,"" which seeks to track what has become of the oil released from the well. 
The report is based on ""measurements and best estimates"" from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of the Interior, of the 4.9 million barrels of oil estimated to have spilled from the well. According to the report, about 25 percent of the oil is estimated to have been skimmed, burned or directly recovered from the wellhead. Another 25 percent naturally evaporated or dissolved, the report states; about 24 percent was dispersed as microscopic droplets into gulf waters; and the remaining residual, 26 percent, ""is either on or just below the surface as light sheen and weather tar balls, has washed ashore or been collected from shore, or is buried in sand and sediments."" 
According to the report, oil in the residual and disbursed categories is in the process of being naturally degraded. 
In a press release announcing the report, Jane Lubchenco, under-secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator, warned that ""less oil on the surface does not mean that there isn't oil still in the water column or that our beaches and marshes aren’t still at risk."" 
Browner's assessment that three-quarters of the oil spilled from the well is ""gone"" was derided by gulf fishermen, as well as a number of environmental scientists. In an Aug. 5, 2010, Washington Post story, ""Scientists question report of shrinking spill,"" David A. Fahrenthold reported that in interviews with scientists who worked on the report, some said the figures ""were based in large part on assumptions and estimates with a significant margin of error."" 
In addition, the story stated, ""some outside scientists went further: In a situation in which many facts remain murky, they said, the government seemed to have used interpretations that made the gulf -- and the federal efforts to save it -- look as good as possible."" 
""I think the statement is a 'glass half full' interpretation of the estimates presented in the report,"" stated Michael J. Blum, a professor in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Tulane University, in an e-mail interview with PolitiFact. ""The estimates can also be interpreted as indicating that 50 to 75 percent of the oil remains in the environment."" 
The estimates presented in the report are ""a good starting point to work from,"" said Blum, but ""they will undoubtedly be refined pending further work to account for the distribution of oil/dispersants in the gulf."" 
In order to get to the 75 percent figure cited by Browner, the report does a misleading trick, said Ian MacDonald, a professor of biological oceanography at Florida State University. It includes the 17 percent of oil that was captured from the wellhead by pipes and pumped directly onto waiting tankers. 
""No one cares about oil that wasn't released,"" MacDonald said. ""If I had a student hand in that report, that would not be an acceptable way to present the data."" 
MacDonald further noted that government officials only have firm data on the oil that has been skimmed, burned or chemically dispersed. Most of the rest of the estimates are based on applying formulas from prior gulf spills, most of which occurred near the surface, not in 5,000 feet of water. 
""All the rest of the numbers come from scientific estimates,"" MacDonald said, and as a result are ""complete theoretical conjecture."" 
""To present such a bunch of speculation as actual scientific fact doesn't strike me as the actions of a responsible regulatory agency,"" he said. ""I don't know that it's necessarily inaccurate, but to say as a scientific fact that it's gone from the system, that it has biodegraded -- with no measurement by NOAA -- I'm sorry, that's baloney."" 
And oil that has been ""dispersed"" isn't the same as ""gone,"" he said. While some of it will naturally evaporate in the gulf, he said, ""the rest of it is still in the water."" 
Ed Overton, a professor at Louisiana State University who collaborated on the report, said in the Washington Post story that he would not have given out exact figures, as Browner did, because ""We don't have the foggiest idea [about how to measure the oil] with that precision."" 
We spoke with Overton, who said he was still relatively comfortable with Browner's assessment. 
""I don't know if I would have put it at three-quarters,"" Overton said. ""I'd say the vast majority. I'd be comfortable with that."" And with the evaporation that has likely taken place in the weeks since the date was collected, he said, ""I don’t think, today, there is 25 percent of the oil left in the gulf."" 
Oil is an ""environmentally biodegradable component,"" Overton said, and the Gulf of Mexico is particularly adept at naturally breaking down oil because of the warm water and nutrient and oxygen levels. As a result, he said, most of the oil near the surface is degrading rapidly. The greatest uncertainty, he said, is with oil clouds that have seeped into the deep water of the gulf. 
""There is a great deal of uncertainty in all of this,"" Overton said. ""This is not a real precise science. I think a lot of the estimates are speculation. But if you hit your finger three times with a hammer, do you have to do it a fourth time to know it's going to hurt? I think it's the same with this. Oil doesn't stay around for a terribly long time. We have to use the data we know from past experiences."" 
We think it was a reach for Browner to definitively state that three-quarters of the oil is ""gone."" For one, a quarter of the oil was described as dispersed. Much of that may be on its way toward being degraded by natural processes, but we think it's unfair to call that ""gone."" In addition, the report carries a bit of uncertainty. Much of the estimate was based not on on hard data, but was calculated from formulas based on prior gulf spills that occurred in shallower water. As some scientists told us, Browner's estimate may be accurate, but they can't say for sure. 
In a progress report issued by Browner on Aug. 16, 2010, she was more cautious in her wording, saying, ""the vast majority of the oil that spilled into the Gulf has evaporated, skimmed, burned off, been recovered from the wellhead or dispersed."" That's more accurate than saying three quarter of the oil is ""gone.""

Matthew Dowd says Obama's approval ratings are in the low 40s
","During the Aug. 15, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Matthew Dowd, a former political strategist for President George W. Bush, used poll numbers to explain President Barack Obama's relatively weak political position.

Obama's ""approval numbers in this country are in the low 40s,"" Dowd said. ""He's perceived as not able to handle all the major issues in this country right now. The vast majority of this country right now questions his leadership.""

We thought we'd look at whether Dowd was right on the polling numbers.

We checked with the poll-analysis website pollster.com and found 16 traditional, live-caller telephone polls taken by media organizations or independent polling firms between mid July and mid August 2010. We excluded polls taken by automatic-dialing programs, by the Internet or by partisan firms. The polls we looked at included a sampling of either all adults or registered voters.

The two most recently released polls confirm Dowd's statement. A Gallup poll taken between Aug. 12 and Aug. 14, found a 42 percent approval rate, while a Fox News-Opinion Dynamics poll taken Aug. 10 to Aug. 11, 2010, found 43 percent approval.

But most polls in the past month have not been quite so low.

Among the five polls taken in the last week before the show aired, including the two cited above, Obama's approval rating averaged 45 percent. And that percentage has been remarkably consistent. Among the eight polls taken during the two weeks prior to the show, Obama's approval rating averaged better than 45 percent. Among the 13 polls in the three weeks prior to the show, he averaged slightly under 45 percent. And among the 16 polls from the month prior to the show, the average was, once again, 45 percent.

So over the course of the last month, Obama's approval rating in independent, traditional-format polls has consistently averaged approximately 45 percent -- that is, in the mid 40s, rather than the low 40s. However, the two most recent polls -- showing Obama's approval at 42 percent and 43 percent -- are smack in the middle of the low 40s. Whether these poll results are blips or the start of a new downward trend remains to be seen. For now, we'll give Dowd the benefit of the doubt and rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/16/matthew-dowd/matthew-dowd-says-obamas-approval-ratings-are-low-/

State Rep. Courtney Combs says Phoenix is No. 2 for kidnapping in the world
","
A stake through the heart will kill a vampire. A silver bullet can stop a werewolf.  But no known substance, it seems, can stop the monstrous notion that Phoenix has the second-highest kidnapping rate in the world -- an eye-popping claim that has more lives than even disco music. 

The latest conservative to parrot this line is State Rep. Courtney Combs, a Republican from Butler County and the Ohio lawmaker most involved in the debate over illegal immigration.

Combs, who is drafting legislation to bring an Arizona-style immigration law to Ohio, appeared July 16 at the City Club in Cleveland to take part in a discussion on illegal immigration. 

Halfway through the program, after detailing a spring trip to Cochise County, Arizona, to see the impact of illegal immigration, Combs said ""Phoenix, Ariz., is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world"" to underscore how dangerous the state has become.

Combs is far from alone in making this kind of claim. 

U.S. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona said something similar Aug. 1 on CBS News' Face the Nation.  He said Phoenix is ""called the kidnapping capital of the United States because the illegal immigrants who are brought to Phoenix for distribution throughout the country are held in drop houses, and they are mistreated, horribly treated."" 

The claim has been checked several times by PolitiFact. 

Rhode Island talk show host Helen Glover called Phoenix the kidnapping capital of the Western Hemisphere July 9, Sen. John McCain pushed the Phoenix as No. 2 kidnapping capital stat on ""Meet the Press"" June 27, and Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst made the Phoenix as No. 2 claim June 18. 

It's been repeated so much by conservatives that Rachel Maddow poked fun at the repeated GOP mistake, saying ""it's like its just too good a talking point to stop using even though its not true."" She made the quip Aug. 2 in a segment of her MSNBC show dedicated to myths about illegal immigration.

In fact, Combs said he made the assertion because he heard McCain say it ""on one of those talk shows"" as well as being told by Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever during Combs' fact-finding foray to Arizona. 

""I was quoting from what I thought were reliable sources,"" said Combs. ""When I heard it from John McCain who is a US Senator from Arizona, I presumed he knew what he was talking about.""

PolitiFact found that, in a nutshell,  the story goes back an ABC News report from Feb. 11, 2009: ""Phoenix, Ariz., has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone.""

However, ABC never said how the kidnapping ranking was reached. Also, while ABC’s story specifies the number of kidnappings that have occurred in Phoenix since 2008, it doesn’t say how many kidnappings were reported in other cities. And ABC has yet to provide us with supporting evidence, although we first published an item on this back in June.

Neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to Interpol, could confirm that Phoenix has the second-highest frequency of kidnapping cases worldwide. It's simply not tracked.

But overseas kidnapping experts say that cities in Mexico and Latin America see significantly more kidnapping cases than Phoenix. The experts list Mexico City; Caracas, Venezuela; Tegucigalpa, Honduras; San Salvador, El Salvador; Guatemala City, Guatemala; and Bogota, Columbia as places with probable higher kidnapping rates than Phoenix.

Meanwhile, there are also problems that many places don't keep kidnapping data, kidnappings in places outside the Unites States are usually under-reported, and the definition of kidnapping can vary widely.

While Phoenix has experienced hundreds of kidnappings over the past few years, we couldn't find reliable around-the-planet evidence to confirm they are number two in the world. In fact, experts advise that such rankings can't be made based on available information. If they could, they speculate, other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than Arizona's capital.
    
So we have found nothing confirming Phoenix as No. 2 in kidnappings in the world, or in the Western Hemisphere, or in North America. Combs, to his credit, immediately backed away from his statement when told this claim has been thoroughly debunked.

""I don't check out and verify everything that comes out, and I suppose I should if I'm going to repeat it in a  debate,"" Combs said. ""I appreciate you correcting the situation.""

We appreciate that Combs is willing to admit that he didn’t know what he was talking about, but he should have. This claim has been rated false repeatedly as it has made the rounds, yet here it is again. If you repeat a statement that has been proven false, it amounts to a reckless disregard for the facts. 

You may as well touch a match to your inseam. We move this statement to our lowest rating: Pants On Fire. ",/factchecks/2010/aug/16/courtney-combs/state-rep-courtney-combs-says-phoenix-no-2-kidnapp/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Lamar Smith']","
U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith says the United States could cut unemployment by reclaiming jobs held by illegal immigrants.
","
Woe is unemployment. And undocumented workers aren't helping the sorry jobless rate — 9.5 percent in July — according to U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, the co-chairman of the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus. 
""Illegal immigration and unemployment are directly linked,"" Smith said on the House floor July 1. ""There are 15 million unemployed Americans in the United States and 8 million illegal immigrants in the labor force. We could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers."" 
Lainey Melnick, the Democratic nominee for Smith's seat, brought the statement to our attention. We wondered if Smith's claim was true. 
Smith later said his assessment reflects ""simple logic."" 
""If our immigration laws were enforced, illegal immigrants will not be able to get or hold jobs,"" he told us in an e-mail, ""and they would be available for citizens and legal immigrants."" 
Smith didn't offer studies backing up his conclusion that reclaiming those jobs could cut unemployment in half. But, he told us, in case after case, following a raid, citizens and legal immigrants line up for jobs vacated by illegal immigrants. 
We wanted to know more about those cases. He pointed to a Sept. 15, 2009, USA Today article citing a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group critical of illegal immigration. The center looked at six meatpacking plants owned by Swift & Co., where federal agents arrested nearly 1,300 illegal workers in December 2006. Those workers accounted for 10 percent of the plants' labor force. The center's study concluded the raids didn't cripple the company or the plants, which within months had full staffs of legal U.S. residents as workers. 
However, Jessica Vaughan, the center's director of policy studies, told us she doesn't know of any studies — including the center's study — that substantiate Smith's claim. ""I am not aware of any studies that would support his claim if it was taken literally... but we have found that immigration law enforcement targeting the workplace does have a beneficial effect on employment opportunities for legal workers."" 
""The general idea is right, but in practice it's not that simple,"" she said. Why? ""Because in real life there might not be a legal worker in the same place to immediately replace the illegal workers. However, over time many of the vacancies in such a scenario would be filled by legal workers, perhaps even at a higher rate of pay, or some of the jobs might just fade away as employers decide on mechanization or some other way to get by."" 
Separately, we hunted for data relevant to Smith's statement. 
Back in December, we rated Mostly True Smith's claim that illegal immigrants now hold 8 million U.S. jobs. Smith was citing a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, Jeffrey Passel, who estimated, relying primarily on U.S. census data, that 7.8 million undocumented residents worked here as of March 2008. 
When we reached him this month, Passel said the number of workers who are illegal immigrants probably amounted to about 7 million as of late because the unemployment rate among undocumented workers ""has gone way up."" 
At the same time, there were about 14.6 million unemployed legal residents as of July, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. So there's at least one clear-cut way to conclude, as Smith does, that if the undocumented workers were barred, half the nation's unemployed legal residents could fill resulting vacancies. 
Then again, that presumes that every unemployed American would leap for the newly available jobs — and that those jobs would still be available when an undocumented, potentially underpaid worker couldn't fill them. Most experts raised doubts. 
Jack Martin, special projects director at the conservative-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said ""there would not necessarily be an immediate one-to-one replacement of illegal (workers) by legal workers, but we assume that would largely occur over time."" 
Yet Martin noted complications, telling us that of the nation's undocumented workers, about half are paid under the table, according to a 2003 study by the centrist-to-liberal Urban Institute. In a nutshell: employers can pay these workers less than minimum wage because as illegal residents, they're less likely to land well-paying jobs. He said FAIR ""assumes that virtually all"" on-the-books' jobs could be filled by unemployed legal workers. 
Martin elaborated: ""Jobs in the underground economy, on the other hand, sometimes are exploitative jobs — like (jobs in) sweatshops — and exist only because of the presence of the (illegal workers) ... We do not have an estimate of how many of those 4 million jobs might disappear rather than offering the wages and working conditions necessary to attract a legal work force."" 
James Sherk, a policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, said ""economic research does not back up"" Smith's claim. Giovanni Peri, an associate professor in economics at the University of California, Davis, said that ""if you look at any sort of long-term data, there is no association whatsoever between American unemployment rates and undocumented workers,"" as opposed to a direct link, like Smith says. 
We found limited research on what would happen if we could suddenly reclaim all U.S. jobs held by undocumented workers, though in 2006, then-state Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn analyzed the impact of undocumented immigrants on Texas' budget and economy. 
That report cautions that ""calculating the impact of undocumented immigrants on the Texas economy and state budget is at best an educated guess... It is difficult to count a population that does not want to be counted, particularly when the law allows them access to to many government services without regard to citizenship, such as those delivered by public hospitals and public schools."" 
Still, the study assesses the possible economic impact of removing the estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants in Texas as of 2005. Pew estimated the U.S. had 11.1 million undocumented immigrants in 2005, with between 1.4 and 1.6 million living in Texas. 
Wages for the remaining legal workers would increase by 0.6 percent in the first year, the study says, and stay above an estimated wage baseline through 2025. However, ""while pay increases can be viewed as positive social and economic development, when they rise due to labor shortages they affect economic competitiveness,"" the report says. ""In this case, it would be expressed as a modest decline in the value of Texas' exports."" 
Using an economic model, Strayhorn estimated that overall employment would decline 2.3 percent, and ""employment would remain 2 percent below the baseline forecast 20 years later. The impact lessens over time, but remains sizable throughout the 20-year forecast period."" The study doesn't say how many of those 1.4 millions jobs would be filled by remaining residents. 
In December 2008, the Perryman Group, a Waco-based economic research firm, prepared an analysis of the economic impact of undocumented workers on business activity for Americans for Immigration Reform, a Houston group founded by ""Americans concerned with the destructive measures being taken and considered regarding immigration and its impact on the business community, employees and consumers."" 
Upshot: Eliminating the undocumented workforce would result in an immediate loss of 8.1 million jobs, according to the report, and a total eventual loss of 2.8 million jobs after the market has had time to adjust. 
""If all undocumented workers were removed from the workforce, a number of industries would face substantial shortages of workers, and Americans would have to be induced into the labor pool or provided incentives to take jobs far below their current education and skill levels,"" according to the report. ""For this phenomenon to occur to a meaningful extent, substantial wage escalation would be necessary."" 
Ray Perryman, the economist behind the Perryman Group, told us that skill level is a key factor. ""A lot of the unemployed people right now are highly skilled professionals, and would have no experience with these primarly manual labor-type jobs that the undocumented workers perform,"" he said. Plus, he said, the demand for jobs that undocumented workers often hold, like construction and hospitality gigs, is low thanks to the recession. 
Perryman said he has ""never seen an academic study that would support"" Smith's claim. 
We found more studies that showed how undocumented workers affect employment, as opposed to unemployment. Summing them up: immigrants don't exacerbate unemployment. This May, FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan fact-checking project at the Annenberg Public Policy Center in Pennsylvania, looked into whether legal and illegal immigration deprives Americans of jobs. Citing experts, it said that ""study after study has shown that immigrants grow the economy, expanding demand for goods and services that the foreign-born workers and their families consume, and thereby creating jobs. There is even broad agreement among economists that while immigrants may push down wages for some, the overall effect is to increase wages for American-born workers."" 
What's more, experts told us that if all illegal workers vanished, there almost certainly wouldn't be a one-to-one replacement of the workers with legal residents because many of those jobs wouldn't appeal to legal workers or unemployed workers might not live near the newly available jobs. In its 2009 report on the Swift Raids, the Center for Immigration Studies cited the Congressional Research Service, which outlined factors explaining why illegal immigrants fill jobs that legal workers generally find objectionable: ""Some have argued that work involving 'blood, unpleasant odors and repetitive tasks, is not attractive' to U.S. workers. But other factors including low wages, high line speeds, little job security, rural-sited facilities, and diminished union protection may also make domestic recruitment difficult."" 
Where does all this leave us? 
Smith offered no studies backing up his statement, while we found two studies that found that employment would actually decline if undocumented workers were suddenly deported. Meantime, for various reasons experts across the spectrum said it's not believable that unemployment would halve should illegal workers vanish. 
Smith's simple logic is too simplistic. We rate his statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/aug/15/lamar-smith/us-rep-lamar-smith-says-united-states-could-cut-un/

Twelve years after he resigned amid Republican Party defeats and ethics troubles, former longtime Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich is ""ascendant,"" a recent Esquire magazine article reported.

Gingrich, who gained renown for helping orchestrate the historic 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, has managed to maintain his position as the party's philosopher king, according to ""Newt Gingrich: The Indispensable Republican"" a profile by John H. Richardson.

This accomplishment may have produced real political gains. Although Gingrich has not said he is running, he is an early leader in polling for the 2012 presidential election, the article said. Plus, he's trouncing the competition in the thing that matters most in contemporary politics: raising cash.

This year, Gingrich ""has raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined,"" the article states.

Is he really beating all of them? Even Palin?

Granted, the 2012 race is far from beginning in earnest, and Gingrich's real chances are unclear. Thanks in part to his conservative fan base, his name comes up regularly as a possible presidential contender, but he has yet to commit.

Still, his fundraising is well worth a look. Even though it's not clear whether Gingrich plans to run for president, federal law allows him to operate a ""527 group,"" a type of political organization capable of raising massive amounts of money. His American Solutions for Winning the Future raised the cash mentioned in the Esquire article. It describes itself as ""a unique tri-partisan organization designed to rise above traditional gridlocked partisanship, to provide real, significant solutions to the most important issues facing our country.""

American Solutions has opposed stringent regulation of the energy industry and advocated for giving more leeway to school districts that want to fire mediocre teachers, among other things.

One of Esquire's fact-checkers backed up the article's claim by pointing us to a page on the website of Media Matters for America,a liberal group that fact-checks claims by the media. It referenced articles about the fundraising efforts of various political action committees, or PACs, and American Solutions. They show that American Solution's haul dwarfed those of the PACs for potential political candidates.

So what are PACs and 527 groups? We asked Paul Ryan,an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center,which advocates for campaign finance reform and strengthening federal ethics rules and enforcement. We also consulted Federal Election Commission rules and tax code.

It's complicated, so bear with us.

527 groups are a type of nonprofit named after the section of federal tax code that outlines what they can do. They exist to raise money to get a candidate elected.

Political action committees, or PACs, raise money to elect candidates, too. Many are also free from paying income tax under the same code that creates 527 groups. There are several types of PACs, and the kind that's controlled by candidates can't accept money directly from corporations or labor unions. They have strict donation limits that can be as small as $2,400 per individual.
527 groups such as Gingrich's try hard to avoid being regulated as a PAC, and that's a tricky business. A bunch of local, state and federal laws chime in on what it means to be a PAC, but if a 527 can avoid being pigeonholed, the payoff is big: Corporations and labor unions can give non-PAC 527 groups as much money as they choose and as often as they want. 

According to OpenSecrets.org, Newt Gingrich's 527 received $350,000 from a single corporate donor during the 2010 election cycle. 
Politicians interested in running for major offices find it useful to start 527s or PACs to lay the groundwork for their campaigns. They help them exert influence over issues or races. Which one they start depends on how they want to spend. 
Yes, 527s can raise far more money, but PACs can do things that 527s can't. For instance, by law, current federal officeholders have to play by PAC rules when they raise funds. And it's easier for a PAC to give money to a specific candidate.  
 
So 527 groups and PACs are not the same thing, a fact that the Esquire article acknowledges, albeit imperfectly. It said that 527s are barred from promoting the interests of a specific candidate when, in fact, that's what they're all about. But a lot of them avoid contributing to candidates to duck being regulated under tougher PAC rules. 
Pawlenty, who is governor of Minnesota, does not have a 527 group, a PAC staffer confirmed. Press representatives of the other candidates did not respond to our requests for comment, and a Web search found no evidence that they currently have 527 groups either.

Now it's time to examine the numbers.

We looked up American Solutions' Internal Revenue Services filings, plus the FEC filings for the PACs of Huckabee, Palin, Pawlenty and Romney.

By June 30, American Solutions had raised $6,081,984.00.The others had raised $6,015,422.33. Gingrich wins.

Federal filings confirm that Gingrich has indeed raised more than the other candidates combined -- but with a very important caveat. Comparing 527 groups with PACs is not entirely fair because it's much easier for a 527 group to raise money.

The Esquire article acknowledged the difference between PACs and 527 groups. And while it mixed up some details, it got right the overall point that they're hard to compare.

Given that Esquire gave its statement adequate context, we rule this statement True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/15/esquire-magazine/magazine-says-newt-gingrich-leads-fundraising/

Democratic Governors Association says Chafee supported George W. Bush and the conservative GOP leadership more than three quarters of the time
","
The Democratic Governors Association, through its website SenatorChafee.com and via Google ads promoting it, continues to attack Lincoln Chafee, the former Republican now running for governor, asking ""Is Chafee Really Independent?""

The website says, ""Senator Chafee supports the conservative economic policies of President Bush and opposes action that would really benefit the working families of Rhode Island. In fact, while in the Senate, Chafee voted with President George W. Bush and the conservative leadership 76% of the time.""

As a measure of loyalty, 76 percent doesn't strike us as being particularly supportive of then-President Bush and the conservative leadership. Are we talking about the same guy who refused to vote for Bush's reelection in 2004, who was attacked as being in RINO (Republican in Name Only) and who was chastised by the conservative Club for Growth for abandoning ""Republicans to side with liberal Democrats""?

Democratic Governors Association spokeswoman Emily Bittner told us that the 76 percent comes from averaging the percentage of votes Chafee made against Bush, as compiled by Congressional Quarterly, and subtracting that number from 100. From 2000 to 2006, she said those figures were 12 percent, 16 percent, 7 percent, 23.1 percent, 24 percent, 44.4 percent and 29 percent, respectively.

But that comes out to 77.8 percent support, not 76 percent. Bittner was unable to explain the discrepancy.

The math is dead wrong for another reason: you can't get an accurate average by averaging individual percentages based on a voting record in which the number of votes differs from year to year. 

When we challenged Bittner about the calculation, she said, ""What we're trying to demonstrate is the depth of commitment that Chafee had to supporting Bush's agenda. Beyond, that I'm not going to get into math questions.""

Still hoping to get an accurate percentage, we asked Bittner what the actual number of votes was. She said she didn't have the data available.

So we turned to ""Politics in America 2006,"" an almanac from Congressional Quarterly, and found the annual percentages cited by the governors association.

It turns out they do not reflect how often Chafee voted with Bush and the conservative leadership. They only reflect his votes supporting the president. (The percentages are based on the editors' assessments of what the president probably wanted, as gleaned from speeches and other sources; not all votes were included.)

The other problem with the percentages cited by Bittner: Bush wasn't president in 2000. So when the association says that Chafee opposed the president 12 percent of the time in 2000, they're talking about Democrat Bill Clinton, not Bush.

The almanac includes a separate listing of how often Chafee voted with his Republican colleagues in the Senate, but those percentages make Chafee look even less loyal to the GOP.

Unfortunately, the almanac doesn't include vote totals, so we couldn't calculate Chafee's overall voting percentage in either category.

So we went to a source that does have the numbers we needed -- the U.S. Congress Votes database at WashingtonPost.com. It indicates how often candidates follow the party line and gives the total number of votes that serve as the basis for the calculation. It does not estimate how often a member of Congress supports or opposes the president.

Chafee served in the 106th through 109th Congresses, casting 2,244 votes. He voted with the Republican Party 1,577 times. That's 70 percent, not 76 percent.

That may not seem like a big difference, but consider the context.

During the 2001-2002 sessions, the only Republican senator less likely to vote with the GOP was James Jeffords of Vermont, who left the GOP in 2001 to become an Independent. Chafee voted with his party 71 percent of the time.

In the 2003-2004 sessions, Chafee ranked lowest in party loyalty among all Republicans, voting with the GOP 78 percent of the time.

And during the 1999-2000 and 2005-2006 sessions, Chafee was the least likely of ANY senator -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote with his or her party (62 percent and 68 percent, respectively).

The folks at the Democratic Governors Association are taking estimates of how often Chafee supported Bush, manipulating them improperly and mischaracterizing them by ignoring how often he opposed his mostly conservative GOP colleagues. We recommend courses in remedial math and history. To help motivate them, we'll give them a Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/15/democratic-governors-association/democratic-governors-association-says-chafee-suppo/

Rebecca Bell-Metereau says Ken Mercer wants Sean Hannity and James Dobson in social studies texts
","
Democrat Rebecca Bell-Metereau, trying to unseat Republican Ken Mercer on the State Board of Education, calls him ""an extreme partisan with a set agenda"" in a campaign flier that we recently snagged from a pile laid out in the Texas AFL-CIO building in Austin. 
Among Bell-Metereau's statements: Mercer ""wants Sean Hannity and James Dobson included in social studies texts."" 
We wondered whether Mercer was really in favor of Texas schoolchildren learning about a conservative political commentator -- Hannity -- and the founder of the evangelical Christian group Focus on the Family -- Dobson. 
We've previously checked four claims related to the board's rewriting of the state's social studies curriculum standards this year, including one by Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee and another by Kathy Miller of the Texas Freedom Network, which bills itself as a watchdog group that monitors ""far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders"" and has been critical of some changes the board made this year to the standards. Accusations that a seven-member conservative bloc on the 15-member board is infusing the process with politics has thrust the body into the national spotlight. 
Conservative stalwart Mercer, a San Antonio businessman initially elected to the board in 2006, waxed a well-funded challenger in March's GOP primary. Mercer's district, No. 5, includes Travis County south of the Colorado River, northern Bexar County and parts or all of 10 other counties. 
For this article, we asked Bell-Metereau, a professor at Texas State University, how she concluded that Mercer wants Hannity & Dobson in Texas textbooks. 
Her consultant, Harold Cook, pointed us to an August 2009 San Antonio Express-News news article about the social studies curriculum standards stating that Mercer ""would add James Dobson's Focus on the Family, conservative talk-show host Sean Hannity and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to the list of conservatives"" that students could study in a high school U.S. history course. 
The article starts by saying that under the first draft of the standards, high school students would learn about ""such significant individuals and milestones of conservative politics as Newt Gingrich and the rise of the Moral Majority — but nothing about liberals."" It notes too that the standards are the basis of public school textbooks; that's in keeping with state law. 
The first draft of the U.S. history standards, dated July 31, 2009, said students would be expected to ""identify significant conservative advocacy organizations and individuals, such as Newt Gingrich, Phyllis Schlafly, and the Moral Majority"" as part of learning about ""the circumstances of the U.S. as it emerges into the 21st century."" According to the Express-News story, that's the list Mercer was referring to when he mentioned Hannity and Dobson. 
The story also quotes Mercer saying students should ""study both sides."" At ""the end of the day,"" Mercer is quoted saying, ""we will want the young students to be able to identify what's conservative, what's their advocacy and who are the conservative groups, individuals and leaders. And what is liberal in contrast."" 
According to the story, Mercer suggested adding as examples of liberals the National Education Association, MoveOn.org, Planned Parenthood and the Texas Freedom Network. 
When we asked Mercer about his position on putting Hannity and Dobson in textbooks, he said he offered those examples of whom to include in response to the reporter's asking about adding liberal groups to the standards then being drafted. 
He said the groups and people in the standards such as the Moral Majority were examples of past conservative movements so his point was that if contemporary liberal groups were added to the curriculum, some of their conservative counterparts such as Huckabee and Hannity should be added as well. The Moral Majority, an evangelical Christian organization founded by the late Jerry Falwell, was a powerful political player during the 1980s. 
The board adopted a final version of the standards this May after approving revisions in January, March and May. 
We hunted for signs of Mercer advocating for Dobson and Hannity to be added to the standards during board deliberations. Our finding: When the time came to offer amendments to the standards, Mercer didn't propose adding Hannity or Dobson, although he proposed at least 15 amendments, including to put Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Wallace Jefferson on a list of people whom fourth-grade students could learn are examples of ""important individuals who modeled active participation in the democratic process."" He also proposed changing ""growth of the slave trade"" to ""Atlantic Triangular trade"" in an objective for eighth-grade social studies students learning ""why various sections of the United States developed different patterns of economic activity."" The former survived the amendment process and is in the final version of the standards; the latter did not. 
Dan Quinn, a Texas Freedom Network spokesman, and Debbie Ratcliffe, the education agency's communications director, said they did not recall any board attempts to add Hannity or Dobson to the standards. And we didn't find mention of them in the adopted versions. 
From another vantage point, a note in the first draft stated that several members of the panel of educators and others who wrote it were in favor of adding a requirement that students learn about liberal groups. In the end, that didn't happen, though a specific mention of conservative groups survived the amendment process. The final version of the standards says high-school U.S. history students are expected to ""describe the causes, key organizations, and individuals of the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s, including Phyllis Schlafly, the Contract with America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority, and the National Rifle Association"" as part of learning about ""the impact of political, economic, and social factors in the U.S. role in the world from the 1970s through 1990."" 
The word ""liberal"" doesn't appear in the high school standards. We asked Mercer why a mandate to study liberal groups didn't become a part of the standards. He said a separate requirement wasn't needed because liberal groups were already well represented. 
As to Bell-Metereau's statement, she's correct that Mercer spoke about adding Hannity and Dobson to the state's social studies curriculum standards -- although Mercer says the comment was intended to make a point about preserving ideological balance. Sorting who provoked what in that exchange is beyond us; that's between Mercer and the reporter. 
And although judging someone's wants is difficult, we find it significant and persuasive that neither Mercer nor other board members made a motion to include Dobson and Hannity in the standards, meaning there's been no push thus far to include them in textbooks. 
That earns Bell-Metereau a rating of Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/14/rebecca-bell-metereau/rebecca-bell-metereau-says-ken-mercer-wants-sean-h/

Kathryn Starkey missed just over half the meetings
","
A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks State House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax.

The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)

""Taxin’ Kathryn,"" says the mailer sent in early August 2010. ""With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?""

We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item tackles her attendance at meetings. Other items are here on her voting record for river board tax rates, and here on her actions involving the Pasco sales tax.

We looked at the claim that ""As a member of the Pinellas-Anclote River Basin Board, Kathryn Starkey had the opportunity to fight for lower taxes in 14 separate budget meetings between 2002 and 2008. But ... She only attended half of those meetings!""

Pennington said he based that claim on minutes from the basin board’s meetings. We took a look, too.

We looked at two budget meetings each year: June, when the basin board typically sets its preliminary tax rate, and August, when it takes a final vote. (In 2007, the final vote was taken in July.)

Starkey served on the board from June 2002 through April 2008, so we looked only at the 12 budget-related meetings that fell within that period. (Pennington, who put together his mailer a month ago, said he wasn’t sure why we came up with different counts for the meetings.)

Of 12 budget meetings she could have attended, Starkey attended seven (five of those seven were the final votes). That attendance record is more than half — by a hair.

Group raps Kathryn Starkey for aiding and abetting taxation
","
A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax.

The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)

""Taxin’ Kathryn,"" says the mailer sent in early August 2010 . ""With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?""

We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her voting record on setting tax rates. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving the sales tax.

After questioning Starkey’s attendance record as a member of the Pinellas-Anclote River Basin Board, the mailer says that when she did attend, ""Starkey aided and abetted the continued taxation on residents’ properties over 70 percent of the time by seconding motions and voting to keep the millage rate the same DESPITE skyrocketing property values that allowed local governments to pad their budgets.""

Here is what the minutes show.

Of the seven budget meetings she attended, the board voted six times to keep the tax rate the same. Starkey voted with her colleagues five out of those six times (She cast a dissenting vote in 2006). So overall, she voted over 70 percent of the time to keep the same tax rate.

All this came as taxable values were soaring in Pinellas and Pasco counties.

Between fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2007, when the rate stayed at 40 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, the total taxable values for the basin board went from roughly $48 billion to $81 billion in Pasco and Pinellas counties, according to Southwest Florida Water Management District.

By the time the board lowered the rate to 37 cents for fiscal year 2008, the total values were roughly $86.6 billion.

Simply counting votes misses an important fact, though. Starkey did make efforts to lower the tax rate.

In 2004, for instance, she made a motion to lower the rate to 39 cents. The motion died for lack of a second, and Starkey went along with the rest of the board to keep the tax rate the same.

And it was Starkey who took the lead role in 2006 when she again argued for lowering the rate, this time making a motion to set it at 37 1/2 cents.

The motion failed. She tried again, arguing for 38 cents. Her motion failed again. The board voted 3 to 2 to keep it at 40 cents, and Starkey dissented for the first time.

At the preliminary budget meeting in June 2007, Starkey made the motion to set the rate for the 2008 budget at 37 cents, which finally passed.

""Every year I tried to roll it back,"" she said, but didn’t have the votes.

Pennington’s mailer is technically correct: Starkey did go along with votes most of the time to keep the tax rate for the basin board the same, even as taxable values soared.

But it leaves out the important context that Starkey tried over three years to lower the tax rate. We rate this Half True.

""Taxin' Kathryn"" Starkey draws fire over 2004 local sales tax
","
A new political mailer from the Committee to Protect Florida attacks State House District 45 candidate Kathryn Starkey of New Port Richey for her record on taxes, citing her role on a water district board and her support of the Penny for Pasco, a 2004 increase in the county sales tax.

The committee is headed up by Rockie Pennington, a political consultant for Richard Corcoran, one of Starkey’s two opponents in the Aug. 24 Republican primary. (Fabian Calvo is also on the ballot.)

""Taxin’ Kathryn,"" says the mailer sent in early August 2010. ""With Kathryn Starkey’s record on taxes here at home, how can we trust her -- or afford her -- in Tallahassee?""

We wondered, can you trust the mailer’s claims? We looked at three claims, and this Truth-O-Meter item examines her actions and stance on the Penny for Pasco sales tax. Other items are here on her attendance at river board meetings and here on her actions involving votes on river board tax rates.

The tax hike in question is the Penny for Pasco sales tax, a one-cent-on-the-dollar county sales tax increase to build new schools and roads, preserve land and buy public safety equipment. About 52 percent of voters approved the tax in March 2004. By the end of 2009, the extra penny had pulled in about $205 million.

The claim that Starkey ""joined forces with liberal Democrats"" to pass the tax has problems.

First, Starkey played no strong public role in selling the tax to voters. She publicly endorsed the Penny for Pasco during her successful 2004 campaign for School Board, but she never actively campaigned for it or joined the committee promoting it.

Second, where were the liberal Democrats? Pasco’s Citizen Committee, the political action committee that formed to promote the tax, had 14 key volunteers: 10 of them were registered Republicans, the Pasco Times reported then.

They included well-known Republicans Allen Altman, Joanne Hurley, Thad Lowery and Bill Phillips.

True, the tax got the endorsement of Pasco’s Democratic Executive Committee and not that of the county’s Republican Executive Committee.

But consider, too, the prominent Republican politicians who publicly supported the tax: Commissioners Ted Schrader, Ann Hildebrand and Pat Mulieri and then-commissioner Steve Simon, along with then-state representatives Ken Littlefield and Heather Fiorentino.

And don’t forget Pasco Sheriff Bob White, another Republican, who was quoted in the Pasco Times calling support of the tax a ""no-brainer.""

White said then that his remarks were aimed primarily at how the tax would help the school district, but his endorsement — however nuanced — was political gold for the tax’s backers.

One big selling point for Republicans: The sales tax would result in a property tax reduction on the school district side. (Incidentally, that is not unlike Corcoran’s platform in the House 45 campaign to eliminate property taxes and increase the sales tax.)

To be sure, there were Democrats who were very involved in the effort. They included Land O’Lakes lawyer Tim Hayes and, most visibly, Ray Gadd, who led the school system’s effort as a Pasco school district administrator at the time. Then-commissioner Peter Altman, a Democrat, was also a vocal supporter.

""I can’t think of a liberal Democrat who was involved,"" said Gadd, who, incidentally, has changed his affiliation to independent.

The strongest opponents of the tax included Republicans Bill and Ann Bunting, leaders in the local party. But even they acknowledge that they were more often fighting people with Rs, not Ds, after their names.

""I can’t for the life of me understand how those Republicans supported it,"" said Ann Bunting.
Pennington, Corcoran’s consultant, said he linked Starkey with the Penny leaders because her endorsement as a School Board candidate carried weight. He said he also thought Allen Altman, who helped spearhead the campaign, was a Democrat. (Wrong.)

Corcoran was equally mistaken that the tax was a strongly Democratic initiative. ""It was overwhelmingly pushed by Democratic leaders,"" he said. (He was also unaware that White — whom he now works for as a contract attorney — endorsed the Penny.)

A new tax may be often associated with ""liberal Democrats,"" but that wasn’t the case with Penny for Pasco, particularly when it came to those who were publicly pushing for it. In addition, Starkey was not a key promoter of the tax.

Democrats' op ed accuses Republicans of taking credit for provisions of the health care bill they once tried to derail
","
Whoa, talk about a change in tune. Are Republicans now trying to take credit for parts of the health care bill? Are the Yankees rooting for the Red Sox? Are dogs and cats getting along?

In an Aug. 12, 2010, op-ed for Politico headlined ""GOP touts preventive care it opposed,"" Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., and Rosa DeLauro , D-Conn., touted the benefits of preventive and wellness care. As survivors of breast and ovarian cancer, respectively, they said that preventive care saved their lives. But if Republicans have their way, the Democrats said, they would roll back a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires no co-pay for preventive care — including cancer screenings, health checkups, flu shots, mammograms and immunizations.

That's pretty standard fare from Democratic supporters of the health care bill. But here's the part of the op-ed that caught our attention:

""Even Republicans who voted against the health care reform law and went out of their way to prevent its passage have now lauded these reforms. Recently, on the Senate floor, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) actually took credit for the preventive care provision. 'One of the things we did in the health care legislation,' Kyl said, 'was to provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care.'""

And, they wrote, ""This is not the first time Republicans have taken credit for health care provisions that they had tried to derail. After the act passed, and every Republican attempt to gut the bill had failed, House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) took credit for provisions that banned the practice of rescissions — dropping people’s health coverage when they get sick — and allowed young adults to continue being covered by their parents’ plans until age 26.

""To paraphrase President John F. Kennedy, success has a thousand fathers, while defeat is an orphan. So we understand why Republicans now like to laud health care reform — particularly when one considers that, after a decade of congressional control with eight years holding the White House as well, they had failed to do anything about the issue.""

That Republicans are now lauding the health care bill was news to us. So we decided to check out the two examples cited in the op-ed.

Kyl's comments about preventive care came from the Senate floor on July 12, 2010. The topic was the White House's controversial recess appointment of Dr. Donald M. Berwick as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Here's what Kyl said:

""Dr. Berwick expressed his disapproval for costly cutting-edge medical technologies and has said prevention services such as 'annual physicals, screening tests, and other measures' are 'over-demanded.' One of the things we did in the health care legislation was provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care, for screening, to try to help people avoid illnesses on the theory that it would be a lot cheaper if we didn’t do a lot of treatment that was unnecessary. If you could identify in advance that an individual had a need for some treatment, maybe you could catch the disease, say, the cancer, early and not have the expensive treatment, the end-of-life kind of care that is frequently very expensive.""

Kyl's new use of the royal ""we"" didn't quite mesh with his vocal opposition to the bill. In a health care debate last year -- that ended up a minor hit on YouTube -- Kyl argued against mandating blanket coverages.

""I don't need maternity care, and so requiring that to be in my insurance policy is something that I don't need and will make the policy more expensive,"" Kyl said.

So were Kyl's recent comments from the Senate floor an endorsement of the health care bill's preventive care provisions, and was he now taking credit for it?

""Sen. Kyl did not, in fact, 'take credit for' anything in his remark,"" said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Kyl. ""'We' was a factual reference to Congress, and did not contain a partisan context, as some now assert presumably for political reasons.""

Still, Democrats note that Kyl's tone appears to have changed, saying ""we"" instead of the more typical reference to the bill as ""the Democrat health care bill.""

""The way he's talking about it, he's talking about it like it's a good thing,"" said Brian Cook, press secretary for Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee.

Whether that amounts to taking credit for the idea is getting into a bit of semantics. Certainly Republicans -- and Kyl in particular -- have forcefully opposed the health care bill, and repeatedly spoken of it in terms that liken it to a disaster. And so we can understand Democrats' frustration when a strong opponent of the bill cites a provision of of the bill that ""we did"" -- especially in light of his earlier comments against requiring insurers to carry preventive services -- like maternity care -- that not everyone would use. But we think it's a bit of a stretch to suggest that Kyl was ""taking credit"" for that provision.

The ""taking credit"" moniker better fits the comments regarding Boehner.

In an April 30, 2010, interview with Boehner on National Public Radio, a reporter said, ""As you know, Democrats are already pointing to things that are already changing in America because of this (health care) bill. They will point to the fact that college seniors who would have been kicked off their parents' insurance when they graduated will get to stay on. Insurance companies are now saying they are going to end the practice of rescissions, or at least modify it...""

Boehner interjected, ""Both of those ideas, by the way, came from Republicans and are part of the comments and ideas that we ought to have in the law.""

Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner, noted that both provisions -- abolishing rescissions and encouraging extended coverage of young adults on their parents’ insurance through age 25 -- were included in the Republican alternative health care plan proposed by Boehner last November.

But the ideas were in the Democrats' health plan long before that. And if they were Republican ideas, asked Cook, the Democratic spokesman for the Ways and Means committee, then why was it never a part of the Republicans' legislative agenda when they held the majority?


We weren't able to pinpoint who originated the ideas, but we can say these were two ideas with rare bipartisan support -- as they were both in the Democratic and Republican health care proposals. It's certainly true that Republicans aggressively fought the health care bill, and are now aggressively seeking to overturn it. But it is misleading to suggest Republicans tried to derail the health care bill based on these two provisions.

So are Wasserman Schultz and DeLauro correct that Republicans are now ""taking credit"" for provisions of the health care bill ""that they had tried to derail""?

In the case of Kyl comments, we think it's a stretch to say he took credit for the preventive care provisions in the health care bill. But Boehner did credit Republicans for provisions to abolish rescissions and allow young adults to continue being covered by their parents’ plans until age 26. Yet those specific provisions were not the target of the GOP opposition, which focused on larger issues of cost and the growth of government. And so we find the claims in the op-ed Half True.",/factchecks/2010/aug/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/democrats-op-ed-accuses-republicans-taking-credit-/

Health reform costs $1 trillion over 10 years

Brown-Waite, a Florida Republican, also lists bullet points for why she opposes reform:
 
""Any Government-Run 'Public' Plan - Why it's the WRONG solution to America's Health Care Problems - Creates an entitlement that will cost another $1 trillion over the next 10 years, on top of the trillions the government is already planning to spend on health care.""
 
We found the phrasing here odd. As

, the Democratic plans for health reform leave employer-provided insurance in place. The House bill seeks to make it easier for individuals to buy health insurance on their own by creating a national health care exchange, a kind of one-stop shop for health insurance. One of the plans on the exchange will be a government-run plan that provides basic coverage at a price likely to be lower than private insurers. (For a fuller explanation of the basics of health care reform, read our story

Health care reform: a simple explanation

.)
 
It's not correct to characterize the overall health bill as a ""government-run 'public' plan."" Rather, the government will run one of the insurance plans, and people can choose to buy it or not.
 
Nevertheless, if we're talking about the overall bill, Brown-Waite is correct about its cost. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that the overall health care reform bill from the House would cost $1 trillion over 10 years. The bill includes cost-saving measures and tax increases on the wealthy, so its impact on the deficit would be lower: $239 billion over 10 years, according to the CBO.
 
If you're wondering how much the public option alone would cost, we're not sure. Obama has said he wants the public option to be self-supporting through the premiums it charges its customers. But the public option would need, at a minimum, some sort of seed money to get going. The CBO estimated all the costs associated with ""exchange subsidies,"" and that came to $773 billion, but that includes tax credits (called ""affordability credits"") to help people of modest means buy insurance on the exchange, and they might or might not choose the public option.
 
We also want to address Brown-Waite's statement that the health plan ""creates an entitlement."" An entitlement is ""a right to benefits mandated by government,"" and sometimes a euphemism for welfare, according to

Safire's Political Dictionary

. Strictly speaking, the bill creates entitlements for some people, but not for everyone. As we noted earlier, it gives tax credits to people of modest means, and it expands Medicaid for the poor.
 
We asked Brown-Waite for the reasoning behind her claims on the mailing, but we didn't get a response.
 
In some ways, Brown-Waite's mailer seems like a classic campaign tactic: Take your opponent's position and distort it so that it appears scary or stupid. But in this case, the mailer was paid for with tax dollars. Members of Congress get to mail their constituents without paying postage, a perk known as ""franking,"" and Brown-Waite's mailer clearly states it was ""prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense.""
 
Waite says that ""Any Government-Run 'Public' Plan ... Creates an entitlement that will cost another $1 trillion over the next 10 years, on top of the trillions the government is already planning to spend on health care."" But, to be clear, the overall health bill is not a ""government-run 'public' plan. The public aspect is just a part it, which people can choose to participate in or not. She also offers a confusing way to explain the cost of the health care reform bill, and we want to be clear that $1 trillion includes all aspects of the bill. So we rate her statement Half True.

Health care bill does not 'force' employers to drop coverage
","
Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite sent a mailing to constituents explaining her opposition to the Democrats' health care reform plan.
 
""Unfortunately, I believe the legislation currently being considered in the House of Representatives could spark the government takeover of health care,"" she wrote. ""The American people will have fewer choices, rationed care and higher costs. This is the last thing we need right now.""
 
Brown-Waite, a Florida Republican, lists bullet points for why she opposes reform. One of the points says, ""Any Government-Run 'Public' Plan ... Forces more employers to drop employee coverage due to rising costs and pay an additional  8% payroll tax for each worker.""
 
Her phrasing is misleading. As

we've


noted


before

, the House health care reform bill leaves the employer-provided health insurance in place. It seeks to make it easier for individuals to buy health insurance on their own by creating a national health care exchange, a kind of one-stop shop for health insurance. One of the options on the exchange will be a government-run plan that provides basic coverage at a price likely to be lower than private insurers. 
 
So her description of the overall health bill as a ""government-run 'public' plan"" is a distortion of the plan. That is only one element, and a small one at that.
 
In another item, we addressed claims from the mailer about how much the health bill would cost. Here, we'll address her claim that health reform ""forces more employers to drop employee coverage due to rising costs and pay an additional 8% payroll tax for each worker.""
 
It's true that the overall plan imposes a penalty on employers who don't offer health insurance to their workers. Employers with payrolls over $400,000 pay an 8 percent penalty on their total payroll. That means it's not a tax for ""each worker,"" but a tax on overall payroll. Small businesses are exempt from a penalty if their total payroll is less than $250,000 a year.
 
We've read all 1,000 pages of the House bill, though, and it seems clear that the penalty is intended to be a disincentive to dropping health care insurance. The tax penalty is part of a section titled ""Shared Responsibility"" that includes a requirement that all individuals carry health insurance.
 
Brown-Waite writes that the plan forces more employers to drop coverage ""due to rising costs."" Some who oppose the reform believe that it will inevitably result in higher costs, forcing employers to drop coverage. But that would be an unintended consequence. The exchange is intended to foster competition and lower costs, not force people into a public plan. (For more details on this issue, read our story

Health care reform: a simple explanation

.) The mailer gives the impression that the bill forces employers to drop coverage and then taxes them to create a government plan.
 
We turned to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan research center that collects and analyzes data on employee benefit plans. The institute does not take positions on policy issues. We asked if it was likely that employers would drop coverage if the House bill passed.
 
""I don't think anybody really knows what employers are going to do,"" said Paul Fronstein, a senior researcher.
 
Employers offer benefits voluntarily right now, he said, and they do it for business reasons, because it helps them recruit and retain workers. Most workers prefer not to have to buy insurance on their own.
 
""Employers offer coverage to be competitive in the labor market, and they offer coverage because their workers have no alternative due to the dysfunctional individual market,"" he said.
 
If health reform makes the individual market more competitive, employers might not feel like they must offer health benefits to retain their workers.
 
We should note that the tax penalty, sometimes called an employer mandate, remains controversial and may not be part of the final legislation.
 
We find Brown-Waite's statement misrepresents the way the bill works. We asked her office for an explanation but got no response. It's worth noting that the mailing reads like campaign literature, but was actually paid for with tax dollars. Members of Congress get to mail their constituents without paying postage, a perk known as ""franking,"" and Brown-Waite's mailer clearly states it was ""prepared, published and mailed at taxpayer expense.""
 
We find Brown-Waite's mailer does not accurately describe the bill. She incorrectly describes the overall plan as a ""government-run 'public' plan."" She is right that there is an 8 percent tax, but she mischaracterizes it as a tax on all businesses, when it is a tax on employers who do not offer health insurance. We rate her statement Barely True.

George Will claims the stimulus money will be spent slowly
","Faced with larger deficit projections than expected, the White House is shifting its attention back to the economy and so is conservative columnist George Will.
 
In a round table discussion on the Aug. 23, 2009, episode of  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  , four commentators including Will lamented the administration's loose fiscal practices, including how little of the $787 billion stimulus package has been spent.
 
""Well, I noticed that the stimulus, which has sent out, what, about 10 percent of what has been voted on this, that most of the stimulus spending will be not this year, not next year, but in 2011,"" Will said.
 
We've already  discussed  the difference between stimulus money that's been literally spent and money that's been obligated, and we've already looked at a claim about how quickly the stimulus money will be spent  here  . For this Truth-O-Meter item, we'll focus on Will's claim that most of the stimulus money will be spent ""not this year, not next year, but in 2011.""
 
It seems that Will's information springs from a bit of confusion that happened back in January 2009, when the White House and Congress were just starting to hash over the stimulus package.
 
At the time, the White House had released a $825 billion stimulus proposal that included about $355 billion in spending on everything from alternative energy to road construction. Repeatedly, the White House maintained it would spend about 75 percent of the money within the first 18 months of enactment.
 
A flurry of news reports cited a Congressional Budget Office prediction that much of the spending would happen in 2011 or later, but the White House contended that report was incomplete:
 
""The Congressional Budget Office recently released an analysis of a component of the economic recovery proposal; that analysis, however, did not assess the overall package,"" Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag wrote in a Jan. 22 letter to House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt. ""Our analysis indicates that at least 75 percent of the overall package (including its tax component and the other spending provisions that were not analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office) will be spent over the next year and a half.""
 
Nevertheless, Republicans seized on the estimate as a way to demonstrate that stimulus money would drip slowly rather than flood into the economy.
 
The final cost estimate of the $787 billion passed by Congress on Feb. 13 shows that about $145.4 billion will be spent on infrastructure and other job-creating projects in 2009 and 2010, and about $162.5 billion will be spent between 2011 and 2019. Just using those numbers, Will would be correct: most discretionary spending — the Washington term for the portion of the budget that Congress controls — will go out in 2011 or after.
 
But discretionary spending is only part of the $787 billion package.
 
Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy for Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, said the rest of the package includes mandatory spending — such as money for food stamps and health care — and spending on tax breaks. That money must also be taken into account to get the most accurate idea of how much cash is literally leaving Washington each year.
 
In that regard, the numbers look very different. According to the CBO, about $185 billion will go out in 2009 and $399 billion will go out in 2010. Together, that's about 75 percent of the $787 billion bill.
 
Also worth noting: Will said ""in 2011"" not ""after 2011."" In the heat of debate, it's clear that he slipped up his words. Nevertheless, in this case he's wrong no matter how you crunch the numbers; in every scenario, 2010 is the biggest spending year.
 
To recap: If the government were only considering discretionary spending, Will would be correct; CBO's cost estimates of the White House proposal and the final version of the bill demonstrate that most discretionary funding will go out in 2011 and later. However, that's not the whole story because Will's claim does not take into account mandatory spending or tax breaks. In that case, the bulk of the money will be spent in 2009 and 2010. As a result, we give Will a Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2009/aug/26/george-will/george-will-claims-stimulus-money-will-be-spent-sl/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Veterans', 'Michael Steele']","
RNC chairman Michael Steele says VA has a manual that encourages vets to commit suicide
","
Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele jumped into the so-called VA ""death book"" debate, calling it just the kind of thing that makes people nervous about the Democrats' health care reform plan.
 
""If you want an example of bad public policy, just look at the situation with our veterans where you have a manual out there telling our veterans stuff like 'Are you really of value to your community?' You know, encouraging them to commit suicide,"" Steele said in a Fox News interview on Aug. 25, 2009.
 
""I mean, this is crazy coming from the government. And this is exactly what concerns people and puts them in fear of what government-controlled health care will look like.""
 
But like the claim about ""death panels"" in the health care reform bill, we find this is another ridiculous falsehood about an important end-of-life issue.
 
At issue here is a 10-year-old VA-funded pamphlet on end-of-life issues called

""Your Life, Your Choices: Planning for Future Medical Decisions.""

 
The pamphlet entered the national discussion on health care after President George W. Bush's director of Faith-Based Initiatives, Jim Towey, wrote an

op-ed piece

for the

Wall Street Journal

on Aug. 18, 2009, in which he took issue with what he called the ""hurry-up-and-die message"" of the pamphlet. The issue takes on larger import, of course, due to the heated debate over funding for end-of-life counseling included in the Democrats' health care reform bill.
 
In his op-ed piece, Towey zeroed in on an exercise in the manual designed to ""help you think about and express what really matters to you."" The worksheet poses a number of scenarios and asks users to finish the phrase ""Life like this would be..."" by checking options that include ""difficult, but acceptable,"" ""worth living, but just barely"" and ""not worth living.""
 
While the scenarios include such things as relying on a feeding tube or breathing machine to keep them alive, Towey notes that it also includes circumstances common among the elderly and disabled such as: living in a nursing home, being in a wheelchair and ""cannot seem to shake the blues.""
 
""There are also guilt-inducing scenarios such as 'I can no longer contribute to my family's well-being,' 'I am a severe financial burden on my family' and that the vet's situation 'causes severe emotional burden for my family,'"" Towey wrote.
 
""This hurry-up-and-die message is clear and unconscionable,"" Towey concluded.
 
Towey also noted that one of the principle authors of the pamphlet, Dr. Robert Pearlman, was among 42 bioethicists who argued in a 1996 case that physician-assisted suicide should be recognized by the courts as a fundamental right.
 
Worse, he said, is that after the Bush administration shelved the pamphlet in 2007 in order to make revisions, the Obama administration revived it in a July 2009 VA directive that ""instructs its primary care physicians to raise advance care planning with all VA patients and to refer them to 'Your Life, Your Choices.' Not just those of advanced age and debilitated condition — all patients. America's 24 million veterans deserve better.""
 
We should note that Towey, president of St. Vincent College and founder of the nonprofit Aging with Dignity, years ago created his own advance care planning document called ""Five Wishes,"" and he made an unsuccessful pitch to VA officials in 2007 to have the government buy and distribute his pamphlet. In his op-ed, Towey says that unlike the VA's document, his ""does not contain the standard bias to withdraw or withhold medical care.""
 
In response, the Obama administration's veterans agency issued a fact sheet to the Plum Line's Greg Sargent on Aug. 25 in which they state that the ""Your Life, Your Choices"" pamphlet, developed by the VA more than 10 years ago, ""helps veterans consider the types of health care they would want to receive if they were unable to make decisions for themselves, and encourages them to discuss their views with their loved ones and their health care providers, and, if they so desire, to complete an advance directive.""
 
The pamphlet ""does not promote limitation of life-sustaining treatment, assisted suicide, or euthanasia,"" the fact sheet states.
 
However, the VA did acknowledge in November 2007 that although ""clear in its presentation,"" it has been ""interpreted by some to be too negative in tone and not sufficiently sensitive to the perspectives of veterans with prolife perspectives and veterans living with lifelong disabling conditions."" At that point, the VA officially suspended use of ""Your Life, Your Choices""  pending review by an expert panel, including input from faith-based groups as well as disability experts. The pamphlet is currently undergoing final revisions before being posted online, which is set for the spring 2010.
 
But the pamphlet is still posted on the VA Web site, albeit with a disclaimer that it is undergoing revisions. And a July 2, 2009, memo on Advance Care Planning and Management of Advance Directives states that when patients request additional information about advance directives, ""Patients may be directed to the exercises in 'Your Life, Your Choices' or other published resources.""
 
According to the White House fact sheet, the pamphlet is still officially suspended, but is available on the Web site because, ""it is the official policy of the Obama administration not to suppress or alter information or products resulting from federal research grants.""
 
Whether the pamphlet should continue to be made available pending its revision is a matter for political debate. Here, however, we are focusing on Steele's claim that the manual encourages veterans to commit suicide.
 
After reading the 51-page pamphlet, we conclude unequivocally that it does not. Rather, the pamphlet encourages vets to think about the kind of advanced care they'd like to receive in various situations, to communicate those wishes to loved ones, and to formally put them into writing (including steps on how to prepare a personalized living will).
 
Alongside positions such as ""I believe there are some situations in which I would not want treatments to keep me alive"" is the position, ""My life should be prolonged as long as it can, no matter what its quality, and using any means possible."" The pamphlet also respects that some people may have religious beliefs that come into play. One position is described as ""I'd want my religious advisers to be consulted about all medical decisions made on my behalf to make sure they are in keeping with my religious teachings.""
 
The document begins like this: ""There’s only one person who is truly qualified to tell health care providers how you feel about different kinds of health care issues — and that’s you. But, what if you get sick, or injured so severely that you can’t communicate with your doctors or family members? Have you thought about what kinds of medical care you would want? Do your loved ones and health care providers know your wishes? Many people assume that close family members automatically know what they want. But studies have shown that spouses guess wrong over half the time about what kinds of treatment their husbands or wives would want. You can help assure that your wishes will direct future health care decisions through the process of advance care planning.""
 
With regard to the issue of suicide, the pamphlet is quite clear:
 

Q: Can I specify that I want assisted suicide in my directive?


 

A: No. Assisted suicide is currently illegal.

 
Advanced care scenarios are upsetting to think about and discuss. And we certainly can see how some might think it's insensitive to disabled or aged veterans to have a pamphlet with an exercise that poses scenarios such as being in a wheelchair or living in a nursing home, and then to even include the option to check a box saying that life like this would be ""not worth living.""
 
But we think Steele goes way too far and sensationalizes an important issue when he says the pamphlet ""encourages (vets) to commit suicide"" — particularly when you consider the pamphlet in its entirety. This is a pamphlet intended to encourage vets to make choices about the kind of advanced care they want. And for the record, there is nothing in the manual that tells vets ""Are you really of value to your community?"" We rule Steele's statement Pants on Fire.
 

Note: We added information about Dr. Pearlman on Aug. 28, 2009.

There's rationing in health care now, and there still would be under reform bill
","It is perhaps the most polarizing word in the health care debate: rationing. Countless conservative opponents of the Democrat-backed health care reform plans have used the word. Their argument goes like this: You get government more involved in running health care, you set a goal of reducing costs, and it will inevitably mean rationing of medical services. It's not a long road from there to images of Grandma being denied a life-saving operation as a cost-saving measure. Everyone from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to Sen. Chuck Grassley has warned that people have reason to worry about rationing, while Democratic proponents of the plan have dismissed the claims as uninformed fearmongering. The term rationing has become so ubiquitous in the health care debate, we could've chosen to fact-check statements from any number of politicians as a way to talk about this issue. In a separate item, we looked at a claim about rationing from House Republican Leader John Boehner. In this item, we opted for one from Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, if only because he was so definitive about a subject with a lot of gray. ""Let me just say, A, there's no rationing in any of these bills, so we don't have to worry about that,"" Dean said on ABC's  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  on Aug. 9. Before we examine his specific claim, let's look at the criticisms that have led to charges of rationing. The critics have often focused on two areas of the health plan to back up their accusations. The first is a proposal to expand comparative effectiveness research. That's a bureaucratic way of saying the government would do studies to find out which medical treatments and medications work better than others, and which are most cost-effective. The idea is that this would help doctors and patients make better informed decisions about the most effective treatment strategies. It's also expected to save money over time. Some opponents, however, claim the government would use findings from this research to ration care. We looked into this issue in detail and concluded that claim is  False  . Other opponents of the plan have pointed to the Obama administration's proposal for an Independent Medicare Advisory Council (IMAC). The board would make annual recommendations for changing federal payments for various services covered by Medicare, as well as recommendations on ways to reform the Medicare delivery system. Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argues that price controls recommended by IMAC's unelected board amount to implicit rationing. Judith A. Stein, director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a group that helps seniors get care under the federal program, doesn't agree. Stein is no fan of IMAC, but she said its goal is not to ""ration"" care but to seek out ways to improve the efficiency of Medicare services, not necessarily cut them. We note that while IMAC has been recommended by the Obama administration, it was not included in any of the House bills so far. It has been discussed as an option by the powerful Senate Finance Committee. Still, we think it's a little premature to suggest this is part of the health care reform plan. And we think claims that IMAC might lead to wholesale rationing are alarmist. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the IMAC proposal and concluded it would save the government $2 billion from 2016–2019. That doesn't sound to us like the CBO expects any kind of dramatic cuts in service. In fact, we think much of the rhetoric from opponents about how the Democrats' health plan would lead to wholesale rationing has been wildly distorted, fanning the flames of public fear that the health care plan would have the government setting dollar limits on how much could be spent in a year to care for a patient, or deciding that some groups of people — older or disabled people, for example — should not get care because it's too expensive for the common good. And so it's understandable that Dean would want to knock down these wild claims. But we think Dean goes too far when he says the bills have ""no rationing,"" because it ignores a hard reality of health care — there is rationing now and there would be rationing in the Democrats' plan too. ""This whole notion of rationing as it applies to a public option, I think, is really ridiculous,"" Stein said. ""It is what insurance is. Right now, Congress and any health care plan 'rations.' No health insurance I know pays for 'whatever it costs.'"" ""Everyone hates the word rationing,"" said   Katherine Baicker,   a health economics professor at Harvard University. ""From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything."" And you can bet people who can't get health insurance due to a pre-existing condition feel like there's already rationing. Ditto for those who can't afford health insurance. Proponents of the health reform plan — which seeks to provide basic coverage to everyone, regardless of whether they have a pre-existing condition — argue that it would clearly reduce that form of rationing. You could spend an unlimited amount on health care that would have some chance of helping people, Baicker said. But we have a limited amount of public resources. And so decisions have to be made about how to prioritize to allocate those resources. The idea, she said, is to provide adequate, basic health care in a public plan. Above that threshold, she said, people with more money could buy extra care. John Holahan, the director of the Urban Institute Health Policy Research Center, said he has not seen anything in any of the plans that will result in explicit rationing, but ""if you define rationing as 'people can't get everything they want,' it's true. But it's also true today.""   Interestingly, he said that Medicare is much less likely to deny a health service than a private insurer. ""That's the argument you hear people making (that the reform bills would lead to government rationing),"" Holahan said. ""But I think they have it backwards."" Even Obama acknowledged the reality of health care rationing in a town hall on health care on Aug. 16: ""When we talk about reform, you hear some opponents of reform saying that somehow we are trying to ration care, or restrict the doctors that you can see, or you name it,"" Obama said. ""Well, that's what's going on right now. It's just that the decisions are being made by the insurance companies.   ""Now, in fairness, we probably could not construct a system in which you could see any doctor anywhere in the world any time, regardless of expense. That would be a hard system to set up. So if you live in Maine, you know, we're going to fly you into California, put you up. I mean, you can see — and I'm not trying to make light of it — you can just see the difficulty.   ""So any system we design, there are going to have to be some choices that have to be made in terms of where you go to see your doctor, what's going on, et cetera. That's being done currently in the private marketplace. All we're trying to do is to make sure that those decisions that are being made in the private marketplace aren't discriminating against people because they're already sick; that they are making sure that people get a good deal from the health care dollars that they are spending."" In other words, rationing is just a fact of life in a world with limited resources. Or as Cato's Cannon puts it: ""Asking if there will be rationing under the Obama plan is like asking if there will be gravity. It is ubiquitous and unavoidable."" We realize some may read our ruling and conclude that we believe the Obama plan will mean more drastic rationing. But we think it's more accurate to say the bill seeks a more rational way to ration. Whether it can succeed is a topic for legitimate debate. The Democrats' health care plan calls for a health care exchange that will be a vigorous marketplace of companies offering different plans that will compete for customers by offering more or less coverage. But each of those choices about coverage — a lower or higher cap on out-of-pocket expenses, perhaps, or more or less generous coverage for doctor visits — are rationing. And the same goes for three-fourths of Americans who would probably keep their current employer-sponsored health insurance. Those plans too have limits and caps — and rationing.

Boehner says study into the effectiveness of medical treatments would be used by government to ration care
","
Many opponents of health care plans being considered by Congress have warned they would lead to government rationing of health care services.
 
To which we say, yes they would. Health care is already rationed. Public and private plans have limited resources, and you can't just get any medical service you want anywhere at any time. That's rationing. It's a reality of health care today and would be under any of the plans being considered in Congress. And so we gave a False to former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean when he said the plans include no rationing.
 
But that's not to say many of the claims of rationing by the Republican opponents are right. In fact, many of them are very misleading, or outright wrong. We've weighed in previously on former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's claim the bill would create ""death panels"" that will decide whether Grandma will get health care.

It wouldn't.

 
Here, we'll deal with another popular claim from Republican opponents of the plan: that government-sponsored research into medical care would be used to ration services. Most recently, the claim was made in a press release on the Web site for House Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Aug. 18, 2009. It states:
 
""The bill would establish a new tax on every health insurance policy to fund a government board that would be tasked with deciding which treatments are more cost-effective,"" the release states. ""The research findings would be used by the government to ration care.""
 
The press release cites the part of the House bill that deals with establishing a Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research within the Agency for Healthcare Research. That's a bureaucratic way of saying the government would do studies to find out which medical treatments and medications work better than others, and which are most cost-effective. The idea is that this would help doctors and patients make better-informed decisions about the most effective treatment strategies. It's also expected to save money over time.
 
A case for it was made on June 12, 2007, by Peter R. Orszag, then director of the Congressional Budget Office but now a member of the Obama administration, in an address to Congress:
 
""Hard evidence is often unavailable about which treatments work best for which patients or whether the added benefits of more-effective but more-expensive services are sufficient to warrant their added costs."" The findings, he said, suggest that better information about the costs and benefits of various treatments could substantially lower health care spending as well as ""yield better health outcomes from the resources devoted to health care.""
 
Some opponents such as

Boehner

have argued that such research will lead to the government telling doctors what kinds of services or medications they can and cannot provide — rationing.
 
Our ruling here may seem something of a paradox because, as we note above,

Boehner

would be right if he said there is rationing now and will be rationing in the future. But in this case, there actually are provisions in the bill about comparative research to make sure it is

not

used for rationing. Language in the House version of the health bill specifically states: ""Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer.""
 
And let's be clear, comparative

effectiveness

research has been done by the government for years and years. The Obama administration wants to greatly expand the amount of research. The economic stimulus package also included more funding for comparative

effectiveness

research. And the bill included a similar disclaimer that it would not mandate insurers to cover or reimburse one treatment or medication over another.
 
""We definitely need more information about how cost-effective certain things are,""

said Katherine Baicker,

a health economics professor at Harvard University. People are understandably nervous that these studies could lead to rationing of certain services, she said, but as a researcher, ""It's hard for me to see how we can make better decisions without better information.""
 
AARP, the leading advocate for seniors, has long been a strong supporter of such research.
 
""It boggles the mind"" said AARP spokesman Jim Dau, how comparative

effectiveness

research has been portrayed by opponents of the health care plan as government rationing of care.
 
""It's just good common sense,"" Dau said of the research. ""It's giving individuals and doctors better evidence-based research so that they can make better decisions.""
 
Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s, is another big advocate of comparative

effectiveness

research. She views it as lobby-free information that can be used to empower patients.
 
Wilensky envisions tiered co-payments based on the clinical appropriateness of various medical treatments. That's not rationing, she said.
 
""As we get more advanced, we'll be able to move toward more precision medicine, where we can authorize even very expensive treatments if we know they are going to work,"" she said.
 
So, for example, she said, if someone with cancer has a biomarkers that indicates they would be likely to respond to the treatment, there would be a lower co-pay.


""We ought to be doing things better,"" Wilensky said. ""We need to spend smarter and treat more effectively,""
 
We think it's reasonable to conclude that some insurers may decide to use the government's research findings to determine what kinds of medical services it will cover, or at least which ones it will cover first. But we think it's a stretch to call giving patients better information about which treatments and drugs are most effective ""rationing."" In fact, given specific language in the bill to the contrary, we think it's outright wrong for

Boehner

to claim the research findings would be used by

the government

to ration care. Our friends at FactCheck.org came to the same conclusion in


an item


that walks through the evolution of comparative

effectiveness

research.
 
So we find

Boehner

's claim that comparative

effectiveness

research findings ""would be used by the government to ration care"" to be False.

Obama says lower obesity rates would save Medicare $1 trillion
","We don't expect President Barack Obama to remember everything we write about him, but when he repeats a claim we had earlier found to be False, we think it's worth calling him out.   On Aug. 20, 2009, President Obama held a discussion and conference call at a national health care forum sponsored by Organizing for America, the successor to Obama for America, his campaign organization. In response to a question about how food and lifestyle affect health care, the president responded, ""Well, this is a great question. Look, this is an interesting statistic. If we went back to the obesity rates that existed back in the 1980s, the Medicare system over several years could save as much as a trillion dollars. I mean, that's how much our obesity rate has made a difference in terms of diabetes and heart failure and all sorts of preventable diseases.""   It wasn't the first time Obama had talked about the cost of obesity. The earlier instance came at a  Des Moines Register  presidential debate among Democratic primary contenders on Dec. 13, 2007. ""Well, just to emphasize how important prevention and cost savings can be in the Medicare system, it's estimated if we went back to the obesity rates that existed in 1980, that would save the Medicare system $1 trillion,"" Obama said.   But there's a problem. When we  reviewed  his claim in 2007, we found it False.   We noted that he was accurately quoting that number from a report issued by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. The report states, ""If we were able to reduce obesity to 1980s levels, Medicare would save $1-trillion."" It attributes the number to the Commonwealth Fund and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   But that study — and his claim — are not supported by the data.   At issue is the increased prevalence of obesity. The percent of the U.S. population considered to be obese has roughly doubled since the 1980s. Researchers have documented that these people need more health care due to complications from obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancers and other illnesses. Researchers have also developed models to calculate costs for obesity-related health care.   And it's true that obesity does drive up health costs, but you can't get to $1 trillion, according to our estimates. (Our friends at Factcheck.org reached the same conclusion; check out their analysis  here  .) The Centers for Disease Control cited a study on health spending due to people who are overweight or obese that shows numbers significantly less than $1 trillion.   We also verified our assessment with Eric Finkelstein, a health economist with the research group RTI International who has studied the issue extensively and written several papers on the topic. Finkelstein said obesity accounts for excess health spending of about $90 billion a year. About half of that — about $45 billion — is billed to Medicare and Medicaid together. Medicare's share of obesity spending therefore is between $20 billion and $25 billion. If obesity rates rolled back to 1980s levels, Medicare spending would be about half that, or about $12 billion a year.   That's a far cry from $1 trillion.   From the perspective of 2009, we can offer two additional developments — and neither improves the accuracy of Obama's assertion.   The first is that Finkelstein and his colleagues published an updated paper on July 27, 2009, in the online version of the journal  Health Affairs.  In it, they said, ""We estimate that the medical costs of obesity could have risen to $147 billion per year by 2008.""   That estimate is about 63 percent higher than it was in the previous paper. So if we increase all of our previous calculations by 63 percent, the number goes up — but not by enough to push the total cost to $1 trillion any time soon. Even the most generous estimate, factoring in inflation and other factors, would mean that $1 trillion would be reached in perhaps 30 years.   And that's where the second new development comes in. Unlike in his comment in 2007, Obama actually gave a time frame the second time he cited the statistic -- specifically, ""over several years."" And 30 years doesn't sound like ""several"" to us.   We contacted Finkelstein to see whether he agreed with our logic, and we reached his co-author on the paper instead. Justin Trogdon, a research economist at RTI International, said he agreed that the increase in the cost burden from obesity, while a substantial jump in a relatively short time, did not get Obama much closer to the mark. ""It's a little higher today, but I don't think it's increased enough to get there,"" he said. ""It would be tough to get to $1 trillion.""   Medical research supports Obama's broad point that obesity is a serious health issue that imposes significant financial, as well as physical, costs on the American public. However, obesity doesn't cost anywhere near as much as the president has said it does. Once again, we rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2009/aug/24/barack-obama/obama-says-lower-obesity-rates-would-save-medicare/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Dick Armey']","
 Dick Armey's claim about Medicare and Social Security is only partially true
","
To demonstrate how much control the government already has over our health care system, former House Republican Leader Dick Armey made this comment about Medicare on a recent episode of the

NewsHour with Jim Lehrer

:

 

Senior citizens ""see this as a hostile government takeover of all health care, where they will be forced into a government-run program, and their health care lives will be managed by the government, just as today's the case in Medicare,"" Armey, currently chair of FreedomWorks, a conservative activist group, said on the Aug. 13, 2009, episode. ""If you're over 65 years old in America today, you have no choice but to be in Medicare. Even if you want out of Medicare, you have to forfeit your Social Security to get out of it.""

 

We wondered if the rules for Medicare were are rigid as Armey described, and, as usual with government programs, we found it's more complicated than we expected.


First, we wanted to find out how Medicare enrollment works. According to the Social Security Web site, anyone who files for Social Security benefits at the age of 62 is automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A and B — coverage for hospital and doctor's visits, respectively — at the age of 65. Patients must enroll independently for private coverage or prescription drug benefits.

 

In some cases, people never sign up for retirement benefits and therefore they must enroll in Medicare on their own, said Dorothy Clark, spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration.

 

Either way, ""Medicare is a voluntary program,"" said Clark. No one is ever required to sign up for government health benefits, nor are they required to keep them.

 

Nevertheless, Armey is right that beneficiaries collecting Social Security will lose those payments if they drop Medicare Part A — so long as they were enrolled in both programs in the first place, Clark said.

 

We were curious why Social Security and Medicare are linked, and when we asked, we found that the issue is the matter of a lawsuit that was brought against the Social Security Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services in 2008. Among the plaintiffs is none other than Dick Armey. The plaintiffs argue that, under the Medicare Act signed in 1965 and under the Social Security Act, there are no rules requiring enrollment in Medicare Part A to receive retirement benefits. Rather, a series of subsequent policy statements have linked the two programs, which are illegal because the two departments did not follow the traditional procedure to write the new rules, according to a press release issued by the plaintiffs on Oct. 9, 2008. The policy essentially traps retirees into participating.

 

We asked the plaintiff's lawyer, Kent Masterson Brown, why the government had done this and he had a simple answer: power.

 

""That's the curiosity here,"" Brown said. ""[The departments] want to control every body.""

 

It turns out the

NewsHour

got a few viewer inquires angry that host Judy Woodruff did not do enough to challenge Armey on that point, according to Michael Getler, PBS ombudsman. Instead, Woodruff asked the other guest, Richard Kirsch with the liberal advocacy group Health Care for America Now, to challenge Armey's claim, but he didn't offer a specific rebuttal, leaving Armey's claim up in the air.

 

So, back to Armey's claim. He's wrong that Medicare is required for everyone over the age of 65, but he's correct that those who want out of the program will lose their Social Security benefits as well. To us, that's a clear-cut Half True.

Alleged Obama birth certificate from Kenya is a hoax
","
With all this health care debate dominating our time for the last few weeks, can we please get back to the issues that matter? Like, what's up with Obama's Kenyan birth certificate? 
Birthers, the folks who question whether Obama was born in Hawaii and is eligible to serve as president, experienced a bit of a second wind there for a little while in late July as cable TV and radio programs were abuzz over a group of Republican legislators who endorsed a bill that would require future presidential candidates to submit birth certificates to prove their citizenship. 
Then the health care debate began in earnest, and the birthers were again relegated to the backburner. Right before the media light dimmed on birthers, however, birther attorney Orly Taitz made a bit of a splash — at least in the birther community — when she posted a  birth certificate purported to be for Obama from the Republic of Kenya  and filed a motion in federal court to determine its authenticity. 
The conservative WorldNetDaily.com, which has long beaten the birther drum, quickly ran a story under the headline,  ""Is this really smoking gun of Obama's Kenyan birth?""  
But even WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah later ran  a column  saying he doubted it was real. 
Still, some PolitiFact readers asked about it, and so we decided to check it out. 
We e-mailed the purported Kenyan birth certificate to Salim Lone, spokesman for Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, to see what he thought.

Here was his three-sentence reply: ""It's a forgery. Kenya only became a Republic in December, 1964. Other arguments could also be marshaled, but they are not needed."" 
Then came a crushing blow. An astute blogger, Steve Eddy of California, did a Google image search and came across an eerily  similar-looking birth certificate  posted on a genealogy Web site by a South Australia man named David Jeffrey Bomford. Eddy put it side-by-side with the Obama one. Same format. Same book and page number in the birth registry. Some of the officials' last names were even the same. 
""At that point, it was pretty obvious the Kenyan one was a fake, that someone had used this real one from Australia to make their version,"" Eddy told us. 
Eddy posted his finding on the Web, in a forum at  Politijab.com  . 
An  ABC News affiliate in Australia  got wind of it, tracked down David Jeffrey Bomford and broke the news to him about his newfound Web fame. 
""That is ridiculous,"" said Bomford, a 50-year-old public service clerk from Adelaide, Australia. ""Little old person in Adelaide, the president of the United States. I don't know whether to laugh about it or not, be worried about it."" 
Bomford said he certainly didn't have anything to do with it. 
""It's little old me and my mum and everything else up there,"" Bomford said. ""Oh I definitely confirm that the birth certificate was mine. That was quite easy to see — my address, even the style of the birth certificate was an old South Australian one. So it's quite easy to identify that it's mine.""

And what of the Kenyan birth certificate? 
""It's definitely a copy of my certificate,"" Bomford said. ""It's so laughable it's ridiculous."" 
Orly Taitz wasn't backing off so quickly, though. On her Web site, she suggested the South Australia birth certificate was more likely the fake, altered from the Obama one from Kenya to discredit the birthers. 
Said Eddy: ""There's no reasoning with some of these people."" 
But just to be sure, we fired off an e-mail to South Australian officials to see if they could set things straight. 
We heard nothing. Until yesterday. (This is our sheepish explanation for why we are dropping a birther item into the middle of the health care debate.) 
We got an e-mail response from Val Edyvean, Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages for South Australia, in which she said this: 
""It appears that a South Australian loaded an image of his own birth certificate onto a family history website and that the format was used by others to 'create' a document which purported to be a Kenyan birth certificate for Barack Obama. As the South Australian man has now removed this image, and the date of his birth is in the period of certificates which are restricted from public access, I do not intend to add to speculation by commenting on details of either that certificate or any aspects of it."" 
Ms. Edyvean also made it clear she didn't want any follow-up questions. ""I now advise that I am not prepared to comment further nor otherwise to enter into further correspondence on this matter,"" she wrote. Fair enough. 
We think that's enough to definitively put this particular issue to rest. The purported Kenyan birth certificate posted by Taitz is a fake. 
As always, we have no delusions this changes anyone's mind in the birther movement. So please, spare us the vitriolic e-mails. At PolitiFact, we have explored several of the birthers' claims, and have concluded that there is ample evidence that President Obama was born in Hawaii. We simply post this item in case anyone came across the Kenyan birth certificate on the Internet and wondered what to make of it.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Orrin Hatch']","
Who are the uninsured? Hatch's take.
","
During a recent interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News, Sen. Orrin Hatch made the argument that the American health care system works well for most people.
 
""You know, why would we throw out a system that 85 percent of Americans have and basically approve of and exchange it for 47 million people?"" asked Hatch, a Republican from Utah, referring to a frequently cited estimate of the number of uninsured in the United States.
 
""By the way, of that 47 million people, when you deduct the ones who could have insurance through their employers but don't, you deduct the 11 million that basically qualify for CHIP or Medicaid but don't realize it (and) are not enrolled, you deduct those who are over $75,000 a year in income but just won't purchase their own health insurance, and then 6 million people who are illegal aliens, my gosh, when you put that all together, it leaves about 15 million people. So we're going to throw out a system that works for 15 million people.""
 
We were interested in analyzing Hatch's numbers for accuracy. When you subtract out all those groups, do you end up with only 15 million people?
 
The basis for Hatch's statement is a chart created by the Republican Policy Committee, his staff told us. Hatch handles things a little differently from the chart: He adds 1 million to the number who qualify for Medicaid and SCHIP, and he doesn't mention legal immigrants, the way the chart does. But the numbers as he uses them add up.
 
But let's take a closer look at the chart to see how it arrived at its conclusion.
 
We asked the Republican Policy Committee for its supporting materials, and a lot of it is based on data from the U.S. Census, which conducts annual, large-scale surveys on income, poverty and health insurance coverage. Other data is based on research published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source for nonpartisan information on health care policy.
 
But the way the data is used raises questions. The biggest problem is that there's almost certainly some overlap between the different groups. How much overlap? Unfortunately, there's no way to tell.
 
For clarity's sake, we're going review the different data points.
 
The Republican analysis uses data from 2006, which is a year earlier than the most recent data. That year, the census found that 47 million were uninsured and that 10.2 million of them were noncitizens. Estimates from reputable sources indicate that roughly 6 million of those are illegal immigrants. So far, so good. (We examined Census data on

the uninsured and estimates for illegal immigrants

in a previous item, if you'd like to read a more in-depth analysis of this point.)
 
The next number on the chart is households that earn more than $75,000 a year. Keep in mind this number represents household income, so it counts people who live in roomate situations, too, for example. But the number is right: The census does show that 9.3 million uninsured people live in households with income more than $75,000 a year.
 
The next two categories come from outside the census, from research published by the Kaiser Foundation. The chart says that 10 million people are eligible for a government program like Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Fund, known as SCHIP or just CHIP. And it says 6 million people could get insurance through their employers but choose not to. The numbers are roughly correct, but these analyses were based on 2004 data, not the 2006 data.
 
If you subtract each group separately from the total of 47 million, you get to 12 million. The chart seems to account for that, by saying it's 12 to 15 million who are insured. But there's no way to know if 3 million is a proper way to account for people who fall into multiple categories.
 
Take for example a legal immigrant who comes to the United States to work at a high-paying job. News reports have mentioned that many of these immigrants are young people who come to work in the technology sector or the financial industry. A person like that who chose not to buy insurance through an employer would be subtracted three times here: Once as a legal immigrant, once as someone making more than $75,000 and once as someone who declined to get employer insurance.
 
As another example, generally speaking, most illegal immigrants are not eligible for federal benefit programs. But there are exceptions. Some state governments have chosen to cover illegal immigrants, especially children, through programs affiliated with Medicaid and CHIP. So there may be duplication between the category of illegal immigrants and people eligible for Medicaid and/or CHIP. How many people? We don't know, and we couldn't find any analysis that could answer that question.
 
The $75,000 number also poses questions. Remember, this is the total income for an entire household. We can envision scenarios where that number represents people living in the same household but each making a lower income, and they may not be able to afford insurance individually. But again it's hard to know.
 
So we find that the individual numbers that Hatch uses are accurate or in the ballpark. Our concerns are with the methodology used to come up with his bottom line. It relies on a hodgepodge of different years and sources and leaves open the possibility that some people are double- or triple-counted. It would not pass muster in an undergraduate statistics class. So we find his statement is Half True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Bill Pascrell']","
Pascrell says up to 22,000 Americans die yearly because they don’t have health insurance
","

On July 30, 2009, PolitiFact rated as True a statement by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey that ""as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance."" We based that ruling on the same study that Pascrell did. Subsequently, a reader pointed out a paper published last spring in the online edition of the journal HSR: Health Services Research that contradicts the study Pascrell relied on. So we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis.

 
Much of the push for reforming the nation's health care system has been driven by concerns about uninsured Americans. So it's no surprise that a statistic on the number of Americans who die every year due to lack of health insurance has been used frequently in speeches and opinion columns. However, this statistic, which stems from a report by an influential, quasi-governmental institution, is quietly coming under academic attack.
 
When Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said on July 30 that ""as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance,"" the number he cited was an updated version of one originally calculated by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine. In 2002, an IOM panel of more than a dozen medical specialists estimated that 18,000 Americans died in 2000 because they were uninsured. They came up with this figure by looking at long-term studies that measured the links between insurance status and death rates. The IOM then used annual statistics on insurance rates and deaths to determine an estimate of extra deaths attributable to the lack of insurance.


In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM's study with newer data. Replicating the Institute of Medicine's methodology, Dorn concluded that the 18,000 figure should be increased to 22,000 — the figure later cited by Pascrell. Given the Institute of Medicine's prestige and Pascrell's caution in saying that ""as many as"" 22,000 Americans die annually from a lack of insurance, which signaled some uncertainty about the exact number, we gave the congressman a True rating.


But a more recent paper raises questions about the IOM's conclusions.


The paper, published online in April in HSR: Health Services Research, is by Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine. Using data on adult health and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is a part of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kronick concludes that the Institute of Medicine's estimate (or any that replicates its methodology, such as Dorn's) is ""almost certainly incorrect.""


Pascrell's office was not aware of the paper when he made his statement and we did not find it when we researched his claim.


The most notable difference between the Institute of Medicine's data — which were drawn from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey as well as the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey — is that Kronick adjusted it for a number of demographic and health factors, such as status as a smoker and body mass index. When he did that, ""the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance."" In other words, once you compare death rates in an apples-to-apples fashion — comparing insured smokers to uninsured smokers, for instance — the likelihood of dying evens out. This, in turn, would mean that IOM's estimate of 18,000 deaths would drop essentially to zero.


In his paper, Kronick acknowledges that this is a ""counterintuitive"" result, possibly resulting from the safety net of public hospitals and community clinics providing ""'good enough' access to care for the uninsured to keep their mortality rate similar to that of the insured.""


Either way, he writes, ""there would not be much change in the number of deaths in the United States as a result of universal coverage, although the difficulties of inferring causality from observational analyses temper the strength of this conclusion.""


We ran Kronick's paper by a number of health care policy experts to see whether they thought it undercut the Institute of Medicine's death estimate. Everyone agreed that both Kronick personally and the journal that published him are credible. Because the significance of his finding could also have political consequences — on June 24, for instance, John Goodman, president of the conservative National Center for Policy Analysis, testified to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health that we ""do not know how much morbidity and mortality is attributable to lack of health insurance"" — we also wanted to determine whether there may be any ideological bias at work. But we found no evidence of it.


In fact, far from having ties to the conservative movement, Kronick served as a senior health care policy adviser in the Clinton administration, where, according to his biography, he contributed to the development of the Clinton health care reform proposal. Kronick's articles have appeared in the

New England Journal of Medicine

and the

Journal of the American Medical Association

, and his work has at times been funded by the Commonwealth Fund, whose mission is ""to promote a high-performing health care system"" that aids ""society's most vulnerable,"" including ""the uninsured.""


Kronick even told PolitiFact that his finding was ""not the answer I wanted"" and, as a result, he agonized over whether to publish it or not. He said he's ""grateful"" that it has so far been unnoticed in the increasingly hostile debate over health care. ""I don't have a whole lot of friends, and will probably lose a few over this,"" he told us. ""And I might make some friends I didn't want.""


But a number of experts we spoke to are glad that Kronick did publish it. Henry Aaron, a health policy specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that he was impressed by Kronick's research from the time Kronick presented an early draft of it at a Brookings lunch seminar. ""I found his reasoning compelling,"" said Aaron, himself a member of the Institute of Medicine. ""In fact, after listening to his presentation, I had a hard time believing that the IOM had done what they had done.""


In interviews, Aaron and other health care scholars agreed with Kronick that uninsured and insured Americans differ in many ways other than their insurance status. ""To estimate the impact of the lack of insurance on mortality rates, one has to control statistically for all of those differences,"" Aaron said. That, he added, is exactly what Kronick has sought to do so.


Robert Book, a senior research fellow in health economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, agrees with Aaron. ""I would be more inclined to believe Kronick's than other studies,"" he said, ""I'm just surprised the IOM did their study without controlling for other factors.""


Book also praised Kronick’s decision to run calculations with numerous alternative models, and to remove various factors, one at a time, from the calculations. ""From the standpoint of a careful econometric study, Kronick’s paper is excellent,"" Book said. ""I’ve seen few papers that are this thorough in terms of seeking alternate explanations for their conclusions.""
 
Other health policy specialists we talked to were open to the idea of Kronick being right, while urging caution before overruling the Institute of Medicine estimate.
 
Dorn, the Urban Institute researcher, pointed to a second study published by the Institute of Medicine on Feb. 24, 2009. This 268-page volume, America's Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care, provides a detailed analysis of subsequent studies on the topic. While it didn’t provide a new estimate of extra deaths from uninsurance, the new Institute of Medicine study concluded that ""the body of evidence on the health consequences of health insurance is stronger than ever before.""


Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund and an Institute of Medicine member, said that the existence of Kronick's study ""doesn't convince me yet not to use the IOM study,"" but she added that ""if I saw a few more, I might be convinced. I tend to believe things when I see multiple studies using different databases and methodologies come to the same conclusion."" (Aaron said he agreed with Davis on this point.)
 
For the record, an IOM spokeswoman said the institute has not assessed Kronick's paper and thus had no comment on its assertions.


On one key point, the Institute of Medicine and Kronick actually aren't that far apart. Kronick said he doesn't doubt that individuals' health suffers when they're uninsured — he just hasn't found evidence that they die sooner. ""No one would choose not to have insurance if they could afford it,"" Kronick said. ""There's no benefit to having 47 million Americans uninsured.""


When we asked Pascrell’s office whether the Kronick study would change their view, spokesman Paul Brubaker said it would not.


""The point of the congressman’s statistic is to show a direct correlation between one’s ability to pay and the ability to have insurance, and therefore on their ability to be healthy,” Brubaker said.


But for us, Kronick’s study raises questions about the reliability of the Institute of Medicine’s death estimate. We acknowledge that there is not yet a consensus among the experts. But in re-evaluating Pascrell's claim, we can no longer rate it True. We recognize that the Institute of Medicine is still widely respected, but an ideologically diverse group of experts is giving credence to Kronick's findings. That leaves us with something of a split decision, and so we downgrade our rating to Half True.

On the Aug. 19, 2009,

Rachel Maddow Show

on MSNBC, Sanders responded to a question about corporate interests' role in the health care reform debate by saying, ""We spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation on Earth. And there is a reason why the insurance companies, year after year, make huge profits and pay their CEOs tens and tens of millions of dollars in compensation salaries. And the reason for that is that these guys exert enormous influence over the political process in Washington.""


With this item, we'll address his international comparisons on health spending.


We looked at two widely used sources of international health care comparisons — statistics from the World Health Organization, the public health arm of the United Nations, and from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that represents 30 wealthier, industrialized countries, most of them in Europe and North America. We also confirmed with three international health care experts that these were the best statistics available.


According to the 2009 edition of WHO's

World Health Statistics

report, which uses figures from 2006, health care spending in the United States — both public- and private-sector — amounted to $6,719 per capita. Ranking next were Luxembourg and Monaco at $6,506 and $6,353 per capita, respectively. All told, either 11 or 15 countries told the WHO they spent more than $3,360 per capita, the point at which the United States no longer doubles their spending. (We provide two possible figures here because the WHO offers both raw figures and statistics adjusted for currency valuations.) The other nations that rank near the top with the United States include Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, in addition to tiny Malta and San Marino.


The OECD's numbers tell a similar story. In 2007, the OECD said that the United States spent $7,290 per capita on health care, ranking it first among the 30 countries studied. Five other nations spent more than $3,645 per capita, the point at which the United States no longer doubles their spending. The highest is the Netherlands at $4,417. The other four were Austria, Canada, Norway and Switzerland.


Sanders would have been on completely firm ground had he simply said, ""We spend

more

per capita on health care than any other nation on Earth."" But instead he said ""twice as much."" And for that reason we rate his statement False.

Groups claim overwhelming support for the public option
","
A Web site called ""We Want the Public Option"" includes this headline at the top of the home page:


""76% of Americans Say We Want the Public Option.""


The Web site also includes a video that has no voice-over, just a list of signatures supporting a public option in the health care reform plan, plus a smattering of statistics about reform. The signatures were collected by the two liberal groups —

Democracy for America

and the

Progressive Change Campaign Committee

— that paid for the ad.


The ad aired for the first time on July 23, 2009, in Washington, D.C., and Montana. It's no longer on the air, but the video remains prominent on the Web site. The video opens with this claim:

 

""76% of Americans support President Obama's public health insurance option.""

 

That number seemed high to us, especially in the light of recent polls, so we decided to check it.


The statistic comes from a poll conducted June 12-15 by NBC News and the

Wall Street Journal

that asked, ""In any health care proposal, how important do you feel it is to give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance — extremely important, quite important, not that important, or not at all important?""

 

About 41 percent of respondents said it was extremely important, and about 35 percent said it was quite important. Add those numbers together, and you get 76 percent.

 

But in the health care debate, June was a long time ago.

 

Since that poll was published, rowdy town hall meetings and a barrage of criticism have made Americans more skeptical of health care reform. The public option has become less popular as well; several surveys done since that first NBC/

Wall Street Journal

poll indicate declining support for a public plan. Here are just a few examples:

 

    •

The Kaiser Family Foundation

, a health care think tank, polled 1,205 people July 7-14 and found that 59 percent of people questioned would favor ""a government-administered public health insurance option similar to Medicare to compete with private health insurance plans"" and that 36 percent would oppose the idea.

    • A

second

NBC/

Wall Street Journal

poll done July 24-27 asked 1,011 people whether they ""would favor or oppose creating a public health care plan administered by the federal government that would compete directly with private health insurance companies."" Forty-six percent said they would favor the plan while 44 percent said they opposed the idea. The two news organizations asked the same question to 805 people between Aug. 15-17 and

found

that 43 percent favor a public option and 47 percent who oppose it. Both statistics fall within the three-point margin of error of the July poll.

    •

A New York Times/CBS poll

of 1,050 people between July 24-28 asked whether they would ""favor or oppose the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan — something like the Medicare coverage that people 65 and older get — that would compete with private health insurance plans."" Around 66 percent favored the idea and 27 percent opposed it.

    • From July 27-Aug. 3,

Quinnipiac University asked

2,409 voters whether they ""support or oppose giving people the option of being covered by a government health insurance plan that would compete with private plans."" Around 62 percent were in support and 32 percent were opposed. That's down from a July 1 Qunnipiac survey in which 69 percent supported the public option and 26 percent opposed it.

 

House Democratic leaders and the group Health Care for America Now, which is supporting the Democratic plan, say the July and August NBC/

Wall Street Journal

polls are misleading because they changed the framing of the question. Instead of asking if the choice of a public plan was important, they simply asked whether respondents were in favor of a public plan.

 

""These polls are not comparable,"" the group wrote in it blog. ""The first poll (June) accurately framed the question — should people be able to choose a public health insurance option. The second poll (July and August) pushed them towards an answer by leaving out the essential question of choice and asking a yes or no question.""
 
Regardless, these numbers are all over the map, and the only thing we can say with certainty is that they are each well below the 76 percent figure cited by Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

 

We also wondered whether the two groups accurately characterized the original NBC/

Wall Street Journal

poll in the first place, and we got a mixed response.

 

""It's fine to add those two numbers together,"" said Karlyn Bowman, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ""But [respondents] were responding to a question about choice, not necessarily the idea of a public plan,"" she said.

 

Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Mellman Group, said that the ad does a ""fair reading of the question. Basically, you have 76 percent in favor of a choice.""

 

Humphrey Taylor, chairman the Harris Poll, Harris Interactive, agrees that the group characterized the two-month-old poll results correctly, but that ""it's a mistake to say that large numbers of people support the public plan, because they don't understand what it would do,"" Taylor said, noting that ""most people don't have an opinion until they are asked.""

 

Language often skews opinion polls, Taylor said. When it comes to the public plan, supporters often call it the ""public option"" while opponents call it a ""government-run plan,"" so the Harris Poll tried to bridge that gap during a survey of 2,276 people between July 9-13. Respondents were asked whether they supported a ""public, or government-sponsored, health plan,"" and the group found that 52 percent were in favor while 30 percent opposed the idea.
 
That brings us back to the ad's original claim that 76 percent favor the public plan. That's a classic case of cherry-picking where they have found the highest number possible. They've also relied on a poll with wording that might lead people to think they were being asked if they favor choice in picking their health plan rather than whether they support a government-run option. Most of the other polls show support, but not nearly the landslide as the June poll.
 
What's more, they continue to display the ad on their Web site even though the poll is sorely out of date and eclipsed by more recent and more precisely worded surveys. By most accounts, there's slightly more support for the public plan than there is opposition, but that support has dwindled throughout the summer. As a result, we give the Progressive Change Campaign Committee a False.

At 59, GOP congressman says he couldn't get a hip replacement in Canada or England
","Critics of President Barack Obama's health care plan have often cited problems with government-run health care in Canada and Britain to make a point that there could be long lines or inadequate care under the Democratic plan.

During a meeting with with reporters and editors at the St. Louis  Post-Dispatch  in early August 2009, Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he was living proof of the drawbacks of the Canadian and British systems.

""I'm 59. In either Canada or Great Britain, if I broke my hip, I couldn't get it replaced,"" he told them, asserting that he was too old to be eligible for the expensive surgery. Our friends at the  Post-Dispatch  checked the assertion and found it to be false. We did our own fact-checking and verified their work.

In an Aug. 16 editorial challenging Blunt's assertion, the newspaper wrote that ""at least 63 percent of hip replacements performed in Canada last year and two-thirds of those done in England were on patients age 65 or older. More than 1,200 in Canada were done on people older than 85.""

Let's take those numbers individually.

On the question of Canadian hip replacements, the  Post-Dispatch  cited a report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information, which describes itself as ""an independent, not-for-profit organization that provides essential data and analysis on Canada’s health system and the health of Canadians."" The report draws on information from several databases, including nationwide figures on medical procedures undertaken in hospitals. Using those statistics, it found that in all of Canada (except for the province of Quebec, for which information was unavailable), 63 percent of all hip replacements in 2006-2007 were performed on patients 65 and older. So Blunt was wrong, and the newspaper was right.

As for the the number of Canadian hip replacements for the 85-and-older demographic, the newspaper actually underestimated how many there were. The number for 2006-2007, according to the same report, was 1,577.

Just to make sure these numbers were valid, we checked with Shirley Chen, a senior analyst at the Canadian Joint Replacement Registry, a project of CIHI and orthopedic surgeons in Canada that collects statistics on hip and knee joint replacements. She confirmed the numbers reported here.

For Britain, the  Post-Dispatch  got its figures from a 2000 report by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, a group that determines whether particular treatments are covered by the British National Health Service. The report said that ""the over 65-year age group accounts for two in every three"" hip replacements.

When we called Britain's National Health Service's Information Center for Health and Social Care — the NHS's hub for medical statistics — they provided new numbers showing that 87 percent of hip replacements were performed on people age 60 or over. That's a different age bracket than what the newspaper used, but it still means Blunt was wrong.

Blunt acknowledged his mistake to the  Post-Dispatch  and promised to do better. ""I'm glad you pointed that out to me,"" he told the newspaper. ""I won’t use that example any more."" He blamed the bad information on testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, given by ""some people who are supposed to be experts on Canadian health care."" We looked through past congressional testimony using both  Congressional Quarterly  and Google but we couldn't find a reference that fit the description. Blunt's office did not respond to our request for an explanation.

Unlike others who have been caught in falsehoods in the health care debate, it's notable that Blunt has acknowledged his mistake and said he was sorry. But still, he was wrong about both countries and would be eligible for hip replacements for many years to come. Public officials have a duty not to get things wrong, especially when it has the potential to frighten people. (You may recall we gave Vice President Joe Biden a  Pants on Fire  for saying during the swine flu scare that when you sneeze, it travels through the whole plane.) Likewise, this claim could scare many senior citizens. So we have to set the meter ablaze and give Blunt a Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2009/aug/19/roy-blunt/59-gop-congressman-says-he-couldnt-get-hip/

Number of those without health insurance about 46 million
","
It's a statistic often quoted by Democrats during the health care debate: 46 million people without health insurance.
 
""Now, health insurance reform is one of those pillars that we need to build up that new foundation,"" said President Barack Obama at a town hall in New Hampshire. ""I don't have to explain to you that nearly 46 million Americans don't have health insurance coverage today. In the wealthiest nation on Earth, 46 million of our fellow citizens have no coverage. They are just vulnerable. If something happens, they go bankrupt, or they don't get the care they need.""
 
The number is important because of the big dollars involved in the health care bill. If the number of uninsured is significantly higher or lower, it could have a major impact on the cost.
 
That 46 million number — which to be exact, is actually 45.7 million — comes from the U.S. Census Bureau, which releases estimates of the uninsured yearly. That estimate is for 2007, and the data were released in 2008. (The 2008 data are scheduled for release on Sept. 10, 2009.)
 
The Census Bureau is not the only government agency that collects numbers on the uninsured, but it is often cited because it has the biggest sample, contacting about 97,500 households to ask about their insurance and other factors.
 
The Census Bureau calls these people each spring, and it asks if they were insured at any time during the previous year. They run through a

list of questions

of all the ways people could have been covered to make sure. If a person had insurance for even one day during the year, they are not counted as uninsured.
 
That seems like a nice, conservative way to measure, but the census number still has a few critics. Researchers have noticed that the census numbers tend to be a bit higher than some of the other government surveys collected for similar time periods. For example, in 2007, a survey from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found the full-year uninsured population to be 40 million, not 45.7 million.
 
The researchers have a suspicion about the reason for the difference: people's bad memories. The Census Bureau calls people and asks them to think back during the past year as to whether they were insured or not. The other survey calls the people back every few months and ask if they're insured at that moment.
 
Looking back to Obama's statement, though, he said nearly 46 million Americans don't have insurance. Actually, the census data include noncitizens. The Census Bureau breaks out that information and reports that 9.7 million of the uninsured are noncitizens. So the number of Americans without insurance is actually closer to 36 million.
 
 While we're on this topic, we wanted to also report what we've learned about a popular question from readers: How many of the uninsured are illegal immigrants?
 
None of the government agencies that we're aware of asks people about insurance

and

about whether they are in the United States legally. The census survey does not ask whether people are in the United States legally or not.
 
Since the government doesn't provide data on uninsured illegal immigrants, we turned to the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization that seeks to ""improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation."" The center does not take positions on policy issues.
 
Jeffrey Passell is the center's senior demographer, and he's used the census data to calculate estimates of illegal immigrants for Pew. He told us that Pew's data indicate that 11.9 million illegal immigrants were in the United States in 2007. About 6.8 million of them did not have health insurance.
 
Pew's model assumed that illegal immigrants are slightly undercounted by the Census Bureau, so the total number of uninsured in the country would be slightly higher than the official census number. The model supposes a total of 46.3 million uninsured, so illegal immigrants would represent close to 15 percent of those without insurance.
 
There are other complicating factors to consider: The children of illegal immigrants born in this country are citizens, and Pew estimates that of those, 1 million are uninsured.
 
Getting back to Obama's statement, he said, ""Nearly 46 million Americans don't have health insurance coverage today."" That is the most recent number for the U.S. Census available, but he messes it up in one way that would tend to overcount the uninsured and in another way that would tend to undercount them.
 
It's an overcount because it counts noncitizens. Take out the 9.7 million noncitizens and the actual number is closer to 36 million.
 
It's an undercount because it's old data from when the economy was doing much better, and it was for people who were uninsured for a whole year. If you wanted to look at numbers just for ""today,"" the number would likely be higher, but by how much we can't say. (The Department of Health and Human Services survey found that there were 57.7 million uninsured at some point during the first half of 2008, but we couldn't find a breakout for noncitizens.)
 
So Obama is sloppy by saying it is for ""Americans"" but not accounting for the noncitizens, which leaves him off by about 22 percent. Yet it's likely his error is counterbalanced to some extent by the large number of people who have lost insurance during the recession. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'J. James Rohack']","
AMA president says pregnant women are barred from buying individual health policies
","
You've probably heard of ""pre-existing conditions,"" which provide an escape clause for health insurance companies. If you have a pre-existing condition, an insurance company typically won't pay for treatment.


J. James Rohack, president of the American Medical Association, cited them when he was asked during an appearance on

Fox News Sunday

on Aug. 16, 2009, whether the Democratic health plan would lead to rationing for older patients.
 
""Well, there's a myth that rationing doesn't occur right now,"" Rohack said. ""In the United States, if a woman's pregnant and on the individual market (and) tries to get health insurance, that's called a pre-existing condition and it's not paid for. That's why this bill's important. It gets rid of some of the rationing that's occurring right now."" The AMA endorsed the House version of health care reform legislation in July.


First, we should emphasize that he's only talking about the relatively small number of women who buy their coverage through what insurers call the individual market. About two-thirds of women have health insurance through their employer or their spouse's employer, and about 13 percent have public coverage such as Medicaid or military health care.


So the people affected by these limitations include the 19 percent now uninsured and the 6 percent that have coverage purchased on the individual market. These policies are sold directly to an individual by a private insurer, and the purchaser doesn't get the same consumer protections routinely given to those who have coverage through an employer. For example, people in employer-based health plans have benefited from requirements for maternity coverage that date back to the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. But individual plans are not included under that umbrella and are regulated state by state.


In 39 states, listed

here

, insurers can turn down anyone for virtually any reason. It can be because you have a pre-existing condition, like cancer or diabetes. And pregnancy almost always counts too, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents the state government officials who regulate insurance sold within their borders. So if you're pregnant and living in one of these 39 states, you're very likely out of luck in securing individual health coverage. You'll have to pay for your care out of your own pocket or seek out charitable assistance.


And the coverage isn't much better in the remaining 11 states. These states have ""guaranteed issue"" laws that say insurers cannot turn applicants down based on their health or risk status. But there's a caveat: Even if an insurer must offer you a plan, it can place exclusions on what the plan covers. Typically, the NAIC says, these exclusions last from six to 12 months, which rules out most or all maternity coverage. (After the exclusion expires, the insurer does have to cover those conditions, meaning that a subsequent pregnancy could be covered.)


One category of individual policyholders has it slightly better ? those who leave an employer's plan that had given them uninterrupted coverage for the pre-existing condition in question. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, people in this category can obtain a plan that covers their pre-existing condition once they have exhausted their old employer's coverage under the law known as COBRA. However, a state only has to provide a minimum of one ""HIPAA plan"" within its borders, rather than requiring that every insurer operating in the state offer one. Such plans may have unfavorable terms and high premiums.


So back to Rohack's claim. Health care reform

legislation

now under consideration in Congress would, if enacted, improve the situation for pregnant women seeking health insurance by prohibiting restrictions based on pre-existing conditions. But for now, Rohack is correct that pregnancy is considered a pre-existing condition and prevents many women from getting coverage if they seek insurance on the individual market. We find his statement True.

Rachel Maddow says Republicans Chuck Grassley, John Boehner and John Mica flip-flopped on end-of-life counseling
","We've had to set the Truth-O-Meter on fire in the past several weeks because of the ridiculously false claims about end-of-life counseling in the health care reform bill.

So it looked like a real gotcha when bloggers dug up what appeared to be hypocrisy – that a number of Republicans who have recently harrumphed about end-of-life consultations in the health care bill had voted for something similar in the 2003 Medicare drug bill.

This was MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s take on this discovery:

""As we have reported recently, many Republican officials have enthusiastically embraced the conspiracy theory that health care reform is a secret plot to kill old people,"" Maddow told viewers.

""Health reform really isn‘t really a secret plot to kill old people. The part of the House bill that is cited by the conspiracists to supposedly prove their point actually says that Medicare will cover consultations about living wills, advanced directives — if patients want to talk to their own doctors about what they want to happen at the end of their own life. That's it.

""But that hasn‘t stopped people like Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on health care in the Senate, who said, quote, 'We should not have a government program that determines if you‘re going to pull the plug on grandma.' Then there was House Minority Leader John Boehner who said, quote, 'This provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.' And putting the exclamation point on ridiculous — Florida Rep. John Mica, who said, quote, 'There are death counselors.  There is authorization for reimbursement for those counselors for Medicare. You have a whole new cottage industry.'

""Well, as Amy Sullivan reports on  Time  magazine's 'Swampland' blog today, Sen. Grassley and Congressman Boehner and John Mica have another thing in common in addition to being 'deathers.' They all also voted for the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug Bill. That bill in part provided funding for end-of-life counseling. And I quote, 'Counseling the beneficiary with respect to end-of-life issues and care options and advising the beneficiary regarding advanced care planning.' Or as these things are now known in Republican circles, death panels.

""In all, 204 Republicans in the House and 42 Republicans in the Senate voted for the death panels.  And there was not a peep about then-President Bush having a secret plan to kill old people.

""Bottom line? Either Republicans like Chuck Grassley and John Boehner and John Mica have totally changed their minds about whether living wills are really a secret plot to kill old people or they voted for something just a few years ago that they actually thought was a secret plot to kill old people. Take your choice.""

Maddow (unlike her cited source, Sullivan) glossed over an important difference in the language of the two bills. The 2003 bill applied to terminally ill patients, including those in hospices, whereas the 2009 bill applies to Medicare recipients — that is, everyone over 65.

The current bill would reach many more Americans than the 2003 language did — all healthy seniors nationwide, rather than just those who are terminally ill. The current bill would allow consultations every five years — something that, almost by definition, cannot happen in a hospice setting, where stays are often two months or less. It would shift the time frame for discussing these issues to years before someone falls seriously ill.

We turned to independent experts to see whether they thought the bills were significantly different, as Boehner’s staff suggested to us. And the consensus of the experts was that the bills are indeed different.

Robert Applebaum, a gerontologist at Miami University in Ohio, said that ""calling advanced planning a 'death panel' is ridiculous, but comparing this legislation to (the drug bill version) is not factual either.""
 
Applebaum said that the drug bill ""really focused on hospice care, while the proposed legislation is really about planning for future health care. … One of the problems with hospice is that the vast majority of patients wait until they are very close to death to even consult hospice. … So the (drug bill) legislation was relatively inconsequential"" in terms of the numbers and types of people it affected.

We presented Applebaum’s reasoning to three other academic experts in gerontology — J. James Cotter of Virginia Commonwealth University, Julie Masters of the University of Nebraska at Omaha and John Krout of Ithaca College — and all agreed that Applebaum’s reasoning was sound.

We also asked Amy Tucci, the president and CEO of the Hospice Foundation of America, and she said she agreed that the two bills are ""apples and oranges.""

""The 2003 legislation did not encourage or compensate doctors generally for having the conversation with people before a health crisis was looming,"" Tucci said. ""The 2003 legislation really only pertained to hospice doctors, who could be compensated for providing an evaluation of a patient and/or having a discussion with a prospective hospice patient about care plans, which would mean the services they're entitled to under hospice, other options for care, and so on. These evaluations would be to ensure that the patient was hospice eligible, which would be an evaluation that certified that the patient had six months or less to live.""

By contrast, Tucci said, the current legislation ""intends for the conversation to be held with … doctors who a patient would see, theoretically, long before the onset of some kind of terminal illness.""

When PolitiFact asked Maddow what she thought of our experts’ perspective, she said she still believes the lawmakers’ positions on the two bills are hypocritical.

She cited a quote that Grassley reportedly made to a crowd of 300 in Winterset, Iowa, on Aug. 12, 2009, that ""in the House bill, there is counseling for end of life. You have every right to fear. You shouldn’t have counseling at the end of life, you should have done that 20 years before. Should not have a government-run plan to decide when to pull the plug on grandma.""

Grassley, Maddow said, ""supported the 2003 bill covering 'end-of-life' counseling and 'advanced care planning' specifically for patients who were terminally ill. To be clear: he voted for it for terminally ill people, and he's railing against it for all seniors, despite saying, 'You shouldn't have counseling at the end of life, you should have done that 20 years before."" It's not only disingenuous for Sen. Grassley to deride measures he earlier supported as 'pull[ing] the plug on grandma,' it is rank hypocrisy for him to state that he has a particular objection to this counseling when it occurs at the actual end-of-life.""

We see her point, but it's clear to us from our interviews with experts that there's a distinct difference between the 2003 law and the 2009 bill. Yes, there's the appearance of inconsistency given the similar purpose for both bills, but the 2009 bill is more far-reaching than the 2003 law, which was focused narrowly on hospice patients. So we find Maddow's claim that they flip-flopped to be Half True.",/factchecks/2009/aug/17/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-republicans-chuck-grassley-john/
