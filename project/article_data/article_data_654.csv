Obama says terrorism worldwide has not increased substantially since he took office
","President Barack Obama spoke with veterans and active military members at a CNN town hall, discussing extended wait periods at VA hospitals and and the threat of terrorism. A major serving in the West Virginia Air National Guard asked Obama if the United States is doing anything greater to combat Islamic jihadists. He prefaced his question by saying that since Obama took office in 2009, ""there has been a substantial increase in terror attacks around the world"" and in the United States. Obama contradicted the premise of the question, though. ""It's important to recognize that if you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased,"" Obama said. ""What we've seen are some very high-profile attacks, mostly in the Middle East, also in our European theaters."" Obama said the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also called ISIS) underscored ""that the ideology of hatred and killing had metastasized"" even after the killing of Osama bin Laden and the dismantling of al-Qaida. He also said military efforts, intelligence work and other improvements had made large-scale terrorist attacks more difficult. Obama said there had not been a ""substantial"" increase in terrorism. Even though there’s no hard number to measure that against, we decided to look into it. Obama’s numbers, and a caveat When we asked, the White House referred us to data from the State Department’s counterterrorism bureau. Terrorism is defined as ""premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents."" Looking at Obama’s time in office, worldwide terror attacks increased about 7 percent, from 10,999 in 2009 to 11,774 attacks in 2015. That’s an increase, not a decrease, but in recent years the numbers have been declining. In 2015, the total number of terrorist attacks decreased by 13 percent compared with 2014. Deaths due to terrorist attacks also decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, by 14 percent, according to the State Department figures. ""This was largely due to fewer attacks and deaths in Iraq, Pakistan, and Nigeria,"" the report said. ""This represents the first decline in total terrorist attacks and deaths worldwide since 2012."" It’s problematic, though, to compare years between 2009 and 2015, because in 2012 the State Department changed the way it collected data about terrorist attacks. In 2012, the State Department began using data from  the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, from the University of Maryland. While the old count and the new count used similar methods -- data from open source information such as TV reports, specialized journals and think tank studies -- they are not exactly the same. The State Department said that due to the collection change, the data is ""not directly comparable."" ‘Conservative filter’ Erin Miller, who manages START’s Global Terrorism Database, says the numbers it provides the department amount to ""a conservative filter"" on the broader definition used in START’s own database. Totals presented by the State Department don’t include attacks targeting people in combat. They also exclude incidents in which there are mixed reports or vagueness. START’s overall count of global terrorism attacks in 2015 is at least 3,000 more than the State Department’s 2015 figure, because it includes some combat deaths and less definitive incidents. By START’s measure, there was a 214 percent increase in terrorist attacks from 2009 to 2015. Joseph Young, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs and School of International Service at American University, said it is tough to make claims about trends in terrorism since 2009. Obama’s statement is one possible interpretation of the data. There have been small increases and decreases in attacks over recent years, shifts in targeted locations, more suicide attacks and a small decline of other terror actions, Young said. ""(Obama’s) statement is consistent with a range of outcomes,"" Young said. START and State Department data both show there were fewer attacks in 2015 than in 2014. More than 55 percent of all terrorist attacks in 2015 happened in five countries — Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nigeria, according to State Department data. The department also reported 382 terrorist attacks in Syria in 2015 (up from 232 in 2014), but says they are conservative estimates given limitations of media coverage in that country. On top of attacks and fatalities rising, terrorist arrests are also up, noted Max Abrahms, a political science assistant professor at Northeastern University. A December 2015 report from the Program on Extremism at George Washington University said 56 individuals were arrested in 2015 in the United States for ISIS-related activities, ""the largest number of terrorism arrests in a single year since September 2001."" Brent Smith, director of the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas, said there are attacks, like the one in San Bernardino, Calif., last year, where there were no arrests because the perpetrators were killed in the incident. Our ruling Obama said, ""If you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased."" There is no universally accepted definition of a terrorist incident, so there is no universally accepted count. Based on State Department data, there’s been a 7 percent increase in terrorist attacks worldwide from 2009 to 2015. But the State Department’s criteria for what can be counted as a terrorist attack is stricter than that of other databases. According to START’s Global Terrorism Database, for instance, there was a 214 percent rise in terrorist attacks from 2009 to 2015, a substantial increase. Obama’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/13/barack-obama/obama-says-terrorism-worldwide-has-not-increased-s/

NRCC: Morgan Carroll voted to let welfare recipients use benefit cards at strip club, pot shop ATMs
","A Republican group has launched a racy ad saying Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll, a Democratic congressional candidate, voted to allow welfare recipients to use public benefit cards at ATMs in strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries. The National Republican Congressional Committee’s ad shows how down and dirty the race between Carroll and Republican incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman is getting in the final sprint to Election Day. They’re fighting over suburban Denver’s 6th Congressional District, one of the nation’s most competitive swing districts. ""Career politicians waste lots of money. Morgan Carroll is one of the worst,"" the narrator says at the beginning of the ad, titled ""Clubs."" ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries,"" the narrator continues as the video shifts from Carroll addressing the Legislature to her standing at a podium in front of a red neon silhouette of a nude female figure and the words ""STRIPPERS"" and ""MORGAN CARROLL"" on a brick wall. There's a row of marijuana-filled jars beside the senator. ""It's enough to make you ask, 'What's Morgan Carroll thinking?' Welfare for lap dances? Morgan Carroll is careless with our money,"" the ad concludes. We examined the claim that ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."" The facts are fairly straightforward. Carroll was among a dozen Democratic senators who voted against final passage of a 2015 bill to prohibit welfare recipients from using state-issued electronic benefit transfer (or EBT) cards to obtain cash from ATMs at pot shops and strip clubs. Low-income families use these debit cards to buy ""essential goods"" such as food and clothing and to help pay for utilities and rent. Senate Bill 65, which became law, expanded on existing state law prohibiting people from using the cards to withdraw ATM cash at liquor stores, casinos and gun shops. Federal law already required states to prevent people receiving public benefits from using EBT cards at liquor stores, gambling and adult entertainment venues. Colorado also has had trouble preventing people from withdrawing ATM cash totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars at casinos and liquor stores, according to Watchdog.org. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado would face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against EBT card use at strip clubs. There were also concerns about a federal crackdown after several reports of people using the benefit cards at shops selling medical or recreational marijuana -- a drug that’s legal under state law but illegal under federal law. ""We stand to lose a lot if we don't show we are trying"" to prevent the use of tax money for marijuana, Republican Sen. Vicki Marble, a primary sponsor of the bill, told the Associated Press last year. ""The growers here put in a lot of time and effort. A raid would be absolutely devastating to our state."" Why did Carroll -- along with many other Democratic senators -- vote against the bill? ""The reason she voted against it was because of 'banking deserts,' where many poor people don't have"" bank ATMs in their neighborhoods, said Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich. Removing their ability to get cash from ATMs at the many marijuana dispensaries that dot Colorado cities and towns hampers low-income families’ ability to access money to purchase legitimate products elsewhere, he added.   According to the Atlantic magazine, a March study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the increase of ""banking deserts"" found that ""lower-income communities and communities of color have historically and disproportionately limited access to mainstream banking services."" This makes it harder for people in these communities to manage their finances and build wealth, the study said. Democratic lawmakers had repeatedly defeated similar legislation, arguing that improper ATM withdrawals at strip clubs, liquor stores, casinos represent a tiny fraction of the total use of cash-assistance cards, the Denver Post reported. Critics also note that the 2015 law doesn't prevent someone on welfare from using their EBT card to make a withdrawal at a supermarket ATM and then go spend the cash at a pot shop or a strip club. Our ruling NRCC says, ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."" There's slightly more to this than the NRCC lets on: Carroll voted, unsuccessfully, to allow welfare recipients to continue withdrawing money from ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries.  Carroll’s spokesman said the senator voted against the bill that prohibited people from using public benefit cards for cash withdrawals at strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries because she was concerned about the impact on residents of poor neighborhoods where there are few -- if any -- banking services. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado could face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against the use of benefit cards at adult entertainment venues.

At refugee summit, Obama claims refugees in U.S. are screened more than tourists
","As the Syrian civil war rages on, the refugee crisis was a major subject of debate at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York last month. Many nations remain suspicious of refugees from the Middle East, fearful that some may be terrorists or criminals. In a speech to the Leader’s Summit on Refugees on Sept. 20, President Barack Obama strongly pushed back against this suspicion. He made an impassioned argument for countries to increase humanitarian aid to conflict zones and accept their fair share of refugees. ""In recent years, in the United States, we’ve worked to put in intensive screening and security checks, so we can welcome refugees and ensure our security. In fact, refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist,"" he said. Officials at government agencies have made similar statements, saying that refugees are subject to the most intense screening of any visitors to the United States. His claim comes at a time when politicians such as Donald Trump are casting doubt on the government’s ability to vet refugees and make sure they don’t pose a threat to the country. We were interested in comparing the screening process for tourists and refugees to see whether Obama’s claim is correct. Comparing the protocols We first looked at the Department of Homeland Security’s official protocols for tourist and refugee screening, and outlined the major components of each one below: First, travelers from 38 countries such as the U.K., Australia, and Japan can apply for the visa waiver program. This allows them to travel to the United States for 90 days or less without applying for a visa. Applicants must have passports with special security features, and need to obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, an automated screening system for passengers. Visitors that don’t apply for a visa waiver need to apply for a visitor’s visa. Prospective visitors need to have a valid passport, resume, and photo ID in order to complete the DS-160, which is the major online nonimmigrant visa application. They also need to pass a visa interview, where they’re often asked to provide evidence of their trip’s purpose. For example, a visiting scientist may have to bring a document proving that they will attend a research symposium in the United States. The waiting time to obtain a visitor’s visa depends on the traveler’s country of origin, but typically takes between several weeks to several months. A visitor’s visa usually lasts six months, but can be extended through an additional application process. The listed screening process for refugees is more complicated, and frequently takes at least two years to complete. According to the White House’s website, refugees are first identified, assessed, and interviewed by UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency. Applicants then go through a strict screening process while still overseas. They face security checks and interviews with at least four federal agencies, such as the FBI and the State Department. The Department of Homeland Security then interviews the candidate again with specially trained officers from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Applicant’s fingerprints are also gathered and cross-referenced to terrorist watch lists, and they must pass medical screenings and attend cultural orientation classes. Refugees from Syria face additional security checks and may be referred to fraud detection experts in Homeland Security. According to the State Department, around half of refugee applicants are ultimately admitted to the United States. Obama was correct in saying that the refugee screening process is more rigorous that the tourist screening process, at least in theory. But does it always turn out that way in real life? The risk of admitting terrorists with each process David Martin, professor of law at the University of Virginia, told us that Obama’s statement is accurate. ""The procedures are not merely theoretical,"" he said. ""DHS has worked hard to develop procedures and effective lines of inquiry specific to refugee populations, and they are fully employed."" For example, even if refugee applicants initially passes a certain stage, they face the prospect of recurrent vetting. If they provide any new biographical information in the vetting process, the entire round of security checks with federal agencies is repeated. Additionally, pending applications are constantly reviewed against terrorist databases to watch for new threats. If any potential concern comes up, the application is paused and reviewed again. Martin acknowledges that no security screening is completely foolproof. One of the largest challenges facing refugee screening is a lack of access to government data in war-torn countries. Because the U.S. government can only work with the data it can obtain, verifying people’s identities in countries where records may be missing or destroyed is more difficult. In fact, the tourist screening process could potentially be more prone to letting terrorists in, according to Anne Speckhard, associate professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University. Of particular concern to her and other experts is the relative laxity of the visa waiver program. ""In my view the most danger of an ISIS cadre making it to the United States is the visa waiver form, so for instance, a European ISIS cadre who comes as a ‘tourist’ but is really a terrorist,"" she said. ""It’s hard for me to believe an ISIS cadre would expose himself to so long vetting process and wait for two years to enter the United States when it’s so much easier to get here through visa waiver."" Speckhard said that the majority of Syrian refugees pose no danger to the United States and simply wish to flee repression from either ISIS or the Syrian government. She argued that some refugees are highly educated and have much to contribute. Matt Mayer of the American Enterprise Institute told us that Obama’s use of the word ""average"" makes his claim correct, due to the low level of screening that visa waiver applicants receive. But because refugees are coming to the United States permanently, as opposed to tourists’ brief visits, Obama is making a false comparison. Mayer said refugees should be extensively screened due to widespread problems with document fraud and verifying people’s identities. Our Ruling Obama said, ""Refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist in the U.S."" Reviewing the government’s vetting protocols confirms that refugees face a far stricter and longer process than tourists for entering the United States. The experts we consulted agreed that the refugee protocol is strictly enforced and more difficult than the screening process that tourists go through. We rate his claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c81c169f-1d88-43cc-bdc0-39a481f8658a",/factchecks/2016/oct/13/barack-obama/refugee-summit-obama-claims-refugees-us-are-screen/

Cloonen says her GOP opponent wants to strip seniors of their Social Security, Medicare benefits
","Few local legislative races in Illinois are as hotly contested as the one in the 79th District between incumbent state Rep. Kate Cloonen, D-Kankakee, and her Republican challenger Lindsay Parkhurst. Cloonen, who won the 2014 election by a mere 122 votes and the 2012 election by just 91, is seeking her third term in the General Assembly. Parkhurst is a political newcomer and a defense attorney who has headed a general practice law firm for 16 years, during which she has represented clients in Social Security disability and workers’ compensation cases. In a Sept. 21 campaign ad posted on Cloonen’s Facebook page, she claimed, ""Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes."" Since state lawmakers play no role in these federal programs, we decided to check the record to see if there’s any merit to Cloonen’s claim. Confusing claim  Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages requesting information and sources used to back up her claim.  The ad cites three articles from 2011 by the Philadelphia Tribune, NPR and Bloomberg.com, as well as a March 2014 article by the Chicago Tribune. However, the NPR article dated March 29, 2011, was about Democratic members of Congress holding a rally to support Social Security. The Bloomberg story from Aug. 12, 2011, was about former GOP congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann calling for cuts to Social Security and Medicare for future recipients. Neither article mentions Parkhurst. A search of the Philadelphia Tribune and Chicago Tribune archives did not yield any results for the dates listed. But considering Parkhurst was a private citizen at the time and not even on the political radar, it’s unlikely these news stories would include any mention of her, let alone describe her position on Medicare and Social Security benefits for seniors. In a phone interview, Parkhurst told PolitiFact Illinois she has no idea where the Cloonen camp got this information to level the accusation. Parkhurst noted she has represented clients in cases involving Social Security disability benefits for people who were not at the eligible age of 65 -- the opposite of what Cloonen’s ad suggests. ""I advocate for people to qualify and obtain those benefits,"" Parkhurst said. ""I have been an advocate for 16 years."" When asked about her general position on Social Security and Medicare, Parkhurst said both are part of a contract the federal government has made with U.S. citizens and one that must be honored, not eliminated. Regardless, the claim against Parkhurst is curious because state lawmakers have no authority over these federal programs. State role in Social Security and Medicare  Charlie Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting graduate program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and a long-time former politics and government reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times, says the ad attempts to make a connection that’s not there and ignores the fact that the state only administers these programs and cannot eliminate Social Security benefits or Medicare for seniors. Wheeler said the only quasi-logical explanation behind Cloonen’s claim is that the Democrat is trying to tie Parkhurst to the GOP’s national platform, which many believe includes policies that would hurt the Social Security program. It’s a very old and common campaign tactic to link a local legislative candidate to his or her party’s broader policies and scandals, Wheeler noted, pointing to recent TV ads and campaign mailers in which Democratic and Republican candidates have tried linking their opponents to sex offenders. ""The state Legislature and state law have very little to do with Social Security and Medicare. Those are federal programs,"" Wheeler said. ""State involvement would be to the extent that it collects Social Security taxes and passes them on to the federal government."" Our ruling In a campaign ad posted on Facebook, Cloonen said, ""Lindsay Parkhurst wants to take away programs like Social Security and Medicare that seniors have earned throughout their lifetimes."" With Social Security and Medicare being federal programs, state lawmakers have no say in setting benefit levels for these programs. Additionally, Parkhurst has not previously held elected office and therefore has no public voting record on Social Security or Medicare. Nor has she talked about her position on Medicare or Social Security benefits in her campaign. Ironically, Parkhurst is a defense attorney whose law firm has helped clients obtain Social Security disability benefits. She believes both Social Security and Medicare are part of a contract the federal government must honor. Cloonen’s campaign did not respond to multiple emails and messages for comment, and the articles cited in the ad contain no mention of Parkhurst. There is no evidence to back Cloonen’s claim, nor can we find any statement or action by Parkhurst that would have, even indirectly, elicited it. We rate Cloonen’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/487f0897-a88a-4c8f-a8c5-4d5464447785",/factchecks/2016/oct/13/katherine-cloonen/cloonen-says-her-gop-opponent-wants-strip-seniors/

Lack of basic death data leads to false claims in Kenya
","At the launch of a new political party at a sports stadium in Nairobi, Kenya, the country’s deputy president William Ruto talked about a disease that Vice President Joe Biden has made his life’s mission. At the start of the year, following the death of Biden’s son to brain cancer, the vice president took the lead in the administration’s Cancer Moonshot project, an effort to rapidly accelerate cancer research. Ruto cast cancer as a top public health priority for his country. ""Cancer and matters to do with kidney failure kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined,"" Ruto said Sept. 9, 2016. Given that AIDS is the No. 1 killer in sub-Saharan Africa, and malaria ranks fourth, our Africa Check partners decided to check Ruto’s numbers. He is wrong. For the record, Ruto’s office did not provide any supporting data. A dearth of numbers Solid data is sorely lacking in Kenya as it is in most sub-Saharan African nations. But the numbers that are available disprove Ruto’s claim. Kenya just launched a national cancer registry, but it won’t be fully in place until 2019. For the time being, the highest estimate puts the number of cancer deaths at 28,000 in 2015. On kidney disease, Kenya has no national data at all. The World Health Organization estimates 3,100 deaths for 2014. Combined that’s a rough count of 31,100 deaths. WHO is the most reliable source for tuberculosis death estimates in Kenya as well, with about 9,400 deaths in 2014. The United Nations AIDS program relies on statistical models to derive the number of AIDS deaths in Kenya. UNAIDS says it is ""logistically impossible and ethically problematic"" to investigate all deaths. According to its statistical model, there were between 28,000 and 50,000 deaths due to AIDS in Kenya in 2014, with 38,000 being the most likely figure. For malaria, the WHO said in its World Malaria Report for 2015 that it was unable to collect data for six East African countries, including Kenya, between 2000 and 2014 because of ""inconsistent reporting, or changes in health service accessibility or diagnostic testing"". The best we could find for malaria deaths was Kenya’s civil registration data, which provisionally shows 23,789 deaths in 2013 and 20,691in 2015. As you can see, while the numbers are far from perfect, they do not support Ruto’s point. This table pulls the numbers together. Even using the lowest estimates for AIDS and malaria deaths, the combined toll is greater than for cancer and kidney disease. Cancer/Kidney deaths AIDS/Malaria/TB deaths Cancer 28,000 Kidney disease 3,100 AIDS 28,000 Malaria 20,691 TB 9,400 Totals 31,100 58,091 There are efforts such as the Health Data Collaborative and the African Health Initiative that aim to beef up the health data collected in sub-Saharan Africa. But it will be a tough slog. Robert Black at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health helps oversee the data coordination program at the African Health Initiative and he told us it will take many years before these countries have robust systems. ""The funding that is available for this from both national and donor funds is grossly inadequate to reach that objective in the near term,"" Black said. In May 2016, Kenya became the first African country to launch a national effort to ramp up its systems for collecting health data. One of the top priorities? Making sure that every death and cause of death is recorded. Our ruling Ruto said that cancer and kidney disease ""kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined."" The precision of the numbers leaves a lot to be desired, but based on the best estimates, Ruto isn’t even close. Using conservative estimates, deaths from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are double those from cancer and kidney disease.

Republican group wrong that 'fired' Pete Gallego turned around and became lobbyist
","Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader, wants Pete Gallego of Alpine back in the U.S. House, according to a TV ad from a Republican group backing the incumbent in the seat representing the 23rd Congressional District sprawling south and west from San Antonio. And why, the ad’s narrator says? He says: ""Because Gallego is the insider’s insider. Career politician. Went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress."" Fair enough on the politician part; Gallego, a lawyer, was a Texas House member for more than 20 years before winning election to Congress in 2012. Two years later, though, he lost re-election to Republican Will Hurd of Helotes, who’s now trying to win his second term. The National Republican Congressional Committee ad shows Gallego smiling as he strolls what looks like a major Washington, D.C. avenue. Text simultaneously flashes: ""Career politician,"" then ""Gallego lobbied"" with these words in smaller type at the bottom of the screen: ""City of Austin, 2015."" https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/505c2984-7393-475b-aac6-534c66d2f87d  SOURCE: Screen grab, TV advertisement, ""She’s a Fan,"" National Republican Congressional Committee, YouTube, Oct. 4, 2016 Gallego might be in legal trouble if he went to lobby right away on Washington’s infamous K Street where lobbying firms marshal forces. A 2007 law bars former House members from lobbying Congress for a year after leaving the body. Then again, news reports including a July 2016 Politico story suggest that despite the ""cooling off"" mandate, former senators and House members continue to enjoy lucrative careers trying to influence lawmakers. As of October 2016, too, the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that 49 percent of the former members of the 113th Congress, which was in session through 2014, had already gone to work for lobbying firms. Its list, though, didn’t link Gallego to any firm. And asked to share the basis of the lobbyist claim, NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter, who confirmed the ad video showed Gallego strolling in Washington, pointed out Gallego’s August 2015 federal personal financial disclosure indicating he was paid $55,000 that year to work for Austin’s city government. Hunter also emailed us 10 documents that appeared to come from Gallego’s city employee personnel file. City officials: Gallego didn't lobby We confirmed the authenticity of the city-connected documents by asking a city spokesman, David Green, for the public portions of Gallego’s employee personnel file. Those documents indicate Gallego was employed in ""government relations"" for 40 hours a week from March 2, 2015, through Aug. 21, 2015, at an hourly rate of $56.26. At our inquiry, Green also shared the financial calculations that bear out the city ultimately paying Gallego $55,359. For part of that time, through June 1, 2015, the Texas Legislature was in session. So, might it be that Gallego proved helpful to the city by lobbying legislators? To the contrary, Green and a former Gallego superviser each told us Gallego had been hired not to lobby legislators but to advise the city on legislative and legal matters. Gallego, Green said by email, ""advised the government relations officer on policy and legislation and assisted in document preparation and strategy."" Green told us John Hrncir, then the government relations officer, was one of Gallego’s supervisors. When we called Hrncir, who retired in May 2015, he said he’d recommended that the city consider adding Gallego to its government relations team after Hugh Brady left city government to work in President Barack Obama’s administration. According to Brady’s entry on LinkedIn.com, he was a special assistant city attorney and legislative counsel to the city until March 2014 when he became general counsel in the executive office of the president. In his city role, Brady’s entry says, he advised city officials and drafted ""state and federal legislative instruments involving taxes, land use, water, government finance, regulatory authority, redistricting, collective bargaining, pensions and telecommunications."" By email, Hrncir wrote that ""in a typical legislative session the city is potentially impacted by 25% or more of the bills considered. The city usually has to pay attention to the 1,200 to 2,000 bills impacting it the most of the five to seven thousand filed. Deciding which legislative provisions to amend, pass, or defeat, and the time and effort to spend on each action, is a constant process, and decisions are revised, sometimes hourly, until the final gavel at sine die.  ""Pete Gallego is an experienced former (legislator) who had demonstrated exceptional ability at solving problems by finding solutions palatable to multiple factions of legislators--both parties; rural and urban reps; business and environmental advocates; etc. The constant triage for bills and amendments is critical to the city's success and I was confident that Gallego's advice to the team would be invaluable in maximizing the city's resources."" Gallego responds In gauging this claim, we also queried Gallego’s campaign. By email, spokeswoman Lyndsey Rodriguez said the implication that Gallego was a Washington lobbyist doesn’t hold up. Gallego, Rodriguez said, was a temporary in-house employee of the City of Austin for approximately a six-month period of time"" and not among the city’s outside paid lobbyists, she wrote, noting that he also didn’t register as a lobbyist with the Texas Ethics Commission, which we confirmed from records listing outside lobbyists paid by the city to lobby in 2015. Gallego, Rodriguez wrote, ""reported directly to the city attorney and provided the city attorney with opinions on legislative language and process. Pete also reviewed legislation, during and after session, to determine its impact on the city."" Following up, we asked if Gallego in 2015 testified before a legislative committee or perhaps registered a position on behalf of the city; those are the kinds of duties often fulfilled by a lobbyist. ""He did not,"" Rodriguez replied. We also reached Brian Yarbrough, among outside lobbyists paid by the city, who told us by phone he wasn't aware of Gallego directly lobbying for the city that year and didn't recall even seeing him in the Texas Capitol. Our ruling The pro-Hurd Republican group says Gallego ""went and lobbied after you fired him from Congress."" For half of 2015 including three months of the legislative session, Gallego worked in government relations for Austin’s city government. But the NRCC didn’t provide nor did we find evidence he was working as a lobbyist--either in Austin or Washington, which the ad arguably implies. We rate this claim False.

On Oct. 11, 2016, four days after the release of the 2005 video, the Republican nominee slammed the GOP House speaker from Wisconsin on Twitter (and later on the Fox News Channel). In the tweet, which came two days after his second debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump declared: ""Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!"" So, we thought we’d check the polls. Trump and Ryan The relationship between Trump and Ryan, never close, frayed after the video. Ryan denounced Trump’s remarks and canceled what would have been his first appearance with Trump at a rally in Wisconsin the following day. We rated True a claim by Clinton that Ryan still endorses Trump, but the ill will between the two Republicans remained. An hour after tweeting about the polls, Trump called Ryan in another tweet ""our very weak and ineffective leader."" The response from Ryan’s office: ""Paul Ryan is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same."" The debate Fiery exchanges between Trump and Clinton marked the second debate, which was held at Washington University in St. Louis. The town hall-style event drew more viewers nationally than the Green Bay Packers-New York Giants game, but fewer than the first debate. It generated more than two dozen fact checks by our colleagues. So, who did Americans say won the second debate? Here’s a look at the national, scientific polls: Poll Clinton Trump Politico/Morning Consult Registered voters 42% 28% NBC News/Survey Monkey Likely voters 44% 34% CNN/ORC International Registered voters who watched the debate 57% 34% YouGov (research company) Registered voters who watched the debate 47% 42% So, not only did Trump not win by a landslide in any of the polls, he didn’t win any of the polls, period. Trump’s campaign didn’t get back to us before deadline on what polls would back Trump’s statement. All we could find in his favor were non-scientific polls, open to anyone to participate, that were conducted online. But such polls can be heavily influenced, for instance, by campaigns pushing supporters to vote, or can skew to one side based on the audience of the website. Some may even allow more than one vote per person. The Drudge Report reported that among more than 1.1 million people who cast votes in its survey, 72 percent said Trump won and 28 percent said Clinton won. In a non-scientific poll offered online by MLive.com, the website for the Ann Arbor News and other newspapers in Michigan, Trump won by a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent among more than 27,000 votes cast. And in a non-scientific poll offered by the website of a group of New Jersey newspapers, Trump won 64 percent to 31 percent among more than 241,000 votes cast. For what they’re worth, those are landslide margins. But even in non-scientific surveys, Trump didn’t win them all: In a non-scientific survey done online by the Fox television affiliate in Milwaukee, Clinton won by 52 percent to 48 percent among 325,000 votes cast. Our rating Complaining about a lack of support from Ryan, Trump nonetheless claimed he won the second debate with Clinton ""in a landslide"" in ""every poll."" But four national, scientific surveys all showed that not only did Trump not win by a landslide margin, he didn’t win any of the polls at all.

Trump: 'I’ve been proven right' about Clinton wanting open borders
","Donald Trump repeated his claim that Hillary Clinton supports open borders, pointing to an excerpt of a leaked speech as new evidence. Wikileaks released more than 2,600 hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, including an email with brief sections of Clinton’s paid remarks to Wall Street banks. (The Clinton campaign hasn’t confirmed or disputed the authenticity of the emails.) According to Trump, these speeches show ""she wants the United States to surrender to global governance with no controls over trade or immigration."" ""Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all, would end the United States as we know it today,"" he said at an Oct. 10 rally in Pennsylvania. ""By the way, weeks ago, I called out Hillary Clinton for supporting open borders and the media said I was wrong. Now, I've been proven right,"" he continued. ""Where is the media rushing to correct these false stories? Because in the Wikileaks, it was all about open borders, free trade for everybody."" Is Trump right that Clinton really does want open borders? The leaked excerpt does contain the words ""open borders,"" but that alone doesn't make Trump's claim correct. Experts suggested Clinton could have been talking about free travel or open trade, or immigration policy. It's just not clear. What's more, Clinton's official immigration position does not contain a proposal for an open border. Clinton’s immigration plan As evidence for Trump's claim, the Trump campaign referred us to Clinton's pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office as well as her support for sanctuary cities. We've looked into this before, and concluded that equating Clinton's immigration plan with ""open borders"" is not accurate. Clinton supported 2013 legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship with conditions and billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. As a candidate, she has said she would focus on deportations for violent criminals or those who pose threats. Clinton, however, does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain a legal status. That’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement, of course, and it’s a far cry from Trump’s characterization: ""Anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all."" Clinton’s paid speech comment on open borders According to Trump, the Wikileaks hack vindicates his earlier charge. The speech excerpt is more ambiguous than he’s suggesting, but she does use the words ""open borders."" On Jan. 25, Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk sent an email to Podesta that contained excerpts of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speech transcripts but hasn’t done so.) She mentioned open borders in her remarks on May 16, 2013, to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau. The excerpt, in its entirety, reads: ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere."" It’s difficult to discern exactly what she was referring to here, because we don’t have more context. The Clinton campaign didn’t respond to our request for the full speech. But a campaign spokesman pointed to statements by Podesta and Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook on Oct. 9. Both said the context of that sentence related to green energy -- and wasn’t about people immigrating to the United States. On Face the Nation, Mook said she was talking about integrating green energy between north and south America. ""But if the question is does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders, absolutely not. And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interest of workers in this country. That is actually why she voted against the Central American free trade agreement when she was a senator,"" Mook said. On Fox News Sunday, Podesta also said she was referring to clean energy. ""When she was secretary of state, she talked about creating a hemispheric effort to bring clean energy across the continent from the tip of South America to Canada, to invest in clean and renewable energy, to invest in the transmission that would clean up our energy system,"" Podesta said. ""And I think when you look at what she said about immigration, she's for comprehensive immigration reform that takes people out of the shadows, emphasizes family unity, but also has -- modernizes our border security.   Are her remarks a call for open borders for immigrants? We interviewed three immigration experts and asked them if they thought she was calling for open borders for immigrants and whether it was in conflict with her campaign immigration plan. The experts said Clinton’s remarks were not a clear-cut call for open borders. They also said that her statement sounded aspirational and contained no timeline or explanation as to how she would make it happen politically. ""I would note her emphasis on a ‘hemispheric’ common market, an idea that became more concrete in 1994 when her husband, Bill Clinton, hosted the first Summit of the Americas meeting in Miami,"" said Stephen Kelly, a Duke University public policy professor. That summit involved 34 democracies, and ""open markets, hemispheric integration, and free trade"" were all cited as a means of increasing prosperity at the meeting, Kelly said. Those summits have continued, and Clinton attended one in 2012 as secretary of state. ""My guess would be that Clinton's Brazil speech reflects this broader call for greater hemispheric cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade,"" Kelly said. ""Given this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I would also guess that the ‘open borders’ she mentions relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not people.""   Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the European Union’s internal borders. For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean an open border for free immigration, but rather for free travel. ""I don't think she is calling for open immigration, but the context of her remarks shows that when she says ‘open borders,’ she doesn't just mean open trade,"" he said. Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance University of Washington, said Clinton appeared to be talking about both trade and immigration. ""I would read the remark as calling for open borders with regard to both trade and immigration.  Otherwise the term ‘open trade and open borders’ would be redundant,"" he said. However, he said he saw no timetable in her remarks beyond  ""some time in the future,"" or discussion about how to make it happen. ""I don't necessarily see a contradiction between a statement of ideals and a more pragmatic policy agenda for reality,"" he said. ""One can dream of a crime-free world where there is need for neither police nor prisons while still supporting those things in reality."" Our ruling Trump said, ""I’ve been proven right"" about ""Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all."" Trump is referring to a leaked speech excerpt in which Clinton purportedly says, ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere."" We don’t have more context about what Clinton meant by ""open borders"" because she has not released the full speech. Her campaign has said she was talking about clean energy across the hemisphere. Trump argues that it directly applies to her current immigration policy. She has not called for open borders in this campaign. Clinton has proposed making it easier for the current undocumented population to gain a path to citizenship with conditions, but she has also supported beefed-up border security. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cad1cc7a-6265-40a9-a8d4-2df1d465d1ae",/factchecks/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/trump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-/

McCrory says Syrian refugees not properly vetted or tracked by the FBI once in the US
","During Tuesday’s debate in the North Carolina governor’s race, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory repeated a questionable claim from the realm of national politics when defending his party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Seven North Carolina cities and towns have received several hundred Syrian refugees since 2014. In total across the country, the U.S. recently took in its 10,000th refugee from the war-torn nation. In the debate, McCrory said we don’t know anything about these newcomers. Trump has previously made the False claim that there is ""no system to vet"" refugees. Former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson made a similar Mostly False claim that ""there is currently no ability to vet these people."" The difference between the two claims was that Trump said there’s no system for vetting refugees, and Carson said we don’t have the ability to vet them. There is certainly a system: It has been in place since 1980 and has been tweaked several times since 9/11. Carson’s claim had a tiny bit more truth to it than Trump’s did because it can be difficult to track down every bit of information about every Syrian refugee, given the violence and destruction there. So where did McCrory land with his own claim? Let’s take a look at the whole thing. Debate moderator Chuck Todd was pressing McCrory and his Democratic challenger, Roy Cooper, about their parties’ presidential candidates. He asked McCrory if Trump was a role model. You can watch the entire exchange here. McCrory said Trump ""does stand strong on certain issues that need to be said, especially from outside Washington, D.C. The Syrian refugee situation is a disaster. I personally talked to the FBI – one of the top leaders of the FBI – and they kind of laughed when they said they’re checking the backgrounds of the Syrian refugees. No, they aren’t. There’s no embassy to check. There’s no qualifications. So when Hillary Clinton says they’re doing a vetting process of these Syrian refugees coming into our state, the FBI is not even being told where they are."" McCrory’s claim that ""no, they aren’t"" being vetted is in line with Carson’s Mostly False claim that we don’t have the ability to check the backgrounds of these refugees. And his claim that ""the FBI is not even being told where they are"" reminds us of a Mostly False claim by Sen. Ted Cruz that ""the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees."" Vetting refugees McCrory said at the debate there’s no embassy to help with background checks. But the U.S. does have an embassy in Syria. The Syrian government also had an embassy in the U.S. until 2014, when the U.S. suspended it and began recognizing diplomats for the rebels instead. Regardless, embassies are rarely the first point of contact for refugees. The initial vetting is almost always handled by United Nations workers. That process takes four to 10 months. If refugees pass the U.N. checks and are referred to the U.S., they face additional scrutiny from the FBI and other federal agencies – including in-person interviews, medical screenings and background checks. If they pass they are matched with sponsors, begin taking ""cultural orientation"" classes and undergo a final security clearance. Then they’re allowed to come to the United States. And that’s just the normal process for refugees from anywhere in the world. Syrian refugees undergo an additional layer of security checks, using classified information. The process typically takes one to two years or longer. The State Department says about half are approved. The system certainly isn’t perfect, since many refugees have fled violence hastily, without all their papers. Officials have also said a lack of U.S. troops on the ground means our knowledge of local terrorists isn’t as complete as in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, which have also sent thousands of refugees to the U.S. ""If we don’t know much about somebody, there won’t be anything in our data,"" FBI Director James Comey told Congress in 2015. ""I can’t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this."" But few Syrian refugees fit the typical profile of a terrorist or criminal – only about 2 percent resettled in the U.S. have been young adult men, according to a Washington Post article from 2015. Half have been children, and another quarter have been older than 60. Including the 10,000 Syrian refugees now here, the United States still had almost twice as many refugees a decade ago, under President George W. Bush. The number of refugees and asylum-seekers in the United States peaked in 2006 at 970,000 people. In 2015, there were 560,000. Government awareness We’re not sure why an FBI official might have told McCrory that the agency ""is not even being told where they are,"" but we can fill the governor in. North Carolina is one of the top states for Syrian refugees. Only Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas have taken in more. As of August North Carolina had 430, according to the conservative group Federation for American Immigration Reform. That group, citing data from the federal government, says there are 102 Syrian refugees in High Point, 83 in Raleigh, 70 in Charlotte, 63 in Durham, 61 in Greensboro, 48 in Winston-Salem and three in New Bern. The FBI does not continue automatically tracking the movements of all Syrian refugees once they pass background checks and settle here – but again, most of the refugees are children or senior citizens. And there is nothing keeping the FBI from tracking suspected terrorists of any nationality or residency status. If a refugee does exhibit red flags after making it through the background checks, the FBI can begin tracking that person. In 2010, the FBI arrested two Iraqi refugees who had been under surveillance for being suspected of trying to smuggle weapons from Kentucky back to Iraq. They were caught handling heavy weapons on camera after being set up in a sting by the FBI. Our ruling McCrory said Syrian refugees aren’t being vetted and that the FBI doesn’t know where they are. The vetting process has faced criticism, but it does exist –  leading to the rejection of thousands of applicants and, in many cases, taking more than two years for those who are approved. There are also extensive records of where refugees are initially settled. The FBI does not automatically track all of them once they’re settled, but nothing is stopping agents from tracking refugees who make it through the vetting process but later exhibit signs of extremism – and there are recent examples of the FBI doing exactly that. McCrory distorts the reality of the Syrian refugee system, and we rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de8d8b9-b87c-4e34-bb1e-d1f3d8813722",/factchecks/2016/oct/12/pat-mccrory/mccrory-says-syrian-refugees-not-properly-vetted-o/

Attack ad gets Deborah Ross' stance on the Iran nuclear deal half right, half wrong
","North Carolina’s incumbent senator, Republican Richard Burr, is facing a closer-than-expected re-election campaign against Democratic challenger Deborah Ross. Now a national conservative group is coming to Burr’s aid, with a $1 million ad campaign that criticizes Ross’ views on foreign policy and national security. ""Now she supports the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages, despite it being bad for America,"" the ad says. It was paid for by the John Bolton SuperPAC, run by the former U.N. ambassador and Republican political advisor John Bolton. Burr is the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and has had several prominent moments in that position. He helped lead the government’s fight against Apple to try to make the company unlock the phones used by the terrorists in the San Bernardino attack last year. He also spearheaded efforts to keep a report on the CIA’s torture program out of the public eye, calling it politically motivated. Ross has no foreign policy experience. She was formerly a state legislator and executive director of the North Carolina ACLU. The new ad campaign attempts to tie her to the policies of the Obama administration. But is it true that Ross supports ""the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages"" like the ad claims? A refresher on the Iran deal The nuclear deal was an exchange: Iran would give up its aspirations for a nuclear weapon, and in return the international community would lift many of the economic sanctions on the country. We’ve previously written summaries of both the negotiations and the technical details of the deal and its enforcement. It can be a tricky subject to talk about, and claims on both sides often lack nuance. Burr previously received a Half True for his claim that Obama and Hillary Clinton were ""responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran."" And for a more complete picture on the billions of dollars Iran will receive via the deal – largely coming from overseas bank accounts that had previously been frozen – and whether that money could be put toward terrorism, see this Half True claim from Rudy Giuliani. Support for the deal? Ross does say she supports the nuclear deal, although she adds a caveat. ""In the future, the U.S. should extend Iranian sanctions and consider increasing them to stop Iran from financing terrorism around the globe,"" Ross says on the foreign policy section of her website. This position seems to be contradictory, since the main part of the deal was to remove many sanctions from the country. So does she support it or not? Experts told us that while Ross’ two sentiments seem at odds with one another, they actually aren’t – as long as any new sanctions are added due to Iran’s financing of terrorist groups, like Hezbollah. But it’s a slippery slope. ""Iran could pull out of the deal"" if the United States adds sanctions for the wrong reason, said Aaron Arnold, an international affairs expert at Harvard University. According to Jim Walsh, who leads the Security Studies Program at MIT: ""If Iran does something new and egregious that warrants new sanctions, the U.S. has every right under the deal to respond any way it wants, including sanctions. But if this is just, ‘I hate Iran so we should have more sanctions,’ that is an agreement killer."" Duke University professor Peter Feaver referred to Ross’ support of both the Iran deal and extra sanctions as ""tip-toeing through a minefield."" Feaver worked in defense policy under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said Ross’ seemingly contradictory position is technically possible since the deal had to allow the possibility for future American sanctions in order to survive Congress. Republicans have tried to pass legislation killing the deal but don’t have enough votes in the Senate. ""While in practice those objectives have been in tension with each other, increasingly so as the Obama Administration resorts to ever more desperate measures to prop up the Iran deal, they are not fundamentally at odds,"" Feaver said. Prisoners and ransom? So Ross supports the Iran nuclear deal, even with the caveat that she also supports new sanctions on Iran. But what about her support for ""ransom"" payments? PolitiFact has previously looked into whether the $400 million the United States sent to Iran, shortly before several Americans were freed in January, was actually a ransom. We ruled that Mostly False. It was the first part of a $1.7 billion settlement the U.S. agreed to pay in an international arbitration tribunal, related to a failed 1979 arms deal. Yet at the same time, U.S. officials have acknowledged they withheld the money until they were sure that five Americans held in Iranian jails had been released. That previous fact check concluded that, ""While some in the national security community might consider the transaction unsavory, ineffectual, or legally questionable, calling it ‘ransom’ isn’t quite accurate."" Whatever the appropriate phrase for that payment, Deborah Ross has clearly said she does not support it. She said as much in a TV interview earlier this month, and in a paper outlining her foreign policy positions. ""The United States government should not pay Tehran for the return of American prisoners,"" Ross wrote. So we asked Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the PAC, if there were examples of Ross saying anything that could back up the ad’s claim. Marquis didn’t point to any examples, but he said that doesn’t matter. ""You can’t have one without the other,"" he said. ""Of course she’s not going to say she’s for ransom payments. But she supports the Iran deal which included the payment. It seems that Ross is trying to have her cake and eat it too."" However, several legal experts we spoke with said it’s not necessarily true that the payment was part of the Iran deal. Eric Lorber, a terrorism financing expert and senior associate with the Financial Integrity Network consulting firm, testified before Congress last month regarding the payment. He said in an interview the timing had more to do with the release of the prisoners than with the implementation of the nuclear deal, even though all three happened around the same time. ""The bottom line is that the payment wasn't part of the nuclear deal,"" he said. Our ruling A new ad attacking Richard Burr’s challenger Deborah Ross says Ross ""supports the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages."" Ross does support the nuclear deal. She does not support ""ransom"" payments for American prisoners. The group behind the ad said she can’t support the Iran deal and also oppose the payment, arguing that the payment was part of the deal, but experts say that isn’t correct. Since the ad gets one part right and one part wrong, we rate this claim Half True. Correction: The payment from the U.S. to Iran was agreed to in a settlement in an international tribunal. It was not from an order from that tribunal. This correction does not change our ruling. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/80b12778-8fbb-4312-8585-24c71767571e",/factchecks/2016/oct/12/john-bolton-superpac/attack-ad-gets-deborah-ross-stance-iran-nuclear-de/

Clinton is right: Trump tax plan gives more to rich than Bush tax cuts
","With a backdrop of leaked lewd comments and Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual misconduct, you may not necessarily remember what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton said about tax policy in the deeply personal and nasty Oct. 9 presidential debate. When Trump touted his proposal to deliver tax cuts for all, Clinton pointed out that his tax plan would help millionaires and billionaires like himself the most. ""His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two,"" Clinton said. ""Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift."" Is Clinton right that the wealthy would benefit from Trump’s tax plan twice as much as they did under the Bush tax cuts? The Clinton campaign told us their data comes from an analysis by the conservative Tax Foundation and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities on after-tax incomes of the top 1 percent. We also looked at the share of tax relief received by the top 1 percent as a percentage of GDP. The evidence shows Clinton is right. The Bush tax cuts As a refresher, the Bush tax cuts, enacted under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003,  reduced the then-top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent rate to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, and so forth. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the Bush cuts increased the after-tax income of the top 1 percent between 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent from 2004 to 2012 (tax rates for high-income earners were raised the following year). Altogether, the top 1 percent received a cut equivalent to about 0.66 percent of GDP (the Bush tax cuts were altogether 2.4 percent of GDP, while the top 1 percent received 27.5 percent of the cuts.)   Trump’s plan Trump’s plan would increase after-tax incomes of the wealthy between 10.2 to 19.9 percent, according to the Tax Foundation, and deliver a tax cut equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Two key provisions in Trump’s latest tax plan, released September 2016, are particularly relevant to this fact-check. First, Trump would collapse the current seven tax brackets into four, reducing the current top marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent to 33 percent. (His previous tax plan called for a top marginal rate of 25 percent.) Second, Trump would also reduce the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He would also apply this rate to pass-through businesses, so-called because their profits currently ""pass through"" the business and instead are taxed as their owner's ordinary income. These would include partnerships like law firms and investor groups, sole proprietorships, limited liability corporations (LLCs) and corporations with less than 100 shareholders. In its analysis of Trump’s tax plan, the Tax Foundation used both the 33 percent personal tax rate as well as the 15 percent pass-through business rate to assess the plan’s impact on individual taxpayers.   The Tax Foundation found that, depending on which rate you apply and whether you factor in growth, the top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes increase by 10.2 to 19.9 percent. Here’s a table breaking down Trump’s proposed tax cuts by income group:  Similarly, the Tax Policy Center, which is affiliated with the Urban Institute, estimated that the top 1 percent would see a 13.5 percent gain in after-tax income. The think tank also said the Trump’s cuts would amount to about 2.6 percent of GDP, with 50.8 percent of the cuts going to the top 1 percent. In other words, the top 1 percent would see a tax break equivalent to about 1.32 percent of GDP. Clinton may actually be understating the gains the top 1 percent would receive under Trump. The Tax Foundation does not take into account one additional proposal that could affect the bottom line of many one percenters: eliminating the carried interest tax break. Currently, profits from investment funds can be taxed at a personal capital gains tax rate of 23.9 percent rather than the top marginal income rate of 39.6 percent. Taxing these lucrative earnings as ordinary income would raise about $18 billion over 10 years. While Trump’s plan calls for closing this loophole, it could also lower the tax rate since he’s proposing to tax pass-through businesses at a corporate tax rate of 15 percent — an 8.9 percentage point reduction from the current rate applied to hedge fund and private equity profits, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted. Our ruling Clinton said Trump’s tax plan will give the wealthy ""more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two."" After-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of taxpayers increased by 5.4 to 6.7 percent thanks to the Bush tax cuts. The same group would see incomes gains of 10.2 to 19.9 percent under the Trump tax plan, if not more. Measuring it in a different way, the top 1 percent received a tax break equivalent to 0.66 percent of GDP under Bush. Trump’s tax plan would deliver a cut equivalent to 1.32 percent of GDP.

Hillary Clinton claim that US is energy independent goes too far
","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says President Barack Obama’s administration has hindered energy production in the United States. ""Energy is under siege by the Obama administration,"" Trump said at the second presidential debate Oct. 9. ""Under absolute siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies."" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton replied that on the contrary, ""We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent."" Clinton’s claim that the United States is energy independent raised some eyebrows, so we decided to see if it was accurate. Some energy experts we spoke with said the United States is close enough to energy independence that it could prosper without importing energy from unstable or unfriendly countries. Others said the United States isn’t quite there yet, even though it’s trending that way. If the United States only used foreign energy sources, it would clearly be energy dependent. And if it only used domestic energy sources, it would clearly be energy independent. On this spectrum, the United States is definitely closer to independence than dependence, and getting closer every year. But it’s not at full energy independence yet. The United States still consumes about 11 percent more energy than it produces, so it has to import from other nations to meet that need. In 2015, the United States produced 87.9 quadrillion BTUs of energy and used 97.3 quadrillion BTUs, according to the Energy Information Administration, an office of the federal government. The United States imported about 11 quadrillion more BTUs of energy than it exported in 2015. This means ""the U.S. is not energy independent,"" said Kenneth Medlock, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. That said, imports have been trending down significantly since the mid 2000s. The EIA has projected that the United States will switch from a net importer of energy to a net exporter sometime between 2020 and 2030. ""The U.S. is not currently energy independent and, while it is moving toward energy independence, it is not expected to be so for about a decade,"" said Paul Holtberg, leader of the EIA’s Analysis Integration Team.  This shift is happening because of changes in both supply and demand. Domestic natural gas and oil production has skyrocketed since hydraulic fracturing, the extraction method known as fracking, came into regular use in the late 2000s. At the same time, Americans are using less energy as a result of growing efficiency. Clinton said the United States is energy independent for the ""first time ever."" However, going by net imports vs. net exports, the United States is currently a larger net importer than it was from the 1950s (as far back as the EIA data goes) through the 1970s, and again in the mid 1980s. So current net import levels are not unprecedented.  When people think of energy independence, they often think of oil because it’s the one source of energy that the United States has historically imported from potentially unstable areas. While the United States is essentially self-sufficient as it pertains to coal, natural gas and renewable energy sources, it still imports about 24 percent of its oil needs, even with the increase in fracking. Even so, Marilyn Brown, a professor of sustainable systems at Georgia Institute of Technology, told PolitiFact that she thinks the United States is energy independent because it could meet its oil needs from a friendly country, like Mexico or Canada, if the oil market in one of its other top supplier countries became unstable. North America as a whole is arguably energy independent, in that it produces all the energy it consumes on a net basis, several experts pointed out. While Clinton’s claim that the United States is at present energy independent might not be fully correct numerically, the spirit of the claim is on target because the country is becoming less and less dependent on foreign sources, said global energy expert Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director for Energy and Sustainability at University of California, Davis. While the United States is interwoven with the world energy market, if for some reason ""all our fuel had to be produced in the United States, we could do it,"" she said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent."" The United States imports more energy than it exports, and it consumes more energy than it produces domestically. So the United States still relies on foreign energy sources for about 11 percent of its energy consumption needs. However, this import-export gap is trending down. The EIA predicts the United States’ energy exports and imports will balance in the not-so-distant future. That said, imports and exports have been balanced in previous decades. The United States is on track to energy independence, but it’s not there yet. Clinton's statement is not accurate and we rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/11/hillary-clinton/clinton-claim-us-energy-independent-goes-too-far/

Rubio mischaracterizes his own position on abortions for pregnant women with Zika
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio misrepresented his stance on abortion for pregnant women with Zika in a new Spanish-language campaign ad trying to discredit his Democratic challenger. In the ad, released Oct. 4, 2016, a speaker says U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy ""lies about Marco Rubio, when Marco has been there for us."" The screen lifts an image from a prior Murphy campaign ad showing a woman standing on a beach with the words, ""Marco Rubio: 'No abortions for Zika-infected women.' "" It then shows Murphy with a stamped ""FALSE."" Murphy and groups that support abortion rights have repeatedly attacked Rubio for saying he didn’t believe in allowing abortions for pregnant women with the Zika virus, which has been linked to microcephaly in newborns. And the reason they’ve attacked him is because that’s what Rubio said. On the record In an Aug. 8, 2016, story in Politico, Rubio told reporter Marc Caputo he did not believe infected women had a right to an abortion, even if they suspected their child might be born with the birth defects associated with microcephaly. The quotation in the commercial refers to the story's headline. ""I understand a lot of people disagree with my view — but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws,"" Rubio said. ""And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it’s a difficult question and a hard one. But if I’m going to err, I’m going to err on the side of life."" The comments came as Congress struggled over funding emergency relief for the disease, which has spread in Florida and nationwide over the summer. Politico’s story was widely cited by other outlets afterward. Murphy and Rubio have batted attacks on Zika funding back and forth during the Senate campaign. Murphy has attacked Rubio’s stance on potential abortions in statements and a campaign ad. But this is the first time Rubio has said the Jupiter Democrat is misrepresenting him. There hasn’t been an English-language counterpart repeating Rubio’s claim. His campaign did release an ad in September accusing Murphy of not telling the truth, but that ad omitted the Zika claim. Rubio’s campaign did not respond when we asked them why they said Murphy was lying about the subject. Spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas did not specify to the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee bureau, either, only telling reporter Kristen Clark that Murphy has ""repeatedly distorted Marco's record."" Just to be sure Rubio wasn’t misquoted, we double-checked with Politico’s Caputo, who said he had ensured Rubio knew what he was going to write about the senator’s opinion. He said Rubio did not object. Caputo also noted the campaign had not disputed the story after it published. ""They never said it was false,"" Caputo told PolitiFact Florida. ""They never expressed any doubt whatsoever.""    Murphy’s campaign stood by their characterization of Rubio’s position. ""Either Rubio is silently flip-flopping on his pro-life stance and forgot to let voters know, or he is blatantly lying in this ad,"" Murphy spokeswoman Galia Slayen said in a statement. Our ruling Rubio said Murphy wrongly conveyed Rubio's stance on abortion for women infected by Zika. In a Spanish-language ad, Rubio disputed the notion that he does not believe in allowing pregnant women to get an abortion if they suspect their baby may suffer from Zika-related birth defects. Rubio confirmed that stance in an August story in Politico, which Murphy has subsequently cited. Unless Rubio has changed his position, which he hasn’t stated publicly, the ad is wrong about Murphy misrepresenting Rubio’s stance. We rate the statement False.

Mitt Romney repeats claim that repealing health law saves $95 billion a year
","
One of Mitt Romney’s favorite talking points is the need to shrink the federal government. The former Massachusetts governor says he will cut government spending and reduce taxes if elected president.

Where would he start? With the national health reform plan signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

""The number one to cut is Obamacare. That saves $95 billion a year,"" Romney said in a primary debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 8, 2012.

That savings figure is one he has cited before, and we found it to be incorrect.

The national health care law leaves in place existing insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor while reducing the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. It includes an individual mandate, requiring almost every American to acquire insurance or pay a fine. And employers that don't offer health insurance to their employees will have to pay fines, with a few exceptions.

For backup to his savings claim, Romney’s campaign cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agency that independently calculates the cost of proposed laws. In February 2011, the CBO published an analysis of a Republican measure to fully repeal the health care law. The analysis was for H.R. 2, ""the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act,"" a simple repeal bill that House Republicans approved on Jan. 19, 2011.

On page 5 of that report, the CBO projected $95 billion less in outlays in 2016 if the law is repealed.

But it’s important to note that repealing the health care law doesn’t only cut spending. The law had many moving parts, some of which were revenue sources to offset the spending and reduce the overall federal deficit.

The law spent money on providing tax subsidies to help people buy insurance and by expanding Medicaid. But it offset those additional costs by slowing the growth of future spending on Medicare. And, it generated revenues by creating new excise taxes on high-cost health insurance plans (the ""Cadillac"" plans); adding new Medicare taxes on people with high incomes; and charging new fees to health insurance companies and health care manufacturers.
   
In other words, fully repealing the law would also repeal mechanisms that reduce the deficit, such as cost reductions and higher taxes.

When the CBO looked at the first 10 years of repeal, from 2012 to 2021, it found that repeal added $210 billion to the deficit. So the deficit would actually be lower if the law is not repealed.

Our ruling

Romney said repealing the health care law would save $95 billion a year. But that only accounts for outlays in one year, 2016. Because of the revenue sources that the law established, repealing it actually adds significantly to the deficit over the long haul, according to the CBO.

Public hearing on Wisconsin mining held ""15 hours away"" from mine region, Rep. Kelda Helen Roys says
","
Passions run high over whether Wisconsin should allow a four-mile, 1,000-foot-deep iron ore mine near Hurley, a burg perched on the state’s northern border that brags of ""wilderness, waterfalls and wildlife.""

And passions can sometimes lead to exaggeration.

In a news release issued Jan. 5, 2012, state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, D-Madison, complained that a hearing on speeding the approval process for new mines was held in southeastern Wisconsin -- ""15 hours away"" from the mine region.

Whoa. Stop the car.

We love to drive through Wisconsin, but it seems like after 15 hours in the car, we’d be able to get from one end of the state to the other. And back. With plenty of time for potty breaks.

To be sure, the distance question isn’t the most important issue in the mining debate. But the statement underlines how high the emotions are on the issue.

Instead of driving the distance ourselves, we asked Roy, an attorney for her evidence.

In her original news release, Roys cheered the fact that a Republican-controlled committee of the state Assembly, which is considering legislation to change the mine approval process, had changed course and decided to hold a public hearing on the measure in Hurley.

The panel had held a hearingon the bill Dec. 14, 2011 near Milwaukee, which is a major center for mining equipment manufacturing. But only after two angry Assembly Democrats scheduled their own hearing for Jan. 7, 2012 in Ashland, much closer to Hurley, did the committee set a hearing in Hurley for Jan. 11, 2012. That led the Democrats to cancel their hearing.

""I am pleased that the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy and Small Business has reconsidered and will now hold a public hearing in Hurley on the bill to permit a giant strip mine in northern Wisconsin,"" Roys began her news release.

""It remains unclear why the original plan was to have the only hearing in Milwaukee -- 15 hours away from those most directly affected.""

Hurley and Milwaukee -- actually, the first hearing was held at State Fair Park in suburban West Allis -- are on opposite ends of the state.

But Mapquest tells us the drive from Hurley to West Allis is about 300 miles and 5-1/2 hours by one route, or about 320 miles and 6-1/2 hours by another.

Roy’s response: We should not be measuring the distance from West Allis to Hurley, but rather to communities to the north and west of Hurley such as Ashland and Superior. They are home to ""lakes, streams, wetlands and groundwater that would be impacted"" by the mine, she said.

And we shouldn’t just measure the distance there, she said. We should measure it there and back.

In bad weather.

For residents of those communities, Roys said, ""it was indeed a 15-hour round-trip drive, through snow and inclement weather,"" to West Allis.

But that’s setting the claim on a whole new road.

Roys had complained that the West Allis hearing was held ""15 hours away from those most directly affected"" -- in other words, claiming it would take a person 15 hours to drive to the hearing from northwestern Wisconsin.

Roys also said that according to Google maps, ""it takes 14 hours and 1 minute to travel the 772 miles from Port Wing,"" which is between Ashland and Superior.

But then she goes on to acknowledge that that distance and duration would be round-trip between Port Wing and West Allis, not one way.

Indeed, Mapquest shows that the longer of two driving routes between West Allis and Port Wing is 385 miles and just over seven hours one way.  

Roys concluded her email by telling us not to ""miss the bigger point here,"" saying it was ""an extremely long and inconvenient drive"" for northwest Wisconsin residents to attend the West Allis hearing.

OK.

It is, indeed, a lengthy drive from northwestern Wisconsin to West Allis. About seven hours long, or less. Not 15.

Bob Menendez attacked by GOP challenger over federal debt increases
","
Republican Anna Little wants to kick U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez out of office this year, but she doesn’t seem to know much about the Democratic senator’s record when it comes to increasing the federal debt.

On her campaign website -- ""Little for Senate"" -- the former Monmouth County freeholder sounded the alarm about Menendez’s spending habits with a message entitled ""Stop Debt! Stop Bob Menendez!""

""Bob Menendez just voted to increase the government's debt ceiling to $1.9 TRILLION! In his 19 years in Congress, Menendez has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt,"" the message continued. ""Who will pay? Your children? Your grandchildren? Menendez doesn't seem to care.""

After reviewing Menendez’s voting records, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Little’s statement is far from the truth. The senator voted against the most recent debt ceiling increase and he has opposed some of the legislation that experts say contributed to the rising federal debt.

However, Menendez has voted for other bills -- such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus) -- that helped put the nation in greater debt. Menendez served as a congressman between 1993 and 2006, when he joined the Senate.

Larry Cirignano, Little’s campaign manager, acknowledged that the message should not have said Menendez just voted for a debt ceiling increase, but he maintained that Menendez is ""spending money we don’t have."" 
Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said the senator has always taken the nation’s deficit seriously, but he believes the issue must be addressed in a way that protects the middle class and ""asks the wealthiest Americans and big corporations to pay their fair share.""

First, let’s explain the most recent debt ceiling increase.

In early August, President Barack Obama and Congress reached an agreement to raise the nation’s debt ceiling by up to $2.4 trillion for a new limit of about $16.6 trillion. But Menendez voted against that deal.

The senator supported a previous debt ceiling increase of $1.9 trillion, but that vote occurred about two years ago. Little’s statement claims Menendez ""just voted"" for a debt ceiling increase, giving readers the impression that she is referring to the most recent increase.

Now, let’s turn to Little’s other claim that ""Menendez has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt.""

The total federal debt has exceeded $15 trillion, the result of military conflicts, legislative actions and overall economic conditions. We focused on Menendez’s voting record in regard to previous debt ceiling adjustments and certain legislation that contributed to the higher debt.

In both categories, Menendez comes away with a mixed record.

Before the most recent debt ceiling deal, there were 16 debt limit adjustments during Menendez’s tenure. Menendez supported 11 of those measures, and rejected five.

The nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative in April identified various legislative actions that contributed to debt increases between 2001 and 2011. Those changes include tax cuts enacted in 2001, 2003 and December 2010; the Medicare Part D program; and the stimulus.

Of those five examples, Menendez voted against three of them -- the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003; and the Medicare Part D program. But he supported the stimulus bill and the December 2010 tax legislation.

Two experts we contacted also pointed out how the weak economy contributed to the higher debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits.

Jason Peuquet, a policy analyst with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, added in an email: ""But one of the largest single factors has been the economic downturn, which is difficult to assign blame for.""

Our ruling

On her campaign website, Little claimed Menendez ""just voted"" for a debt ceiling increase and that he ""has helped overspend America over $15 TRILLION into debt.""

But Menendez voted against the most recent debt ceiling increase, and he has a mixed record in regard to past legislative actions that contributed to the higher debt. For example, he rejected tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, but supported the stimulus bill in 2009 and tax cuts in December 2010.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says development of renewable energy will “get us off” foreign oil
","The environmental benefits of renewable energy are pretty clear, but the economics can still be muddy. Installing wind turbines and solar panels is expensive. That’s why grants, low-interest loans and tax credits are so important to the industry.

A key federal incentive came up for debate Dec. 13 on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  At issue was the future of the 1603 Treasury grant program, which was created as part of the Obama administration’s stimulus package in 2009. The program offered grants equal to 30 percent of a renewable energy project’s cost.

In what would ultimately be an unsuccessful fight to extend the grant program into 2012, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke up at the hearing. In prepared remarks, he said the program is vital to the industry and that its termination would threaten jobs and projects.

""Let me just bring it home,"" Whitehouse said, as he referred to his notes. ""In Rhode Island, this [grant program] has facilitated solar panel installations on three new bank branches. The TD Bank has opened up in Barrington, in East Providence and in Johnston, Rhode Island. Those projects created jobs, they put people to work, they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy, and they get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""

That’s a lot of potential benefits from TD Bank’s projects, but we’re interested in just one of them -- that the development of solar power and other forms of renewable energy will, in the senator’s words, ""get us off foreign oil.""

PolitiFact Rhode Island assessed a similar claim last March after state Rep. Jon Brien said that a proposed waste-to-energy plant in Woonsocket was needed because ""residents are paying through the nose for electricity fueled by foreign oil."" We ruled the statement Pants on Fire because New England -- and, in fact, the nation as a whole -- gets only a tiny fraction of its electricity from oil-fired power plants.

We thought we should revisit the issue, however, because it’s a claim that comes up frequently in support of renewable energy. Whitehouse takes it a step further by framing the issue in terms of national security.

The foundation of the claim is the presumption that the United States uses oil to generate its electricity.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency under the Department of Energy, in 2010, petroleum was used to generate less than 1 percent of the country’s power. More than two thirds of the electricity in the United States came from burning coal and natural gas, with much of the balance from nuclear energy and hydroelectric power. Oil is seldom used because its cost has risen so high.

As for Rhode Island, the state is part of the New England power grid in which electricity flows across state lines. In 2010, 0.4 percent of New England’s power was fueled by oil, according to a chart provided by ISO-New England, the nonprofit that manages the grid.

Natural gas plants provided the most power with a share of 32 percent, followed by nuclear stations (29 percent), dual-fuel plants that can burn natural gas and oil (12 percent), coal plants (11 percent), hydropower facilities (6 percent), other renewable energy sources (6 percent) and imported energy from New York and Canada (4 percent).

There are plants in New England that use oil. For example, one of Brayton Point Power Station’s units burns oil, generating 28 percent of the facility’s output, according to a spokesman for Dominion Generation.

But other oil-burning plants don’t operate as much these days -- in fact, many go on line only when demand is highest, say, on hot summer days when air conditioners are turned up -- because oil is so expensive and natural gas, especially, is so cheap.

In Rhode Island, of the nine significant power plants in the state, only three can use oil as well as natural gas, according to Thomas Kogut, spokesman for the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. The rest exclusively use natural gas.

The only plant that relies entirely on oil is on Block Island and serves only about 1,000 people for most of the year. Only a fraction of 1 percent of the state’s electric generation came from oil in 2010.

But there is something else. After asking for an explanation of Whitehouse’s comments, his office did point out one way that renewable energy would lessen oil usage. Seth Larson, spokesman for the senator, referred to the New England power grid and what happens on peak demand days in the summer.

On those days, usage spikes, going from a typical load of, say, 18,000 megawatts, to 25,000 megawatts or more. In order to meet demand, oil-fired plants kick on.

Despite the high costs, these power plants come on line because there’s no alternative source of power. Larson said that if more renewable energy is developed it will reduce the need to use oil when the grid is stretched.

ISO-New England confirmed that oil is used more on days when demand for power is high. For example, on July 22, 2011, the second-highest demand day ever in the region, oil provided 14 percent of the grid’s power, according to a spokeswoman for ISO-New England. But days like that are isolated and the amount of oil used doesn’t add up to much relative to annual totals.

We also checked with Seth Kaplan, vice president of policy and climate advocacy at the Conservation Law Foundation, a regional environmental advocacy group. He said that renewable energy can make a real difference when demand for power spikes. And peak demand days, he said, typically occur on sunny days when solar power systems perform best.

Kaplan also said that there is a larger point to be made in reference to Whitehouse’s comments. Reducing the country’s reliance on oil is a process. If more sources of renewable energy come on line and if those sources are used to power electric and hybrid vehicles, then demand for oil could drop significantly. That’s because the bulk of the oil used in the United States -- 72 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration -- goes to fueling cars, trucks and planes.

Before we make our ruling, there are other issues with Whitehouse’s comments about the importance of the 1603 grant program that need to be pointed out. Along with TD Bank’s solar power systems, he cites three other projects in Rhode Island that were helped by the grants: a wind turbine at Hodges Badge Company in Portsmouth, a proposed solar farm in East Providence and three wind turbines that are set to go up at the Narragansett Bay Commission in Providence.

There are problems with some of his examples and details that need to be clarified with others.

TD Bank did indeed benefit from Treasury grants, but a spokesman for the company said the projects would have been done with or without federal assistance. In other words, the grants were not crucial to their development.

In his remarks, Whitehouse said that Hodges Badge ""has just gone completely green energy."" At the time, however, the company’s turbine had not been installed. It wasn’t put up until Jan. 4. Hodges Badge has been approved for a Treasury grant but has yet to receive the money, said Rick Hodges, president of the company.

The Narragansett Bay Commission has started construction on three wind turbines at its Fields Point facility on the Providence waterfront, but the project is receiving no money whatsoever from the Treasury program. Because it’s a quasi-public agency, it would never have qualified for the grants, said Jamie Samons, spokeswoman for the commission.

The solar farm being planned in East Providence did not receive a Treasury grant because not enough work was done on the project before the program expired. Jeanne Boyle, director of city planning, said East Providence could have qualified for a grant because it has partnered in the project with a private developer. Despite the termination of the 1603 program, the project is still in the works.

Our ruling

Whitehouse said on the Senate floor that renewable energy projects would ""get us off foreign oil"" and away from ""foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply.""

His comments demand further explanation.

Oil-powered plants provide a tiny amount of the power used in Rhode Island. That’s also true for New England. And the United States as a whole. For the most part, these plants only come on line when demand is highest a few times a year.

But a layperson would assume something different from the senator’s statement -- that oil is a large part of our generating supply and that alternative energy projects would substantially reduce oil consumption.

The truth is investments in solar and wind power, such as the projects the senator cites, won’t have a large effect on oil consumption.

Because of this misimpression -- and because of the other inaccuracies in Whitehouse’s speech that we noted -- our ruling on the claim is Mostly False.

"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Income', 'Jobs', 'Poverty', 'Workers', 'Matt  Wingard']","
Is Oregon’s per capita income nine percent below the national average -- and does that mean we’re getting poorer?
","
Oregon Rep. Matt Wingard and other House Republicans have vowed to unveil a jobs package in time for the February legislative session, saying that Oregonians are growing poorer.

""Oregon’s per capita income is 9 percent below the national average and getting worse. This is a state that’s actually getting poorer. My Republican colleagues and I are determined to change that trajectory,"" the Wilsonville Republican said in a news post at OregonCatalyst.

PolitiFact Oregon hadn’t been keeping up with the latest in per capita personal income statistics so we wanted to know if the 9 percent figure was accurate. More important, we wanted to know if indeed the gap is getting worse and if we are getting poorer.

First, what is ""per capita personal income""? Don’t fear the phrase. It’s just a fancy term for what happens if you add all the personal income received by all Oregonians from all sources and divide by the number of residents.

Next, is Wingard’s number correct? Pretty much yes. Per capita personal income in Oregon in 2009 totaled $38,833 -- 8.4 percent lower than the national average of $42,408, according to recent figures by the Oregon Employment Department.

In 2010, Oregon totaled $40,475 per person -- 8.8 percent below the national average of $44,384. So the gap widened a teeny bit between 2009 and 2010.

Two more questions then: Is the gap getting worse? And does that mean we are actually getting poorer?

Apparently this is a hot topic, with economists and business advocates arguing over how much weight to give per capita personal income in judging the state’s economic health.

John Tapogna of EcoNorthwest argues income is a significant measure because our state relies so heavily on personal income for public services. His studies for the Oregon Business Council and others find that the Portland-metro area lags behind other cities such as Seattle and Denver.

""In the middle to late ‘90s we went from being a slight over-performer on income to a slight under-performer on income. Seattle, Minneapolis and Denver have persistently stayed as over-performers,"" he said.

Chuck Sheketoff of the Oregon Center for Public Policy finds over-reliance on the statistic ""misleading, and how we rank relative to the rest of the nation is misleading."" The per capita personal income in Oregon has increased most years, he notes correctly.

""If personal income is your measure, we’re doing better,"" he said.

PolitiFact Oregon also found a report by the Oregon Employment Department called ""Why Oregon Trails the Nation."" It’s a detailed explanation of why our per capita personal income is lower than the national average, and more important, what that means.

""The two main reasons for the growing gap are slower earnings growth for Oregon workers when compared with the nation and a state population that has grown much faster than the nation in recent years,"" the authors write in the summary.

Simply put, Oregonians don’t make as much money as people in other states, and the growth in population further flattens per-person income. Our per capita personal income has increased, but not fast enough to keep up with the national average, and not fast enough as it relates to population growth.

Does the gap mean that we are getting poorer?

""By this one measure, Oregon is a lot poorer than it was in the late ‘70s as compared to the rest of the nation,"" said Nick Beleiciks, an economist with the Oregon Employment Department. And we’re poorer -- again, as compared with the rest of the nation -- than in 1996, when Oregon reached its high tech high and lagged the national average by 3 percent.

But ""over the last four years, 2007-10, we really haven’t changed much,"" Beleiciks said.

Here’s the other thing: The Employment Department report states that adjusted for inflation Oregon's per capita personal income rose in the last decade and has risen consistently during most of the last 70 years. It went from around $25,000 in 1990 to $40,475 in 2010. 

So, as Sheketoff said, it’s hard to argue that the state is getting poorer when the per capita personal income has grown most years.

We turned to Wingard to get his take. He stands by the sentiment of his quote, because, he said, there’s no reason why Washington should be doing so much better than Oregon.

""The fact of the matter is we used to track very closely with Washington state and we’ve left that trajectory,"" he said. ""I do feel this state is getting poorer … It might look favorable in the short term, but not in the long term.""

All right, that sheds more context on his statement. And he’s right that in the 1970s Oregon and Washington were on par with the national average, but Washington has always outperformed Oregon.  

We’re going to throw in two more nuggets from the Employment Department report. One, researchers found that even if Oregon attracted 10,000 jobs each paying an annual salary of $100,000, per capita personal income would rise only six-tenths of one percentage point. So even with a bumper crop of new jobs, we’d still look relatively ""poor.""

Two, there are a handful of other states and D.C. that throw the national average out of whack. Wyoming, for example, is oil rich but not people rich so the per capita personal income is high. Removing those areas would reduce the gap by 3.8 percentage points.

So what do we know?

Wingard is correct that we lag the national average by around 9 percent. We are poorer than we were in the 1970s or even in 2000, relative to other states.

Hutchison says getting millionaires off food stamps, unemployment would save $20 million
","
Clarification, 1:44 p.m., Jan. 18, 2012:  This fact check correctly says millionaires don’t qualify for food stamps because households with net income above the poverty level are not eligible. Still, as a reader reminded us, someone with paper assets of $1 million or more – such as valuable property – could qualify for food stamps so long as net income is below the poverty level. We’ve added this wrinkle to the story. It does not change our rating. 
As plans to extend a nationwide payroll tax cut worked their way through Congress, Texas’ senior senator fielded a question Dec. 12, 2011, on CNN about how the government could make up for lost revenues -- perhaps $180 billion to $200 billion over ten years.

One proposal that Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison gave: ""We’re going to take millionaires off food stamps and unemployment insurance which, amazingly, would save $20 million.""

Although Congress passed a two-month extension of payroll tax cuts Dec. 23, 2011, the House proposal to extend the cuts for a year awaits consideration -- and it contains the ""millionaire"" modifications. The cuts reduce from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent the amount of eligible earnings taken from Americans’ paychecks to help pay for Social Security.

We wondered if Hutchison was right that taking millionaires off food stamps and unemployment insurance would save $20 million.

We realized, for starters, that millionaires already don’t qualify for food stamps.

PolitiFact reported in a related fact-check Dec. 1, 2011, that the food stamp program, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is only open to households where net income is below the federal poverty level -- this year, $1,863 a month for a household of four. 
One wrinkle: It’s possible that a household with paper assets of $1 million or more could still qualify, still only if its net income is sufficiently low.

By email, U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Aaron Lavallee told us that the department knows of ""only one case and one alleged case involving individuals with assets over $1 million"" getting SNAP benefits. Lavallee said the confirmed case -- a Michigan man who made headlines in May 2011 for using food stamps despite winning $2 million in a lottery -- was removed from the program and the second case is being investigated.

Mindful there’s no savings in barring millionaires from food stamps, we wondered next how many millionaires collect unemployment insurance. Annual counts of millionaires on unemployment, based on IRS data, appeared in an Oct. 1, 2010, Bloomberg news story and a Nov. 13, 2011, report by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma: 
  
The Bloomberg article also tells why millionaires can collect: As insurance, rather than welfare, benefits aren’t paid out according to need but according to whether a person has become unemployed. There’s no income test. 
And how did Hutchison reach her savings figure? Her spokesman Jeff Nelligan sent us a House Ways and Means Committee breakdown of the House’s payroll tax cut proposal, and directed us to the section describing how it would target millionaires by requiring them to pay a 100-percent tax rate on any received unemployment benefits. That is, any benefits received would have to be paid back.

The Ways and Means breakdown says that making millionaires pay back their unemployment benefits would reduce the federal deficit by $20 million over 2012-2021. Citing Congress’ bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the breakdown says that all told, the government would save $127 million in unemployment benefits that it would not have to pay, but lose $107 million in revenue due to fewer millionaires collecting benefits -- partly because some (or all) millionaires won’t apply for unemployment if the provision passes into law. These figures also appeared in a Dec. 9, 2011, Congressional Budget Office report.

Result: The projected savings -- or more precisely, the 10-year decrease in the federal deficit -- is $20 million.

Finally, we wondered why the government would lose $107 million if the anti-millionaire provision becomes law.

Jim Billimoria, communications director for the Ways and Means Committee, told us that when the government writes fewer unemployment checks: 
We contacted the CBO and JCT seeking the basis of the $107 million estimate. JCT chief of staff Thomas Barthold told us its estimate took into account predicted income growth, changes in income distribution and projected unemployment insurance claims for the 10-year period.

Our ruling

Hutchison said that getting millionaires off unemployment and food stamps would save the government $20 million -- though she doesn’t acknowledge that millionaires are already barred from the food-stamp program; there’s no new savings possible on that front.

Mitt Romney says U.S. income is almost 50 percent higher than in Europe
","
Recently on the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has used a talking point that favorably compares the United States to Europe.

On Dec. 28, 2011, Romney sat down for a a 90-minute conversation with the Quad-City Times editorial board in Iowa. During that session, Romney said that ""our income, our GDP per capita, is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European.""

Romney said this discrepancy demonstrates the strength of the United States’ system of free enterprise. ""I don't want to see a president messing with that,"" he said, ""because it will kill the spirit that makes us the powerhouse we are."" (Suggesting that Obama-era America is a danger to free-market capitalism has been a theme for Romney, who has also claimed that ""we're inches away from no longer having a free economy"" -- a statement we rated Pants on Fire.)

A reader asked us to check out the comparison with Europe, so we did.

We turned to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that analyzes trends in advanced industrialized countries. One of the statistics the OECD calculates is gross domestic product per capita, measured in constant U.S. dollars and adjusted for the cost of goods in different nations.

By this measure, GDP per capita in the U.S. in 2010 was $41,976, compared to $27,533 for the European Union nations. If you compare the two, the U.S. does indeed have a 52 percent higher GDP per capita.

So Romney is on solid ground. But there are some caveats worth noting:

The European Union vs the Euro Zone. The 27-nation European Union includes a broad range of countries, from wealthy (United Kingdom, France, Sweden) to formerly communist and less-wealthy (Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland and Romania). A tighter group  -- and one that includes fewer of the less-wealthy nations, possibly making it a fairer comparison to the U.S. -- consists of the 17 countries that use the Euro.

As it happens, the OECD also calculated GDP per capita for the Euro Zone nations and found the average was $29,885. Using this comparison, the U.S. level is just under 44 percent higher. That’s not dramatically different, but it does fall short of 50 percent higher than the European level.

Who’s not included. Neither Euro Zone nor the European Union includes two of the richest countries in Europe -- Norway and Switzerland. GDP per capita was $46,908 in Norway -- a level that’s higher than the U.S. -- and $37,775 in Switzerland. If these two countries were added to the calculations, the U.S. advantage would shrink.

Holiday and vacation time. By statute, workers in Europe are promised much more vacation and holiday time than workers in the U.S. According to the OECD, workers in 17 European countries work fewer hours than workers in the U.S. Adding holiday and vacation time often means either lower levels of income accumulated from wages, or lower salaries.

""If a German gives up some pay to take four more weeks of vacation than an American, he is reported to be poorer, but that may not be the best way to see it,"" said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that specializes in international economics.

GDP per capita vs. median income. This is probably the biggest factor, because a relatively small number of very rich people can skew GDP per capita higher than one would get by comparing median income, which refers to the household that places halfway between the highest- and lowest-income households. Many economists would argue that a fairer measurement of countries would use median income.

""If the 300 richest people each see their income rise by an average of $1 billion a year, in per capita terms, this would raise our income by $1,000 a year,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""Not many people would feel better as a result of this gain.""

Data on median incomes is harder to find, but we located some OECD data from the mid 2000s. By our calculation, median income in the United States was only about 33 percent higher than it was for the 22 European OECD members -- $26,990, compared to $20,264. So by this measure, the U.S. is still higher than Europe, but not as dramatically as Romney’s ""almost 50 percent"" figure would suggest.

Our ruling

Gross domestic product per capita may not offer the fairest comparison between the U.S. and Europe, mainly because it doesn’t take into account the European trade-off between income and leisure and because it effectively gives heavier weight to a small number of very rich Americans. In addition, there are a number of ways to define ""Europe,"" some of which weaken the accuracy of Romney's statement. 
Still, as Romney phrased it -- that the United States’ ""GDP per capita is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European"" -- his claim has merit. It’s actually slightly over 50 percent by that measure. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/06/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-income-almost-50-percent-highe/

How important was Romney in fixing troubled Salt Lake Olympic games?
","
Mitt Romney portrays himself as an able manager as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for president. In addition to his tenure as governor of Massachusetts and two stints leading the buyout firm Bain Capital, he also has cited his role as chief executive officer of the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee in the run-up to the 2002 Winter Olympics.

On the stump and in commercials, the Olympics are used to promote the image of Romney as a problem-solving turnaround specialist. In a campaign video titled ""Leader,"" Romney says, ""I worked at one company, Bain, for 25 years. And I left that to go off and help save the Olympic games.""

So, did Romney really ""help save the Olympic games?"" That's a broad claim. Was he successful at not just fixing the Salt Lake Olympics, but also saving the Olympic tradition?

Romney left Bain in early 1999 to take over leadership of the games in the aftermath of a bribery scandal that ultimately exposed years of widespread corruption by members of the International Olympic Committee and their counterparts in host cities during the bidding process used to award the games.

The initial focus in the late 1990s was on Salt Lake City, where the scandal forced several of the city’s Olympic officials to quit and the mayor to step down. It threatened to scare away corporate sponsors whose advertising dollars would be vital to helping to fund the games.

An internal investigation pointed the finger at two key Olympic organizers who were among the officials who had been forced out, and the SLOC was reorganized. But with two years until the games were set to begin, officials needed someone who help restore credibility to the organization. Romney, a Mormon whose family has deep roots in the state and who attended Brigham Young University, was called in from Boston to clean up the mess.

It was a pivotal moment for Romney, who had rejoined Bain after his failed 1994 bid to unseat Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. The Salt Lake assignment launched him into the national spotlight and helped reboot his political career. It also served as a springboard to his successful 2002 gubernatorial campaign.

Next month will mark the 10th anniversary of the Salt Lake games, which turned a profit and were well-reviewed at the time. The Romney campaign points to that success as a prime example of his vaunted managerial acumen. Romney even wrote a book about it -- Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games.

Many who worked closely with Romney in Salt Lake praise his Olympic work. One of them, Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor who tabbed Romney to lead SLOC, now campaigns for Romney.

Mark Lewis worked for the International Olympic Committee when Romney hired him to help recruit additional corporations to help fund the games. SLOC’s effort to attract sponsors had come to a virtual standstill, Lewis said, with the bribery scandal and subsequent federal investigation casting a shadow over the organization.

""Things were in pretty bad shape,"" Lewis said. ""There was a significant budget deficit. There was also a crisis in confidence.""

Lewis, who now lives in Montana and is president of Jet Set Sports, which provides hospitality services at the Olympics for corporations, said he traveled with Romney to boardrooms and watched him make the pitch as to why the Salt Lake games were still a good bet.

""It’s a pretty tough sell to go out to a company and say you should pay money to be associated with us,"" Lewis said. He said Romney’s sales job persuaded them to contribute.

""I came into this not knowing Mitt,"" said Lewis, who is a state finance chairman for Romney in Montana. ""I can tell you without hesitation he is one of the most amazing people I’ve ever worked with.""

Mark Tanner was the chief financial officer for the SLOC before Romney was hired.

""The games weren’t in shambles, but they needed more money,"" said Tanner, who left for a corporate position shortly after Romney was brought in and now works for an educational nonprofit in San Diego.

Even though the games had attracted a number of sponsors, many had fulfilled pledges through in-kind donations instead of money. ""It was very straightforward that we needed more cash,"" Tanner said. ""Mitt was a really quick study.""

History intervened as well. Just five months before the games came the 9/11 attacks, which changed attitudes in Washington about supporting the games financially. Tanner said winning federal backing had been a tough sell during his tenure.

""That was money that was not available before,"" he said.

Under Romney's leadership, the Olympic committee, which had about a $1.3 billion operating budget, ultimately brought in tens of millions in profits, enough to set aside $40 million to create a fund that owns and maintains the Olympic facilities that were built for the games.

Not everyone is ready to declare Romney a gold medal winner for his Olympic performance. David Wallechinsky is an author and the vice president of the International Society of Olympic Historians.

He said the Romney improved the situation in Salt Lake, but that the claim in the Romney ad, that he ""helped save the Olympics"" is too broad. The bribery scandal was a low point for the Olympic movement, Wallechinsky said, but it wasn’t an existential threat.

""It wasn’t going to threaten the Olympic movement, which survived two world wars, major boycotts and terrorist attacks,"" Wallechinsky said.

Our ruling

While it may be stretch to suggest the future of Olympics themselves were at stake during Romney’s time in Salt Lake, by all accounts, he did help the city’s moribund Olympic committee reverse its fortunes after an embarrassing scandal and brought the 2002 Winter Olympics to a successful conclusion.

Gov. Bob McDonnell says he's proposed record contribution to state pension
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell has proposed spending an additional $2.2 billion on state employee and teacher pensions during a two-year budget period that will begin July 1.

The governor, in presenting his biennial budget plan to the General Assembly’s money committees on Dec. 19, said his pension proposal, if approved, would be ""the largest employer contribution to the Virginia Retirement System in history.""

We wondered whether the total $2.21 billion infusion over two budget years would truly be historic.

Since taking office in 2010, McDonnell has made a number of proposals to reform the Virginia Retirement System, which is an estimated $19.9 billion short of the assets needed to pay its projected pension liabilities over the next 85 years. But the governor also added to VRS’s woes early in his term by convincing the legislature to divert $620 million in scheduled pension contributions to balance the state’s general fund, which pays for education, public safety and health programs.

Under McDonnell’s new proposal, Virginia would pay roughly $600 million for state employee pensions during the 2013-14 budget years. Another $1.6 billion would be contributed to teacher retirement funds, with local governments picking up $1 billion of the sum and the state government paying $600 million.

Tucker Martin, McDonnell’s director of communications, told us the governor’s claim that the $2.21 billion total contributions would be historic was based on VRS data.

The VRS figures show the largest employer contribution to date came in the 2007-08 biennial budget when total state and local contributions were $1.72 billion. That’s lower than McDonnell’s proposal.

The retirement system started in 1942, but VRS doesn’t have records of employer contributions before 1973.

Jeanne Chenault, a VRS spokeswoman, said the number of teachers and state employees before 1973 would have been lower, so it’s unlikely that contribution amounts would have exceeded 1973 levels.

The VRS data shows annual contribution amounts without adjusting for inflation. So we did that work ourselves to see McDonnell’s claim could survive another test.

It did. Even when adjusting for inflation, the 2007-08 contributions were still the high-water mark for employer contributions to the pension system, coming in at just more than $1.8 billion in current dollars. McDonnell’s proposal eclipses that.

Our Ruling:

The governor said his proposed $2.21 billion employer contribution for state worker and teacher pensions would be the largest in VRS history.

For as far back as the data goes, the governor’s statement is correct even when adjusting for inflation.

Ad says President Barack Obama put in place 'historic fuel efficiency standards'
","
With all eyes on Iowa for the Republican caucuses in the first days of 2012, the Democratic contender for president reminded watchers of his own Iowa win — and what he has done to keep his campaign promises.

Obama for America bought banner ads across the home page of the online Des Moines Register on Jan. 3, 2012, with a link to highlights from Obama's 2008 victory speech.

Music plays as candidate Barack Obama promises action on health care, taxes, energy independence and the war in Iraq. Between clips, white text across the screen highlights President Obama's policy accomplishments.

For example, after candidate Obama declares, ""I'll be a president who harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all!"" the next three screens show an image of him driving a car and the words: ""Put in place historic fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks to lower costs at the pump and reduce dependence on foreign oil.""

We wondered, did Obama do that?

New standards

Obama has announced new fuel economy standards — more than once — taking part in the bipartisan practice of updating rules in place since the 1970s Arab oil embargo.

The most recent update, announced in July 2011, covers cars and light trucks made from 2017-2025, requiring an average of 54.5 miles per gallon in 2025.

The year before, a new rule required cars and light trucks combined to get an average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. (PolitiFact in April 2010 weighed his campaign promise to ""increase fuel economy standards,"" and ruled it a Promise Kept.)

But were those changes ""historic""? (Which we take to mean in some way unprecedented, or as Merriam-Webster puts it ""having great and lasting importance."")

""A lot of what Obama's doing is really extending what President Bush started,"" said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for automotive information site Edmunds.com.

And President George W. Bush extended work started by his predecessors.

Still, Obama's push for the first time will require medium- and heavy-duty trucks to meet fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards, starting in 2014. It's also twice as long as previous plans. Meanwhile, while automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won't carry companies through lofty goals set for the end of the decade.

""There has to be some kind of breakthrough, and nobody knows what it's going to be,"" he said.

'Lower costs at the pump'

Will those changes lower costs at the pump, as the ad said?

The White House, along with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, argue a family that buys a new vehicle in 2025 will save $8,200 in fuel costs compared with driving a similar one in 2010. 

Of course, those savings are likely to be offset by the higher sticker prices on the cars themselves, since meeting the 2025 standards will require expensive technology — now in just a few, mostly high-end vehicles, according to Edmunds.com — to be widely used in cars and trucks. 

How much will prices go up? It's not clear. Edmunds.com reports estimates range from nearly $1,000 to $9,300 per vehicle. EPA and NHTSA say it'll be closer to $1,400 to $2,600 per purchase.

So, lower costs at the pump, yes. But lower costs for consumers? That's not a given.

Reducing dependence

From the origins of fuel economy standards in the '70s, the policy focus has been ""energy independence and security,"" according to NHTSA.

Some observers, such as Peter Huber and Mark Mills, authors of a 2005 book The Bottomless Well, have argued that greater efficiency doesn't actually reduce consumption. Instead, lower costs to drive simply stimulate more demand. A Boston Globe editorial this year calls energy independence ""a pipe dream,"" saying that 35 years of such mandates haven't reversed the U.S. demand for oil. They point out highway fuel consumption has grown from 109 billion gallons in 1975 to 175 billion gallons in 2008.

Lynda Tran, spokeswoman for NHTSA, points out population growth plays a role in that change. She argues petroleum imports would need to be much higher to meet demand if the average passenger car fuel economy was still at the 1978 standard of 18 mpg and light truck fuel economy was still at the 1979 standard of 15.8 mpg to 17.2 mpg. 

The last time passenger car fuel economy standards increased significantly was between 1978 and 1983, when it jumped from 18 to 26 mpg. During the same time, consumption dropped, along with imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, standards didn't change much from 1983 to 2005, and consumption and imports increased — because of an increase in miles driven, Tran said. 
So the new standards, Tran said, ""will reduce oil imports from what they would be if there were no improvements in passenger car and light truck fuel economy."" 
Our ruling 
The Obama administration has launched new fuel efficiency standards. They're not exactly a break from the past, but they do significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade. Fuel costs for new-car drivers will drop, though it's important to point out they'll likely pay more up front for more efficient machines. Meanwhile, past increases in fuel standards have pushed down foreign petroleum imports — though consumption overall is up, partly because there are more of us, and we drive more than we used to. Those factors mean even more efficiency might not reduce imports. The ad's statement that Obama ""put in place historic fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks to lower costs at the pump and reduce dependence on foreign oil,"" is partially accurate, but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/06/barack-obama/ad-says-president-barack-obama-put-place-historic-/

Gov. Scott Walker ended Planned Parenthood contract for cancer screenings, Dem Rep. Gwen Moore says
","Twice on Dec. 27, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., accused Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker of eliminating a cancer-screening program for low-income women.

""Scott Walker cuts cancer screenings for uninsured women, offers no alternatives,"" read Moore’s first statement on Twitter, the online messaging site that has some 200 million account holders.

""Walker kills women’s cancer screening program for political gain,"" her second tweet claimed.

In the messages, Moore cited two website articles about the state Well Woman program. Among other things, it provides tests for cancer for low-income women who don’t have insurance that covers such screenings.

The articles refer to Walker canceling a state contract with Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, which provides services related to the cancer screenings in four counties -- Winnebago, Fond du Lac, Outagamie and Sheboygan -- between Milwaukee and Green Bay.

In the vast majority of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, a county health department serves as the local coordinator for the screenings. But since the program was started in 1995, Planned Parenthood has had what now is a $130,000-per-year state contract to serve as coordinator in the four counties. In that role, Planned Parenthood uses two employees to help women sign up for and receive the cancer screenings. In 2010, 715 women in the four counties were served, according to the state Department of Health Services.  

So did Walker kill a cancer-screening program for poor women?

In a word: No.

1. The contract in question was for helping women sign up for and get the screenings, not the screenings themselves. The screenings are separate. Some are done by Planned Parenthood, but they also are done by other health care providers.

2.Walker’s administration did end Planned Parenthood’s contract -- but neither the assistance Planned Parenthood provided, nor the screenings themselves, ever ended. Indeed, the change put the four counties on par with how the program is handled in most of the rest of the state.

When we asked Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams if she had additional evidence to back Moore’s charges against Walker, she provided a news release from Planned Parenthood. But that release made clear both the assistance and the screenings would continue.

So let’s see how Moore, who counts Planned Parenthood as an ally, got it all wrong.

Walker moves to end contract

Walker and Planned Parenthood are political foes. Planned Parenthood’s services -- unrelated to the Well Woman program -- include abortion, which Walker opposes. And two weeks before losing its contract, the organization announced its support of the campaign to recall Walker from office in 2012. Walker earlier in 2011 moved to cut Planned Parenthood’s public funding for family planning services.

Controversy over the contract surfaced in December 2011.

Dec. 1, 2011: The state health department, according to Planned Parenthood, notifies Planned Parenthood by phone that its contract would end effective Jan. 1, 2012.

So, it’s clear the Walker administration abruptly ended the longtime contract -- but that didn’t mean an end to the cancer screenings or the assistance that Planned Parenthood was providing in the four counties.

Dec. 23, 2011: The state health department announces that Winnebago County would take over the screening assistance in the four counties and that there would be a transition.(The news release did not mention that the assistance would be transitioned from Planned Parenthood.)

So, the state made it clear the cancer screening-related services would continue. The change to Winnebago County puts the four counties in the same position as nearly all other counties in that a local health department, rather than a private agency such as Planned Parenthood, will serve as the local coordinator.

But again, that’s not ending the screenings, which was Moore’s claim.

Dec. 27, 2011: On the day Moore issued her tweets, Planned Parenthood announces it had agreed to continue providing assistance for the screenings for 60 days past the end of its contract.

So, Planned Parenthood itself made it clear that neither the screenings nor the assistance in getting the screenings would end.

How Moore went wrong

Moore used as her tweets, almost word for word, the headlines from the two website articles she linked to in the tweets. Both articles incorrectly reported that Walker had ended entirely the screenings in question.   

Moore’s spokeswoman said Moore’s tweets were merely relating what the articles said. But neither article was from a straight news source. And Moore is responsible for stating bad information, even if it came from another source. That’s the approach PolitiFact has consistently taken, with Democrats and Republicans alike.

A Dec. 17, 2011, Forbes.com article Moore cited was written by a contributor who took the stance that Walker was playing politics with the contract. And a Dec. 20 article she linked to was written by the left-leaning Huffington Post political website.

As for why Planned Parenthood’s contract was canceled, Walker explained his decision, in a news article his spokesman provided to us, by saying:

""There are many clinics that are not as controversial as Planned Parenthood, and our goal was to make sure low-income women had access to those sorts of screenings from other providers around the state that don't carry the controversy you get with Planned Parenthood.""

Doug Gieryn, director of the Winnebago County Health Department, told us that local health officials were happy with Planned Parenthood’s work and upset that the state ended its contract. But as for Moore’s claim that Walker eliminated the cancer screenings, Gieryn said: ""That’s inaccurate.""

And by quite a lot.

Our conclusion

Moore said Walker eliminated ""cancer screenings for uninsured women"" in four Wisconsin counties and offered ""no alternatives."" But all Walker eliminated was a contract with Planned Parenthood for assisting women in getting the screenings.

And the screenings never ended -- nor did the assistance Planned Parenthood provided.

Moore’s claim was false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire. (Editor's note: In the original version of this story, published Jan. 6, 2012, we stated Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin does not provide the actual cancer screenings. Planned Parenthood does offer the screenings separately from the contract that was canceled, which involved helping women sign up for the screenings. )",/factchecks/2012/jan/06/gwen-moore/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-ended-planned-parenthoo/

John Kasich says Ohio No. 8 for job creation, No. 1 in the Midwest
","
When John Kasich narrowly upset incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland to become Ohio's 69th governor, an issue the Republican pounded on was job creation.

Ohio had lost nearly 400,000 jobs during Strickland's tenure, and Kasich played that song again and again as he pinned the losses on Strickland.

With Ohio's economy on a modest rebound, the Kasich administration is keeping a close eye on the key economic numbers during his first year in office knowing that how voters perceive Kasich's record on jobs could be a key factor in whether he earns a second term in office.

Kasich held an end-of-the-year session with reporters Dec. 19, 2011, that was designed to highlight his administration’s accomplishments and Ohio's limited economic recovery over the past year was front and center.

As Kasich rattled off some statistics to bolster his case, he honed in on job creation -- a key measuring stick in a state where unemployment rates have hovered in the double digits in recent years. Kasich said Ohio is now on the comeback trail under his tenure.

""We are now eighth in the nation in job creation...and No. 1 in the Midwest,"" Kasich told reporters.

PolitiFact Ohio went to work to check out the governor’s claim.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols told us the numbers came straight from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data that serves as the baseline for the state's unemployment rate.

Using the category of all non-farm workers adjusted for seasonal employment -- so that work done only part of the year, like summer lifeguards, aren't included -- we compared the number of jobs in Ohio in January 2011 when Kasich took office with where the numbers stood in late December when the November estimates were released.

We found that Ohio was close to where Kasich had said -- 9th in the country in the raw number of jobs created with a net increase of an estimated 45,200 jobs this year.

Ohio was also tops in the Midwest if you define the Midwest as the U.S. Census Bureau does: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. (If you include Pennsylvania as a Midwest state Ohio would slip to No. 2.)   

But when you look at what states rank the highest in raw numbers of jobs created over that time frame, you begin to notice a common characteristic: they are predominately the states with the highest populations.

By raw numbers the most jobs created were in California (193,800), Texas (158,300), Florida (120,200), New York (101,000), New Jersey (52,100), Massachusetts (50,000), Louisiana (49,700), Pennsylvania (45,400) and Ohio (45,200).

And by population the biggest states are California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio.

The only state in the top seven in population to be outside the top 10 in job growth is Illinois, which is No.11 in raw number of jobs created with 38,100.

When you hold steady for the relative population size of a state by looking at the new jobs created as a percentage of the state's workforce population, Ohio drops precipitously down the job creation ranks.

In terms of relative job creation, Ohio has roughly 0.89 percent more people estimated to be in the workforce today than at the beginning of the year which is good for 22nd place among the 50 states.

Once you hold equal for population, the top 10 job creation states become a mix of small, medium and big states: North Dakota (3.72 percent more workers than January 2011), Wyoming (2.64), Louisiana (2.63), Oklahoma (2.24), South Carolina (2.09), Utah (2.04), Arizona (1.74), Florida (1.68), Massachusetts (1.57) and Texas (1.51).

Ohio's 22nd ranking would slot them in between West Virginia (0.98 percent) and Pennsylvania (0.80). And two other Midwestern states, by the U.S. Census definition, would top Ohio on a percentage basis -- South Dakota and Nebraska.

Kasich spokesman Nichols argues that raw numbers are how job creation is commonly discussed and that because the Kasich administration spent so much time talking about the raw number of lost jobs under Strickland's watch that it should be how things are measured. ""It's the very same yardstick we used during the election,"" Nichols said.

While that is true, the context of Kasich's remark came when he was comparing Ohio to other states around the country trying to make the case that the Buckeye State was becoming a national leader in job creation. Ranking by percent increase of the workforce allows for an apples-to-apples comparison. The results give you a mix of states of all population sizes in the top 10.  

That's additional information that clarifies the claim and puts the job picture in better context.

Price worries about health care law's impact to seniors
","
For critics of the controversial federal health care law, there are few elements of it that are discussed with as much disdain as the Independent Payment Advisory Board.

Rush Limbaugh, for example, has called the 15-member board ""death panels.""

U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Roswell, explained some of his concerns about the board in a Dec. 8 letter he sent to constituents of the northwest metro Atlanta district he represents. Several people who received the letter asked us about the veracity of one particular sentence concerning the board.

""[T]hey put in place an unaccountable, unelected board of 15 bureaucrats, known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board [IPAB], and gave them the power to deny care to seniors,"" wrote Price, a doctor, underlining that specific part of the letter.

So can this board deny care to seniors, as Price wrote?

First, what is this board and what can it do?

It was created to reduce Medicare spending, if spending surpasses the targeted rate, which is the average of consumer and medical care inflation. Medical inflation has been higher than general inflation 24 of the past 25 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS).

Board members are chosen by the president, with advice from the U.S. Senate. Board proposals to reduce spending must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by Sept. 1 of each year and to the president and Congress by Jan. 15 of the following year. The Senate can vote by a three-fifths majority to reject the board’s recommendations, but it then must come up with Medicare spending cuts.

Board members should include doctors, employers, health economist researchers and third-party payers and can serve six-year terms. The HHS secretary, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator and the administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration are nonvoting members of the board.

The board would be required to submit its first proposal to the president and Congress in January 2014 if per capita spending exceeds projections.

""[T]he Board is directed to consider, among other things, Medicare solvency, quality and access to care, the effects of changes in payments to providers, and those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid,"" according to the CRS.

The health care law has goals of maintaining or enhancing beneficiary access to quality care. It prohibits IPAB from reducing payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities, long-term care hospitals and hospices until 2020, noted an April report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that researches health policy. The Kaiser report says there could be changes in ""Medicare Advantage, the Part D prescription drug program, skilled nursing facility, home health, dialysis, ambulance and ambulatory surgical center services and durable medical equipment.""

Another Georgia congressman, Rep. Phil Gingrey, claimed a few months ago that ""a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy."" Those bureaucrats were, yes, IPAB. We reviewed that claim and rated Gingrey’s statement as False. Section 3403 of the health care law noted that IPAB may not submit ""any recommendation to ration health care.""

Price believes costs will exceed projections, which will require cuts to Medicare. The congressman told us that IPAB decisions will likely result in changes such as withholding payment to doctors for certain services, specifically under a formula the federal government uses for Medicare physician payment known as the sustainable growth rate.

Some doctors, the congressman believes, will see fewer Medicare patients. Lack of access is equivalent to a denial of care, Price argues.

""It’s a cause-and-effect relationship,"" Price said.

The Kaiser report backs up Price’s argument.

""If IPAB recommends policies that squeeze Medicare payment rates without equal pressure being placed on private payment rates, there is some concern that Medicare beneficiaries would be at greater risk of having access problems, as providers become more inclined to serve other patients,"" it says.

Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the nation’s private insurance companies, told us that seniors could be impacted by cuts to Medicare Advantage, a health choice program for recipients. Some argue otherwise, and note that Medicare Advantage users will pay slightly less this year for care.

Our conclusion

Price gets it partially right. The IPAB can push for changes that impact some areas of health care, and that could have an indirect result on care for seniors. The board, however, cannot propose changes that impact the most widely used forms of care -- such as inpatient hospital services, long-term care and hospice -- for Medicare beneficiaries.

The IPAB can impact changes to some programs, but not specific care to specific seniors as Price’s statement implies.  

Price’s concerns have merit, but his statement about the IPAB having the power ""to deny care to seniors"" needs much more context to be completely accurate.

"['Rhode Island', 'City Budget', 'Pensions', 'Retirement', 'Taxes', 'David Cicilline']","
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline says Providence made full pension contributions six of eight years that he was mayor
","
On the Christmas Day edition of WPRI’s ""Newsmakers,"" talk turned to the public employee pension problems in Rhode Island. Former Providence Mayor and now U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was asked how often his administration properly funded the city's pension system.

Cicilline initially said the city made its annual required contribution (ARC) -- the amount that experts say is needed to properly fund that system -- every year during his eight years as mayor. But then he backed off a bit, not always finishing his sentences.

""We made it every year and I think the last year . . . One thing that we set out [to do] -- we had a plan that made sure we made 100-percent contribution to the system to keep us current, which doesn't deal with the unfunded liability but it stops the bleeding,"" he said. ""I think with the exception of the last year or maybe the last two years, we were at 100 percent. I think the last year it was 90 . . .""

At that point, WPRI reporter Tim White broke in and asked, ""You're saying you made the ARC six times in your administration?""

""Yeah, I think to the 100 percent,"" Cicilline said. ""I think two years we got over 90 but didn't . . . But the unfunded liability occurred because -- and this happened in Providence for many years before I took office -- that the city didn't make its 100-percent contribution.""

Since he left the mayor's office, Cicilline has come under a lot of fire over how he managed the city's finances, so we decided to check his statement.

We turned to the latest report by Buck Consultants, which determines how much Providence is supposed to put into its pension program each year. The report also lists how much the city was supposed to invest each year and how much it actually did.

The report goes back to the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, when the city invested all of the $16.1 million that it was supposed to. But in following years, the contribution started to fall. With Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. in his second era as mayor, the level dropped to 93.6 percent, then 57.5 percent, then lower still. During Cianci's last year in office -- 2002 -- it was 64.2 percent.

Cicilline is correct when he says that the contribution level rose after he took over from acting Mayor John Lombardi. During the 2003 fiscal year -- when Cicilline had been at the helm for only six months -- the contribution rate rose to 80.1 percent.

The amount kept rising, but the contribution level didn't hit or exceed 100 percent until the 2007 fiscal year, more than three years after he took office.

Over the subsequent three years it averaged 100 percent -- 100.2 percent in 2007, 100 percent in 2008 and 99.8 percent in 2009 -- but then dipped a bit to 97.7 percent. By then, the price tag for financing the city's employee pension program had grown to $50.3 million, more than three times what it was in 1996. 
When we asked Cicilline's office about his statement, spokeswoman Raymonde Charles said that ""as it turns out, his recollection wasn't that far off.

""With the exception of two of the budgets proposed and implemented during his administration, the city's pension contributions were made at 100 percent or within just a few percentage points, and in one year, even in excess of 100 percent.""

But that wasn't the question. The question was how many times the Cicilline administration funded the pensions at 100 percent. And particularly during the 2004-2006 fiscal years, where the payment was at 96 percent or less, the shortfall was $2 million to $6 million.

At the end of the 2010 fiscal year, Providence's pension fund had only 34 percent of the $1.26 billion it needed, according to the report.

Our ruling

U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said that ""with the exception of the last year or maybe the last two years, we were at 100 percent"" when it came to the amount Providence contributed to the city's pension fund during the eight years he was mayor.

But those last two years were not the exception.

During the first three years when Cicilline was in office for the full fiscal year, the city's contribution fell short of 100 percent, ranging from 86 to 96 percent.

But in the last five years of his term, the contribution was either close to or at 100 percent.

Cicilline, in his off-the-cuff statement, mixed up where the years with the lowest contribution fell. But he made it clear a few times that he was citing figures from memory, so we’ll give him some leeway and rule Mostly True.

Barack Obama reelection video says he “closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas""
","
With all eyes on Iowa for the Republican caucuses, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign reminded watchers of his own Iowa win — and what he has done to keep his campaign promises.

Obama for America bought banner ads across the home page of the online Des Moines Register on Jan. 3, 2012, with a link to Obama's 2008 victory speech in the state.

Music plays as candidate Obama promises action on health care, taxes, energy independence and the war in Iraq. Between clips, white text across the screen highlights Obama's policy accomplishments.

For example, candidate Obama declares, ""I’ll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas."" At that point, an on-screen visual reads: ""Closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas.""

We wondered whether the ad’s claim about Obama’s accomplishment is justified.

We asked the Obama campaign for supporting material, and they said they were referring to Public Law 111-226, a measure that was primarily aimed at providing economic aid to states. To offset the cost of new spending, however, the bill included a few provisions related to taxation of international corporations -- what a number of tax experts have told us can be fairly described as loopholes.

As we explained in a previous item, Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10, 2010. The tax provisions took away more than a half dozen existing exemptions and credits estimated to be worth $9.8 billion over the subsequent 10 years.
   
Here’s how it worked. The United States, unlike a variety of other countries, taxes its companies on the foreign profits they earn. But the companies don't have to pay taxes on their foreign earnings until they bring those profits back to the U.S. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as they can.

But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments, and some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid on the same income to foreign governments. That's what the law tried to address. It said that companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until they report their income.

But while there is some truth to the claim that the president signed legislation that ""closed corporate tax loopholes thta were sending profits overseas,"" we should point out a few issues.

First, under the old law, companies weren’t necessarily ""sending profits overseas,"" as the ad states, but may have been keeping in place profits that were already being generated overseas. Still, this strikes us as a fairly minor linguistic quibble.

A more pertinent question is whether the legislation Obama signed fulfills the pledge he made in Iowa in 2008 -- that he’ll ""be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas.""

H. David Rosenbloom, director of the International Tax Program at the New York University School of Law, calls the legislation ""very narrow.""

""It addresses a specific tax planning strategy whereby foreign taxes and credits are ‘split’ from the foreign income that gave rise to them,"" he said. Left relatively unscathed is the broader ""deferral regime"" that allows companies to avoid U.S. taxes on foreign income as long as they do not ""repatriate"" -- bring home -- the money and avoid a few other hurdles.

For instance, one proposal by former Walt Disney Co. executive Preston Padden, now an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado, urges a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, which would be aligned with most foreign countries, paired with stricter ""anti-deferral"" rules.

""A tax rate comparable to foreign countries would greatly eliminate the incentives to move operations and jobs offshore because of rate differentials, and the anti-deferral regime would minimize the benefits to U.S. companies from offshoring operations and jobs,"" Padden wrote in a recent op-ed.

The narrower law signed by Obama, by contrast, ""will hardly prevent companies from sending profits abroad, keeping them abroad, and otherwise profiting from the current set of international tax rules,"" Rosenbloom said.

Even after passage of the 2010 law, ""most experts would agree that the U.S. international tax system encourages U.S. multinationals to accumulate profits offshore,"" said Lawrence Lokken, an emeritus professor of law at the University of Florida.

Our ruling

While there is some truth to the claim that Obama signed legislation that ""closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas,"" experts say the law by itself doesn’t live up to Obama’s promise in Iowa to ""be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas.""

Mitt Romney ad says labor board tried to block Boeing from building factory in South Carolina
","
With the South Carolina presidential primary fast approaching, Mitt Romney’s campaign released an ad blasting President Barack Obama over a union dispute involving an airplane factory in North Charleston, S.C.

In the ad, Romney stands in front of workers on a factory floor and says that ""the National Labor Relations Board, now stacked with union stooges selected by the president, says to a free enterprise like Boeing, ‘you can’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state.’

""That is simply un-American. It’s political payback of the worst kind. It is wrong for America, and it is something that will stop under my administration.""

Romney made this same basic claim during an October 2011 debate. Its stems from a complaint filed by the NLRB against Boeing over its decision to build a jet factory in South Carolina, instead of ramping up production at its existing union facility in Washington state.

PolitiFact looked into it then and found that Romney distorted the facts.

The background

The Romney campaign told us previously that the source of his October statement was an April New York Times story about the NLRB complaint, which sought ""to force Boeing to bring an airplane production line back to its unionized facilities in Washington state instead of moving the work to a non-union plant in South Carolina.""

About six years ago, Boeing was making plans for production of its newest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. The company explored making all the planes at its factories in Washington state, but in 2009, it decided to start a second production line in South Carolina. The union plants in Puget Sound would make seven planes a month; the non-union facility in North Charleston, S.C., would produce three a month.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers complained. The NLRB’s general counsel, Lafe Solomon, tried to bring the parties together but failed. In April 2011, Solomon formally issued a complaint on the grounds that Boeing built its factory in South Carolina in order to punish the union.  

Top Boeing officials had been open about the connection between the machinists union and the new factory. According to the filing, one executive told a newspaper that ""the overriding factor (in transferring the line) was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we’re paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years.""

Solomon considered this retaliation against the union for having conducted strikes in the past. As such, he argued Boeing violated the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from interfering with the right of workers to organize and to strike.

Problems with Romney’s portrayal

Solomon’s complaint initiated a process that sent the case to an administrative law judge. The judge’s ruling would then go to the NLRB to be voted up or down or changed. In short, the law provides a process with checks and balances -- an important point Romney ignored.

(As it turned out, the case ended without a hearing. The NLRB dropped its complaint in December 2011, at the urging of the machinists union after it reached a deal on wages with Boeing.)

In addition, the complaint against Boeing is not based on the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. We spoke to lawyers who think the complaint is well-founded and lawyers who think it’s misguided, but they agree on this point.
   
Stanford law professor William Gould, a former chair of the NLRB, thinks the general counsel was wrong to move this complaint forward. By his reading of federal law, employers have the legal right to minimize exposure to strikes, and deciding to locate a plant in a place where unions are weak can be a strategy that passes legal muster.
   
But Gould said Romney did ""make an error of fact.""
   
""He’s wrong in suggesting that the general counsel’s reasoning applies … to union or non-union states,"" Gould said.

Another labor lawyer, Jeffrey Hirsch at the University of North Carolina Law School, concurred. ""This has nothing to do with geography,"" Hirsch said. ""You could switch the states, and the case would be identical.""  
   
Both lawyers also said that if Romney is suggesting that the NLRB has done anything unusual, he’s completely wrong. ""The NLRB has held in countless cases that employers can’t move to another facility for prohibited reasons,"" Gould said.  A prohibited reason would be to punish the union.
   
Even the spokesman for the National Right to Work Committee, Patrick Semmens, said the issue isn’t that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. ""The more fundamental point is that it was a non-union facility,"" said Semmens, who maintained that Romney’s claim has merit.

Our ruling
   
The Romney ad claimed that the NLRB told Boeing that it ""can’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state.""

The NLRB’s complaint started a legal process that could ultimately have resulted in a factory closure, but the NLRB as a whole didn’t tell Boeing anything. What’s more, the legal basis for the action centered on whether Boeing was punishing the union for staging strikes, not that Boeing had opened a factory in a right-to-work state.

Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele says county buses are no less safe now than a year or two ago
","
A spate of diametrically opposed claims about safety on Milwaukee County buses is the latest product of the increasingly bitter battle between Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. and County Executive Chris Abele.

The sheriff, whose agency helps police buses, released videos of student fights to dramatize that, as he put it, ""a ride on a Milwaukee county bus has become a frightening experience.""

The bad news aboard or around buses in December 2011 included a fight culminating in an attack against a mother who was with a 2-year-old child, an assault against a driver, a road-rage episode and stunning footage of beatings of students.

Taking a somewhat longer view, Abele told reporters there is no disturbing new trend.

""I think he’s misrepresenting the facts,"" Abele told CBS 58 TV reporter. ""If the sheriff has given you the impression that transit is less safe than it was a year ago or the year before that, then he’s giving the wrong impression.""

We’ll focus on that two-year time period, but also peek at how Clarke can say incidents on buses have spiked five years in a row since 2006, while Abele cites a big drop comparing 2011 to 2006.

This dispute escalated to the point that Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn stepped in to have his officers patrol buses, which prompted Clarke and Flynn to hammer at each other.

Both Clarke and Abele referred to data on ""incidents"" when we asked. But Clarke couldn’t show us numbers to back up his assertion of a five-year rise. Abele did produce transit system figures, but his claim of a drop comparing 2011 to 2006 is misleading because he compared the present to a high point.

In any event, the ""incidents"" figures are highly diluted. They include many hundreds of problems so minor -- sleeping on the bus, for example -- that neither law enforcement nor the transit system’s private security force was called in to deal with them.

So let’s stick to more serious incidents -- and Abele’s statement about the last two years. We’ll look at violence, lawbreaking and other security problems that required intervention by law enforcement or G4S, the private security company formerly known as Wackenhut.

Here’s our analysis of figures provided by the Milwaukee County Transit System (2011 figures are through Dec. 20).

Law enforcement responses: This is arguably the most important measurement, and the trend line goes up -- though in roller-coaster fashion around 600 responses per year.

Police were called in 12 percent more often in 2010 than in 2009, but those cases were on pace to fall about 5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. So, buses were less safe this year than in 2009, but more safe this year than in 2010.

But if you look at the last two years mentioned by Abele, and compare the responses from the previous two years, they are up slightly, about 4 percent.

All responses: Counting all instances when police and/or private security was needed, incidents went up the last two years. This year, compared to 2009, they are up more than 13 percent.

Those are the broad numbers for police and private security responses. But there are hundreds of non-criminal episodes such as fare disputes included, though, so let’s take a closer look at the violent incidents.

Assaults and verbal altercations against passengers: Security was called -- and law enforcement sometimes dispatched --  in 150 such cases in 2011, up from 139 in 2010 and 106 in 2009. That’s two years in a row of increases, though it moderated in 2011, according to a report MCTS ran for us.

Assaults against drivers: This counts drivers struck by a person, but mainly by objects or fluids (such as spittle). There were 29 such incidents in 2009, 24 in 2010 and 25 this year. It’s fallen off more compared to 35 in 2008. There were six drivers struck by individuals in 2011, though not all of these cases were serious enough to warrant medical attention.

Non-violent lawbreaking: We only have two years of data here. It was virtually unchanged at nearly 900 incidents per year, this category includes threats, weapons incidents, off-bus fights and disorderly conduct, vandalism and profane/drunken behavior. The number represents how many time private security -- and police in some cases -- were called in.

Those are the numbers.

A transit spokeswoman sees no red flags in the fluctuations and mixed trends.

""There’s not an increase in crime, there’s an increase in attention,"" said Jacqueline Janz of MCTS.

The numbers are a bit of a mixed bag, but show lawbreaking and violence is a consistent, if relatively uncommon, phenomenon on county buses that -- MCTS officials are quick to point out -- provide 44 million passenger trips a year on 411 buses, most without incident.

Broadly speaking, it’s happening less now than five years ago, but more than it was two years ago, based on total responses by police and security. The Abele statement we are checking referred to the last two years.

Assaults on drivers are notably down over two to three years.

But looking at the broadest measure of serious problems (altercations among passengers), the history shows a significant increase two years in a row. That’s the time frame Abele referred to, and we think Clarke’s critique focuses mainly on these kind of serious incidents.

To be sure, there’s no dramatic swing up, as Clarke’s rhetoric implied. And the picture improves when the longer view is taken, though as we noted that’s selectively taking a high point as the starting point.

But Abele’s claim about buses being no less safe than a year or two ago flies in the face of the passenger altercation stats. Plus, Abele makes use of overly broad ""incident"" numbers that are highly misleading as a measure of crime.

There’s enough counter evidence -- the declining number of bus drivers struck -- to give Abele’s claim an element of truth. But it also gives a wrong impression.

That is our definition of Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/05/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-chris-abele-says-county/
