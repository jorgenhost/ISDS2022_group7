Jeanne Shaheen says Scott Brown wanted to force women to look at photos of fetuses before abortions
","As the 2014 New Hampshire Senate race veers toward a conclusion, the state’s next senator needs the support of women voters. Incumbent Jeanne Shaheen underscored that point when she targeted Republican challenger Scott Brown’s record supporting women’s reproductive rights during his tenure as a state senator from Massachusetts. Her aim was to undercut Brown’s assertion that he is a pro-choice politician. An ad with a female narrator released on Oct. 7 said, ""In Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses."" The ad, titled ""Force,"" drew a swift response from Brown. He held a press conference the same day the ad was released, calling it a lie and adding that it was ""not only insensitive, it is also deeply offensive."" ""I have always been a pro-choice, independent Republican and have a strong record of supporting women’s health care,"" Brown said in Derry, N.H., with his wife Gail by his side. Brown demanded that Shaheen pull the ad, and the next day he launched his own ad calling Shaheen’s commercial a ""smear campaign."" More than ever in this hotly contested Senate race, this seemed like a job for PolitiFact. For support, the ad, and Shaheen’s campaign, pointed to Massachusetts Senate Bill 979, ""An Act Relative to a Woman’s Right to Know,"" filed in 2005. While the bill co-sponsored by Brown and Republican Michael R. Knapik eventually failed, it would have given any woman seeking an abortion information and mandated 24 hours to consider the consequences of that decision. (Exceptions would only be given in the case of a medical emergency.) ""The purpose of the Woman's Right to Know Act is to ensure that every woman considering an abortion receives complete information on the procedure, the risks, the status of her unborn child, and her alternatives, and sufficient reflection time, thereby reducing the possibility of serious, lasting, or life threatening consequences of a medical, emotional and psychological nature,"" the bill states. Similar laws have been proposed and enacted in other states following a 1992 Supreme Court decision allowing the state of Pennsylvania under its ""Abortion Control Act"" to require a woman seeking an abortion to give her informed consent prior to the procedure, receive a host of information about abortion and adoption, and wait 24 hours before having an abortion. The introduction to the Massachusetts bill cites that Supreme Court decision, saying the state ""has an important interest in ensuring that women seeking abortions are provided a fully informed choice and a sufficient period of time to reflect on the information provided, ‘to reduce the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision was not fully informed.’ Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 882 (1992)."" So how about those photographs of fetuses that women would be ""forced"" to look at? Like similar laws proposed and passed elsewhere, the proposed Massachusetts law would have required doctors or their representatives to provide women with lots of information at least 24 hours before an abortion was scheduled, including the names of adoption agencies and contact information for public and private agencies that offer financial and medical support to women throughout a pregnancy and after childbirth. It also required women to receive descriptions of the ""anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two week gestational increments from fertilization to full term, including color photographs."" If photos were unavailable ""realistic drawings"" were considered acceptable. The bill made clear that photos of fetuses must be provided to women seeking abortions, but didn’t stop there. It also called for descriptions of the different methods of abortion and ""the physical, psychological and emotional risks or medical complications commonly associated with each method; a description of the physical, psychological and emotional risks or medical complications of pregnancy and delivery; a description of the support obligations of the father of a child born alive."" Before performing an abortion, the doctor or a representative would have to ask the woman if she had ""seen"" the information and ""provide the woman with an opportunity to contact abortion alternative agencies at this time should she so desire."" In addition, a woman’s signature was required before the abortion was performed to give her consent and ""indicate that she has been offered the information described in this section."" Brown says the bill was intended to give adoption a chance and ""did not force women to do anything. I would never force women to do anything."" He’s got a point. Nowhere in the bill is the word ""force"" used. Still, the language of the bill certainly ensures women would be given the information, asks them if they had ""seen it,"" and provided at least 24 hours to review it before having an abortion. Our ruling Shaheen’s ad says that ""in Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses."" The measure backed by Brown nine years ago made sure that women were provided photos of developing fetuses, along with a lot more information. It certainly forced doctors and their representatives to provide this information to women seeking abortions -- except in cases of emergency -- and it ensured women received the information both through verbal questions and a signed consent form. Brown has a point that the bill wouldn't have ""forced"" them to look at color photographs -- but it did just about everything else it could possibly do up to that line. This statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/10/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-wanted-women-look-/

Pants on Fire: Duncan Hunter makes unconfirmed claim Border Patrol caught at least 10 ISIS fighters
","U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande. The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he’d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. ""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"" Hunter said, adding a moment later: ""I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas."" Border Patrol agents ""caught them,"" Hunter also said, but ""you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail. No federal or state confirmation No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter’s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman’s sources. Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter’s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account. Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: ""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border."" And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it ""does not have any information to confirm"" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message’s authenticity. In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr. In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: ""An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be naïve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press."" On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman’s claim that ""we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,"" which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that ""we know"" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch. For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter’s claim doesn’t make much sense. ""It’s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of ""no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I’ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There’s not one shred of evidence this is the case."" Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said. Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught. ""Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,"" Kasper wrote. ""We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post,""  much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said. Our ruling Hunter said ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas"" and there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol."" No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are ""dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol"" is missing a factual basis. All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Fact-checking Sarah Silverman's viral 'vagina tax' video
","Liberal comedian and activist Sarah Silverman isn’t one for discretion, especially when she’s out to make a political point about money and genitalia. Silverman mused about the ""wage gap"" in a new video launching a fundraising campaign for the National Women’s Law Center. The wage gap refers to the difference between what men and women earn. In the video, Silverman’s solution to mismatched earnings is to get a sex change. That’s a joke, but she ticked off statistics that were not. (The video itself is a little NSFW, but here it is if you’re interested.) ""Every year the average woman loses around $11,000 to the wage gap,"" Silverman says as she sits on a doctor’s exam table in a hospital gown, waiting for her faux sex-change consultation. ""Over the course of the working years of her life, that's almost 500 grand."" And, in a phrase you’re not likely to soon forget, she realizes, ""That's a $500,000 vagina tax."" Let’s peel the curtain on what men and women earn. Is it really a half-million dollar difference? What the numbers say The National Women’s Law Center didn’t get back to us, but an FAQ on the group’s website shows the math. To arrive at Silverman’s $500,000 vagina tax, she used 2013 Census income and poverty data for the median earnings of full-time, year-round workers who are 15 years old and up, regardless of occupation. The median wage was $39,157 for women and $50,033 for men. The average difference is $10,876, which rounds up to Silverman’s $11,000. This is basically the same calculation politicians made in 2012 to claim that the average woman makes 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. As PolitiFact, PunditFact and other fact-checkers have noted in earlier examinations, the figure should be used with caution. It’s hard to say for whom this would be the case, but it’s ""a summary measure, just like anything else would be,"" said Valerie Wilson, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. ""It may not be experienced in reality by any one person, but that doesn’t make it wrong,"" said University of Maryland sociology professor Philip Cohen. ""It is the average experience, which is meaningful."" Then, Silverman multiplied $11,000 by 40 years to get to $440,000. Why they picked 40 years we’re not sure. There’s no official government figure for the length of the average American career. In the video, $440,000 becomes almost $500,000. So you can see there already is some generous rounding, as a ""tax"" that should be $435,040 over 40 years (in present day dollars) becomes almost $500,000. That’s worth noting, but it’s not the only point of caution. Other figures for earnings by gender The Census is not the only available source of earnings by gender. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks average annual weekly median earnings of full-time salary workers using the Current Population Survey. In 2013, median weekly earnings for women were $706, or $39,520 a year. Men brought in $860 a week, or $44,720 a year. This produces a much smaller average annual earnings difference of $5,200, which using Silverman’s calculation, would translate to $208,000 over a career, not $500,000. Looking at a one-year snapshot Silverman’s calculation also is only based on a one-year look, when experts said an examination of a longer period of time would be more useful. ""I think the average does help, but I'd rather see the lifetime earnings calculated for the mean and median female worker rather than extrapolating from the average for one year,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. The primary difference between the Census and BLS data is BLS does not include self-employed workers. Meanwhile, the Census does not include some other workers, such as teachers and seasonal and construction workers. Men work more hours Some economists, such as those at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer to examine hourly wages by gender because it includes part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, who are more often women. In 2012, the latest year for which data is available, median hourly earnings for women were $11.99. For men, it was $13.88. But hourly data is not without its drawbacks, as it does not account for salaried workers, which typically earn more than hourly workers. Also, women tend to work fewer hours than men, which could mean that part of the reason men earn more is because they work more. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, men worked 8.34 hours a day on average in 2013. Women worked 7.73 hours a day on average in 2013. Over the course of 40 years, that’s about a 6,000-hour, or more than 700-day difference (without factoring in vacation, etc.) ""At a minimum, I think Sarah Silverman should calculate the tax on being female after adjusting for the number of working hours required to earn the average man’s and the average woman’s annual pay,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""That would still leave a tax, but it would be a smaller one if Ms. Silverman did indeed forget to adjust for hours worked."" Unpacking the gap Economists also bristled at Silverman’s suggestion that the gap would disappear if she were a man. It’s widely understood that the wage gap is not entirely due to gender discrimination. There are a lot of ways to consider the numbers, and the gap shrinks as workers are compared by similar levels of education, occupation and experience. Nurses and cashiers, for example, have closer pay parity. Still, a gap persists. A 2012 report from the American Association of University Women found a 7 percent ""unexplained"" pay gap among full-time workers one year after graduating from college in 2009, even when they made similar career and education decisions. Part of it is career choice, research suggests. More women populate lower-wage jobs than men, more often choosing jobs as receptionists, grade-school teachers and nurses, for example, while men disproportionately select jobs as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers. Another factor is the time women take to have children and care for them. Cohen argues that even if women choose to have children or work fewer hours, it is still fair to consider their lifestyle choice a ""tax."" ""You might be opting into that lifestyle, and still it has a cost,"" he said, comparing it to a cigarette tax. One final note: PolitiFact typically frowns upon people deeming something a ""tax"" when it really isn't. In this case, we think it's clear Silverman is using ""tax"" as part of a punchline and not referring to a literal government levy on women. So we won't split hairs on this term in our rating. Our ruling Silverman said, ""Every year the average woman loses around $11,000 to the wage gap,"" which amounts to ""a $500,000 vagina tax"" over her working career. A bulletproof number to illustrate the gender gap remains elusive, and Silverman’s ""vagina tax"" is a lifetime estimate based on a one-year average. The economists we spoke to were leery of the $11,000 figure, to a point, and similarly leery of the math to reach $500,000. There are just too many variables to describe the lifetime income-earning potential of ""the average woman."" That said, most experts say a pay gap does exist, though it’s smaller when you compare workers with similar experience and education. It’s just that pinpointing specific numbers is problematic. Silverman’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.  ",/factchecks/2014/oct/10/sarah-silverman/fact-checking-sarah-silvermans-viral-vagina-tax-vi/

Jeanne Shaheen says Scott Brown backed bill to let employers use religious opt-out on mammograms
","The U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire has been awash in claims about abortion and women’s health issues in recent days. One claim by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen caught our eye. Shaheen is facing a challenge from former Republican Sen. Scott Brown. In a news release from her campaign, Shaheen said: ""I have always supported a woman’s right to choose because I know women should be making health care decisions in consultation with their doctors and their families, not their employer. Scott Brown’s record is clear: When it counts, he doesn’t stand up for women’s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms. New Hampshire women can’t trust Scott Brown, and his record is move evidence that he is wrong for New Hampshire."" We noticed two claims that are related, but distinct enough to analyze separately. First, would the legislation in question have allowed employers deny women coverage for birth control? And would it have allowed employers to deny coverage for mammograms? We’ve heard of controversies over birth control, but not mammograms. So we decided to check it out. (We’ve addressed birth control in a separate fact-check.) Mammograms are used to screen for breast cancer, either preventively in women who have no signs of the disease, or as a diagnostic aid after a lump or other symptom is reported, according to the National Cancer Institute. In a different Shaheen campaign news release, the campaign explained its sourcing by writing, ""FACT: Scott Brown both co-sponsored and voted for the Blunt Amendment that would let employers deny women access to a range of healthcare services, including contraception and coverage for mammograms."" The amendment in question was proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. It was tabled -- that is, dispensed with -- by a 51-48 vote in which a simple majority was required. Among those who voted ""nay"" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- was Brown, then representing Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a predecessor measure, S.1467, the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act of 2011. So Shaheen’s camp is correct that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It acted to widen the scope of acceptable actions for opting out of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on religious or moral grounds. It focuses on mandates within the law for preventive services, called the ""essential health benefits package."" The Shaheen campaign pointed us to a Feb. 29, 2014, news release opposing the Blunt Amendment by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The release said, ""the expansive nature of the proposed Blunt amendment ... could result in coverage denials of life-saving preventive services such as mammograms or tobacco cessation based on employer discretion."" But we aren’t accepting the claim of an advocacy group without digging further. So we read the relevant portions of the law ourselves. We agree that the provision is drawn broadly. It’s not targeted at abortion or birth control -- it simply says that employers cannot be required to cover ""specific items or services"" that are ""contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering the plan."" So, presumably, any aspect of preventive care could qualify for a religious-conscience opt-out -- including mammograms. Or, for that matter, stethoscopes or tongue depressors. We can’t imagine any religious objections to the use of tongue depressors. But what about mammograms? We asked a number of experts in medicine and bioethics whether they had ever heard religious objections raised regarding mammograms. None said they had. ""I have not heard this claim in the specific context you describe,"" said Paul A. Lombardo, a specialist in medical law and ethics at Georgia State University. Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, noted that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent in Hobby Lobby noted past religious objections to blood transfusions (by Jehovah’s Witnesses); antidepressants (by Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (by certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (by Christian Scientists). However, Sonfield couldn’t recall hearing objections to mammograms. Opposition to mammograms would also be news to a leading anti-abortion group, the National Right to Life Committee. ""I've never heard of any argument being made against mammograms based on a conscience objection,"" said Susan T. Muskett, the group’s senior legislative counsel. Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, said the closest he can get ""to making any sense of"" the claim involves what in the game of pool would be known as a multiple bank shot. Here goes: Planned Parenthood has become a target of anti-abortion activists because it performs abortions, but the group’s clinics also provide other forms of health care to women. These include breast examinations, but not mammograms per se. If the clinic determines that a patient needs a mammogram, they will be referred to a health care provider that offers one. Some abortion opponents might ""see this as a ruse,"" Caplan said. ""So there might be a doctor or a nurse who would refuse a mammogram referral from Planned Parenthood on the grounds that that they are just funding abortions."" But this is all speculative, Caplan added. ""No doc I know of has any issue with mammograms,"" he said. Holly Fernandez Lynch, a Harvard bioethicist and author of Conflicts of Conscience in Health Care: An Institutional Compromise, called the claim ""technically true"" but ""a bit of a strawman."" Could it have been used to deny access to mammograms? ""Yes,"" she said. ""Would it have been? Almost certainly not. I have never heard of a religious or moral objection to mammograms. The better examples would have been contraceptives, abortion, vaccines (especially HPV), psychiatric care, or palliative care/hospices."" Our ruling Shaheen said Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for mammograms. The amendment, which Brown supported, was written loosely enough to allow a religious-conscience opt-out for almost any conceivable form of preventive care. But it didn't target mammograms, as Shaheen implied. And while the amendment would have protected religious-conscience objections, we failed to uncover any evidence that mammograms have inspired religious opposition, either now or in the past. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/10/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-backed-bill-let-em/

We agree with the Shaheen campaign that the provision is drawn broadly.

As we explained in our other fact check, we find no evidence that anyone has expressed a religious or moral objection to mammograms, so we rated that claim Mostly False. But the case that the Blunt Amendment would have affected access to birth control is stronger. Some opponents of abortion have supported opt-out rights for employers who oppose certain types of birth control that they say work like abortifacients. In fact, this was the issue at the heart of the closely watched 2014 Supreme Court decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby. In that case, a 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. The only quibble we have with the phrasing of Shaheen’s claim is that the Blunt Amendment didn’t single out birth control, which is the impression one could easily get from her statement. But since the amendment was written so broadly -- and since birth control has long been at issue for religious or moral reasons -- we don’t see this as a significant problem. Our ruling Shaheen said Brown ""co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control.""

Perdue off base with agriculture claim
","Candidate references to the family farm and toting watermelons are far more than folksy. Agriculture is Georgia’s top industry, pumping more than $71 billion a year into the state economy. In that context, talking farms is political calculus, especially in farm heavy Middle Georgia. That math was on display in its full glory at the state fair this week in Perry, where U.S. Senate hopefuls Michelle Nunn and David Perdue debated for the first time. ""How do you justify to the farmers that in your list of priorities there are 17 items more important than the farmers in this state?"" Perdue, the Republican asked his Democratic opponent. Nunn appeared confused by the question and called the claim untrue. ""There is no plan that has that listed,"" Nunn said. Considering that the winner of the race will replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a former agriculture lawyer who spent his Congressional career on agriculture committees, PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into the facts behind the political theater. First, some background. Nunn and Perdue are both political novices who lay some claim to rural Georgia. Nunn spent the first six years of her life in Perry, before her father was elected to the U.S. Senate. The family still owns a farm in the area. Perdue also is a Middle Georgia native. An ad featuring his cousin, ex-Gov. Sonny Perdue, talks up that background and youth spent ""pickin’ watermelons."" Both candidates have met with the clout-wielding Georgia Farm Bureau, which does not endorse candidates. Both have said they will seek seats on the Senate agriculture committee if elected.   Perdue’s television ads have long featured him wearing a jean jacket, walking in a rural field. His platform includes reducing regulations facing farmers, to help boost production. ""I hope to bring fresh ideas that will help relieve burdensome regulations and ensure our local farmers succeed in growing a strong Georgia,"" Perdue said in an August press release. Perdue’s criticism against Nunn’s agriculture credentials is based on two pages out of 144 pages of Nunn campaign memos that were produced in December 2013 and leaked this summer. Starting on page 61 are several policy issues that call for background memos for the candidate and her staff to review. Listed in order of need for completion, agriculture ranks 18, after issues as varied as the budget and the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. ""It is absolutely clear that’s how she ranks agriculture on her list of priorities on what to discuss,"" Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said. The memo appears to contradict that interpretation, however.  The document bolds the word ""agriculture,"" a sign from the authors that the policy paper on the issue is either done or near completion. Policy papers on issues that are ranked higher in the memo, such as the budget, are not bolded and therefore still in process. Nunn spokesman Nathan Click said that’s because the issues were not listed in order of importance but as ""topics the consultants want addressed."" Click said Nunn made her commitment to agriculture clear when, within a week of announcing her candidacy in July 2013, she told reporters her goal was to serve on the Senate Agriculture and Armed Services committees. Her father, Sam Nunn, was chair of the armed service committee during his 24-year tenure in the Senate. Nunn’s seven-page jobs plan includes a call to expand partnerships between state universities and farmers among other priorities such as tax reform. ""My family has a third generation farm in Perry, and we have grown and raised everything from pecans to peppers to pigs – if you count our farm pig, Maybeline,"" Nunn said during a visit to the Georgia Farm Bureau in February. ""I understand how important our agriculture community is to our economy and our heritage as Georgians."" So where does that leave us? It is accurate that agriculture is listed as 18 out of 22 policy memos that need completing, according to leaked internal campaign documents. But there is no evidence to support the idea that the list is a ranking of Nunn’s priorities. Perdue’s statement ignores critical facts and is misleading on its face. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/10/david-perdue/perdues-agriculture-against-nunn-claim-base/

Pat Roberts: Obamacare killed insurance for 20,000 Kansans
","In an unexpectedly tight race, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas is doing everything he can to paint his opponent -- independent Greg Orman -- as a liberal henchman. One of Roberts’ favorite points is Orman’s stance on the Affordable Care Act. Orman says he does not support the health care law, but he also says pushing legislation to repeal it is impractical, because President Barack Obama would simply veto it. In a recent Web video, Roberts treats that view as support for Obamacare. The ad starts out with video of Orman shaking hands with constituents, one of whom asks him a question about repealing Obamacare. Orman replies, ""That’s an interesting question,"" and moves on down the line. ""Greg Orman won't repeal Obamacare,"" the ad’s narrator says, ""even though 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of it."" Roberts was expected to easily win a fourth term (the last time Kansas elected a Democrat to the Senate was in 1932). Then, Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out, and independent Orman surged in the polls. Now the race is a toss-up. Some see a Roberts win as necessary for Republican Senate control in 2015. Both candidates say they do not support Obama’s health care law, but we wanted to know how the law had affected Kansas -- did 20,000 people really lose their health insurance? The answer, it seems, is no. How many Kansans lost insurance? We asked Linda Sheppard, health policy adviser for the Kansas Insurance Department, how many Kansans had lost their insurance due to Obamacare. She said the state does not require health insurance carriers to report when people go on or off coverage, so there’s no way to definitively know the answer. However, Sheppard said insurance carriers do have to check in with the department when they decide to terminate a policy. So 20,000 people losing health insurance would have likely come to her attention. ""We are not aware of any wide-scale cancellation of policies,"" she said. Here’s what happened. About a year ago, in October 2013, Kansas’ largest insurance carrier -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas -- sent letters to about 9,450 policyholders, according to numerous news reports. Those members would be unable to renew their plans for 2014 because those plans do not comply with new standards under the Affordable Care Act. Sheppard told us there are no official numbers for how many people received these notices from insurance carriers other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas. Roberts’ ad cites the 20,000 figure from an October 2013 story out of Kansas Watchdog, a conservative news website. That story says Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City (which is primarily based in Missouri but also serves two Kansas counties) sent out notices to about 10,000 Kansan policyholders, on top of the 9,450 from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas. For Roberts, this is where the story ends. But in reality, the thousands of people who received these letters did not end up without insurance. The following November -- after the failed roll out of HealthCare.gov (Kansas uses the federal marketplace) -- Obama announced that people who had recieved these nonrenewal notices could keep their policies through 2014. Then in March of this year, Kansas agreed to another transitional policy that allowed all of these policies to continue through 2016. It’s Sheppard’s understanding that Kansas insurance companies turned around and retracted those nonrenewal notices -- meaning the thousands of people who received those notices were able to keep their health insurance. Retracting the nonrenewal notices caused some behind-the-scenes challenges for the carriers, but ""for the consumer it was pretty easy,"" said Scott Brunner, senior analyst at the Kansas Health Institute, a nonprofit think tank. Of course, these policyholders could have chosen not to renew. They could have picked a different plan, switched to a different provider or dropped insurance altogether -- but they were not forced out of health insurance by the Affordable Care Act. ""It is disingenuous to focus on those who lost insurance without acknowledging that it doesn’t mean they are currently (uninsured),"" said Roberta Riportella, a professor of community health at Kansas State University who supports the Affordable Care Act. Roberts’ ad also ignores that the number of uninsured Kansans who have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Because the state does not meticulously track the number of insured folks, and the law only became fully implemented this year, it is hard to know with certainty how many people gained insurance as a result of Obamacare. But about 57,000 Kansans are now enrolled in the health insurance marketplace, Riportella said. If Kansas follows national estimates, then roughly half of those people were previously uninsured. There’s no evidence to suggest that more people are uninsured now than before the Affordable Care Act was implemented, Brunner said. ""The expectation would be that with the Affordable Care Act that the number would continue to decline,"" he said. Our ruling Roberts said, ""20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of (Obamacare)."" There’s no official information to corroborate Roberts’ claim. Several thousand Kansans received notices that their insurance plans could not be renewed because they did not comply with Obamacare standards, but the notices were retracted about a month later. Meanwhile, about 57,000 Kansans obtained insurance on HealthCare.gov. If the state follows the national trend, roughly half of these people were uninsured before the law.

Alderman Nik Kovac says police, fire workers routinely get 4% raises
","Some city employees would get a New Year’s gift under a proposal by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to soften Act 10’s effect on their pocketbooks. After losing a legal fight, the city is complying with Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011 collective-bargaining law and will begin deducting pension contributions from those workers not already making them. To help offset the pension contributions, Barrett wants to give 3.9 percent raises for general city employees. The plan, which carries a price tag of $4.8 million, would not apply to police and firefighters. They were exempted from the provisions of Act 10. City officials say most fire and police personnel pay little or nothing toward their pensions and -- unlike most other city employees -- still can negotiate over benefits and pay. East Side Alderman Nik Kovac said Barrett’s plan for raises seems reasonable. And in a Sept. 30, 2014 Fox6 TV interview, Kovac addressed the disparities between different groups of city employees under Act 10. Police and fire officials ""are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting a zero or 1 percent raise,"" Kovac said. ""That imbalance, the longer it continues, is going to hurt morale and make it harder and harder to run the city in a fair manner."" Four percent vs. nothing? Routinely? That got our attention. On Facebook, a few firefighters pushed back on Kovac’s claim, saying they have not seen a raise in two or three years. ""Nic, where are you getting 4% annually?"" a Fire Department employee commented. ""This is not just misleading, it’s wrong."" What are the real numbers? When we asked Kovac for backup, he said he spoke off the cuff with the TV reporter. In doing so, he misspoke. After checking the recent history of raises with the city budget office, Kovac said he should not have said ""routine"" or ""annual"" in regards to 4 percent raises for police and fire. Maria Monteagudo, the city’s employee relations director, sent us the base pay increases for city employees back to 1991. Here are the percentage raises from 2010 to present. (Fire and police unions ratified contracts for 2010-2012 after Act 10 took effect in 2011).
  Fire Police General Managers 2010 0% 0% 0% 0% 2011 0.5%-0.8% 0% 0% 0% 2012 4.3% 3.55%* 0% 0% 2013 n/a** n/a** 1.5% 1.5% 2014 n/a** n/a** 1.0% 1.0% **Contract negotiations ongoing   In 2012, firefighters and police received raises in the 4 percent range while general employees received nothing. But that was a one-year blip. With that exception, across-the-board raises have been small or nonexistent for all city employees dating to 2010, the year before Act 10. One important note: For 2013 and 2014, public safety employees have not yet negotiated a contract with the city. So while they have received nothing so far, they could still receive raises retroactively once a contract agreement is reached. General city workers and managers received small raises for those two years. That was done without collective bargaining for most of those workers, because the largest labor union representing city employees was not recertified under Act 10 rules, Monteagudo said. Before 2010, city employees of all types typically got 2 percent to 3 percent raises with small variations. Unionized workers typically were around the top of that range, with non-represented managers closer to the low end. Within the union ranks since 2007, police and fire raises have outstripped those for general workers. Mandatory furloughs, including of police and fire workers, have cut further into pay. Barrett’s 2015 budget would eliminate furloughs for non-uniformed workers, while their future use for police and fire workers would depend on the outcome of labor negotiations. Our rating Kovac said police and fire workers ""are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting zero or one percent raises."" That scenario was seen in 2012, but so far has not reappeared. Uniformed workers have had a leg up on general employees since Act 10, but only marginally in a time of austerity.

Barack Obama says states that raised minimum wages have had higher job growth this year
","President Barack Obama is renewing his call -- stalled by Republican opposition in Congress -- to raise the minimum wage to $10.10. ""We should be raising the minimum wage to make sure that more workers who have been working full-time shouldn’t be living in poverty,"" Obama said in an Oct. 3 speech at a manufacturing plant in Princeton, Ind. He noted that ""about 13 states and a bunch of cities around the country have gone ahead and done it without Congress."" ""When you hear folks saying, well, if you raise the minimum wage that's going to be fewer jobs -- it turns out the states that have raised the minimum wage have had faster job growth than the states that haven’t raised the minimum wage,"" he added. We wondered whether Obama was correct. The White House told us they were referring to the seasonally adjusted growth of non-farm jobs since December 2013. So we crunched the numbers for state-level employment data, which is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The comparison involved nine states that increased their minimum wage automatically early in the year to keep pace with inflation (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington) plus four more states that passed new laws to hike the wage (Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island). The other side consisted of 37 states that didn’t boost their minimum wage at all. We calculated the differences between wage-raising states and non-raising states in two ways. One was to simply average the job-growth rates for all states in each category, with each state weighted equally. The other was to determine the combined increase in jobs for all states in a given category; this second method effectively places more weight on what’s happening in larger-population states. Using the first method, we found that job growth over that eight-month period averaged 1.074 percent per state in the wage-raising states, compared to 0.871 percent per state in the non-wage-raising states. This provides support for Obama’s claim, though it’s a pretty small difference -- just two-tenths of one percent. Using the second method -- the one that gives greater weight to high-population states -- we found that job growth over that eight-month period averaged 1.092 percent in the wage-raising states, compared to 1.090 percent in the non-wage-raising states. That’s a higher rate of job growth in the minimum-wage-raising states -- but by the almost comically narrow margin of 2/1,000ths of one percent. So Obama has some very small numerical support for his claim that growth rates over that period are higher in states that raised their wage. But as support goes, economists we interviewed said it’s an awfully thin reed. Here’s why this scale of difference doesn’t mean a whole lot. • Employment figures are ""noisy."" That means they tend to move around a lot. So economists caution against reading too much into upward or downward movements in these numbers; they may simply be random blips. One way to illustrate this is to use a slightly different time frame. We decided to run the numbers the same way, but started the clock one month later, crunching the data from January 2014 to August 2014. If you make just this one-month switch, the job-creation advantage among wage-raising states simply disappears. The difference in job growth ""could just be random chance,"" said Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. • The raw data we’re using has built-in margins of error. A related point is that BLS’s job figures may seem precise on the surface, but the agency warns that they are only the best approximation -- there’s a margin of error that has to be taken into account with every figure. For the nation as a whole, the monthly job figures have a margin of error of about 90,000 jobs -- meaning that if the number of jobs is reported to grow nationally by 100,000, the actual amount will very likely be somewhere between 10,000 and 190,000. The widely reported figure of 90,000 is simply the best guess within that range, rather than an absolute. Each state has their own margin of error. This degree of uncertainty becomes particularly important when Obama is relying on such small differences to make his point about the impact of the minimum wage on job growth. When he argues that a difference of two-tenths of a percentage point is enough to hang a talking point on -- much less 2/1,000ths of a percentage point -- it’s important to remember that’s a difference so small it is likely within the margins of error. • Eight months is a short period for drawing conclusions. ""I would never draw an inference about employment effects by considering the observed change in employment in just the first six or eight months after its enactment, period,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""I would be flabbergasted if it turned out that the effect over such a short period of time could offer a valid indicator of the impact of minimum-wage hikes on employment. You need more time, and you need to make some kind of rudimentary control for the economic trends in the states that preceded the wage hike."" The White House told PolitiFact that there’s precedent for an eight-month window in studying this question, pointing to this widely cited 1994 study on the minimum wage. More broadly, the White House frames Obama’s comment not as proclaiming that minimum-wage hikes cause faster job growth, but as a reaction to critics who argue that minimum-wage hikes inevitably hamper job creation. That is a more defensible point, and it’s true that Obama prefaced his claim by saying, ""When you hear folks saying, well, if you raise the minimum wage that's going to be fewer jobs."" However, Obama goes on to say that minimum-wage-raising states actually ""had faster job growth"" -- a stronger statement than just saying that a minimum-wage hike won’t damage job growth. Obama may not have intended to, but it would be reasonable for a listener to the Princeton, Ind., speech to think the president believes that raising the minimum wage affirmatively leads to faster job growth, and then wonder if that’s true. Our ruling Obama said ""the states that have raised the minimum wage have had faster job growth than the states that haven’t raised the minimum wage."" The White House told us they were referring to the seasonally adjusted growth of non-farm jobs since December 2013.  On the numbers, Obama has a point -- at least when using the very specific time frame he chose. But economists say that the numbers are too noisy, the margins of error are too big, and the time frame may be too short to be certain that we’re seeing the effect of a higher minimum wage. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of  context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/09/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-states-raised-minimum-wages-have/

Walker sticks to claim on Midwest jobs growth
","On Aug. 25, 2014 the Scott Walker campaign launched a TV ad that  featured the governor saying this about the July employment numbers: ""Well, the latest job numbers are in and Wisconsin created more private-sector jobs than Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois. That means we ranked third in the Midwest."" We rated that Mostly True. The ranking among the 10 states was right, but only if you use the raw number of jobs added instead of the more revealing percentage growth. Well, now that summer has turned to fall, there’s a new batch of monthly jobs numbers out, with August being the latest month available. And a new Walker TV ad makes the same claim comparing midwestern states over the last 12 months: ""The truth? In the last year, Wisconsin ranked third in Midwest job growth."" Is the ranking still right? No. The ad sent us back to the best source of federal employment data, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker is using the monthly data for his comparison. This time around, Wisconsin has dropped a spot. Wisconsin ranks fourth out of 10, not third, both in raw jobs growth and in percentage change from August 2013 to August 2014. In the new rankings, based on preliminary August numbers, Wisconsin (1.2 percent growth for the year) trailed North Dakota (No. 1 rank nationally with 5.3 percent growth), Indiana and Minnesota on percentage change. Same story on the increase in the raw number of jobs over the year: Wisconsin came in fourth among 10 states. That put Wisconsin’s rank nationally at 32nd. In the new ad, Walker discloses in an on-screen graphic that he’s using the July-to-July figures. But that text runs counter to his spoken claim of ""in the last year."" Defending the new ad, the Walker campaign said that the July data is final, revised estimates in contrast to the preliminary August data. But we note that in the campaign’s earlier ad, Walker didn’t hesitate to use the preliminary July data and use it to round out the ""latest"" one year period when it showed the ranking was third. Rating switch Walker himself clearly knew better. On Sept. 19, the governor sent out this tweet from his personal account after the new numbers came out: ""WI is 4th in the Midwest for private sector job creation & % growth (CES BLS Aug 2013 - Aug 2014)."" His campaign, which is airing new TV ads frequently, had plenty of time to absorb the August jobs report (released Sept. 18, 2014) before putting out his new ad (released Oct. 8, 2014). We’ve taken a similarly dim view of numerical maneuvering by Democrat Mary Burke’s campaign. In August, we rated True a Burke claim that Wisconsin was ""dead last"" in the Midwest based on a three-year time span coinciding with the first three years of Walker’s term. But when Burke made a similar statement in September and framed it around the latest numbers showing the drop, we rated her claim False -- a rating Walker highlights in his new ad. She cited accurate data -- Wisconsin ranked last in the Midwest from March 2011 to March 2014. But that period was out of sync with the start of Walker’s term. In her claims, Burke has been using quarterly jobs data, which is more reliable than the monthly data but lags significantly. Notable in that rating: For the most recent 12-month period by that measure, Wisconsin no longer ranked last of 10 states. It ranked 8th of 10 states. Our rating In a new TV ad, Walker says ""the truth"" is that ""in the last year, Wisconsin ranked third in midwest job growth."" That’s old news. The updated ranking is fourth, closer to middle of the pack, something the governor knew before his ad aired. We rate the claim False.

Dan Patrick errs on Leticia Van de Putte and Central America, but ad is right on other fronts
","Republican Dan Patrick, vowing to make border security his priority, says his Democratic opponent for lieutenant governor has been hiding her ""failed record on illegal immigration."" In a TV ad shared by the Houston state senator on Facebook Oct. 8, 2014, the narrator says: ""Leticia Van de Putte,"" a San Antonio state senator, ""opposed putting National Guard troops on the border, would send millions to Central American governments instead and wrote the law giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants."" A note: Patrick’s ad opened with his declaration that Islamic State group ""terrorists threaten to cross our border and kill Americans."" In September 2014, PolitiFact looked into a similar claim, concluding it’s highly unlikely that ISIS would operate in Mexico and stage an attack that involves crossing the border. But for this article, we focused on Patrick’s three charges about his opponent, finding two of them solid and the third a bit of a twist. Let’s take them one by one. Troops on the border As the ad says in type displayed on screen, Van de Putte said in a July 21, 2014, campaign press release that Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to dispatch up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the border was the ""wrong way to go."" In her release, she said a better approach would be to provide local and state law enforcement agencies with resources they request and need. Van de Putte, referring to the uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the Rio Grande, conceded National Guard members are prepared for many missions. ""But to strictly militarize the border won’t help us meet this unique humanitarian challenge,"" she said. So, the Democrat opposed the troop deployment. In-state tuition for undocumented immigrants Van de Putte also played a major role in presenting the 2001 legislation affording in-state college tuition rates to some immigrants unauthorized to live in the U.S., though contrary to Patrick’s ad, Van de Putte wasn’t the proposal’s author -- as in original sponsor. The lead author was then-Rep. Ric Noriega, D-Houston. She was darned close, however, by serving as the Senate sponsor of the House-approved proposal that came to the Senate before later making it to Perry to be signed into law, legislative records show; indeed, no other senators co-sponsored the act. Under the law, which Perry has long defended, children of Texas residents who entered the country without legal permission may qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. In the 2001 legislative session, Perry has accurately said, very few legislators opposed the action. Millions to Central America And what of Patrick’s third dart -- that Van de Putte favors sending government aid to countries in Central America instead of putting Texas troops on the border? Patrick’s ad lists a June 14, 2014, news report by KGBT-TV, Channel 4 in Harlingen, as his basis for the government-aid claim. We watched the report and read a story posted with the station’s news video and didn’t notice Van de Putte directly saying she would prefer to send millions of dollars to such countries. According to the news report, Van de Putte told a station reporter after visiting a U.S. Border Patrol facility in Brownsville holding thousands of mothers and children that it’s time for Congress to embark on immigration reform. According to the station’s online write-up, Van de Putte also asked Congress to strongly consider accepting President Barack Obama’s $3.7 billion request to deal with the border crisis (though this described message for Congress wasn’t part of KGBT-TV’s video report). With a nudge from Alejandro Garcia, Patrick’s campaign spokesman, we spotted references to Obama’s proposal touching on money for border security and other needs in countries in Central America. When Obama unsuccessfully sought the $3.7 billion in July 2014, he said the government needed the spending to pay for new detention facilities to house the additional border-crossers coming from Central America and to conduct more aerial surveillance and hire immigration judges and Border Patrol agents. The Central America angle: Garcia pointed out a July 2014 breakdown of Obama’s $3.7 billion request by USA Today stating $295 million of his requested aid would go to the State Department and other international programs to ""support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help regional governments better control their borders and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance and citizen security conditions. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries,"" the paper said. We saw the same dollar figure and explanation in a July 8, 2014, White House ""fact sheet."" Then again, Patrick’s camp didn’t provide nor did we spot evidence Van de Putte said that instead of Texas paying to station troops near the Texas-Mexico border, state dollars should go to countries in Central America. It’s worth noting, too, that she talked up Obama’s $3.7 billion request about five weeks before Perry revealed he was considering dispatching troops to the border. Perry issued the deployment order July 21, 2014. Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte ""opposed putting National Guard troops on the border, would send millions to Central American governments instead and wrote the law giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants."" Van de Putte was the Senate sponsor of the House-originated 2001 proposal authorizing in-state tuition for immigrants not living here with legal permission. She also opposed this summer's National Guard deployment. However, she didn’t say that instead of placing  troops near the border, the state should aid countries in Central America. Rather, Van de Putte earlier and separately urged congressional approval of an Obama request that included federal aid to such countries. Suggesting she conflated spending on the Texas troops with the sought federal funding amounts to a misleading stretch. On balance, we rate Patrick's statement Half True.

Did Washington tell responders to prep for Ebola months ago? No
","As if Ebola were not frightening enough in its own right, it is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. One of the latest comes from Morgan Brittany, a former actress from the original television soap opera Dallas who is now a commentator with the conspiracy-minded blog WND. Brittany suggests that Ebola is part of a larger White House plan to control the nation. Brittany’s column describes a Los Angeles dinner party where the conversation turned grim. ""One of the men brought up the fact that Washington has known for months if not years that we were at risk for some sort of global pandemic,"" Brittany wrote. ""According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that’s just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened."" A few months ago, we debunked that last eyebrow-raising bit about the government being behind the surge of undocumented children at the border. Now, we examine whether something called ""the Disaster Assistance Response Team"" was told to get ready for an outbreak of Ebola. Brittany’s column provided a link to Global Research, another conspiracy website. Global Research had its own alarming article. ""A large government supplier of emergency response products specializing in ‘high risk events’ says that Disaster Assistance Response Teams were told to prepare to be activated in the month of October. The shocking revelation, made on the Golden State FIRE EMS Twitter page, suggests that not only did someone know that the Ebola virus would be reaching America, but that they knew exactly when it would happen."" Global Research even had a screenshot of the Twitter exchange from Sept. 30, and indeed, there we found, ""DART teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October. Timing seems weird. Source: current DART member."" The tweets are authentic. What’s lacking is anything of substance behind them. We spoke to Ed Castillo, president of Golden State FIRE EMS. Castillo was regretful. ""A couple of EMS guys were talking about conspiracy theories,"" Castillo said. ""There are no facts to support it. It can be written off as a couple of guys shooting the breeze."" Golden State is based in Woodland Hills, Calif. Among other services, it contracts with Hollywood film companies to have a medical team on hand when they shoot stunt sequences. Castillo said the company’s only goal now is to ""extinguish the flames"" and stop hearing from conspiracy theorists. ""These guys came out of the woodwork left and right,"" Castillo said. ""We had to tear down our Twitter account. Now we’re just sticking to Facebook and our Web page. We just want to get back to work."" The Golden State tweets might have been vacuous blather taken as reality, but the Global Research and Brittany posts went beyond even what the tweets said. Their reference to a ""large government supplier of emergency response products"" seems to have greatly reimagined Golden State’s line of work. To write about ""the Disaster Assistance Response Team"" as a singular entity also seems odd. Such a name applies generically to any group that jumps in to help in a disaster. Brittany doesn’t write definitively that these theories are accurate but closed her article on a note of fear. ""Maybe the current administration needs this to happen so martial law can be declared, guns can be seized and the populace can be controlled. Once that happens … game over."" Our ruling Brittany passed along as fact that a government supplier knew that emergency responders had been told well in advance to get ready for Ebola. The rumor was based on tweets from a private California medical and safety services company, which now says the tweets were based on nothing.

Thom Tillis says North Carolina is 'near the national average' for unemployment.
","Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, said during a recent debate that the Tar Heel State has come a long way since the onset of the great recession. ""We came from far behind,"" Tillis said. ""Fourth-highest unemployment rate when I came in, now we're near the national average."" We wondered: Is North Carolina now ""near the national average"" for unemployment? As it turns out, things have improved in the state, but they haven’t improved as much as Tillis suggested. We looked at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data. We found that for the most recent available month -- August 2014 -- North Carolina had an unemployment rate of 6.8 percent. That’s much lower than it was in January 2011, when Tillis assumed the office of state House speaker -- it was 10.4 percent. That’s a decline of just over one-third its previous level. (We’re not saying he gets all the credit for that drop -- simply that it happened during his tenure.) But despite this significant improvement in the North Carolina unemployment rate, it’s an exaggeration to say North Carolina is ""near the national average."" North Carolina’s August rate of 6.8 percent is 0.7 percentage points higher than the nation as a whole during August, and 0.9 points higher than the nation for September. (BLS releases national numbers before state-by-state numbers.) It’s a stretch to say it’s ""near"" the national average. By way of comparison, it took the nation nine months this year to drop its unemployment rate by 0.7 points, and it took North Carolina 11 months to shed 0.7 points to its current level. So a difference of 0.7 percentage points is a lot of ground to make up. Looking at North Carolina’s ranking among states provides further detail, but the result is not much more favorable to the accuracy of Tillis’ claim. In the state-by-state rankings for August, North Carolina is tied with Alaska for the 38th-best unemployment rate in the nation. That means it’s in the weakest one-quarter of states, not somewhere around half. Our ruling Tillis said that in North Carolina, ""now we're near the national average"" for unemployment. He has a point that the state has dropped its unemployment rate significantly in the past few years, but he exaggerates about how close the state is to the national average. In reality, North Carolina’s unemployment rate ranks it in the lowest one-quarter of states.

","The debate over including a citizenship question on the 2020 census has been heating up since the March 26, 2018, U.S. Commerce Department announcement of its census plans. Officials said the question -- which asks respondents whether they are citizens -- will be included for all respondents at the request of the Justice Department. The department said the purpose of the question is to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. Meanwhile, immigrant-rights advocates and Democrats argue that the question instills fear in immigrant communities and will lead to an undercount of the population. The population count, taken every 10 years, is required by the U.S. Constitution and used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House as well as how federal money is distributed to local communities. Since undocumented immigrants are more heavily concentrated in some states and areas, an undercount would mean less money and could change how legislative districts are drawn. California, which has a large immigrant population, has filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Commerce Department and census bureau seeking to block the question.   During a March 28, 2018, interview with host John Muir on the ""Restoring Reason"" program on Green Bay’s WTAQ radio, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel slammed the opposition to the census question. ""When you talk about the Democrats, too, look at what they are fighting for. They are now mad that our census, which for years and years and years, decades, has asked, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States of America?’ – they are mad that the census asks that simple question."" Is McDaniel correct? Has the citizenship question that is now at the center of a debate already been asked for ""years and years and years""? The evidence The history section of the U.S. Census Bureau’s web page notes that the first U.S. census was taken in 1790. At that time the questions asked for the name of the head of the family and the number of persons in each household, including slaves. As part of its announcement, the Commerce Department said that citizenship questions have been included on prior censuses:   Between 1820 and 1950, almost every decennial census asked a question on citizenship in some form. Today, surveys of sample populations, such as the Current Population Survey and the ACS (American Community Survey), continue to ask a question on citizenship. According to our colleagues at PolitiFact National, the last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 Census. That census questioned where individuals were born, and ""if foreign-born — is he naturalized?"" In 1960, the census only asked about place of birth. From 1970 to 2000, the Census Bureau used two questionnaires: a long-form and short-form. Most households received the short-form questionnaire, which covered basic questions, while about 1 in 6 households received a long-form questionnaire that included a question on citizenship. The 2010 Census, the most recent one, only used a short-form questionnaire with 10 questions. None of those related to citizenship. However, in the mid-2000s the Census Bureau began gathering demographic and socioeconomic information through the American Community Survey, or ACS. The survey  collects information from about 3.5 million households a year and asks about citizenship status. The ACS asks such questions as ""In what U.S. state, territory, commonwealth or foreign country was this person born?"" Another question is ""Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?"" The idea with both the now-defunct long-form and the ongoing ACS survey is to use a large sample of responses to draw conclusions about the population as whole, much as a poll does not need to contact every voter to be considered valid. Our rating McDaniel said the census ""for years and years and years, decades, has asked, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States of America?’"" The last time all households were asked about U.S. citizenship was in the 1950 census. But in the decades since, some version of the question has been asked in nearly every census -- either through the now-defunct ""long form"" or the ongoing annual surveys. The 2020 census calls for asking all households the citizenship question. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate McDaniel’s claim Mostly True.   ",/factchecks/2018/apr/03/ronna-mcdaniel/rnc-chair-ronna-mcdaniel-says-us-census-bureau-ask/

Donald Trump says caravans of people coming through Mexico to cross U.S. border
","In a tweet,  President Donald Trump ruled out a deal to restore a program protecting certain young immigrants from deportation in part by warning that the Mexico-U.S. border could soon be besieged by a pile of people. Trump said April 1, 2018: ""Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!"" The tweet folded in familiar terms. ""Catch and release"" refers to the practice of releasing immigrants apprehended at or near the border, expecting them to appear later before a U.S. immigration judge. DACA stands for the Trump-rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created on President Barack Obama's watch to shield hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. We focused this fact-check on Trump’s fresh statement that ""caravans"" are coming our way, presumably from south of the Texas-Mexico border. To our inquiry, a White House spokesman, Steven Cheung, said by email that there have been such caravans in the past and estimates indicate there are 1,000 individuals participating in the caravan Trump had in mind. A Fox News discussion Cheung didn't provide more detail. But before the president tweeted, a Fox News program the same morning featured a discussion of a caravan headed toward the U.S. through Mexico. CNN reported April 1, 2018: ""Trump appears to be referring to a migrant caravan assembled by the group Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People without Borders), which was discussed on Fox News' ‘Fox & Friends’ shortly before he published his tweet. It's not known if the President watched the specific segment, but he indirectly referenced claims mentioned in an on-air interview with a Border Patrol union representative."" Similarly, a news story in The Washington Post pointed to the described caravan as the likely basis of Trump’s concern. The Post story took note that a leader of the National Border Patrol Council, which says it represents some 18,000 Border Patrol agents and support personnel, had been interviewed on the Fox News program. Afterward, the council asserted in a web post that Trump’s tweet was referring to a large group of immigrants making their way to the U.S. border. In the Fox News segment, the council’s president, Brandon Judd, was asked how the Border Patrol would react to the group eventually arriving at the border. Judd responded that a Mexican government entity was helping the group proceed and Pueblos Sin Fronteras, a U.S. group, also was helping. Judd said that once the people made it across the border, each one could request political asylum before getting released by authorities and then not showing up later for an immigration hearing. News stories confirm caravan entered Mexico Fox News’s report was accompanied by a photo tweeted by Adolfo Flores, national security correspondent for BuzzFeed News, who reported from Mexico March 30, 2018, that hundreds of men, women and children had crossed into Mexico from Central America and were moving north--1,200 as of the group’s first night in Mexico, the story said. BuzzFeed’s story said: ""For five days now hundreds of Central Americans — children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras — have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them. ""Organized by a group of volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, the caravan is intended to help migrants safely reach the United States, bypassing not only authorities who would seek to deport them, but gangs and cartels who are known to assault vulnerable migrants."" As of March 30, the story said, the caravan had made it to the southern Mexico state of Oaxaca but it wasn’t immediately successful getting participants onto a freight train heading north. Oaxaca, the state’s capital, is more than 900 miles from Laredo, Texas on the border. Buzzfeed’s story also said: ""While there are organizers from Pueblos Sin Fronteras leading the way, much of the effort to get to the U.S. border is in the hands of the migrants themselves."" Also, the story says that according to organizers, about two-thirds of people are planning on crossing into the U.S. ""undetected or asking for some type of protection like asylum."" Caravan spokesman: Not everyone will cross U.S. border That's not what we heard from Irineo Mujica Arzate, a Pueblos Sin Fronteras press contact who told us he was speaking to us from the caravan itself. Arzate said in a phone interview April 2, 2018 that the group helped organize two caravans in 2017 but, he said, there’s only the existing caravan planned for 2018. Arzate said that he doesn’t expect every member of the caravan to cross the U.S. border. Most will try to stay in Mexico, Arzate said, with about 200 to 300 individuals ultimately crossing the U.S. border to seek asylum--a forecast that we found to be far short of published forecasts. ""We’re trying to do it in a sensible way,"" Arzate said. Pueblos Sin Fronteras says on its website that for 15 years, ""members have been reaching out to the most vulnerable immigrants in the United States and to migrants and refugees on the move."" Members, the group says, ""accompany migrants and refugees in their journey of hope."" On its site, Pueblo Sin Fronteras calls the caravan the ""Via Crucis,"" or Stations of the Cross, march. Our search of the Nexis news database yielded an April 2015 news story from the Malaysian national news service, Bernama, of a march that year from Mexico's southern border to Mexico City. According to the story, the ""Via Crucis"" name draws a parallel between the suffering Jesus endured and the ordeal experienced by migrants. News stories indicate a planned 2018 stop in Central Mexico Our search of the Nexis database for other news stories about the caravan turned up another account of the 2018 arrivals into Mexico. Noticias Financieras said in a March 26, 2018, story that nearly 1,500 people fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala had entered Mexico--with the majority hoping to reach the U.S. border to be considered as refugees. Also, a March 26, 2018, story posted on SplinterNews.com, which describes itself as news and opinions that get under your skin, specified that the 1,500 people who entered Mexico would seek asylum in the U.S. after a month-long journey. The story quoted Rodrigo Abeja, described as a Mexico-based organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, expressing surprise at the turnout. Abeja said the group’s caravans in 2017 drew about 450 migrants, the story said. Then again, several accounts mentioned plans for caravan members to seek legal advice at a gathering in Puebla, in central Mexico. According to a fact-check from the Associated Press, posted the day after Trump tweeted, the caravan was scheduled to end later in April in Puebla, which is some 650 miles from the U.S. border. ""After the formal caravans end,"" the AP story said, ""some migrants do try to reach the U.S. border, but often just to turn themselves in and request asylum."" Our ruling President Trump tweeted that caravans of immigrants are coming to the Mexico-U.S. border. We confirmed that a caravan of 1,200 to 1,500 people from Central America--not caravans--was in southern Mexico, about 900 miles from the Rio Grande, when Trump tweeted. Also, accounts vary on whether all participants are bound to enter the U.S. An organizer estimated that most of the people intend to remain in Mexico. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

Donald Trump off-base in comparison of U.S., Mexico border laws
","  President Donald Trump offered an unflattering comparison between immigration laws in the United States and those of its southern neighbor, Mexico, in a series of immigration tweets. ""Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws -- ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!"" Trump tweeted on April 2. Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws! We decided to take a closer look at Trump’s comparison of the countries’ immigration policies. Is Mexico really more strict about who it admits? The White House held up an article published in the conservative-leaning Washington Times in 2010 as support for Trump’s statement. Among other points, the article said that Mexican law since 2000 ""mandates that federal, local and municipal police cooperate with federal immigration authorities in that country in the arrests of illegal immigrants."" The article outlines steep felony penalties for violations and says Mexico can use the law to kick out foreigners for a variety of reasons, including a lack of financial self-support. There’s a problem with citing this nearly eight-year-old article, however: The 2000 law has largely been superseded by a law enacted in 2011. Notably, the 2011 measure decriminalized the act of entering the country without documentation and allowed undocumented immigrants to use education and health services. It also set criminal penalties for abuse of migrants by immigration agents. The 2011 law stemmed from two impulses, said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a group that generally opposes a hard-line approach to immigration. ""They wanted to create a law that respected immigrants and cleaned up human-rights violations,"" Selee said. ""They also didn’t want to embarrass themselves with the United States.  Mexican human-rights advocates would beat them over the head for the punitive aspects of the old law, while also enabling enforcement capabilities. It was a delicate balance."" Meanwhile, the article’s point about requiring local Mexican jurisdictions to cooperate with the federal government is a red herring for the United States, said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""The requirement for states and localities to cooperate is neither here nor there, because the U.S. system of federalism prevents any such law from existing,"" Bier said. Immigration policy specialists added that there’s a difference between the Mexican laws on the books and enforcement of those laws. ""As anywhere, individuals who are caught without proper authorization in Mexico will be deported from the country,"" said Sonja Wolf, a researcher with the Drug Policy Program at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), a think tank in Aguascalientes, Mexico. ""The question is to what extent the authorities have the capacity and the will to implement the legal requirements."" One point bolstering Trump’s position is that Mexico does allow a much lower rate of immigration as a percentage of its population than the United States does. In that sense, Trump has a point that the United States is broadly more open to immigration than Mexico. But most of the additional evidence weakens Trump’s argument in the tweet. For starters, it’s important to remember that the enforcement mechanism of U.S. immigration laws is robust and has become more so in recent years. The U.S. Border Patrol ""has 19,000 officers with a budget of $3.8 billion,"" said Douglas S. Massey, a professor of public policy and sociology at Princeton University who specializes in immigration between the United States and Mexico. ""It is the most controlled and hardened border anywhere in the world with the exception of Korea's DMZ."" Since the late 2000s, increases in Border Patrol resources have combined with a tougher protocol for handling incoming migrants, including more deportation proceedings and incarceration. ""Based on the previous 20 years’ experience, we would have expected increased apprehensions of Mexicans after 2009 as the U.S. economy improved and unemployment plummeted,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. ""Instead, apprehensions of Mexicans continued to decline."" The United States removed more than 3 million non-citizens from the United States between 2008 and 2016. ""Immigration crimes are still the No. 1 reason for a federal criminal arrest in the United States,"" Bier said. Another important point: In recent years, Central Americans have accounted for a growing share of migrants coming into Mexico, due to deteriorating conditions in countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. While Mexico has taken a variety of measures to limit illegal immigration and asylum for Central Americans, specialists have deemed efforts on Mexico’s southern border to be largely unsuccessful. ""Mexico's borders are quite porous,"" said Wolf of the Mexican think tank. ""There are many areas where people and goods can pass through fairly easily, and there is little that the migration authorities or the security forces could do about that."" A final note: In recent years, the United States and Mexico have significantly increased their cooperation on cross-border issues, such as drug trafficking and terrorism. This cooperation deepened due to the Merida Initiative during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, ""and, at least up until now, it has continued through the Trump administration,"" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute. Trump tweeted that Mexico has ""very strong border laws — ours are pathetic."" Broadly, Mexico does admit fewer immigrants than the United States. But the strict Mexican law cited by the White House as evidence has largely been supplanted by a softer 2011 law. In addition, Trump underplays the increasing robustness of U.S. immigration laws and enforcement even under his predecessors, while downplaying how porous Mexico’s own southern border is.

No, the Postal Service isn't losing a fortune on Amazon
","President Donald Trump took a swing at Amazon once more on April 2, blaming the digital retailer for the United States Postal Service’s financial woes. ""Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,"" Trump tweeted. ""THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!""  Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field! We addressed the closing of retailers across the country in another Amazon-USPS tweet-inspired story last week. (Trump had a point.) But for this fact-check, we wondered whether Amazon is causing the Postal Service to ""lose a fortune."" The post office is losing a fortune, but Trump is wrong to blame Amazon. The Postal Service reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for 2017. It has lost $65.1 billion since 2007. Much of the red ink is attributed to a 2006 law mandating that USPS pre-fund future retirees’ health benefits. First-class mail, the USPS’ biggest source of revenue, also continued to shrink, seeing a $1.87 billion revenue loss in fiscal year 2017. Package delivery, however, was one of the few bright spots in its latest financial statement. In 2017, parcels brought in $19.5 billion, or 28 percent of USPS’ annual revenue. At $2.1 billion, packages contributed the largest revenue increase. Deals with private shippers like Amazon accounted for $7 billion of the $19.5 billion in revenue. While we know that Amazon is the biggest e-commerce player, we don’t know exactly how much of the $7 billion comes from Amazon, because the details of the postal service’s deals with private shippers are considered proprietary and not made public. USPS ships about 40 percent of Amazon’s packages. Amazon bulk-delivers packages to a USPS distribution center, and the Postal Service brings it to your door. USPS negotiates the discounted rate for that service with Amazon, as it does all other bulk shippers. Those rates are kept under wraps. That said, we do know the Amazon deal is at least a break-even venture. That’s because the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost. ""By law our competitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon, must cover their costs,"" an August 2017 USPS press release said. ""Our regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), looks carefully at this question every year and has determined that they do. The PRC has also noted that competitive products help fund the infrastructure of the Postal Service."" In fact, the Postal Regulatory Commission gave the green light to the USPS-Amazon deal the same day Trump began tweeting about Amazon last week. Trump might have a point, however, in saying the USPS could be making more money off Amazon. For example, Citigroup found that on average, USPS was charging $1.46 below market rates for parcel delivery (not just to Amazon). Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers, explained the Postal Service can offer lower prices than their private competitors because they already ""go to every house, every day."" ""We’re already going there to deliver mail and bills and advertising, so the marginal cost of delivering an extra package is not high, especially in the low-density areas,"" Sauber said. Trump tweeted, ""Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed."" Amazon isn’t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it’s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. While we don’t know the deal USPS crafted with Amazon, we know it’s not losing money. A 2006 law codified profitability into law, and an independent regulatory commission that reviews their deals annually gave it a green light on March 29. That said, it’s possible that the Postal Service could be charging Amazon more for package delivery and therefore get a better deal. That still doesn’t mean USPS is losing a fortune. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/apr/02/donald-trump/trump-usps-postal-service-amazon-losing-fortune/

Michael McCaul says 1 in 100 people is a sociopath
","A Texas congressman commenting on the man linked to bombings around Austin before blowing himself up made a claim about the prevalence of sociopaths that made us wonder. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, told Karina Kling on the March 26, 2018, edition of Spectrum News’ Capital Tonight: ""He’s a sociopath. He claims I’ve been a psychopath all my life. You know, 1 in 100 people are sociopaths. They have no remorse or conscience or guilt when they commit acts of murder like in this case. So he had no remorse."" A sociopath, per Merriam-Webster, is someone who behaves in a dangerous or violent way toward other people and doesn’t feel guilty about such behavior. And that describes 1 in 100 of us? A note: Our inquiries about McCaul’s claim led us to recognize that experts don’t necessarily use the word ""sociopath."" For instance, the American Psychiatric Association responded to our inquiry about sociopaths by pointing out diagnostic criteria for ""antisocial personality disorder."" The disorder’s essential feature is a ""pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood,"" according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual further says its prevalence has been found to range from 0.2 percent to 3.3 percent. McCaul cites FBI article But Lizzie Litzow of McCaul’s office told us by email that McCaul had relied on research into another disorder as described in a 2012 article in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin titled ""Psychopathy."" That word, the article says, ""refers to a personality disorder that includes a cluster of interpersonal, affective, lifestyle and antisocial traits and behaviors."" The article continues: ""These involve deception; manipulation; irresponsibility; impulsivity; stimulation seeking; poor behavioral controls; shallow affect; lack of empathy, guilt, or remorse; sexual promiscuity; callous disregard for the rights of others; and unethical and antisocial behaviors. ""Psychopathy,"" the article goes on, ""is the most dangerous of the personality disorders."" Among indicators, the article says, is ""a profound lack of remorse for their aggressive actions, both violent and nonviolent, along with a corresponding lack of empathy for their victims. This central psychopathic concept enables them to act in a cold-blooded manner, using those around them as pawns to achieve goals and satisfy needs and desires, whether sexual, financial, physical, or emotional. Most psychopaths are grandiose, selfish sensation seekers who lack a moral compass—a conscience—and go through life taking what they want. They do not accept responsibility for their actions and find a way to shift the blame to someone or something else."" To McCaul’s point, the article says it’s estimated that ""approximately 1 percent of the general male population are psychopaths, and 15 to 20 percent of the prison population are psychopathic."" Psychopathy checklist That ""1 percent"" statement, we noticed, is footnoted to an article by psychologist Robert D. Hare, who invented and then refined a heralded diagnostic assessment of psychopathy dubbed the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Items gauged by an expert using the checklist include a subject’s glibness/superficial charm; egocentricity; lack of remorse or guilt; parasitic lifestyle; and impulsivity. As summed up in another researcher’s 2016 article, Hare’s scale ""amalgamated many of the traits and behaviors of psychopathy using conceptual and statistical methods to provide for a more objective and dimensional assessment of psychopathy in criminal populations."" We read the chapter noted by McCaul’s aide via the University of Texas library catalog and learned that Hare’s 1-in-100 statement lacked certainty. Hare wrote: ""In spite of their small numbers--perhaps 1% of the general population--they constitute a significant proportion of our prison populations and are responsible for a markedly disproportionate amount of serious crime, violence, and social distress."" Next, we reached Hare, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia. He advised by email that many years ago he’d offered the 1 percent estimate as an informed guess -- and it held up in subsequent studies. Still, he stressed, such calculations rest in deciding what score on the checklist scale demonstrates that a person is a psychopath--and researcher judgments vary. As measured, Hare elaborated, ""psychopathy is dimensional and not a diagnostic category. So, about all we can say is that around 1% of the male population would receive a score of 30"" on the extended exam or a score of 18 on a shorter version. Hare also told us he doesn’t use ""sociopath"" when he’s talking about psychopaths. Sociopaths, he suggested, are capable of feeling remorse or guilt. Hare later said by phone he’s unaware of surveys gauging the prevalence of sociopaths but he’d expect the percentage to be ""fairly high."" Other experts We also heard back from Scott Lilienfeld, an Emory University psychology professor. Lilienfeld said by email that the oft-cited 1 percent figure, rooted in research employing Hare’s checklist, ""may be defensible, although it is also oversimplified."" He also pointed out a 2013 Emory University breakdown of misconceptions about psychopathic personalities including, it says, the idea that a person with psychopathy poses more than a modest risk of heightened violence. ""Evidence suggests,"" Lilienfeld told us, ""that psychopathy isn’t an either-or phenomenon; instead, it is continuously distributed, much like height and weight. So there is no scientific cut-off for distinguishing psychopaths from non-psychopaths. As a result, the 1 percent figure isn’t exactly wrong, but it’s somewhat misleading because it implies that 1 in 100 people are somewhat different in kind – rather than in degree - from the rest of us. Instead, psychopathy blends imperceptibly into normality,"" Lilienfeld said. Summing up, Lilienfeld called the 1-in-100 statistic informative in that it indicates ""that a nontrivial proportion of people walking among us are markedly elevated on traits such as superficial charm, social dominance, self-centeredness, dishonesty, manipulativeness, callousness, poor impulse control, and casual sexual relationships,"" he wrote. Also to our inquiry, John Petrila of the Dallas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute pointed out a 2009 study, by researchers including Hare, that gauged the general prevalence of psychopathy. According to the study’s abstract, the researchers concluded -- after using Hare’s checklist to screen 638 individuals aged 16 to 74 in England, Wales and Scotland -- that ""psychopathy is rare, affecting less than 1% of the household population, although it is prevalent among prisoners, homeless persons and psychiatric admissions."" By email, Petrila also noted a 2015 study that says in its abstract that ""psychopathy is almost exclusively investigated within criminal populations so that its prevalence in the general population has been inferred by psychopathic traits rather than disorder (1%)."" That study takes note of a 2011 study by researchers at the Queensland Institute of Technology, in Australia, that had 300 members of the general population complete a self-reported version of the psychopathy checklist and undertake a test of deception qualities. ""Results indicated that at least 1% of the current community displayed characteristics consistent with psychopathic tendencies,"" the study’s abstract says, with ""younger males who tend to misuse alcohol"" found most likely to have the tendencies. Our ruling McCaul said 1 in 100 people are sociopaths. Mental health experts steer clear of ""sociopath"" to characterize individuals who don’t show remorse, among antisocial qualities. Still, research suggests that about 1 percent of the population consists of psychopaths though it’s also worth clarifying that such judgments are reached on a scale. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Do most children outside New York City lack full-day pre-kindergarten, as Nixon said?
","Gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon says more than three-quarters of 4-year-olds outside New York City don’t have access to state-funded full-day pre-kindergarten. Nixon blames Gov. Andrew Cuomo for the lag, calling it a broken promise.   ""In 2014, Andrew Cuomo promised that he was going to expand pre-K to all of New York's children, not just those in New York City,"" Nixon said at a press conference in Albany. ""But four years later, 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City lack full-day pre-K."" Cuomo and state lawmakers approved a five-year plan in the 2014 state budget to subsidize statewide pre-K. The plan earmarked $1.5 billion for pre-K through 2019, with $340 million for the first year. Most of the first-year money — $300 million — went to New York City schools. Is Nixon right that 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City don’t have access to full-day pre-K? The data Nixon was citing a statistic from a report by a handful of education advocacy groups, including the Alliance for Quality Education The report used data from the state Education Department. A spokesperson for the department sent us the data. The numbers reflect access to state-funded pre-K for 4-year-olds during the 2016-2017 school year, the latest data available. The state counted 103,679 4-year-olds outside New York City during that school year. Only 22,124 of them had access to state-funded full-day pre-K, according to the data. That translates to about 21 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City with access to state-funded full-day pre-K. So that means 79 percent of the children did not have state-funded full-day pre-K, confirming Nixon’s claim. That doesn’t mean the other 81,555 4-year-olds did not have access to pre-K altogether. Twenty-five percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City had access to state-funded half-day pre-K, meaning 46 percent of them had pre-K during that school year. Added to the New York City 4-year-olds who had full-day pre-K that year, about two-thirds of 4-year-olds statewide had access to state-funded full- or half-day pre-K. Between New York City, Long Island, and upstate New York, about 66 percent of 4-year-olds statewide had access to either state-funded full or half-day pre-K. Was there a deadline? Nixon is right that Cuomo promised to expand pre-K to children statewide. But Cuomo never promised statewide pre-K by the 2016-2017 school year, and the 2014 state budget did not set a deadline. Cuomo pledged funding for statewide pre-K during a radio interview before the state budget passed in 2014. ""We’re going to have a statewide pre-K program funded by the state,"" Cuomo said. ""That’s what we said we’re going to do, and that’s what we’re going to do."" Cuomo said after the 2014 budget passed that timing would depend on local districts. ""We have to watch the implementation rate and how fast we can actually make universal pre-K a reality and where,"" Cuomo said. ""But we have the funding to move the program at the pace the localities can move the program."" The state has more than doubled its funding for pre-K since 2013, from $410 million to more than $800 million.  The boost in funding did not change the share of 4-year-olds with access to pre-K outside New York City between the 2014 and 2016 school years. Only about 46 percent of those students had access to either full or half-day pre-K during the 2014-2015 school year, according to state data. That share was the same two years later. Our ruling Nixon claimed that 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City don’t have access to full-day pre-K four years after funding was earmarked in the state budget. The latest data supports Nixon’s claim, though it’s from the 2016-2017 school year. That’s three years after Cuomo and lawmakers committed funding for universal pre-K, not four as Nixon said. There was also never a deadline to implement statewide pre-K by the start of that school year. Her claim was accurate but we thought it needed additional information.

Donald Trump 'just ended welfare' for immigrants? That's False
","A website claiming President Donald Trump ended welfare for immigrants ignores critical facts as much as Trump did when he announced this was his intention.

In a nearly 1,000-word post, americatb.com recaps Trump’s desire for limits on federal benefits for immigrants, for a merit-based immigration system and for an end to ""chain migration."" The story itself isn’t as affirmative as its headline, claiming Trump is ""about to"" ban immigrants from federal benefits. ""President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years,"" the americatb.com post said. ""The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Americatb.com doesn’t indicate who’s behind the website or what its mission is, and it doesn’t list contact information. Trump in June 2017 did say he wanted new immigration rules that would bar new immigrants from public benefits for a period of at least five years. But as we pointed out back then, there’s already a federal law that does that. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 said immigrants who entered the United States on or after Aug. 22, 1996, would not be eligible for federal ""means-tested"" public benefits for five years, starting on the date of their entry into the United States with a status meeting the definition of ""qualified alien,"" which includes lawful permanent residents. The law did outline several exemptions and said certain groups were not subject to the five-year restriction, including refugees and asylees, military veterans and active-duty military members, along with their spouses and unmarried dependent children. The americatb.com post accurately cited remarks Trump made in an August 2017 weekly address: ""Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country."" Trump’s weekly address alluded to the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga. Their bill does include a provision to prevent immigrants admitted under their proposed skills-based points system from receiving federal means-tested public benefits for five years. But as fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org have noted, while the RAISE Act tightens eligibility requirements, many would still remain eligible. The RAISE Act’s provision also only applies to those admitted under the skills-based system, which as Cotton has said, currently represents a small fraction of immigrants legally admitted per year. (The RAISE Act also seeks to limit family-based immigration.) Americatb.com’s post mixes in opinions and hypotheticals (""Let’s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year.

Wolf's half-truth on the subject of shale taxes
","Almost four years after taking office and in the midst of his first re-election bid, Gov. Tom Wolf continues to push for a severance tax on natural gas extraction in Pennsylvania, arguing that drillers haven’t paid their fair share while raking in huge sums of cash from the Marcellus Shale boom. It’s a theme that carried over from his first campaign and through his first years in office, and it’s present in his latest round of campaign advertising. In a campaign video released March 23 titled ""Here they come,"" Wolf says oil and gas lobbyists — the ""they"" in this scenario — ""spent $60 million to block a tax on oil and gas extraction..."" in Pennsylvania. (The $60 million figure is based on campaign finance data for the seven year period between 2010 and 2017, but MarcellusMoney.org says this total includes lobbying against other regulations and clean energy incentives, not just a severance tax.)  The ad includes an animated clip showing black limousines labeled ""LOBBYI$T"" pulling up to the Capitol where bank bags of cash are tossed atop the steps. In the same breath, Wolf says this lobbying blitz has left Pennsylvania ""the only state in the country not to tax drillers."" Is that true? A tax by any other name While Pennsylvania remains the largest natural gas-producing state without a severance tax, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, it is not the ""only state"" without one. A handful of states with relatively low levels of natural gas production or no natural gas production, like Iowa, lack such a measure. Pennsylvania shale drillers argue that even without a severance tax here, they’re far from being free of levies. In 2012, Wolf’s predecessor, Gov. Tom Corbett, signed into law an updated version of Pennsylvania’s Oil and Gas Act. It included the imposition of a so-called impact fee assessed on new wells, with the resulting revenue distributed to local and state governments to help municipalities ""offset impacts associated with natural gas drilling."" In June 2017, the Pennsylvania Utility Commission said it had collected and distributed ""more than $1.2 billion in impact fees to communities across Pennsylvania"" over six years. Reached by email, Erica Wright, vice president of communications and membership with the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade association and lobbying group, pointed back to a previously released statement. It reads, in part, ""since 2012, Pennsylvania’s natural gas impact tax has generated $1.5 billion (and counting) in new revenue. These revenues, which total approximately $200 million annually, directly support communities in every county, as well as key statewide environmental and conservation programs."" Groups like Marcellus Shale Coalition argue of the impact fee that if it looks like a tax and acts like a tax, it’s a tax. (Wright’s use of the phrase ""impact tax"" in referring to the state’s impact fee is no coincidence. It’s also reflective of the industry’s overall position on this subject.) The Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association, another industry advocate, also argues that gas drillers pay ""the same taxes as other businesses, PLUS the impact ‘fee’ that NO OTHER businesses pay."" Asked if the Wolf campaign video overlooked these taxes or the impact fee in calling Pennsylvania ""the only state in the country not to tax drillers,"" Wolf campaign spokesman Jeff Sheridan said the line is ""clearly"" a reference to the lack of a severance tax here. (The words ""severance tax"" do not appear in the ad.) He then went on to disagree with those who say the impact fee is a practical equivalent to a severance tax. The point of the ad, Sheridan added by email, is that ""Governor Wolf has taken on lobbyists and special interests to fight for a commonsense severance tax to stop letting oil and gas companies off the hook so they pay their fair share in Pennsylvania."" Sheridan continued, ""It’s long past time — Pennsylvania is the only major gas producing state that does not impose a severance tax on oil and gas. States like Texas, West Virginia, and Oklahoma all charge a severance tax, and their natural gas industries continue to thrive."" What’s the difference?  For starters, the verbiage — one is a ""fee"" and one is a ""tax."" Generally speaking, taxes are meant to raise money that can be used to defray the general costs of government — Wolf has said he wants a severance tax to help fund public education, for example  — while a fee is typically meant to pay for the costs of a specific government program or service. But beyond that, the applications of the impact fee and severance tax differ as well. According to StateImpact.org: ""Impact fees are levied on a per-well basis, so each time drillers punch a hole in the ground, they pay. A ‘severance tax’ is applied when resources are severed from the earth, so it would be a tax on the amount of gas produced."" The Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania said in a 2015 report that the yield for the state would be larger with a severance tax, adding, ""were the severance tax in place for the most recent year, extraction companies would have paid an effective tax rate more than three times the rate they were charged under the impact fee."" In February 2015, Wolf said he expected the severance tax to create $1 billion in new revenue for Pennsylvania, Philly.com reported at the time. That projection has fallen in the years since, alongside a slowdown in natural gas production. Actual impact fee collections have fallen for the same reason. But is the impact fee actually a tax? In September, the Pennsylvania State House Energy and Environmental Resources Committee approved an amendment rebranding the existing ""impact fee"" as a ""severance tax."" Critics called it an act of ""legislative deception"" and an exercise in semantics. Supporters called it an overdue clarification. The conservative Commonwealth Foundation, meanwhile, added that because impact fee revenue was restricted to certain uses under Act 13, and because the fee is a flat rate per unconventional well, these limits make the proposal ""truly a fee, rather than a tax in disguise."" Our ruling  Wolf is accurate in saying Pennsylvania does not have a severance tax on drilling. He's also accurate in saying lobbyists are a large part of the reason for that. He's wrong in implying those same lobbyists spent $60 million in direct opposition to severance tax proposals. He's wrong about Pennsylvania being the only state without a severance tax, though it's the only ""major gas-producing state"" without one. It's also misleading to imply that nothing has been done to tap drilling activity for municipal or state gain in Pennsylvania. The result of all this is a lack of context being passed on to viewers and voters.

A ridiculous attack on Ron DeSantis about food stamps and immigrants
","Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who has received support from President Donald Trump in his bid for Florida governor, favors giving a benefit to immigrants in the country illegally, says an article on Facebook. ""DeSantis voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants,"" stated a March 23 headline on Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, a website that says it is a ""community founded by United States Marine Veterans to bring awareness of the lame stream media."" The article drew from the Central Florida Post, a right-leaning website. The Uncle Sam story said that DeSantis’ vote on the 2014 farm bill ""ultimately puts illegal aliens and criminals ahead of law-abiding American citizens in line for food stamps — a judgment President Trump would surely question."" (While Trump has said the ""time has come"" to restrict federal assistance to immigrants, that already exists.) We found that the Uncle Sam article omitted key context that immigrants in the country illegally were already banned from getting food stamps long before the 2014 farm bill, a sweeping package that only briefly mentions verifying immigration status. The article also ignored an explanation by DeSantis about why he voted against the farm bill. DeSantis is running in the August primary against a field that includes Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. A farm bill is passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food stamps, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Uncle Sam story points to an article about DeSantis’ 2014 vote as one of 63 Republicans to join 103 Democrats voting against HR 2642, the farm bill. The legislation, which passed the House 251-166 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama, had drawn opposition from both sides: Some liberals said the cuts were too steep while some conservatives said it didn’t do enough to cut spending. While the legislation was hundreds of pages, only a few sentences related to illegal immigrants. Section 4015 stated ""a state agency shall be required to use an immigration status verification system."" That provision drew scant media attention. Some news stories mentioned in a single sentence that the farm bill banned illegal immigrants, college students, lottery winners and dead people from getting food stamps. Another reason the immigration section may not have been a key part of the debate? Federal law already generally banned immigrants in the country illegally from getting food stamps. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 restricted access for immigrants to get food stamps. But subsequent legislation restored access for certain immigrants, including refugees and lawful permanent residents with a proven work history. While the 2014 farm bill required states to use an immigration status verification system, most states already had procedures in place to meet that requirement. Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, which advocates on behalf of low-income people, said the farm bill didn’t change immigrant eligibility rules for food and nutrition assistance. ""Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens,"" he said. The section on immigration wasn’t the motivation behind DeSantis’ vote against the farm bill. He voted against the bill because of the high costs. He believed that the bill failed to overhaul a food stamp program that was growing too large, said campaign spokesman Brad Herold. In a 2014 Facebook post, DeSantis said the farm bill was a ""bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms,"" such as work requirements. Herold said DeSantis does not believe in granting any form of benefits to immigrants in the country illegally. He has voted in favor of amendments related to work requirements for food stamps. But the 2014 farm bill didn’t alter the pre-existing policy that illegal benefits are not eligible for SNAP benefits. ""Voting against a bill that expanded farm subsidies and failed to enact welfare reforms is not a vote to confer benefits on illegal immigrants,"" Herold said. Jacob Engels, publisher of the Central Florida Post and author of the article inked from the Uncle Sam website, directed PolitiFact to an article by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that advocates for low levels of immigration. The story was more nuanced, saying that a family that has some citizens and some immigrants in the country illegally could still get some benefits. Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children said that DeSantis ""voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants."" The article fails to point out that even before the farm bill passed, undocumented immigrants were already generally blocked from getting food stamps. The farm bill that DeSantis voted against was a sweeping piece of legislation that mentions immigrants only briefly in the context of requiring states to verify their status. DeSantis stated at the time of his vote against the bill that he thought it was a bad deal for taxpayers and failed to rein in the food stamp program. By voting ""no"" he took a stand against the overall piece of legislation — that’s not evidence that he ""voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants.""

NC Republican: March for Our Lives speakers said they want to murder gun owners
","Maddie King, who survived a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida that left 17 people dead, called on politicians to care more about their children than their guns. David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas student and frequent whipping boy of gun rights advocates, said politicians should get their resumes ready. Another Stoneman Douglas student, Cameron Kasky, warned politicians who oppose stricter gun laws. ""Either represent the people or get out. Stand for us or beware: The voters are coming,"" Kasky said. Thousands of Americans gathered in streets around the United States on March 24 to honor victims of gun violence and, generally speaking, to advocate for stricter gun laws. According to a North Carolina legislator, some March For Our Lives speakers also called for a far more nefarious approach. State Rep. Beverly Boswell, a Republican from the coast, suggested on her Facebook page that speakers at the marches expressed violent intentions. ""Many of the speakers at these rallies were calling for gun registration, confiscation, Second Amendment repeal and even the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government,"" Boswell wrote on her campaign Facebook page. Murder? That seems harsh. Boswell, who’s in her first term representing House DIstrict 6, has been an open critic of efforts to toughen gun laws. She recently referred to students who participated in the national school walkout as ""Tide pod"" eaters and boasted on Facebook about confronting a school leader who held an assembly on that day — which he says was simply to honor the victims of Parkland shooting. She was also recently scolded by the North Carolina Board of Nursing for misrepresenting herself as a nurse. Boswell’s comments about March For Our Lives were part of a side conversation on her Facebook page after she posted a photo of some students with the caption, ""They’re out to take your guns, and our freedoms,"" at 8:10 p.m. on March 26. On March 27, she posted the comments about the march speakers after someone suggested Boswell’s original post was a ""scare tactic"" meant to distract people from the message of the march. What the ‘march’ wants The March For Our Lives website doesn’t say anything about forcefully taking guns from gun owners, much less harming them. The organization says it wants universal, comprehensive background checks and a digitized, searchable database of guns at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (known as ATF). It also wants bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence. March For Our Lives has the support of several large, liberal organizing groups that support gun control. And a survey of the Washington marchers found that protesters there were largely liberal, with 79 percent of those who were randomly surveyed identifying as ""left-leaning."" But the group doesn’t appear to have ties to groups with a history of advocating violence. PolitiFact recently debunked a claim by the National Rifle Association that the March For Our Lives is ""backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions."" A story by Variety.com captured some of the marchers’ public disdain for the NRA, but none of the views expressed included calls for violence. ""A video during the [Washington] event showed NRA officials, like Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch, as well as [the late actor] Charlton Heston, then the president of the organization, saying, ‘From my cold dead hands.’ In the crowd the images drew boos and the bird,"" Variety reported. In New York City, ""Marchers chanted ‘NRA sashay away,’ at the New York rally, holding posters decrying the involvement of the National Rifle Association in government,"" Variety reported. PolitiFact emailed Boswell and asked if she could provide videos or news clips showing march speakers advocating violence. Luke Stancil, her campaign spokesman, responded by referencing a candidate for sheriff in North Carolina who joked about taking people's guns.  Daryl Fisher, a candidate running for sheriff of Buncombe County in western NC, explained his views of people who invite him to pry their gun from their cold, bare hands. Stancil pointed out that Fisher shrugged said, ""OK ... Whenever you pass away, we'll come get it."" Fisher indeed said those things. But he didn't say them at a March For Our Lives rally. He later apologized. And Boswell said ""many"" speakers called for the murder of gun owners – and didn't cite any others.  So we searched for evidence of violent rhetoric ourselves. What speakers said Alex Jones, a conservative conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com, said on his show that marchers declared they would ""kill anyone"" who doesn’t turn in their guns. But PolitiFact found no credible evidence of rally speakers calling for violence against gun owners who might refuse to relinquish their guns. Most speakers at the Washington march and other marches across the country spoke about stricter gun laws and warned politicians of forthcoming punishment at the ballot box. Some of those comments, if taken out of context, could be misconstrued as threats. Delaney Tarr, a frequently-interviewed Stoneman Douglas student, said the Washington marchers are ""are here to call out every single politician. We will take action where it counts."" Those comments were preceded by a specific list of legislative demands that included an assault weapons ban, the ""prohibition of high capacity magazines, reinforcement of background checks and closing of loopholes."" In that vein, she said: ""When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile."" Alex Wind, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, used the words ""life"" and ""death"" to describe where politicians stand on gun restrictions. ""To all the politicians out there, if you take money from the NRA, you have chosen death,"" Wind said. ""If you have not expressed to your constituents a public stance on this issue, you have chosen death. If you do not stand with us by saying we need to pass common sense gun legislation, you have chosen death. And none of the millions of people marching in this country today will stop until they see those against us out of office, because we choose life."" D’Angelo McDade, a student from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago and members of the student non-violence group the Peace Warriors, specifically called for non-violent action. ""When will we as a nation understand that we are not here to fight against one another and we are here to fight for life and peace?"" McDade said. ""Dr. King once said, ‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.’ Which now leads me to say that violence cannot drive out violence, only peace can do that."" Speakers at marches in Boswell’s home state of North Carolina were similar. Speakers in Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville reportedly focused on gun laws and the NRA. Our ruling Boswell said ""many speakers"" at the March for Our Lives rallies were calling for ""the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government."" She didn’t provide any evidence to back up her claim, and PolitiFact found no evidence.

Internet hoax claims that investigators working for Trey Gowdy were found dead
","A new Internet hoax claims that two officials who were working for Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., on a criminal investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went missing and were later found dead. ""Trey Gowdy breaks his silence after 2 of his investigators are found tortured and killed,"" read the headline on the blog WhatHappensintheUSA.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article falsely claims that two officials were reportedly on their way to deliver a search warrant on the Clinton Presidential Library when they were tortured and killed, with no evidence left behind. If such a crime were true, it would be picked up by legitimate journalists. But there is no evidence of anything like that happening in Little Rock, Ark., where the presidential library dedicated to former president Bill Clinton is located. Gowdy, who previously announced his plan to retire earlier this year, was the former chairman of the House select committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic properties in Benghazi, Libya, and Hillary Clinton’s response to the attacks as secretary of state. The final Benghazi report was issued in 2016, and found no personal culpability on Clinton’s behalf. The fake news article also said that Gowdy had no comment about the made-up incident for safety reasons. The story also reported a phony statement by Gowdy about a ""vast conspiracy."" When searching these statements, we found no credible reports that Gowdy has made any similar claims. We ran this conspiracy by Gowdy's office, and they confirmed it was inaccurate.

Gun owners would not have to give up their guns under 'assault weapons' ban
","The president of the state group affiliated with the National Rifle Association says a bill in Congress would ban all semi-automatic firearms and lead to the government seizing guns from gun owners. Tom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, appeared on The Capitol Pressroom to voice his group’s opposition to stronger gun control laws. ""The title of the bill is ‘something assault weapons ban,’ "" King said in the interview. ""And, when you read into it, the legislation will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns."" The group also wants to repeal the 2013 New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, the state’s gun law passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. Democrats have proposed some parts of the SAFE Act for the congressional bill, like universal background checks for gun purchases and a ban on certain accessories. But is King right that the bill would ban semi-automatic weapons altogether and lead to gun seizures? The bill Opponents of gun control have long chafed at the term ""assault weapon"" because it does not have a universal definition. The SAFE Act, for example, defines an assault weapon differently than the federal law that banned assault weapons in 1994. The federal ban expired in 2004, and many Democrats have tried to revive it ever since. King did not respond to our inquiry about his claim. In the Capitol Pressroom interview, he mentioned House Resolution 5057 as the bill he was referring to. But that bill has nothing to do with guns. It seems he mixed up his bill numbers. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, leads the latest gun-control effort as sponsor of House Resolution 5087, titled the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018. A Cicilline spokesperson said his office is not aware of any other current bills relating to an assault weapons ban. PolitiFact New York could not find any others in our search of House and Senate websites.  Cicilline's bill would ban the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with certain military-style features: • Rifles that can accept a detachable magazine would be banned from having a pistol grip, a forward grip, a threaded barrel, a barrel shroud, a grenade or rocket launcher, or a folding, telescoping, or detachable stock. • Pistols would not be allowed to have a fixed magazine with more than 10 rounds. They would also be banned from having a threaded barrel, a second pistol grip, a barrel shroud, and the ability to load a magazine at some location other than the grip. • Shotguns would be banned from having a detachable magazine and a fixed magazine would not be allowed to have more than five rounds. The same features banned for pistols and rifles would also be banned on shotguns. Semi-automatic weapons sold without any of those features would still be legal to own and sell. The gun would become illegal if the owner decided to add any of those features. Those who legally bought a gun with those features before the ban would not have to give them up. Those weapons would be grandfathered in, but a background check would be required if the owner sells it to someone else. They would also have to be locked up when not being used. The bill would also ban any magazine with more than 10 rounds. Six states already have a similar ban. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, introduced an almost identical bill in 2017. Neither has support from Republicans, who hold the majority in both chambers of Congress. Our ruling King said a bill in Congress ""will ban all semi-automatic weapons, including pistols and shotguns. So, yes, they are coming to take away our guns."" That’s not true. The latest bill to ban ""assault weapons"" would block the sale of new semi-automatic firearms with one or more military-style features. Guns that already have those features would be grandfathered in. Gun owners would not be required to give up any of their guns as long as they were legally purchased before the ban.
