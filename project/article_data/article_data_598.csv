State Rep. Carol Alvarado says women who are eight to 10 weeks pregnant and need a sonogram require a transvaginal one
","
In a Texas House debate March 2, Democratic state Rep. Carol Alvarado of Houston pressed the author of a proposal requiring women seeking an abortion to get a sonogram on whether he was aware that a sonogram is intrusive early in a woman’s pregnancy.

""There are two different kinds of sonograms,"" she said. ""The abdominal, which I think most of our colleagues may think ‘jelly on the belly’ that would be done there, but that’s not the case. A woman that is eight to 10 weeks pregnant would have to go (to get) a transvaginal sonogram.""

House Bill 15, which cleared the House March 7, requires women getting an abortion to first allow a medical professional to perform a sonogram, ""display the live, real-time obstetric sonogram images in a quality consistent with current medical practice in a manner that the pregnant women may view them"" and ""make audible the live, real-time"" heart beat.

The Senate approved a different version of the proposal in February.

We decided to check at what stage in their pregnancy women who need a sonogram would require the transvaginal kind.

Alvarado told us that she meant to say that women who are up to eight to 12 weeks pregnant need a transvaginal sonogram because the better-known abdominal ultrasound doesn’t always produce a clear enough image.

According to a medical encyclopedia on the University of Maryland Medical Center website, the transvaginal ultrasound looks at a woman’s reproductive organs by placing a probe into the vagina. The internal probe ""sends out sound waves, which reflect off body structures. A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture."" An abdominal ultrasound is performed externally, the site says. A water-based gel is spread over the woman’s pelvic area, which helps the probe transmit sound waves, generating an image.

Alvarado’s office referred us to seven physicians to support her statement. Six responded, all saying transvaginal sonograms are usually preferred in the early weeks of pregnancy. Comments ranged from calling Alvarado’s statement ""100 percent correct"" to describing the transvaginal sonogram as ""the best evaluation"" that early in pregnancy.

Other highlights:

— Lisa Hollier, one of Alvarado’s recommended doctors, chairs the Texas district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She told us that if a sonogram is needed up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy, a transvaginal is necessary to attain a clear image and pick up the heartbeat.  

Hollier, who opposes the sonogram proposals, said that at eight to 10 weeks’ of pregnancy, the heart is hard to visualize using an abdominal ultrasound, particularly on obese women.

— Matt Romberg, a Round Rock ob-gyn who also opposes the proposals, told us that he performs a sonogram to verify the location of the fetus, its viability and the stage of the pregnancy on women who are up to 10 weeks pregnant before performing the abortion. Ninety-nine percent of the time, he said, ""I have to do a transvaginal"" sonogram.

— G. Sealy Massingill, a Fort Worth ob-gyn, told us that ""at eight weeks or less, it’s almost impossible to see anything"" without using a transvaginal sonogram.

For other perspectives, we contacted the Washington-based Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, which seeks to improve reproductive health care through education.

Beth Jordan, the association’s medical director, told us that in the early weeks of pregnancy, fetuses are easier to see on vaginal ultrasounds, though she said ""there are cases when it’s difficult to (perform) a vaginal ultrasound and we have to use the abdominal devices.""

According to current clinical management guidelines produced by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a sonogram in the first trimester may be performed using either an abdominal ultrasound or a transvaginal one. If the abdominal examination ""is not definitive, a transvaginal scan or transperineal scan should be performed whenever possible."" For a transperineal scan, the external probe is placed between the vulva and the rectum.

Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, told us it’s ""possible to do an abdominal ultrasound early in pregnancy, but based on a woman’s weight, the position of the uterus, the size of the pregnancy, a transvaginal ultrasound can be more accurate."" The federation opposes the Texas sonogram proposals, which Saporta said ""put another obstacle in the way of women receiving abortion care.""

Eugene Toy, president of the Texas Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told us that the medical standard of care for a patient seeking an abortion is to have a sonogram that allows the doctor to determine the stage of the pregnancy and identify problems. At less than eight weeks, ""a vaginal probe would be necessary almost all the time,"" he said, though from the eighth to 10th week, it’s necessary one-third of the time.

Kyleen Wright, president of Texans for Life, pointed us to Ralph Wiegman, a Grand Prairie ob-gyn who supports the sonogram legislation. Wiegman told us that the only time a transvaginal sonogram is needed is less than seven weeks into the pregnancy, or if the woman is obese. ""At our pregnancy resource center, a vaginal ultrasound is reserved for those cases when you can’t get a good picture abdominal, or very early in the gestation,"" he said.

Where does that leave us?

Given that lawmakers were weighing whether to mandate sonograms in advance of abortions, we find reasonable Alvarado’s post-debate clarification that she intended to characterize sonograms through the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and not just a two-week segment. Most of the experts we reached agreed that to produce a clear image, a transvaginal sonogram is best, if not the only choice, up to about the seventh week of pregnancy.

But between seven and 10 weeks, another type of sonogram may produce a viewable image, according to some doctors. We rate Alvarado’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/10/carol-alvarado/state-rep-carol-alvarado-says-women-who-are-10-wee/

Advocacy group says 25 percent of Rhode Islanders have criminal record
","
It’s hard enough getting a job these days. Imagine how hard it would be if you have a criminal record.

Most job applications have a box to check off if you’ve been convicted of a crime. That alone is enough to turn off many employers.

Several lawmakers have introduced bills in the Rhode Island General Assembly to improve convicted criminals’ chances of obtaining jobs. The sponsors, working with Direct Action for Rights & Equality, a Providence nonprofit group that advocates for low-income families and minorities, want to prohibit employers from asking whether a job applicant had a conviction until the employer decides the applicant is qualified for the job.

The legislation, patterned after laws in other states, is called the ""ban the box"" bill.

Supporters, who held a rally Tuesday at the State House, argue that if employers would hold off questions on criminal background at least until the applicants are interviewed, they would have a better chance of getting hired.

In an online petition seeking support for ""ban the box"" legislation, DARE (not to be confused with a national anti-drug campaign with the same acronym) argues that roughly 25 percent of Rhode Islanders have a criminal record and could benefit from the new law.

We don’t question that helping people with criminal records find jobs is a worthwhile goal. But we wondered whether it could be possible that 1 out of 4 Rhode Islanders actually has a record.

We asked Jordan Seaberry, organizer of DARE’s Behind the Walls Committee, where the statistic came from. He acknowledged that his group had trouble finding any local source for figures specific to Rhode Island.

As a result, he said his group relied on outside sources. Specifically, he cited Laura Moskowitz, a member of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for those with arrest and conviction records.

She testified in November 2008 before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that there has been an exponential growth in the number of people having contact with the criminal justice system, and in the number of employers conducting criminal background checks, especially since 9/11.

Moskowitz testified that 1 out of 5 adults in the United States ""now has a criminal record that will show up on a routine employment background check.""

She attributed that figure to a chapter in a book called ""The Gloves-Off Economy: Workplace Standards at the Bottom of America’s Labor Market."" The chapter was written by Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of Moskowitz’s group, and Debbie A. Mukama, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

In the book, the authors said they got their numbers from a survey of state criminal history record systems published in 2006 by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. That report was based on a 2003 survey that found more than 71 million subjects on file in state systems.

The authors wrote that they reduced that total by 30 percent to account for individuals listed in multiple states, and came up with a  total of 49.7 million, or 23.8 percent of the 209 million Americans over the age of 18, as reported in the 2000 Census.

The authors rounded down to 1 in 5; the Rhode Island advocates rounded up to 1 in 4.

Either figure is ridiculous, according to Michael T. Brady, an associate professor in the criminal justice program at Salve Regina University.

""I feel that is incredibly high,"" Brady said. Rhode Island’s criminal record system includes not only the names of Rhode Island criminals, but those of students and others from out of state, and even people charged with motor vehicle offenses. And it has many people listed in the data base multiple times for separate crimes.

The people who run Rhode Island’s Bureau of Criminal Identification agree. Chief William Devine and Deputy Chief Robert Chin said the system is not designed to show how many people have criminal records at any given time; it is designed to show whether any individual has had contact with law enforcement.

Every arrest is entered. Some people are arrested many times, and each case is entered separately. And they stay in the system. Misdemeanor charges remain for 5 years, felonies remain for 10 years.

So when the Justice Department surveyed states in 2006 for their 2003 records, the total number of cases in Rhode Island was shown as 229,000. But Devine, who was in charge of the BCI then, said he is sure that figure does not represent the total number of individuals with records; it represents arrests that have accumulated over years.

To illustrate his point, Devine noted that the state has about 1 million fingerprints on file. (Department of Justice figures corroborated Devine’s assertion; the agency reported at the end of 2008 that Rhode Island had 955,800 for the ""Number of subjects (individual offenders) in state criminal history file."")

But that definitely does not mean that nearly everyone in this state of 1 million people has a criminal record.

Chief Devine and his staff estimate the true percentage might be 4 or 5 percent. They can’t be sure of the exact percentage because of the way the data is collected, but they’re certain it’s nowhere near 25 percent.

DARE’s statement is based on old, flawed statistics that were tweaked and re-tweaked to make a point. The idea that 1 of every 4 Rhode Islanders is a criminal is ridiculous on its face.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rod Smith']","
Democratic Party chairman Rod Smith says Rick Scott's budget would result in layoffs for 20,000 teachers
","
In his first State of the State address, Florida Gov. Rick Scott boldly told legislators that he has created the ""most fiscally conservative state budget in the country.""

""Our jobs budget is targeted to create private-sector jobs, increase accountability and reduce the size of government,"" Scott told a joint session of the Legislature on March 8, 2011.

Moments after Scott finished his 27-minute address, Florida Democratic Party Chairman Rod Smith offered a dramatically different interpretation of Scott's spending plan.

""Since he took office, Floridians have seen that Rick Scott only cares about imposing his rigid and extreme philosophy on our state, rather than working to implement common-sense solutions for Florida,"" Smith said in a statement. ""Whether he is killing high-speed rail, proposing his spending plan that would lay off 20,000 teachers, or putting communities at risk by ending critical law enforcement tools to stop pill-mills, Rick Scott's agenda is doing real harm to our state.""

The thing that jumped out at us in Smith's claim is that Scott's budget ""would lay off 20,000 teachers"" -- a huge amount. We'll explain how huge in a minute.

Budget cuts don't spare education

To balance the state budget as required in the Constitution, lawmakers must trim at least $3.62 billion from this year's $70.5 billion budget. Scott's proposal goes further -- reducing the budget by $4.6 billion to $65.9 billion.

PreK-12 education funding is hardly spared as part of Scott's proposed cuts.

Scott's budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state PreK-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of about $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and federal dollars passed through the state.

The cuts break down this way (we're rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly):

• The state's contribution would remain the same at about $8.9 billion.

• Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion.

• And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds.

In total, Scott's budget proposals would reduce the amount of per-student funding by 10.19 percent, from about $6,900 per student to nearly $6,200 per student. (Some of that reduction could be offset for one year, Scott says, by requiring teachers to pay 5 percent of their salary toward their retirement and by using temporary federal funds given to school districts in 2010.)

Scott budget chief Jerry McDaniel has told lawmakers that the proposed budget would result in some teacher layoffs, though he did not offer a hard estimate. The budget document itself -- while cutting funding -- also does not explicitly say school districts should lay off 20,000 teachers.

So we turned to Smith's spokesman, Eric Jotkoff, to understand where the figure came from.

Basis of Smith's 20,000 teacher-layoff claim

Jotkoff said the figure originated from an article that appeared in the Gainesville Sun on Feb. 21, 2011, aptly titled ""Worst-case scenario for education is 20,000 layoffs in Florida.""

The article itself doesn't cite the origin of the 20,000-teacher layoff number; rather, it details Scott's proposed cuts, including a nearly 10 percent reduction in per-pupil education spending.

""While promising to create a world-class education system, Gov. Rick Scott has simultaneously proposed the deepest cuts for Florida public schools by any governor in recent history,"" the article states. ""In a worst-case scenario, they would lead to more than 20,000 layoffs of teachers and other personnel in the state's 67 school districts.""

The article does acknowledge that Scott's complementary proposal to make teachers contribute to their retirement could free up local school district dollars to offset some of the proposed education funding cuts.

Jotkoff referenced numbers presented in the article to help make his case.

• $1.75 billion -- the total of PreK-12 education funding cuts (we say $1.7 billion because of the way we rounded the numbers).

• 80 percent -- the percentage of education funds that the article says goes to personnel costs (we're not stating that number as fact and the Sun article didn't cite a source).

• $46,708 -- the average salary of a Florida teacher (a figure generated by the National Education Association).

Jotkoff said that if 80 percent of education spending is for personnel costs, that represents $1.4 billion of the overall proposed cuts. Divide those cuts by the average salary of a teacher and that equates to the salaries of 29,973 teachers -- even more than cited in the Sun article.

We found two issues with that calculation, however. First, the salary figure does not include teacher benefits. Second, while Education Week has reported that about 80 percent of school districts' budgets are personnel costs, that is a broad estimate that could vary depending on the school district, and also includes school district employees who are not teachers.

On top of that, there's a much simpler way to measure the impact of Scott's proposed cuts on teachers.

The Florida Department of Education said that at the start of the 2010 school year, school districts employed 169,540 teachers and 22,924 additional workers classified as instructional staff, a group that includes guidance counselors, school social workers, librarians.

That's 192,464 people classified as ""instructional staff.""

Using that number, Scott's 10.19 percent per-pupil funding cut would be the equivalent cut of 19,612 teachers and instructional staff. That's pretty close to the 20,000 teachers Smith is claiming would be fired under Scott's budget.

But you need to read the fine print.

More than just the numbers

As we've already said, Scott's budget cuts funding, not teachers. Specific cuts would be left to individual school districts.

But there are also two impediments to the large-scale teacher cuts Smith is warning of. The first is rooted in the state Constitution. In November 2002, Florida's voters approved an amendment to the Constitution that sets limits for the maximum number of students in a classroom starting with the 2010-11 school year. The Legislature tried to loosen the restriction through a second constitutional amendment in 2010, but the amendment failed to receive the needed 60 percent of voter approval.

Since 2003, the state has spent about $16 billion to implement the amendment, mainly by hiring some 30,000 additional teachers. It would be virtually impossible to cut 20,000 teacher jobs and still comply with the constitutional mandate.

Second, Scott proposes making school district employees contribute 5 percent of their salary toward their retirement. He says employee contributions would free up local school district funding to brace against some of the other education cuts. If that proposal were to pass, school districts would effectively see a per-pupil funding cut of about $505, Scott says, a 7.36 percent reduction. That would be the equivalent of 14,165 teachers and instructional staff.

But again, that doesn't mean that will be how many get laid off if Scott's education plan passes.

Our ruling

In offering a counter to Scott's budget message of fiscal restraint, Smith says Scott wants to recklessly lay off 20,000 teachers.

Scott is proposing major cuts to education funding. And even Scott's budget chief acknowledges layoffs will occur.

But trying to estimate a number is tricky. Yes, you can divide the number of teachers and instructional staff by proposed per-pupil cuts to reach a figure, but that ignores the Florida Constitution, which requires small class sizes, and local school district decisions, in how they will spend their money. Also, Scott's proposal to make school district employees contribute to their retirement could dilute some of the cuts being pushed by Scott.

That said, Scott's budget plan would strip a significant chunk of funding out of school districts, equivalent to the amount of around 20,000 teachers. Balancing it all, we rate Smith's claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2011/mar/09/rod-smith/democratic-party-chairman-rod-smith-says-rick-scot/

John McCain errs in saying iPads, iPhones are made in the USA
","
On the March 6, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the host asked Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., about the report she had just aired about American competitiveness.

""Well, I think it's obviously a recognition of the reality and the trends, that cheaper, lower-cost labor products will usually prevail over the products made in higher wage and income countries,"" McCain said. ""But I would also point out that, if you'd emptied (a house shown in the earlier segment) -- if you'd left a computer there or an iPad or an iPhone, those are built in the United States of America. And as the president said, continuously, and I agree with him, innovation is the key to us being able to restore our economy.""

Critics immediately jumped on McCain’s statement that the devices ""are built in the United States of America.""

The answer is inscribed on the back of every iPhone: ""Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.""

When we contacted McCain’s office, spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan confirmed that the senator had been in error and had corrected himself in interviews later on Sunday.

""Sen. McCain is aware the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products were designed in the United States but manufactured elsewhere,"" said Buchanan.

In fact, one of Apple’s key manufacturing contractors in China, Foxconn, has attracted attention over the years for allegations of worker abuse. (Apple did not respond to an inquiry for this story.)

NRSC raps Sen. Sherrod Brown for admitting that 'stimulus law failed' and flip-flopping on tax cuts
","
Republicans don't yet have a declared candidate to challenge incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown in 2012, but that hasn't stopped them from opening the campaign.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), which assists election efforts, made that clear by issuing a series of news releases after Brown spoke at a January luncheon of the Akron Roundtable.

One release, citing coverage in the Akron Beacon Journal, went after the senator ""in light of Brown’s admission that his $787 billion stimulus law failed, and his sudden election-cycle flip-flop to demand more tax cuts.""

""After specifically attacking Republicans for wanting to lower Americans' taxes, Brown now claims that his stimulus bill 'didn't do enough' to lower taxes,"" the NRSC’s Chris Bond said.

Listening to the talk and reading the Beacon Journal story, however, we did not hear the same ""admission."" Here is what the story said:

""Brown defended the federal government's fiscal actions during the Great Recession, saying it was necessary to borrow nearly $1.5 trillion to rescue and stimulate the economy and prevent a global collapse. The efforts also helped save major manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler, he said.

""The subsequent $787 billion Recovery Act that passed in early 2009 didn't do enough, particularly with tax cuts, to get people to spend more or build public confidence in the economy, he said.

""But the federal government's investments in domestic automakers helped tremendously, Brown said, with the economy now growing and adding jobs.

""If the government hadn't acted, the state would have been in much worse shape, Brown said.""

He did not say the stimulus failed. He said it was not large enough, which he has said consistently.

As for tax reductions, Brown said the tax cuts ""didn’t do what they should have. They weren’t large enough, as it turned out, to get people to spend more, they weren’t public enough to help it build public confidence in our economy.""

In explanation, Brown’s office cited a New York Times/CBS News Poll of September 2010, which found that fewer than one in 10 respondents knew that the stimulus had lowered taxes for most Americans, giving typical families an extra $65 a month.

Few people noticed the tax cut because, instead of getting rebate checks, taxpayers had less money withheld from their paychecks, Brown’s staff said. Increases in health-insurance deductions, increases in state taxes in 30 states and cutbacks in business also reduced take-home pay.

But what about the claim that Brown specifically attacked Republicans for wanting to lower Americans' taxes?

Brown was a vocal opponent of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers, which he said have failed to stimulate the economy. He did vote in favor of their extension last December, but said it was only because the bill extended tax reductions for the middle class and included billions of dollars in unemployment benefits.

So where does the NRSC land on the Truth-O-Meter?
  
That’s why we rate the statement as Half True.

Virginia lottery claims all profits since 1999 have gone to education
","
With the Mega Millions jackpot up to $151 million, Virginians will be flocking to stores this week to buy lottery tickets.

Of course, there’s no guarantee a Virginian will win. Forty-one states plus Washington, D.C. play the game and the chance of winning is almost 1 in 176 million for each dollar laid down. The Virginia Lottery encourages play by saying all of the profits it generates go to a good cause.

""Since 1999, all Virginia lottery profits have been used for public education in the Commonwealth, for kindergarten through 12th grade,"" its website boasts.

State politicians and officials have long debated whether all lottery profits really go to public schools. So we decided to take a look.

But before we get to the numbers, it’s helpful to consider a thumbnail history of the Virginia Lottery. Voters approved it in 1987 and the first tickets were sold in 1988.

During the first two years, lottery profits were set aside tor construction projects.  During the 1991 recession, the proceeds were moved to the state’s general fund which supports K-12 schools, health and public safety.

In 1995, the General Assembly was controlled by Democrats. Then-Gov. George Allen, a Republican, accused the Democrats of breaking long-standing promises to earmark every dollar of profits for education. Although news stories from the time say Allen did not provide proof of his claim, defensive lawmakers approved the Omnibus Education Act which required all lottery revenues sent to the general fund to be used only for public education.

Many Republicans and educators denounced the bill as an election-year sham. That was because the $312 million in annual lottery profits at the time was one of many revenue sources flowing into the multi-billion dollar general fund. No one could say with certainty whether proceeds would up in education or another service. Think of it this way: when raindrops fall into a reservoir, can anyone pinpoint whose bathtub they fill?

In 2000, the General Assembly asked voters to approve a state constitutional amendment that required lottery profits only be used for public education. The amendment was overwhelmingly approved. It established a Lottery Proceeds Fund to funnel lottery profits to education.

The controversy was hardly settled, however. The new coffer was made part of the general fund. Again, it was impossible to trace a direct flow of lottery profits into public schools. Although state  support for education increased over ensuing years, it’s impossible specify how much of the rise was caused by lottery profits and how much was caused by revenue surges from a variety of taxes that pour into the general fund.

Walt Kucharski, Virginia’s long-time Auditor of Public Accounts, says he has always been able to confirm that state lottery officials have transmitted their profits to the general fund. But until three years ago, he could not verify that 100 percent of the lottery proceeds ended up in the K-12 budget.

""Can I match it up dollar for dollar, serial number to serial number, the answer is no,"" Kucharski said.

That changed in 2008 when the General Assembly, heeding advice from then-Attorney General Bob McDonnell, separated the Lottery Proceeds Fund from the general fund. The action provided the direct pipeline that allowed Kucharski and others to trace the flow of lottery money into schools.

Kucharski has no hesitation saying that since 2008, every penny of lottery profits has gone to public education. The state budget now lists line items that detail the allocations of the proceeds to specific education programs. This fiscal year, the Lottery is expected to contribute $436 million to the state’s $5.5 billion education budget.

About two-thirds of the lottery money is earmarked for programs that help prepare four-year-olds from low income families to enter school, provide early reading intervention, provide breakfast for low-income students, and provide special education.

John Hagerty, a lottery spokesman, noted that its always been up to the General Assembly to decide how to spend lottery profits.

""The lottery makes the money and then hands it over to the state,"" Hagerty said.

Let’s Review:

The lottery says that since 1999, all of its profits have gone to support K-12 education.

The claim has problems. Prior to 2008, the money went into the state’s general fund -- now totaling about $16 billion a year -- which supports major services such as health and public safety in addition to public schools. It was impossible to trace individual lottery profits into any specific program. Audits show lottery officials correctly transmitted all their proceeds to the state, but make no representations about how the money was specifically allocated.

Since 2008, the state’s auditor of public accounts said that the profits go into their own separate fund and are distributed directly to localities for public education. The money is detailed in the state budget line items.

Just as lottery officials can’t prove their claim that all lottery profits since 1999 have gone to education, nor we can we disprove it. The Lottery would lay aside doubts if it simply said all of its profits go to schools and didn’t mention a start date.

We rate their claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2011/mar/09/virginia-lottery/virginia-lottery-claims-all-profits-1999-have-gone/

Bloggers claim Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s budget OKs disposing of unclaimed stray dogs to university research facilities
","
In critiques that zipped from blog to blog and bounced around on Facebook and Twitter, critics of Gov. Scott Walker are jumping on a dog-related change in the governor’s new two-year budget.

Walker’s budget plan for 2011-’13 amends a state statute (174.13) that allows dog pounds to sell -- for $1 -- unclaimed stray canines to public universities for ""scientific or educational purposes.""

What does it mean? 
Interpretations in the blogosphere ranged from the relatively tame (""Walker's budget okays disposing of unclaimed pound dogs to University research facilities"") to vicious (""Governor Scott Walker wants to kill puppies."") 
It wasn’t just random bloggers weighing in, and not all the reaction was so personal and so broad.  Wisconsin Dog Rescue, a network of shelters and rescue groups, said on its website that Walker’s budget was seeking to ""expand"" the number of institutions that could receive dogs from pounds.

""The public didn’t even know it could happen,"" Lori Fowler, owner of the Wisconsin Dog Rescue website, said of selling strays for research. ""People are concerned that if their dog went stray … conceivably under the law their dog could be sold.""

What’s the truth?

Would Walker’s budget legalize the practice -- or expand it -- as bloggers suggest?

First some background.

Seventeen states -- but not Wisconsin -- ban dog pounds or shelters from turning over stray dogs for research, according to John J. Pippin, a doctor who tracks state laws for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.

Thirty-one states allow shelters to decide (as in Wisconsin) or have no state law on this. Two states, including Minnesota, require shelters to give up strays on demand to research facilities. The data is from a widely cited July 2010 study by the American Humane Association, which advocates against ""pound seizure.""

As a practical matter, neither the University of Wisconsin System nor the Medical College of Wisconsin gets dogs from shelters anymore, officials with each institution told PolitiFact Wisconsin.

Shelters in Wisconsin for years have chosen not to provide dogs for research, according to the top officials at the Wisconsin Humane Society and the Milwaukee Area Domestic Animal Control Commission.

But both the UW System and the Medical College do obtain dogs for medical research -- from sources other than animal shelters.

The Medical College used 140 dogs in its cardiovascular research lab last year and is on track to use 50 this year. The dogs were purchased for $200 each from a vendor in rural Minnesota that cares for abandoned dogs, said college spokesman Richard Katschke.

UW used 237 dogs last year for studies on cardiovascular disease, bone and cartilage healing, genetic conditions and other issues, according to Eric Sandgren, director of  UW’s Research Animal Resources Center.

They are not strays -- they are ""purpose bred"" dogs, typically beagles, that are raised for research purposes, Sandgren said.  The dogs come from two companies in the Madison area.

Medical schools in the United States used to routinely use dogs for teaching purposes -- not just research -- but have discontinued that over the last couple decades, Pippin said.

What does all this have to do with Walker’s budget bill?

Let’s take a look.

According to the legislative history of the law, it’s not a creation of Walker -- it’s been on the books for at least 40 years. The law was changed in the 1970s to make releasing dogs a voluntary decision by the shelters.

The only change in the existing dog law proposed now is the insertion of ""University of Wisconsin-Madison"" in two sections.

Walker’s office said the change has no practical impact.

We reviewed the legislative history, and agree: Walker is making a technical amendment to the dog law, necessitated by his separate move to split UW-Madison off from the UW System.

The bottom line: To make that change, numerous state statutes in dozens -- maybe hundreds of places -- where the UW System is mentioned must be amended.

That is the only reason we could find why the statute is mentioned in the budget bill.

The Wisconsin Dog Rescue organization, which wants to repeal the statute, is urging people to call legislators to block the ""expansion"" of the list of institutions that have the option of buying dogs for research.

We asked Fowler of the dog rescue group how it could be an expansion, since UW-Madison already was a possible receiver of strays because it is part of the UW System -- which, of course, is already named in the statute.

Fowler said Walker could have left Madison out and reduced the opportunities for dogs to be sold. She also worried that if UW-Madison is somehow deemed a private facility because it is splitting off from the UW System, that could open the door for strays to be sold to private research operations.

She concedes, however, that Walker’s move would not actually add an additional university to the list as a practical matter.

So, let’s see if the original claim has any bite left in it.

To sum up, bloggers are saying Walker is responsible for inventing a dog pipeline from animal shelters to research labs where the dogs die for important medical research. A rescue group suggested his budget amendment would expand the pipeline.

But the provision predates Walker’s administration by decades, and by numerous accounts, it is not used because of decisions by shelters. The law, like dozens of others, is mentioned in the budget only for technical reasons, and the proposed amendment would have no practical effect.

'Birther' foe says Ga. bill gets Constitution wrong
","
My, how Georgia’s political winds shift. 

By last Wednesday, 93 state House members had signed on as co-sponsors to Rep. Mark Hatfield’s so-called ""birther"" bill, which would make presidential and vice presidential candidates prove their citizenship to make the state’s ballot. 

The next day, more than 20 had crossed their names off the list. Several more did by Friday afternoon. 

That same day, an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution by local attorney and anti-birther blogger Loren Collins took more wind from House Bill 401’s sails. 

The bill would require presidential candidates to sign an affidavit saying they have never held dual citizenship. This means the bill would create requirements for president that don’t exist in the U.S. Constitution, Collins wrote:  

""There is not and never has been any constitutional rule mandating that the president ‘has never held dual or multiple citizenship.’ This is pure birther fantasy, a nonexistent bit of pseudo law that an attorney such as Hatfield should know better than to promote.""

It sounds like the bill has a huge flaw. Is Collins’ claim true? 

""Birthers"" believe in the oft-discredited theory that President Barack Obama is not eligible for office because the Constitution says that a president must be a ""natural born citizen."" Obama was born in Hawaii, but many birthers think he was born in Kenya. 

Obama was born to an American mother and Kenyan father. He had Kenyan citizenship and lost it. Kenya’s constitution grants citizenship to the children of Kenyans at birth, but those who are also citizens of other countries lose it at age 23 unless they take certain steps. Obama never took them. 

We called Collins, author of the blog Barackryphal, who said he voted for Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr in 2008, not Obama. He cited the Constitution’s Article II: ""No Person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President.""

This language does not and should not exclude candidates who are or were dual citizens, Collins argued. Foreign law decided who qualifies for dual citizenship, and foreign law should not decide who is eligible to be U.S. president.  

We called Hatfield, who does not describe himself as a ""birther,"" but wants more proof that Obama is eligible to be president. 

Hatfield, a Waycross Republican, said the founders thought that presidents should be born in the United States, their parents should be citizens, and dual citizens should be barred to avoid foreign influence. That’s why the Constitution uses the term ""natural born citizen"" instead of ""citizen."" 

Under Hatfield’s definition, Obama couldn’t be president. 

Hatfield noted that in 2008, scholars debated whether Republican nominee for president Sen. John McCain was eligible because he was born in the Panama Canal Zone. His father, a Navy officer, was stationed there.   

We presented Hatfield’s argument to legal experts on U.S. citizenship. They agreed that Hatfield’s concept of ""natural born"" citizenship makes little, if any, legal sense. 
 
""If that [the bill] passes in Georgia’s Statehouse, it will be challenged and it will be struck down as unconstitutional. I am 100 percent confident,"" said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor. 

Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Hatfield’s bill contains a dual-citizenship ban that does not exist in the Constitution. 

""It’s trying to add an additional requirement to the eligibility for president,"" von Spakovsky said. 

The concept of ""natural born citizen"" is more complicated than it seems, scholars said. The founders did not clarify what the term meant, but experts have long interpreted it to refer to those who are U.S. citizens at birth. 

Scholars agree that the Constitution’s authors intended to block naturalized citizens, or those who became citizens after their birth, from becoming president. 

But the law has yet to be tested, Spiro noted. The Supreme Court has never ruled on the issue, and no candidate with dual citizenship or who was born outside the country has won the presidency.

That’s why scholars debated whether McCain was eligible for office. Since he was not born in a U.S. state, he may not have been a citizen at birth, some argued. But that debate was not about dual citizenship.  

Emory University professor Polly Price explained. The United States adopted the concept of ""natural born citizenship"" from the English, Price said. For nearly 180 years before the Constitution was drafted, people were natural born citizens of England if they were born on English soil. 

This understanding was widely accepted in the U.S. during the colonial period.  People born in a colony were considered citizens of that colony, Price said. 

""It may be that some of the founders intended to include only birth on U.S. soil as their understanding of ‘natural born citizen’, but it certainly would not have included that their parents also had to be U.S. citizens,"" Price said. 

Collins is right. HB 401 does create eligibility requirements that aren’t in the Constitution. We rule his claim True. ",/factchecks/2011/mar/09/loren-collins/birther-foe-says-ga-bill-gets-constitution-wrong/

 Gov. Rick Scott wants more control over state hurricane response
","
Florida’s CEO-turned-governor Rick Scott wants more control over the state’s response to emergencies, like hurricanes.

During his first State of the State address on March 8, 2011, Scott said he has asked the Division of Emergency Management to ""report directly to me.""

""If a hurricane comes our way -- I hope it doesn’t -- I will be personally and continuously engaged in solving problems,"" he said. ""Direct, clear lines of authority will expedite our efforts.""

This wasn’t the first time Scott announced his intention to move the division within the Executive Office of the Governor. That news arrived simultaneously with his appointment of Wal-Mart emergency management director Bryan Koon to the agency’s helm on Dec. 28, 2010, a week before Scott’s inauguration.

""If approved,"" Scott said in a press release, ""this move will create a direct reporting structure and enhance communication and cooperation across all federal, state and local entities involved in Florida’s disaster preparedness efforts and response. This transfer will help cut bureaucratic red tape during emergencies and ensure the director has full access and accountability to Florida’s CEO.""

Scott cited the proposal, which needs legislative approval, as an example of his mission to streamline the way state government operates. So we wanted to see just how many government hoops Scott's plan would eliminate.

The Division of Emergency Management was created in 1969 by the Florida Legislature to act as a liaison between federal and local bodies amid environmental and man-made disasters. The division currently is housed within the Department of Community Affairs -- an agency the governor already controls.

That, by itself, gives the governor broad leeway in handling personnel and policy decisions.

And the division itself, it turns out, already reports to the governor. 
Gov. Lawton Chiles came up with the idea after Hurricane Andrew came ashore in 1992 but the direct link between the governor's office and the division became permanent under Gov. Jeb Bush after the 2004 hurricanes when Bush sought legislation to put it into law. Craig Fugate, now director of FEMA, was head of the division at the time. 
Sen. Mike Fasano, R-Port Richey,  sponsored the bill in the Senate. Rep. Tom Anderson, R-Dunedin, was the House sponsor. The law was effective July 1, 2006, and created the Division of Emergency Management as an independent agency with its own budget and a director appointed by the governor.
 
Fugate said, in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times' Lucy Morgan on March 9, that the change was made so it was easier to coordinate the state’s emergency response in the face of a disaster. 
The division explained it this way as part of its 2009 annual report (the most recent report we could find online):

""Though the Division is administered through the Department of Community Affairs, Section 20.18 (2) (a) of the Florida Statutes states that the Division’s executive leadership reports directly to the Governor on all matters concerning the agency’s purview.""

We checked the statutes. They establish the division as a unit of DCA, note that the division is a separate budget entity not within DCA’s control, and require the governor to appoint the division director.

Scott’s budget proposal would formally transfer the Division of Emergency Management (and a budget of $238,593,605 plus 128 positions) from DCA to the Governor’s Office. That’s about the extent of the formal changes we could find. 
Scott took time during his first State of the State speech to say that he wants to have the Division of Emergency Management ""report directly to me."" By statute, it already does. All that seems to be changing is where the division is housed for budgeting purposes. He's really just redrawing lines on an org chart, and it's not as groundbreaking a change as it sounds.

Alan Grayson returns to MSNBC stage, criticizes Gov. Rick Scott's corporate tax cut plan
","
Minutes after Florida Gov. Rick Scott finished delivering his first State of the State address, a trio of Democrats took turns rebuffing the new governor on everything he just said.

Senate Minority Leader Nan Rich and House Minority Leader Ron Saunders came first in brief televised remarks, attacking Scott’s plans to cut education funding and make teachers, firefighters and police officers take de facto pay cuts in order to contribute to their own retirement.

They were, in many ways, a warm-up act for former Florida U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who used a national cable platform offered by MSNBC to excoriate Scott's plans. 
 
Grayson opened the interview on March 8, 2011, by answering a question about how Scott -- whose former hospital company Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 corporate felonies and paid $1.7 billion in fines -- could be elected governor in the first place. He said it was par for the course for Florida Republicans.

""The last head of the Republican Party of Florida was literally led away in chains and indicted,"" Grayson said, referring to deposed RPOF chairman Jim Greer.

Then Grayson cracked a joke, saying Scott once refused to answer questions during a deposition by invoking his 5th Amendment constitutional rights 75 times. ""That’s like pleading the 375th.""

Grayson closed the interview by criticizing Scott’s plan to cut and eventually eliminate the state’s 5.5 percent corporate income tax, suggesting education spending reductions are funding the corporate tax cut.

""He wants to eliminate the corporate income tax and cut corporate taxes in Florida by $1.5 billion,"" Grayson said. ""He wants to cut funding for the schools by $1.5 billion.

""He’s taking money out of children’s pockets dollar for dollar so he can stuff it in his own.""

We knew we’d find a fact check among all the one-liners. We wanted to see if Grayson’s shrewd ledger work is right: Does Scott’s budget reduce education funding by the same amount he would cut corporate taxes?

The numbers are fairly easy to find, it turns out.

Scott’s budget proposal for 2011-12 reduces the total amount of state K-12 education funding from $18.2 billion, to $16.5 billion -- a total cut of $1.7 billion. That number includes local property taxes the state mandates school boards collect (the required local effort), the state contribution from sales tax revenues and trust funds, and money passing through the state from the federal government.

The cuts break down this way (we’re rounding a bit, so everything might not add up exactly):

* The state’s contribution would decrease by about $11 million, but remain largely the same, about $8.9 billion.

* Required local education taxes would shrink by about $660 million, and discretionary local taxes would shrink an additional $200 million -- shrinking the local contribution from about $8.4 billion to nearly $7.5 billion.

* And the state also would not replace about $873 million in federal stimulus funds.

On the other side of the ledger is Scott’s proposed cut to the 5.5 percent corporate income tax. The tax is exactly what it sounds like -- it’s paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Florida already has one of the lower corporate tax rates in the country, but Scott has made eliminating the tax a priority.

As part of his 2011-12 budget, Scott proposes reducing the tax rate to 3 percent. His office says the reduction will save corporations $460 million. Put another way, the cut will trim state revenues as part of the 2011-12 budget by $460 million.

It doesn’t take an Ivy League mathematics degree to figure out that the numbers don’t begin to line up the way Grayson suggests. The tax cuts represent $460 million, which is less than one third of the $1.7 billion education cut.

Part of the issue might be Scott’s budget proposal is actually for two years -- 2011-12 and 2012-13. Over two years -- after factoring in a second reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 3 to 2.5 percent -- corporations would save a total of $1.5 billion, according to the governor’s office.

But that’s not being fair -- $1.5 billion over two years doesn’t exactly compare to $1.7 billion over one year.

In reviewing Scott’s tax-cutting proposals, it appears Grayson’s error also could have been singling out the corporate income tax as a way to cast Scott as a greedy CEO-type looking out only for his buddies.

As we said in a previous item, Scott is proposing a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts as part of his 2011-12 budget. Scott’s proposal includes cuts to the corporate income tax, a cut to required school district property taxes, and a cut to unemployment taxes. PolitiFact Florida has previously ruled that roughly half of those cuts apply only to businesses, while half apply to homeowners and typical Floridians.

Look at the numbers -- a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 versus a proposed total education funding cut of $1.7 billion. They match (well, they’re not identical, because of rounding).

And there’s one final way to look at this. The corporate income tax is estimated to collect about $2 billion in the current budget year. If it’s eliminated, a goal of Scott’s, that would be $2 billion less the state would receive. That’s on the order of the $1.7 billion K-12 education Scott is proposing for 2011-12.

But again, that’s comparing additional budget years beyond even 2012-13 to cuts coming this year.

On MSNBC, Grayson targeted Scott’s proposal to cut the corporate income tax, suggesting the cuts for corporate CEOs are being paid for on the back of students. While he’s right that any tax cut results in money not available to be spent on programs like education, he gets his numbers wrong.

If Grayson had said the tax cuts and fees being proposed by Scott are being paid for by education cuts, he’d have more of a point. But sticking to what he said, we rate this claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/09/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-returns-msnbc-stage-criticizes-gov-ri/

Rick Scott said the corporate income tax fueled Bing Energy's move to Florida
","
Gov. Rick Scott welcomed business leaders to his State of the State address, saying they exemplified his efforts to win jobs for the state.

One of those leaders was Dean Minardi, chief financial officer of Bing Energy Inc., a company that uses nanotechnology to make hydrogen fuel cells.

""Bing Energy, a California-based company, was courted by offers from several states, but Bing decided to come to Florida in December, and Tallahassee, which is nice,"" Scott said in his March 8, 2011, address to a joint session of the Legislature. ""The reason Florida won? Dean said it was our plan to eliminate the corporate tax.""

We decided to fact-check the claim that Bing came here because of Scott’s plan to eliminate the corporate tax, which now stands at 5.5 percent of business income. Scott intends to reduce the tax to 3 percent on the way to eliminating it entirely.

We soon found video of Minardi speaking at a press conference on Feb. 10, announcing that the company was moving its corporate headquarters to Tallahassee and opening its first production facility there. The move could bring up to 244 jobs to Florida.

""The tipping point in our decision to move to Florida is the governor’s pledge to try to eliminate the corporate income tax. It’s huge,"" Minardi said. ""From a business point of view, the simple truth is that the more income a company can keep, the more people it can hire. And the more people we can hire, the faster we can grow. Simple truth.""

All done? Not quite.

As you may have noticed, the corporate tax rate has not yet been lowered, and it’s hardly a done deal that it will be. Legislators have said their first priority is a balanced budget without tax increases. Tax cuts for businesses might have to wait.

And there are a few other pertinent facts about Bing Energy’s business.

• Bing Energy intends to make fuel cells using ""buckypaper,"" a fiber that’s stronger than steel but has a fraction of its weight. Some of the leading research on buckypaper is being done at Florida State University in Tallahassee, at the school’s Center for Advanced Power Systems.

• In September 2010, FSU announced it was entering into a commercialization agreement with Bing Energy. Dr. Jim P. Zheng, a professor with FSU since 1997, would develop several prototypes of fuel cells, while Bing Energy would evaluate the cells for effectiveness and their potential for mass production, the university said.

• In October 2010, Bing Energy asked Leon County officials for tax incentives to continue its work on fuel cells under its agreement with FSU.

• At the February 2011 press conference announcing Bing Energy’s move to Tallahassee, FSU president Eric J. Barron credited the ""breakthrough research"" of FSU’s faculty and added that the company’s decision was ""confirming that the investment made in their work by our state and by the federal government has realized its commercial potential."" Scott himself added, ""If you look at other capitals with great universities, they ought to be big business centers. And this city, Tallahassee, should be a significant business center.""

Scott's right that Bing Energy’s CFO said Scott’s proposal to eliminate corporate income taxes was the ""tipping point"" for the company’s decision to move to Tallahassee. And we have little doubt that Minardi loves the idea of getting rid of the tax.

But the company already had signed a high-tech commercialization agreement with FSU and sought tax breaks from local officials -- all before Scott was even elected. 
So the potential of getting rid of the corporate tax outweighs the reality of a university’s research and commercialization agreement? We don’t think any hard-headed business person would buy that. That's the way Minardi described it, and Scott quotes him accurately. But we think both men are overlooking important details that would put this deal in a different light.

Gov. Rick Scott says budget cuts taxes by $2 billion
","
Gov. Rick Scott asked Florida legislators to pass his proposed budget during his first State of the State speech on March 8, 2011. 
It's a budget that cuts spending to balance the budget as required by the state Constitution. 
And,  it cuts taxes. 
""I delivered to you a budget that ... cuts taxes by $2 billion,"" Scott told legislators on the first day of its 60-day legislative session. 
Let's walk through the math of his budget. Scott proposed a two-year budget that cuts a host of taxes and fees. Here's a breakdown from the governor's office. Scott's budget proposal would: 
• Reduce the corporate income tax from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2011-12 and from 3 percent to 2.5 percent in 2012-13. The rate cut will save those who pay the tax $459 million this year and a little more than $1 billion in 2012-13;

• Reduce the required local effort, a property tax to fund schools, saving taxpayers around $600 million in 2011-12. The tax cut would carry forward in 2012-13;

• Reduce the property tax collected by state water management districts 25 percent for two years, saving taxpayers $180 million annually;

• Reduce unemployment compensation taxes by shortening how long Floridians can collect benefits and making it more difficult for them to be eligible. Scott's office says that will save $630.8 million over two years;

• Roll back 2009 Legislature-approved fee increases for driver licenses, vehicle registrations and other motor vehicle fees. Scott says the rollback would save drivers $492 million over two years;

• And repeal or alter other small taxes on ammonia, pesticides, fertilizer, solvents, dry cleaning, tires and lead acid batteries, among other things. The changes would save $77 million over two years, Scott's office says.

Taken together, that is a total of $1.7 billion in tax and fee cuts in 2011-12 -- slightly below the figure he claimed in his speech. (Scott's office, by the way, claims a total of $4.1 billion over two years, but that number is deceiving because most cuts in the second year of Scott's budget aren't additional cuts; they are just the same cuts rolled over.) 
Scott said his budget cuts taxes by $2 billion. But really, the number is about 15 percent high, based on the estimates of his own budget office. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/mar/08/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-budget-cuts-taxes-2-billion/

On that, there's no question. 
On Feb. 11, Scott authorized the sale of two state airplanes to out-of-state buyers.

Scott ""directed the Department of Management Services to accept two bids that were revealed earlier this week,"" according to a press release.

Mary Burke says Wisconsin is last in Midwest job growth under latest figures
","A new TV ad from Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke plows some familiar ground, arguing that Wisconsin is heading in the wrong direction in terms of job creation. The ad began airing Sept. 23, 2014, several days after the latest set of jobs numbers were issued. It opens with a narrator saying ""It’s happened again. The new August jobs numbers are out, and Wisconsin lost another 4,300 jobs."" The narrator then cites Gov. Scott Walker’s now-unreachable pledge to create 250,000 private-sector jobs, criticizes ""tax cuts to the wealthy"" and cuts to education, and continues with a claim that has become a Burke campaign mantra: ""And we’ve fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth."" The ad meshes together two batches of jobs data that were released Sept. 18, 2014. The first is an initial estimate of monthly performance for August 2014, based on numbers that can fluctuate widely because they are based on a small sample of employers. The second is the more accurate quarterly numbers, this batch covering the first three months of 2014. We have been here before. Sort of. On Aug. 31, 2014, we rated True a claim from a Burke TV ad that ""Wisconsin’s dead last in Midwest job growth."" At the time, the most recent quarterly numbers went to the end of 2013, so they matched quite nicely with the first three years of Walker’s term. But, as the calendar changed, so did the numbers. In the first ad, Burke used a footnote on the screen to bolster her claim. In this one, the fine print illustrates how she has subtly shifted the time frame to her advantage. And the way the August drop is juxtaposed with the ""dead last"" language further confuses the matter. In short, the otherwise accurate numbers reach a conclusion that’s greater than the sum of their parts. Time frame Let’s start with the first ad. As noted, it relied on numbers that covered Walker’s full first three years in office. In that time frame, Wisconsin was indeed last among other Midwest states. What’s more, Wisconsin also ranked last if you looked strictly at the most recent one-year period. So, the short-term view and the long-term one matched. We felt Burke had used a fair approach and we rated the claim True. This time, there is a critical difference. In her latest ad, Burke shifts the time frame and in doing so loses track of Walker’s term. This time, the footnote says the claim is based on numbers that compare March 2011 to March 2014. Burke’s campaign points out that this data is the most recent available and that you cannot combine full-year with partial-year data. And that in the window from March 2011 to March 2014 Wisconsin does rank last in the Midwest. True enough. But that timeframe does not correspond well with anything. It misses entirely the first three months of Walker’s term. What’s more, it masks an important fact. When reviewing economic data, a common yardstick is to examine year-over-year performance to gauge trends. And in that 12-month time frame -- March 2013 to March 2014 -- Wisconsin no longer ranks ""dead last"" in the Midwest. We’ve climbed out of the cellar, past Illinois and Minnesota, and rank eighth of 10 states. A modest improvement, to be sure. But an improvement. When asked about the claim, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said: ""While it is true that we rank 8th out of 10 Midwestern states from March 2013 to March 2014, we clearly indicated in the ad that we are using the time period that better reflects the Governor's full term in office, not just the last year."" But it doesn’t accurately reflect the governor’s full time in office. And it strikes us not as an effort to be most current, but a clever way to maintain a powerful talking point. Consider: When the next set of quarterly data comes out, it will cover the quarter that ends in June 2014. Using Burke’s approach would lop off the first six months of Walker’s term. In the quarter after that, the first nine months would be gone. What’s more, the ad co-mingles monthly and quarterly data in a way that helps obscure the recent improvement. And its verbiage also serves to confuse viewers. The narrator cites the preliminary August jobs count, which did show a drop of 4,300 from the previous month. But when combined with the language used -- ""And we’ve fallen to dead last in Midwest job growth"" -- it suggests that falling to the bottom is a new development. For the first three years of Walker’s term, Wisconsin did rank last in the Midwest -- both for the three years as a whole, and in each of the individual years.That’s a true statement, and we have rated it as such. But while the calendar moved ahead, this claim from Burke has remained stuck in the past. In the last 12-month period that can be analyzed, the period economists most typically measure, Wisconsin moved out of the cellar. Finally, it’s worth noting that since this ad was first aired, the Burke campaign has turned to another ad that has a variation of this claim. In that ad, she defends copying parts of her jobs plan by suggesting if Walker had borrowed good ideas from other states ""maybe we wouldn’t be dead last in Midwest jobs growth."" However, this time there isn’t even a footnote. Our rating Burke’s ad renews the claim that Wisconsin rates last in the Midwest in terms of job creation. She’s arrives at that conclusion by citing accurate data, but by using an unconventional shift in the time frame to make her point. The ad also ignores the most recent 12-month performance -- a common yardstick for economists -- that says Wisconsin’s performance improved and was better than two other Midwest states. We rate the claim False. (Read our tipsheet on five things to watch for when you hear jobs claims)",/factchecks/2014/oct/03/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-last-midwest-job-growth-/

Republican ad blames Mary Burke for loss of 130,000 jobs
","In a TV ad that rips Democrat Mary Burke for copying parts of her economic plan, a key ally of Gov. Scott Walker couldn’t resist an extra jab on jobs. In the spot sponsored by the Republican Governors Association, which began running Sept. 23, 2014, the narrator points to Wisconsin job losses during the Great Recession. ""The truth is Burke’s record is one of failure and job loss, with plagiarism to cover it up,"" the narrator says. ""Don’t go backwards with Mary Burke."" As the words are spoken, this message fills the screen: ""Burke’s record: 130,000 fewer jobs."" It’s a familiar figure to us -- and probably to most voters by now. On the campaign trail, Walker has repeatedly juxtaposed the 100,000-plus jobs added during his first term with the total job loss in the last term under his Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010. Burke served as commerce secretary under Doyle for about three years. In an earlier factcheck of a Walker claim that Doyle’s policies in his last term ""saw the state lose more than 133,000 jobs,"" we found the number to be accurate -- Doyle’s second term saw a drop of 133,943 jobs. But the claim was far off on the blame game. As such, we rated the claim Mostly False. Economists agreed that Wisconsin’s economy was caught in the same economic crash that crippled the entire country. The recession was deeper and more severe than any single state’s policies, including those of Doyle. And, notably, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country. But there are even bigger problems with the RGA taking a figure for Doyle’s last term and applying it to Burke. Her time as head of Commerce spanned parts of both Doyle’s terms, and she only served for 10 months of the four-year term the RGA associates with the 130,000 job loss. Indeed, she wasn’t even around when the job losses started coming. Burke started in February 2005 and left in November 2007 -- shortly before the downturn. Nationally, the Great Recession began in December 2007, but Wisconsin didn’t see a decline in quarterly jobs figures until mid 2008. The state saw jobs turnaround in 2010, the last year Doyle was in office, and annual growth has continued under Walker. Burke’s time at Commerce So, what happened with jobs while Burke was at the helm of Commerce? Statistics show Wisconsin added between 43,500 and 59,100 private-sector positions during Burke’s time in state government, depending on which federal data source is analyzed. To be sure, a governor’s policies have limited impact on increases or decreases in jobs, given the many factors that drive a state’s economy. And, as we have noted previously, a Commerce secretary’s influence would be even smaller. But even if all that were set aside, and the RGA is right to attach all of Doyle’s second-term numbers to Burke, what about the other side of the coin? After all, she also served during Doyle’s first term. Shouldn’t those be included as well? The state gained 86,530 jobs in Doyle’s first term from 2003 through 2006, so when combined with the losses of the second term, the final score for Doyle’s eight years was a  loss of 47,000 jobs. Not good. But also not 130,000. Our rating The Republican Governors Association said Mary Burke’s record is one of ""130,000 fewer jobs."" But that number corresponds to Doyle’s second term, not Burke’s time as head of Commerce -- a period that saw an increase. Even with the most charitable of possible interpretations, the number is wrong.

Fact-checking Reza Aslan on Bill Maher's 'not very sophisticated' rant on Islam
","Comedian and HBO host Bill Maher is outspoken about his atheism, a fact not lost on many viewers of his recent rant about the passive approach of some liberals toward human rights abuses in Muslim countries. Yet a scholar of religion called his commentary ""not very sophisticated"" on national TV. Why? Maher was condemning the collective uproar over racist, homophobic or distasteful comments by American celebrities Donald Sterling, Jonah Hill, Rush Limbaugh and Mel Gibson when more serious offenses against women in Muslim countries are usually overlooked. ""Not only does the Muslim world have something in common with ISIS, it has too much in common with ISIS,""  Maher said at one point. As an example, Maher brought up female genital mutilation, which refers to procedures that remove, in part or in whole, external genitalia for a non-medical reason. International groups such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF and Human Rights Watch condemn the practice as a flagrant example of gender inequality -- one that carries risks of prolonged bleeding, infection, infertility and complications during birth. When performed, the procedure is usually done on young girls. Maher said 91 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of Somali women have been cut that way. CNN Tonight hosts Don Lemon and Alisyn Camerota picked up this thread the following day in an interview with Reza Aslan, an author and University of California-Riverside professor of religious studies. Aslan criticized Maher for making ""facile arguments"" when he generalized about Muslims and mislabeled female genital mutilation an Islamic problem. ""It's a central African problem,"" Aslan said. ""Eritrea has almost 90 percent female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. Ethiopia has 75 percent female genital mutilation. It's a Christian country. Nowhere else in the Muslim, Muslim-majority states is female genital mutilation an issue."" Aslan later tweeted an infographic showing a swath of African countries where female genital mutilation is concentrated.  Is Aslan’s point accurate? The map, taken from a July 2013 UNICEF report, shows the percentage of girls and women ages 15-49 who have undergone female genital mutilation in 27 Central African countries and two Middle Eastern countries (Iraq and Yemen). Seven of the top eight countries with very high rates of female circumcision are majority Muslim, including the ""almost universal"" levels in Somalia, Egypt, Guinea and Djibouti. But Eritrea, as Aslan said, is No. 5 among countries with high prevalence at 89 percent, and it is home to more Christians than Muslims, according to Pew Research’s Religion and Public Life Project. Ethiopia, which is 63 percent Christian and 34 percent Muslim, has a moderately high rate of 74 percent, making it No. 11 on the list. So the countries in which female genital cutting is a practice are mostly Muslim, but they are not exclusively Muslim. Of the 29 countries tracked by UNICEF, 14 are home to more Christians than Muslims. The two Middle Eastern, and predominantly Muslim, countries, Yemen and Iraq, have much lower rates of 23 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Other majority-Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, are not listed. ""It is extremely clear that in many countries that have a very high population of Muslims, female genital mutilation/cutting is not practiced,"" said Francesca Moneti, the UNICEF senior child protection specialist who co-authored the report. Experts say the practice stems from social pressure to conform to traditions passed down for centuries -- one that predates not just Islam but also Judaism and Christianity. (The origins of the practice are subject to some dispute, but some scholars say it may correspond to areas of ancient civilizations, in which the cutting of females ""signalled controlled fidelity and the certainty of paternity,"" the UNICEF report states.) In areas of high prevalence today, ""this is perceived to be the normal and correct way of bringing up a girl,"" Moneti said. ""If a girl is not cut, she may be considered impure and not marriageable, and she and her entire family may be ostracized."" While it stems from neither Christianity nor Islam, some women in Chad, Guinea and Mauritania report a ""religious requirement"" as a benefit of cutting. Some communities consider a clitoridectomy -- one type of female genital mutilation -- as ""sunna,"" which is Arabic for ""tradition"" or ""duty,"" according to the UNICEF report. However, it is not a requirement of the Koran and has been specifically rejected by some Muslim leaders in Egypt. ""There are different positions within Islam on the issue,"" said Marit Tolo Østebø, a University of Florida lecturer on human rights and culture, global sexuality, and anthropology of religion. ""So you would have some Islamic scholars who will say, and might use parts from the hadith, to support that it’s good to do some cutting, but they will often emphasize that it is not an obligation."" (The hadith refers to commentary about the Koran that explains the traditions of the Prophet Mohammad.) The fact that it is also practiced by Christians and other groups with ancient beliefs makes it hard to say the practice is particularly Muslim, she said. ""Very often we tend to think that Islam is one thing -- that it’s one homogeneous religion,"" she said. ""But if we just look at Christianity, there are so many different traditions and views on things. That is exactly the same in Islam."" Aslan acknowledges that some may object to his ""central African"" characterization. He said he was trying to refer to the ""stripe"" of countries across Africa along the equator where this practice is common. However, UNICEF and international groups consider it a ""global"" problem since it happens in parts of Asia, Europe and North America because of immigration. ""All of this is to say that while it is almost impossible to come up with some sort of connection that binds countries that have (a female genital mutilation) problem, it is clear that whatever that connection is, it’s not religious,"" Aslan told PunditFact. Our ruling Aslan rejected Maher’s characterization of female genital mutilation as an Islamic problem, saying instead that it’s actually ""a central African problem."" Due to immigration, the term ""central African"" may be too restrictive, but his larger point -- that this is not a problem in only Muslim countries -- is valid. Countries with majority-Christian populations also carry out this practice, while Islamic-majority countries like Iraq and Yemen have rates on the lower side. We rate Aslan’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/02/reza-aslan/fact-checking-reza-aslans-retort-bill-maher/

Obama ordered military to enlist illegal aliens, Allen West says
","In case you missed this claim making the social media rounds, former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., is saying that President Barack Obama has extended open arms to illegal immigrants to join our military. ""Morning folks. While you were sleeping, Barack Hussein Obama took out his pen and ordered our Military to enlist illegal aliens,"" West posted on his Facebook page on Sept. 26. ""In other words, this charlatan has allowed those who have disrespected our Constitution and are not citizens to take an oath to support and defend the very document, our rule of law, of which they are in violation....."" West declares Obama’s action an ""illegal order"" and says the military shouldn’t follow it. The post caught several PolitiFact readers’ eyes. We will take a closer look at the claim, focusing on the part of West’s post that claims Obama ""ordered our Military to enlist illegal aliens."" West, who represented part of Broward and Palm Beach for a term before he lost running to represent a different district in 2012, is a retired Army lieutenant colonel and a Fox News contributor. Aides to West sent us several news articles, including one in the Military Times, a trade publication that covers the armed services. The article is about an expansion announced Sept. 25, 2014, by the Defense Department to the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest program. Before we get any further, we should explain that this program wasn’t created by -- or even under -- Obama. In December 2008, under President George W. Bush, the Defense Department announced a pilot program to temporarily allow certain legal aliens who were doctors or nurses -- or could speak certain in-demand languages such as Haitian-Creole, Chinese or Farsi -- to join the military. (Spanish is not on the language list.) The program started with 1,000 recruits, and in May 2012 the cap was raised to 1,500 a year through Sept. 30, 2014. The program has been open to asylees, refugees, and certain categories of people who hold non-immigrant visas, such as students or workers. All told, the MAVNI program has enrolled about 2,900 individuals since its inception, Defense spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Christensen told PolitiFact. Just days before the program was set to expire, Jessica Wright, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, signed a memo that extended the program through the end of fiscal year 2016 and allowed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients to apply. DACA -- announced by Obama in 2012 -- allows certain illegal immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation. As of the end of June 2014, about 580,000 individuals received initial deferred action under DACA. There are an estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Where West has a point is that some DACA recipients could eventually join the military program. But contrary to West’s sweeping suggestion, they would be a fraction of a very small program, experts say. The Defense Department doesn’t have any estimate regarding how many DACA recruits will join, but the cap of 1,500 recruits per year still applies. In the past, thousands more individuals have applied for the program than there are eligible spots. Margaret Stock, who helped create the MAVNI program when she worked for the Army and who now works as an immigration attorney, told PolitiFact that it will be difficult for immigrants with DACA status to pass the background investigation needed for top secret clearance. She predicted only a few dozen with DACA status will join MAVNI next year. ""The Pentagon should have set up a separate recruiting program for the DACAs,"" she said. ""They would make excellent military recruits, but hardly any of them can qualify for the MAVNI program, and the MAVNI program already has more than enough qualified recruits. Putting DACAs into the MAVNI program doesn’t make any sense,"" she said. We asked Christensen, the Pentagon spokesman, about the ability of those with DACA status to pass the background test and he told PolitiFact that the military currently does not enlist individuals with undocumented family members. However, the Defense Department ""is working with the Department of Homeland Security to evaluate options to enlist individuals with undocumented family members and resolve the family members' status prior to the enlistee entering active duty.The Department continues to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in reviewing all MAVNI candidates."" Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, expects only a small impact from this change. ""Given the narrowness of the MAVNI program, the slight change made by the president, and the extremely limited number of people involved, I would rate the change as entirely insignificant,"" Janda said. Allowing DACA participants into MAVNI, he said, is ""probably an attempt to court some favor with pro-immigration groups prior to the midterms, but it won’t be enough to make them happy. ... The odds of anyone getting in are very slim."" Marc Rosenblum, deputy director at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact that there are two likely reasons the program was expanded: It aims to attract people who have specialized skills but have a hard time getting into the military, and it falls broadly under the set of actions Obama can take related to immigration. However, it’s a very small piece of immigration reform, he said. Stock, who helped create MAVNI, also took issue with West’s assertion that Obama’s action was an ""illegal order."" ""The Pentagon is acting pursuant to a statute, 10 USC 504(b)(2), which gives authority to the Service Secretaries to determine when someone’s enlistment is vital to the national interest,"" she told PolitiFact. We should also note that the changes open up the possibility of illegal aliens joining the military, but it is short of an order by the president that they be brought into this particular program, and it does not give them any special priority over other groups. It’s also worth noting some historical context. While the Department of Defense started this particular pilot program in 2008, non-citizens have served in the military since the Revolutionary War. About 5,000 non-citizens enlist for active duty each year. A 2011 consultant’s report for the U.S. Navy stated that about 4 percent of the military services are non-citizens. The report concluded that non-citizens are a valuable recruiting resource because of their large numbers, their useful language skills and the smaller likelihood they will leave the armed services quickly. In 2002, Bush signed an executive order to expedite naturalization of military members. Since then, the United States has naturalized about 93,100 members of the military. (Steve Blando, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles naturalization, told PolitiFact that all of the military members who were naturalized were lawful permanent residents -- that is, ""green card"" holders -- prior to becoming citizens.) Our ruling West said that Obama ""ordered our military to enlist illegal aliens."" He’s right that Obama’s decision to allow certain illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status under DACA then enabled the military to announce that those people could apply for the MAVNI program. However, West’s analysis exaggerates what’s going on. The program in question was initiated by Bush in 2008, before Obama was president. In addition, contrary to West’s sweeping suggestion, experts say it’s doubtful that many undocumented immigrants would be brought into the military. And Obama didn't order the military to take illegal aliens but rather made it an option. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/02/allen-west/obama-ordered-military-enlist-illegal-aliens-allen/

Thom Tillis claims Kay Hagan didn't attend half the Armed Services Committee hearings this year
","The rise of the terrorist group known variously as ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic State has increased the role of national security in the political conversation just a month before the midterm elections. In North Carolina, state House speaker and Republican U.S. Senate candidate Thom Tillis released an ad that blames his Democratic opponent Sen. Kay Hagan for being missing in action as the ISIS threat grew. ""In January, President Obama refers to the Islamic State as a ‘JV team,’ "" the narrator says. ""Days later the Armed Services Committee holds a hearing on new global threats. Sen. Kay Hagan? Absent. In fact, Hagan’s missed half the Armed Services Committee hearings this year."" We’ve already checked whether Obama referred to the Islamic State as a JV team (he did). Here, we’ll review Tillis’ characterization of Hagan’s attendance record on the Senate Armed Services Committee. We went through all the committee’s meeting transcripts for 2014 to see which lawmakers were in attendance for each hearing. In compiling the information, we ran into an obstacle. Because the Senate Armed Services Committee often reviews confidential national-security information, it sometimes meets behind closed doors. Minutes for those meetings are not released to the public. Therefore, we’re not able to determine attendance for those meetings. In 2014, it appears there have been 11 closed hearings by the full committee. However, the committee has also held 22 open meetings this year, so we limited our calculations to those. How many of the public meetings has Hagan attended? The record shows the answer is nine. That’s not a great percentage — 41 percent — but is nine par for the course for a busy senator? Not exactly. While Hagan didn’t have the worst attendance among the 26 members of the Armed Services Committee this year, she came close. Only five senators — Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; David Vitter, R-La.; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; and Mark Udall, D-Colo. — attended fewer meetings. Meanwhile, six of her colleagues attended at least 20 of the 22 meetings. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., as the chairman, and Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., as the ranking Republican, would be expected to have perfect or near-perfect attendance. But Sens. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., Tim Kaine, D-Va., and John McCain, R-Ariz., were present for at least 20 hearings. For the sake of argument, let’s go back a year and look at 2013. The Senate Armed Services Committee held 28 open hearings in 2013, of which Hagan attended 14, putting her among those who attended hearings least often. For those two years combined, then, Hagan was present for 23 of 50 open hearings. Only six senators have attended fewer open meetings. Republicans Vitter and Cruz attended the fewest hearings, 16, of any of the committee members. Hagan’s campaign did not dispute those numbers, but staffers said they were taken out of context. They pointed us to an article by the Charlotte Observer that quotes Tara Andringa, spokeswoman for Levin. According to the Observer, Andringa said, ""Hagan appeared to have ‘one of the best attendance records on the committee.’ "" That didn’t mirror our findings, so we reached out to Andringa for clarification. We didn’t hear back. Hagan’s campaign also explained that scheduling conflicts and other duties — including constituent issues, other committee hearings and bill drafting — kept her from attending all the committee meetings. Let’s take a closer look at the February hearing ""on new global threats"" that Tillis highlighted in his ad. Hagan’s campaign said she did not attend that hearing on Feb. 11 on ""Current and Future World Threats"" because she had a constituent meeting with Jerry Ensminger, a former Marine who had discovered that families living on the Camp Lejeune military base in North Carolina were getting sick and, in some cases, dying from contaminated tap water used on the base from 1957 to 1987. (Congress passed legislation to assist the victims of this problem in 2012 and Ensminger and others continue to lobby Congress for further investigation.) The Feb. 11 meeting, which included testimony from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, continued in a closed session on the afternoon of Feb. 27. It’s unclear whether Hagan attended the closed hearing (and they didn’t tell us). However, her campaign said she missed another Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in the morning of the same day to attend a banking committee meeting. Our ruling Tillis said that Hagan ""has missed half of the (Senate Armed Services) Committee's hearings in 2014."" We don’t know the number of closed meetings she attended, so it’s more accurate to say that Hagan missed half of the committee’s public hearings. Still, Tillis has a point — in 2014, Hagan attended nine of the 22 open hearings, which is not only below half but which also ranked near the bottom among committee members. The comment is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. Update, Oct. 3, 2014, 11:00 a.m.: This version of the story reflects additional information about why Hagan was unable to attend the Feb. 11 Senate Armed Services Committee meeting and about her schedule on Feb. 27. The additional information does not affect the ruling, which remains Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/02/thom-tillis/thom-tillis-claims-kay-hagan-didnt-attend-half-arm/

Leticia Van de Putte says Dan Patrick said equal pay for women not a problem
","Leticia Van de Putte said in her recent Austin debate with Dan Patrick that Patrick had said that if women ""get paid less than a man for the same job, that that’s not a problem."" Patrick said that? To our query, Manny Garcia, spokesman for Van de Putte’s campaign, said by email Van de Putte. the San Antonio state senator and Democratic lieutenant governor nominee, heard Patrick, the Houston senator and Republican nominee, make the remark at the 2014 Texas Tribune Festival. Patrick, Garcia noted, voted in the 2013 legislative session against a proposal ultimately vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry requiring equal pay for women doing equal work. And in May 2014, Patrick said that as lieutenant governor, he would keep an equal-pay measure from being considered by the full Senate. As recapped by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, Patrick said: ""I do not think that we should have government telling business how to pay their employees whether they’re male or female. I would hold that bill… Look, women deserve equal pay and if they’re doing a better job than the guy they’re working next to, they deserve more. It’s not up to government."" Patrick added that the lieutenant governor should protect free markets. ""I don’t want government interfering,"" he said. On Sept. 20, 2014, Tribune CEO Evan Smith interviewed Patrick and Van de Putte back to back on an Austin stage. We watched the video. The equal-pay portion of the conversation opened with Smith asking Patrick to confirm he’d previously said: ""Women should be paid the same as a man, but I don’t believe government should enforce it."" ""Correct,"" Patrick said, adding that pay should be based on an individual’s performance. ""And if a woman does a better job than a man, she deserves to be paid more,"" Patrick said. ""And we have a lot of women business owners. I don’t want the state of Texas telling women business owners you have to pay, listen, you have to pay everyone the same."" Smith then asked if Patrick thought Texas has an equal pay problem or, alternatively, if critics had overblown the issue. Patrick: ""You know, I don’t think it’s a problem. But to say, are there some businesses that may not treat people fairly? Yes. But I don’t think it’s a problem. And I think look, I’m a small-business guy; I’ve always had a lot of women work for our company. I want the best employees I can have."" Smith asked next if women who work for Patrick are paid equally as men. Patrick: ""In some cases you’d find they are paid more. Look, I’m a business guy and like every businessman and woman, you want the best people. You don’t really care what color they are, where they come from, what gender they are; you want them to do the job."" Patrick then reiterated he doesn’t want the government imposing pay requirements. Our ruling Van de Putte said Patrick said that if women ""get paid less than a man for the same job, that that’s not a problem."" Broadly, both candidates were vague in their use of ""problem,"" leaving room for interpretation. Still, Patrick answered a question by saying he doesn’t think the equal-pay issue is a problem and he hammered his opposition to any state law mandating equal pay. However, Patrick also said some businesses don’t treat people fairly and said any worker should be paid on performance. These are important missing details. We rate this statement Half True.

Violent crime in Wisconsin higher under Scott Walker actions, police union says
","The state’s largest police union explained its endorsement of Mary Burke for governor by saying Wisconsin has become more dangerous. ""Under Scott Walker, not only has Wisconsin trailed its neighbors in creating jobs but in combating violent crime as well,"" Jim Palmer, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association's executive director, told reporters on Sept. 25, 2014. ""The crime data shows that Wisconsin has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office."" Unlike many statistics-driven claims we have seen, the union did not offer a specific number for a narrow period. Rather, it cited the more general ""less safe"" and pointed to the nearly four years since Walker took office. It also added an element of blame -- that any increase in violent crime is at least partly Walker’s fault. Many factors -- demographics, rates of incarceration, even police misreporting offenses -- can contribute to fluctuations in the incidence of crime, which is typically viewed more as a local issue than a statewide one. Still, the governor does have some say in how much money local governments have to spend. So let’s investigate. Violent crime data Palmer referred us to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. Four offenses are counted as violent crimes: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. One problem: The most recent year available is 2012, so the numbers only cover about half of Walker's time as governor. We found that Wisconsin’s violent crime rate declined each year from 2007 through 2011, Walker’s first year in office, but increased in 2012.   Year Wisconsin population Number of violent crimes Violent crimes/ 100,000 people  One-year change in rate 2011 5,711,76 13,532 236.9 -4.7% 2012 5,726,398 16,064 280.5 +18.4% 
Nationally, violent crime also declined each year 2007 through 2011. But, in contrast to Wisconsin, the national rate declined again in 2012, to 386.9 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. In any case, it’s important to note that based on available statistics, the union's claim can't account for nearly the entire second half of Walker’s term. That is a significant unknown. Walker’s role As for pinning an increase in Wisconsin’s violent crime rate on Walker, local police and sheriff’s departments -- not the State Patrol or Capitol Police -- are most responsible for fighting crime. At the same time, cities, villages, towns and counties get a big chunk of their revenue from the state. And Walker also put strict limits on how much local governments could raise property taxes. Palmer pointed us to Walker’s first state budget, for 2011-’13 -- which reduced ""shared revenue"" to local governments. He also cited a related fact-check we did during the failed campaign to recall Walker in 2012. In that item, we found that Walker cut shared revenue by $76 million, or 9 percent -- the largest reduction in at least a decade. But two other points from that fact-check are also important:   Shared revenue is general aid from the state that local governments use for various programs, not just police and fire. The state money is typically mixed with local money and isn’t tied to a specific local government function.   Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining reform law helped many local governments absorb at least some of the shared revenue cuts by forcing most public employees (though not police and firefighters) to pay more for their health and pension benefits.   As for the size of law enforcement agencies, Palmer cited state Office of Justice Assistance statistics covering the more than 12,000 sworn officers in local police and sheriff’s departments, as well in the State Patrol, universities and the state Department of Natural Resources. The number of sworn officers per 1,000 residents declined by 2 percent in 2011 and 1.8 percent in 2012. But local governments, not the governor, ultimately make decisions that determine the lion’s share of front-line law enforcement officers around the state. Our rating The Wisconsin Professional Police Association union said: Data on violent crime shows Wisconsin ""has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office."" In 2012, Walker’s second year in office, violent crime increased and he reduced funding to local governments. But the available violent crime data cover only about half of Walker’s time in office, so the union’s statement is based at best on a partial picture. Beyond that, a number of factors other than the governor bear on the rate of violent crime. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/02/wisconsin-professional-police-association/violent-crime-wisconsin-higher-under-scott-walker-/

Contrary to Dan Patrick claim, Van de Putte didn't vote for totally free health care for immigrants
","In the only debate between major-party candidates for Texas lieutenant governor, Republican nominee Dan Patrick stood by his objections to a Texas law authored by his Democratic opponent that enables some children living in the state without legal authorization to qualify for in-state college tuition. Patrick, a Houston state senator, went on to say Sept. 29, 2014, that after the tuition proposal passed into law in 2001, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio, the Democratic nominee, supported another questionable move. ""She voted to give illegal immigrants in this country free health care -- not emergency health care but total free health care,"" Patrick said. ""That was about seven years ago and that bill didn’t pass."" We were curious about the described vote. By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick was referring to Van de Putte’s vote for a proposal that cleared the Senate in 2003, Senate Bill 309. Garcia said the legislation required ""local hospitals to provide emergency care to patients regardless of immigration status. Opponents claimed the bill would drive up the costs of health care and increase taxes to provide care to illegal immigrants. Van de Putte supported this measure knowing that it would benefit illegal immigrants at a cost to taxpayers,"" Garcia wrote. We’d been down this path with Patrick before. In May 2014, we rated False his claim that the Senate had earlier approved free health care for illegal immigrants. Let’s unspool afresh. Senators including Van de Putte on May 5, 2003, gave voice-vote approval to the proposal, which a May 5, 2003, Senate Journal entry summarized as ""providing health care services without regard to a person's immigration status."" At the time, Patrick, a talk-radio host, wasn’t yet a senator. The legislation said a city, county or public hospital ""may use money from local sources to provide health care services to a person without regard to the person's immigration status and shall establish a cost-share system for persons receiving health care services."" At an April 2003 committee hearing, authoring Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, said it permitted hospitals to draw on local revenue to provide preventive services to residents regardless of a patient’s immigration standing. Sylvia Garcia, then a Harris County commissioner, testified the proposal would hasten outpatient services, heading off health problems early and saving money thanks to fewer emergency-room visits. Proponents described the legislation as vital after the then-Texas attorney general (and future U.S. senator), John Cornyn, issued an advisory opinion in July 2001 stating that unless lawmakers allowed the Harris County Hospital District (and others, presumably) to deliver preventive services to patients regardless of immigration status, the district couldn’t give such care without violating the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which required state legislatures to intervene if states wanted hospitals to go ahead and do so. Notably, Cornyn’s letter made it clear some health services already were provided to patients regardless of immigration status--as mandated by federal law. Cornyn’s letter said the district was required by law to provide emergency care to residents regardless of their legal status. Lance Lunsford, spokesman for the Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems statewide, told us a federal law from the 1980s, the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, made free emergency care available to illegal immigrants. According to a federal website, that act required Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical exam when a request is made for an emergency condition, including active labor, regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Cornyn’s letter also said federal law permitted public health services including immunizations and testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases. Still, he wrote, the 1996 law specified that any other state or local health benefit could be provided only if a state law ""affirmatively provides for such eligibility."" Mike Stafford, the Harris County attorney, reacted to Cornyn’s letter by advising the local hospital district to stop giving discounted preventive care because it violates federal law, according to a July 12, 2001, Associated Press news story. ""It's up to the Texas Legislature to step in now and, if they want to create an exception for this, it's allowable,"" Stafford said. In 2003, Senate Bill 309 died in the House, though advocates including Lunsford said the permission to provide such services ended up in House Bill 2292, a major 2003 overhaul of health care agencies. Section 285.201 of the Texas Health and Safety code ""affirmatively establishes"" the eligibility of undocumented residents to receive non-emergency public health benefits funded locally by public hospital districts. And in the end, did the legislation expand free health care for illegal immigrants? When we inquired, King Hillier, a vice president of the Harris County Hospital District, said by phone that ""basically"" the district had already been providing non-emergency services when the issue reached lawmakers. Hillier stressed the permissive quality of the proposal; funding and delivery of services was left up to local governments. Finally, Hillier noted the Senate version of the law envisioned a system of patients sharing costs, which has resulted, he said. Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte ""voted to give illegal immigrants in this country free health care--not emergency health care but total free health care."" The 2003 proposal in question didn’t provide immigrants free across-the-board health care. Rather, the measure permitted (and didn’t require) local governing bodies to provide (or, it appears, resume providing) non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, an action that was predicted to improve outcomes and head off costly emergency care to which all residents were already entitled per federal law. Significantly, too, the proposal envisioned patients sharing costs. Diagnosis: False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2014/oct/02/dan-patrick/contrary-dan-patrick-claim-van-de-putte-didnt-vote/

Did Bruce Braley threaten to sue his neighbor over rogue chickens?
","We know why the chicken crossed the road, but what happened after it crossed into Bruce Braley’s yard? A televised debate on Sept. 28 (and a later mention on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show) brought a months-old incident involving a congressman from Iowa, a lawyer and some rogue chickens back to the national stage.  It’s one of Iowa Republicans’ favorite anecdotes -- that Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Bruce Braley got into a dispute with a neighbor because her chickens wandered onto his vacation property, a lake house in Holiday Lake, Iowa. There’s a website, BraleyChicken.com, and reports of promotional rubber chickens. Karl Rove’s conservative political action committee American Crossroads released an ad in July attacking Braley over the dispute. In Des Moines on Sept. 28, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst was well prepared with a quip about what the chicken incident says about Braley as a leader. Ernst and Braley are vying to succeed retiring Democrat Tom Harkin in one of the nation’s tightest and most-watched Senate contests. ""Congressman, you threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto your property,"" Ernst said. ""You’re talking about bipartisanship. How do we expect as Iowans to believe that you will work across the aisle when you can’t walk across your yard?"" ""That’s just not true,"" Braley replied. ""I never threatened to sue anyone."" The chicken incident, which came to light in July, has been well reported. But we wondered about their disagreement at the debate. Did Braley actually threaten to sue or not? There was a real dispute over chickens, but we didn't find evidence for a lawsuit threatened against the neighbor. The backstory The Braleys’ neighbor, Pauline Hampton, keeps chickens in her backyard as pets and therapy animals. These chickens were previously unfenced and would occasionally wander onto the Braleys’ property, and Braley’s wife, Carolyn, claimed she could smell them. Hampton says she did not know that the chickens were bothering her neighbors until this past spring, when Carolyn Braley told Hampton that she would be filing a complaint to the neighborhood homeowner’s association. The neighborhood rules say, ""No animals or birds, other than household pets, shall be kept on any lot."" (The Braleys weren’t the only Holiday Lake residents who had problems with the chickens, according to Yahoo and the Washington Post, both of which interviewed other Holiday Lake residents.)  Carolyn Braley’s complaint came up at the neighborhood association board meeting in May. The board ruled that the chickens are indeed pets and Hampton could keep them, as long as she fenced them into her yard. Problem solved? Well, not quite. The lawyer It doesn’t appear that any legal action was taken, so why do Republicans keep saying Braley threatened to sue over the chickens?  After the matter was settled, the conservative Iowa Republican, broke the story after it acquired a series of emails. They show that Braley contacted the neighborhood association’s lawyer about a week after the board’s decision about Hampton’s chickens, complaining about the board’s ""lack of action"" and saying he believes ""chickens are not pets and should not be permitted at Holiday Lake.""  The Iowa Republican treated these emails as a smoking gun.  However, these emails -- among the lawyer, the neighborhood association board and Braley -- do not say anywhere that Braley was considering a lawsuit. In fact, they say the opposite. The lawyer, Thomas Lacina, writes: ""The implication from Mr. Braley was that he wants to avoid a ‘litigious situation.' ""  Iowa Republicans say that the fact that Braley, a former trial lawyer, hinted at a ""litigious situation"" is evidence enough that he was considering a lawsuit -- but it still doesn’t definitively prove it. One interpretation of the email is that Braley said to the lawyer he wants to ""avoid a litigious situation,"" but he will sue if he has to. But another interpretation is that Braley told the lawyer he planned to ""avoid a litigious situation"" under all circumstances.

Point is, we don't know what was going on in Braley's head or the details of private conversations he had with his wife and the lawyer -- and neither does Ernst. (By the way -- Jeff Patch, the author behind the Iowa Republican story, is now the communications director for the Iowa Republican Party.) A spokesman for Braley told us that ""a lawsuit was never part of the picture at all -- nor was there ever any threat of a lawsuit. Any claims to the contrary are false."" ""I just reached out to somebody I knew expecting to get a phone call back and instead this thing blows up,"" Braley told the Washington Post. In an interview with PolitiFact, Hampton said Braley never threatened to sue her -- though she was under the impression that he threatened to sue the neighborhood association board. In a local newspaper, the Quad City Times, one board member said he thought a lawsuit was in the air, while the board’s vice president said he never thought that was a serious possibility. We called the neighborhood association board, but they declined to comment and hung up the phone. We also want to note that the original Iowa Republican story says the association’s lawyer billed the board nearly $1,700 over the dispute, but the budget document does not specify that the costs directly pertained to Braley’s interaction with the lawyer.  Additionally, the board vice president told the Quad City Times that the figure wasn’t entirely accurate, and the association's lawyer ""handles a number of chores and has a monthly budget."" Our ruling Ernst said Braley ""threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came onto (his) property."" Some might not like the way Braley and his wife handled a dispute with a neighbor -- by going to the neighborhood association and then consulting the association's lawyer. Even so, there is no material evidence that Braley threatened a lawsuit against the neighbor or was even considering one. Even the neighbor says that. We rate Ernst’s claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/02/joni-ernst/did-bruce-braley-threaten-sue-over-rogue-chickens/

Van de Putte, critical of high stakes exams, says testing firm advertises scorer jobs on Craigslist
","In a debate at Austin's KLRU-TV, Channel 18, Democrat Leticia Van de Putte, her party’s nominee for lieutenant governor, revisited her declared desire to battle the ""high stakes"" state-mandated exams imposed by law before students qualify to graduate from high school. But the San Antonio state senator caught our ear in the Sept. 29, 2014, faceoff with Republican nominee Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, by indicating the company that manages the tests in Texas has some possibly cheapskate habits. After saying students in the top-notch Highland Park school district in Dallas had struggled on the state-imposed English II exam, Van de Putte added: ""Probably because our testing company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays."" We wondered if the scorer posts get filled starting from free ads placed on Craigslist, the mostly free online classified ad service founded in 1995. In January 2013, a couple of news reports said Pearson, the company hired by the Texas Education Agency to administer the state tests, had been using Craigslist to advertise openings. According to a Jan. 16, 2013, blog post by the Answer Sheet newsletter on The Washington Post’s website, and pointed out to us by Van de Putte spokesman Manny Garcia, Pearson ran an ad on Craigslist Nov. 29, 2012, looking for people to hire and train to score the written portion of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills; that was then the name of the state exams. ""According to a press release released by leaders of a coalition of people in Texas seeking to reform standardized testing in the state,"" Answer Sheet said, ""the ad says college graduates would be paid  $12 an hour for doing the job. According to the Craigslist ad, ‘Bachelor degree required – any field welcome,’"" Answer Sheet said, adding that the coalition was urging legislators and the TEA to find a way to  ensure only English teachers graded student essays in the exams. A few days later, KDFW-TV, Channel 4 in Dallas, aired a news report saying Pearson Testing ""uses Craigslist to solicit people to grade"" the state test, which had been revised and renamed the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness. This story included a statement from the TEA stating the agency was ""fully aware that the Pearson Testing company utilizes multiple employment avenues to secure and adequately train qualified candidates. Pearson carefully trains the graders, and experienced supervisors oversee the work to ensure that essays are graded in a fair and consistent manner."" On its website, KDFW included information attributed to Pearson stating Pearson exhaustively searches for the best people to score student tests relying on the same employment resources school districts use to promote career opportunities. Pearson said its search for scorers in Texas extended to ads with 21 organizations and publications including the National Council of Teachers of English, the Austin American-Statesman and the Texas Workforce Commission--as well as Craigslist, ClassifiedAds.com and the Austin Chronicle among venues, Pearson said. ""All test scorers hired by Pearson must have at least a four-year degree and undergo very rigorous, state-approved training before they are allowed to begin work,"" Pearson said, according to KDFW. ""As part of this rigorous training, applicants must complete and pass practice sets before being eligible to work. The rigorous training program for scorers was developed with the Texas Education Agency, and TEA must approve all final training materials."" We double-checked this additional information, confirming from Pearson that the company posts ads on Craigslist and numerous other outlets. By email, Debbie Ratcliffe, a TEA spokeswoman, provided Pearson’s 2013 statement on the Craigslist criticism. She also guided us to Dave Clark, a Texas-based Pearson official, who said by phone Craigslist is among 21 advertising venues used by Pearson when it’s hunting for qualified test scorers. Clark said: ""We have to blanket the entire state to find scorers; it’s seasonal work."" Asked if using Craigslist leaves the impression that the recruitment of scorers is slapdash, Clark replied that if so, people would have to reach a similar illogical characterization of the other places where Pearson advertises such jobs. To our inquiry, Brandon Pinette, a Washington, D.C.-based Pearson spokesman, emailed a statement similar to the one circulated in 2013. Among recent applicants to grade the Texas exams, Pinette advised, 11 percent fulfilled Pearson’s requirements. Among the successful applicants, he said, 71 percent had at least a year of classroom teaching experience, 83 percent had writing-intensive four-year college degrees and 27 percent had a degree in English. Our ruling Van de Putte, who has said she opposes high-stakes state-imposed student testing, said the company that scores the existing state tests ""goes on Craigslist to get examiners to read our students’ essays."" There’s a strand of truth here; scorer positions have been advertised on Craigslist. But this statement leaves a loosey-goosey impression by not acknowledging the testing company spreads the word about its scorer jobs in a wide range of  venues. Also unnoted, the company further screens applicants to ensure they’re up to the job. Such information was public nearly two years ago. We rate this statement Mostly False.

Mary Burke says 41,000 people are on waitlist for financial aid
","Democrat Mary Burke thinks the technical-college tuition freeze promised by Gov. Scott Walker could backfire on students. If state aid to tech schools isn’t boosted at the same time, the candidate for governor argues, a tuition freeze could force elimination of in-demand courses. Burke doesn’t rule out backing a tuition freeze herself if she wins the Nov. 4, 2014 election. But she says it’s more important to get financial support to students so they can afford to go to school -- such as by increasing state aid to keep college affordable. ""The bigger issue I think is we have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities, and most of those people are on the waitlist for tech colleges,"" Burke said during a Sept. 22, 2014 interview by Wisconsin Eye. Were that many students turned down? To back her claim, Burke’s campaign pointed us to a July 31, 2014 memo prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for state Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse). We also tracked down a later memo from the agency dated Aug. 19, 2014. Both memos examined Wisconsin Grants, the state-funded program that gives need-based grants to undergraduate students enrolled at least half-time in one of four sectors: UW-System institutions, tech colleges, private and nonprofit schools or tribal colleges. You must be a state resident to receive the money. All told, the state spent about $106 million in 2013-’14 on the grants. Though perhaps not as well known as federal financial aid programs, the state program helps a lot of people. At UW schools and tech schools alone, nearly 57,000 students received grants for the 2013-’14 year. UW schools receive an allotment, and the tech schools work from a separate pot of money. The average grant for a UW student was $1,775; for tech students, $994. In the tech system, it’s first-come, first-served for the grants. In the UW System, it’s first-come, first-served until each campus’ allocation is spent. In the 2013-’14 year, more than 41,000 financial aid applicants who were eligible for state help did not get any due to lack of funds, according to the Fiscal Bureau memo. More than nine out of 10 of those rejected were tech-school applicants, the memo said. The Fiscal Bureau figures are on target, according to John Reinemann, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board, which administers the grants, and Conor Smyth, director of Strategic Partnerships and External Relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System. Those who did not get a grant are put on a list in case they are still in school if grant money becomes available. Demand started to exceed supply of grant money during the Great Recession, when more people were returning to school for retraining and diminished incomes meant  many more were eligible to receive aid. The ""unmet need"" reached as high as 80,000 in 2009, statistics show. The tech schools alone saw 54,000 applicants get turned down in 2012. A word about the numbers There’s somewhat less than meets the eye with the waiting list figures, however. There’s some potential -- though apparently relatively minor -- overlap between the UW System and the Wisconsin Technical College System figures. The tech schools put you on a waiting list if you are eligible for one of their awards, and you listed a tech school as the number one choice on your financial aid application. The Fiscal Bureau points out it’s not known how many of those applicants actually enroll at a tech school. They might have enrolled in a UW or private college instead -- and might even have secured a grant from one of those institutions. And while some may have done so because they didn’t get a tech-school grant, others went a different route for other reasons. This situation means the tech school list likely overstates the unmet need to some extent,  Fiscal Bureau analyst Emily Pope wrote. Conversely, the UW list -- which includes only students who actually enrolled in a UW school -- likely understates it because it doesn’t include applicants who may have enrolled there if they had received a UW grant, So for all those reasons, the 41,000 waitlist figure is the best we have, but not rock solid. Our rating Burke said: ""We have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities,"" most of them for tech schools. There is a large waiting list, and Burke cites a credible source on its size. But some variations in how the lists are defined by the different institutions mean the number should be treated with some caution.

Cianci: When he was mayor, Providence was named safest city in U.S., one of best cities to live in
","During Tuesday’s debate among the three candidates for mayor of Providence, Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. responded to criticism about his past criminal record, saying, ""I can tell you, I’ve made mistakes."" He then pivoted, pointing to positive achievements during his two stints in City Hall, the most recent of which ended in 2002 after a conviction for federal racketeering conspiracy. ""But there were no mistakes in the area of developing the City of Providence, creating jobs, when I was mayor,"" Cianci, an independent, said in the forum sponsored by The Providence Journal and WPRI-TV. ""Providence was one of the five renaissance cities of America, according to USA Today in those days. Money magazine said it was the fifth best city to live in in America. In addition to that, All Cities Almanac said in 1994, I believe, that it was the safest city in America."" While such ratings are notable mostly for their public relations value, it’s still quite a collection of accolades for Rhode Island’s capital. We decided to check if they were all true. Let’s go down the list, starting with USA Today. We found a 1996 story from The Journal on USA Today’s selection of Providence as one of America’s ""renaissance cities.""  The Dec. 31, 1996, edition of USA Today profiled Providence as part of a series on cities that had revitalized themselves through ""bold and creative approaches,"" according to The Journal story. The USA Today story chronicled the city’s efforts to preserve its historic landmarks and launch new development initiatives, including the creation of Waterplace Park. The newspaper credited Cianci for Providence’s renewal, according to The Journal. What about Money Magazine and its annual list of the best places to live in America? In 2000, Portland, Ore., was rated the best in the nation, but Providence was one of four regional winners, according to The Journal. The city was named best place to live in the East. It’s worth noting that Cianci wasn’t always happy with Money’s ""best places to live"" list. After Providence was ranked a lowly 136th out of 300 cities in 1995, Cianci complained in an Op-Ed in The Journal that Money ""failed to take into account Providence's resurgence, renewal, ambiance and amenities."" (Providence dropped to 198th on the list in 1996 and 240th in 1997. The format for the rankings subsequently changed.) On to the ""safest city"" claim. This is based on a 1994 story in Parade magazine, according to a Journal story from that year. For the Parade story, John Tepper Marlin, author of the 1992 book ""The Livable Cities Almanac,"" looked at statistics for murder rates, robberies, auto fatalities, overall death rates, air pollution and infant mortality rates. He concluded that Honolulu, Hawaii, was number one and that Providence was number two -- or safest in the continental United States. At the time, critics of the survey pointed out that it looked at only a limited number of factors, not all crime-related. But Cianci was undeterred. ""This is really and truly something we as a community can be proud of, and we can brag about it,"" Cianci said at the time. And he still is. Our ruling In the debate with Democrat Jorge Elorza and Republican Daniel Harrop, Cianci said that Providence was described as a renaissance city during his most recent stint in office and that it was also rated the safest city in America and one of the best places to live. The details are a bit off on a couple of those claims -- where they were made, the actual ranking -- but Cianci is pretty much on the mark. We rate his statement True.

Nunn camp swings wide on gender pay attack ad
","In a direct appeal to female voters, a new television ad for Michelle Nunn takes a shot at opponent David Perdue on the issue of equal pay. ""David Perdue opposes laws that provide equal-pay protections for women,"" declares the ad from Georgians Together, a super PAC created to support the Democrat’s campaign for U.S. Senate. The Senate race between Nunn and Republican Perdue is being closely watched here and nationally. A Nunn win would allow Democrats to reclaim a top statewide office. The outcome also could determine majority control in the U.S. Senate, now narrowly held by Democrats. Both candidates need the support of women, who make up about 56 percent of the state’s 5 million likeliest voters. Nunn has already tried to make political hay of the fact that Dollar General was hit with a gender discrimination lawsuit during Perdue’s tenure as its CEO. (The suit was settled for $18.75 million several years after Perdue left the company, with no admission of wrongdoing). The new ad from Georgians Together brings up the Dollar General lawsuit. It also accuses Perdue of opposing laws that ""provide equal-pay protections for women,"" a claim that PolitiFact Georgia decided warranted further investigation. The super PAC’s ad claim is a reference to Perdue’s opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill supported by President Barack Obama and most Capitol Hill Democrats and opposed by congressional Republicans.   Supporters say the bill – and it is a bill, and not a law, as the Georgians Together ad states  -- contains practical steps for promoting fair pay for women that the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not been able to achieve. They say the act would enhance the remedies available to victims of gender-based discrimination and require employers to show that pay differences are job-related, not sex-based, and are governed not by bias, but by business necessity. Employers would be barred from retaliating against workers who inquire about their employers’ wage practices or disclose their own wages, the bill’s champions say. Obama has already signed an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against employees who choose to discuss their compensation, and he continues to urge Congress to pass the bill. Opponents say the legislation misdiagnoses the problem. They question the data cited by its supporters, and they say passage of the bill could lead to more lawsuits and even jobs going overseas. The bill passed the House in January 2009 but stalled in the Senate. Opponents claim it has been brought back up this year as an election-year tactic by Democrats who want to paint Republicans as unsympathetic to women in the workforce. Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s campaign spokesman, told us that Perdue doesn’t support the bill because he believes the Equal Pay Act of 1963 makes clear that women and men are to be paid equal wages for equal work. ""They (the Nunn campaign) know David supports equal pay for equal work, which has been the law for over 50 years,"" Dickey said. ""This ad is just another example of Michelle Nunn trying to perpetuate a fraud on the people of Georgia on behalf of (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid and Barack Obama."" Nunn is on record as supporting the bill, which Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former chief economist with the U.S. Department of Labor in the George W. Bush administration, told us appears at this point to be ""just a talking point."" ""If it didn’t pass in 2010 (when Democrats were in control), it’s not going to pass now,"" she said. Furchtgott-Roth, now director of Economics21 at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a New York-based, free-market think tank, said there have been concerns that the bill is ""really a full-employment act for trial lawyers."" She cited, for example, a provision of the bill that would allow an employer found guilty of ""so-called discrimination"" to be liable for punitive damages, instead of just back pay. Furchtgott-Roth said three current laws address the issue --  the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Civil Rights Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Democrats from Obama on down have emphasized the ""gender wage gap"" all this year. There’s always a debate over just how wide that gap is, though most people quote a 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report showing women’s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due, in part, to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Some rigorous economic studies have shown that women make about the same as men — 95 cents on a man's dollar when job, experience and hours of work are all comparable. Our Ruling The ad statement implies sweeping opposition by Perdue to laws giving women the right to collect equal pay for equal work. There’s no evidence of that. In fact, Perdue says he supports equal pay for equal work. The only thing the super PAC can point to is he’s against a single proposed law that supporters say would give women more power to fight back against discrimination. We rate the statement as Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2014/oct/02/georgians-together/nunn-camp-swings-wide-gender-pay-attack-ad/

Bruce Braley says he voted to 'give the president limited authority to begin strikes' against ISIS
","During this busy time for domestic and international news, the emergence of the Islamist militant group ISIS in Syria and Iraq -- and how the United States should respond -- is attracting much of the media’s attention. So it’s no surprise that the topic came up during an Iowa Senate debate between Democratic U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. Braley and Ernst are locked in a tight contest that could help decide control of the Senate. During the Sept. 28, 2014, debate, Braley said, ""I recently had the opportunity to vote to give the president limited authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria. ISIS is a threat that must be stopped, and any time American citizens are attacked by a terrorist group, they need to be brought to justice or to the grave. That's what's happening and that's what we'll continue to do."" So did he vote to give the president authority to begin strikes? Actually, no. On Sept. 17, less than two weeks before the debate, the House took two votes relevant to this question. The first was whether to attach an amendment -- one related to the situation in the Middle East -- to a broad spending bill. The House voted, 273-156, to attach the amendment to the bill. The second was on passage of the bill itself, including the amendment. The bill passed, 319-108. In both cases, Braley voted in favor, along with a bipartisan majority. However, in the debate, Braley misstated what he was voting on. Here’s the relevant text from the amendment that passed along with the rest of the spending bill: ""The Secretary of Defense is authorized, in coordination with the Secretary of State, to provide assistance, including training, equipment, supplies, and sustainment, to appropriately vetted elements of the Syrian opposition and other appropriately vetted Syrian groups and individuals. … Nothing in this section shall be construed to constitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein hostilities are clearly indicated by the circumstances."" In other words, this legislative language is all about the United States providing training and supplies to the Syrian rebels -- not about authorizing the president ""to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria."" ""I don’t see how Rep. Braley’s remarks can be construed as accurate at all,"" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. ""He did not vote to use U.S. forces to strike targets in Iraq or Syria. All he voted for was the authorization to arm, train, and equip elements of the Syrian opposition to fight ISIS."" Indeed, President Barack Obama has indicated so far that he doesn’t need congressional approval for strikes. Obama has been ordering airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks, claiming authorization under the Authorization for Use of Military Force that Congress passed in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks. Congress approved that authorization years before Braley entered Congress. In recent weeks, the White House hasn’t pushed hard for new, specific authorization for striking ISIS, and while some individual lawmakers have urged Congress to debate passage of a new authorization, congressional leaders have been content to let Obama take the lead. When we contacted Braley’s campaign staff, they offered a few points of additional context. One is that the moderator and Ernst followed up Braley’s comments without challenging his wording. The moderator followed Braley by saying, ""Ms. Ernst, just to follow up, would you have voted as Congressman Braley did to allow that attack to go forward?"" She responded, ""Yes, I would have supported that vote also."" In a similar vein, the campaign noted that Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., seemed to indicate during floor debate that ""this proposal strictly limits the use of United States ground forces in the region. ... Any airstrikes or aid would come at no additional cost to our country."" In the debate, Braley ""clearly spoke of his vote in Congress to facilitate strikes against ISIS in Syria by training and equipping Syrian rebels, and Joni Ernst agreed that Braley was right to have taken that vote,"" Braley spokesman Sam Lau told PolitiFact. But while these are points worth noting, what this ultimately means is that the other speakers were just as misinformed (or distracted) as Braley was about what the legislation actually said. Finally, the campaign pointed to the statement Obama made on Sept. 18 after the authorization passed Congress. (Obama signed it into law the next day.) Braley’s camp suggested that Obama was indicating that what Congress passed was meant to lead to strikes to push back against terrorists. But that’s not how we read Obama’s comments. In the statement in question, Obama was careful to frame the legislation narrowly. He talked quite specifically about a ""plan to train and equip the opposition in Syria so they can help push back these terrorists. … With this new effort, we’ll provide training and equipment to help them grow stronger and take on ISIL terrorists inside Syria. … The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission; their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. As I told our troops yesterday, we can join with allies and partners to destroy ISIL without American troops fighting another ground war in the Middle East."" Our ruling Braley said, ""I recently had the opportunity to vote to give the president limited authority to begin strikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria."" Braley did cast votes recently on U.S. policy in Syria and Iraq, but they concerned supplying and assisting the Syrian rebels -- not whether to give the president the authority to launch strikes. Some have even criticized Congress for not directly voting to authorize strikes. We rate Braley's claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/01/bruce-braley/bruce-braley-says-he-give-president-limited-author/

'New York Post' op-ed rebuts starving children claim that was never made
","September was an unusual month for the people who focus on whether Americans are getting enough food to keep them healthy. Early in the month, a Wall Street Journal contributor took the federal government to task for ""distorting"" the numbers on food insecurity. At the end of September, the New York Post carried an op-ed with the headline, Feeding America: ‘Public service' lies. Feeding America is a large nonprofit that raises money and secures food donations on behalf of food banks nationwide. The Post op-ed written by William Benson Huber zeroed in on the organization’s message in its public service announcements. Huber opened his op-ed with a quote from a radio ad, ""People say I’m a pretty good kid. Why, in a country as rich as America, should I have to go to bed hungry?"" The ads, writes Huber, ""inform us of a horror we’d otherwise think impossible: America has so failed its children that 17 million — one in five — don’t have enough to eat. Except that, enjoyable as all this self-loathing might seem, it’s simply a fairy tale."" Huber, who is a marketing consultant and not a full-time Post employee, then challenged Feeding America’s ""nonsensical claim that one in five kids is fighting starvation daily."" ""The only basis for Feeding America’s claim comes from U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys in which heads of households were asked if at any time during a calendar year their children were a) unable to eat what they wanted; b) unable to eat in whatever quantity they wanted; c) forced to eat cheaper brands, or d) afraid their food supply might run out on any single day."" In this fact-check, we focus on Huber’s statement that Feeding America misled the public when it said that ""one in five kids is fighting starvation daily."" As it turns out, we can find no evidence that Feeding America ever made that claim. We asked Huber, and he backed away from it. ""The words they use about going to bed hungry seems to me to be starving,"" Huber said. ""I applied that word to their language."" Feeding America spokesman Ross Fraser told PunditFact that his organization is very careful with its language, and it never speaks of kids starving. ""We say ‘facing hunger,’ or ‘at risk of hunger,’ or ‘on the precipice of hunger,’ "" Fraser said. ""Because the federal government’s data is not about hunger. It’s about food insecurity."" We’ll get into the federal data in just a bit, but beyond denying that Feeding America speaks of starvation, Fraser also denied that his group ever used the line about kids going to bed hungry. ""We don’t have any public service announcements that use that,"" Fraser said. Ellyn Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Ad Council, the corporate-backed nonprofit that distributes the announcements, was equally emphatic. ""I have confirmed that we have never used the line you are referring to in a PSA,"" Fisher said. The radio and video segments we found on the Ad Council website did not contain the language Huber cited. Huber said he wrote it down but he was not able to provide any further proof. Our search of the Internet Archive, a massive compendium of audio, video and text posted on the Internet, also came up empty. Huber also named two celebrity spokeswomen for Feeding America, Paula Deen and Beyonce, that the organization said had not been part of its public service efforts. Huber later told us that Deen had done some work for New York food banks, but that, ""strictly speaking I don't know if she had an audio PSA."" Further, Huber acknowledged that in order to shorten the piece, he paraphrased the questions he drew from the Agriculture Department’s survey. Here are the actual statements and questions put to families: 1. ""We relied on only a few kinds of low-cost food to feed our children because we were running out of money to buy food."" Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 2. ""We couldn’t feed our children a balanced meal, because we couldn’t afford that."" Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 3. ""The children were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food."" Was that often, sometimes, or never true for you in the last 12 months? 4. In the last 12 months, did you ever cut the size of any of the children’s meals because there wasn’t enough money for food? 5. In the last 12 months, were the children ever hungry but you just couldn’t afford more food? 6. In the last 12 months, did any of the children ever skip a meal because there wasn’t enough money for food? 7. (If yes to question 6) How often did this happen—almost every month, some months but not every month, or in only 1 or 2 months? 8. In the last 12 months did any of the children ever not eat for a whole day because there wasn’t enough money for food? Number of children facing hunger To the casual reader, Feeding America’s claim that one in five children faces hunger might sound as though one in five kids actually goes hungry. The organization provides a more nuanced view on its website, and we wanted to lay out the numbers here. The summaries all go back to those USDA questions. The Agriculture Department staff told us that they order these questions by the severity of the situation they describe. The fifth question, about the children being hungry because of a lack of money, triggers the department's most worrisome category of ""very low food security."" In the latest survey, about 765,000, or 1 percent of all children, lived in families where the answer was ""yes."" The government uses the less severe category, ""low food security,"" for children who live in families where, at the very least, a lack of money meant the kids couldn’t get a balanced meal during the last 12 months. The number of children in that group, plus the very low security group, is about 8.5 million, or about 11.7 percent of all children. The most commonly heard statistic, that one in five children live in food insecure households, refers to the 15.7 million kids that live in families in which, at the very least, anyone in the household of any age couldn’t afford a balanced meal at some point during the year. This includes adults and children. Deborah Frank, a pediatrician at the Boston University School of Medicine and member of the National Commission on Hunger, said many studies show that simply living in a low food security household is enough to undercut a child’s well being. ""The hurt can be lasting, Frank said. ""If it cuts into how much kids learn, if it makes them less healthy, and how healthy a baby they have, these are all ways that children are hurt by not having enough of the right kinds of food."" Frank and Feeding America noted that the problem in America is less about children having enough calories, and more about the nutritional quality of the food they eat. Our ruling Huber said that Feeding America was lying when it said kids were starving in America. Huber acknowledged that ""starving"" was his word, not the nonprofit’s. The sentence about children ""going to bed hungry"" was essential to Huber’s argument, but we could find no evidence that Feeding America ever used that phrase. Feeding America also denied using that phrase. While Huber insisted it was accurate, he was unable to provide any evidence.  One of the principles of PunditFact is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. Huber has none. As such, we rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/oct/01/william-benson-huber/ny-post-op-ed-rebuts-starving-children-claim-was-n/

Scary NRA ad claims Mary Landrieu voted to take away gun rights
","The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun lobbying group, is targeting a handful of Democrats in close Senate races with one of the most provocative — if not downright scary —  ads of the campaign season. Let’s set the scene: A young mother puts to bed her infant child and receives a text, presumably from her husband, letting her know his plane landed. ""Love you. Good night,"" she texts back. Suddenly, an ominous shadow is outside a window and a figure busts into the front door. Cut to a scene with police tape outside the home, suggesting tragedy. ""It happens like that,"" a narrator says. ""The police can’t get there in time. How you defend yourself is up to you. It’s your choice. But Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights."" Replace Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., with Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and you get the ad running in Colorado. How do we get from a vote in Congress to an intruder barreling through a poor woman’s front door? It’s far from a straight line. The NRA’s first justification When the Washington Post Fact Checker looked at this question, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pegged Landrieu’s vote ""to take away your gun rights"" to her support of the Toomey-Manchin proposal (named after its sponsors, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.). That proposal, which failed 54 to 46 in April 2013, did not ban the sale of any firearms. Its most significant provision would have expanded federal background checks already in place to firearm purchases made at gun shows and over the Internet. You could still buy a weapon from a family member or friend without a background check. The Fact Checker concluded that it’s hard to envision a situation in which Toomey-Manchin would have prevented a woman from being able to defend herself against an intruder. Assuming the woman in the ad was legally eligible to purchase a firearm (meaning she doesn’t have a criminal record), she would not have any trouble owning a gun in her home — even if Toomey-Manchin passed. The Fact Checker gave the claim Four Pinocchios, its harshest rating. The NRA’s second justification By the time PolitiFact inquired, the NRA offered different evidence as support for its claim. The group told PolitiFact that its claim stems from Landrieu’s vote to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009, a pick the NRA opposed. ""Landrieu voted to confirm at least one anti-gun and anti-self defense (Supreme Court) justice,"" said NRA spokesman Arulanandam. ""Anti-self defense is life or death."" During Sotomayor’s nomination proceedings, her past ruling on a Second Amendment issue became a talking point for Republicans who were critical of President Barack Obama’s choice. While on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District, Sotomayor was part of a three-member panel that reviewed a lower court ruling in Maloney vs. Cuomo. At issue was whether New York could ban the chuka stick (commonly called nunchucks, a weapon with two sticks connected by a chain or rope). Sotomayor was part of a majority opinion that ruled the New York statute legal. The Second Amendment applies to federal laws but not state laws, they wrote, citing an 1886 Supreme Court decision. During her confirmation testimony, Sotomayor reasoned that the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on whether its decision in Heller vs. District of Columbia — which overturned the federal capital’s handgun ban — applied to all cities and states. So, Sotomayor said, she was applying the precedent as it was understood at that point. Several Republican senators cited this case as reason to vote against Sotomayor’s nomination. (Worth noting, Landrieu actually supported the court’s decision in Heller to overturn the D.C. handgun ban and signed onto a letter from Sen. Kay Hutchison, R-Texas, to codify the Supreme Court’s ruling.) The Supreme Court eventually ruled, by a 5-4 margin in 2010, to strike down Chicago’s ban against owning a handgun in the home. This effectively applied the Heller ruling to all local governments. Sotomayor, by then on the Supreme Court, signed on to a minority opinion that argued the Second Amendment did not prohibit local governments from regulating firearms or banning certain weapons in the home. No other major gun issues have come before the Supreme Court during Sotomayor’s time. In fact, it has turned down requests to review the right to have a handgun outside the home, said Amy Howe, editor of the popular Supreme Court analysis website SCOTUSblog. Problems with the second justification So how convincing is the Sotomayor argument? It has some considerable holes. For starters, it’s a slippery slope to claim that a vote for a Supreme Court justice is a vote ""to take away your gun rights."" To use the same logic, was a vote to confirm President George W. Bush’s nomination of John Roberts also a vote for the Affordable Care Act just because he ruled to uphold the individual mandate? Was a vote for Justice Anthony Kennedy — the justice appointed by President Ronald Reagan who became the swing vote in the case that effectively ended California’s same-sex marriage ban — a vote to legalize same-sex marriage? In other words, no one can tell in advance how justices will eventually vote on issues that come before the court. Justices appointed by Republicans can surprise and take what would be considered the liberal position in a case, and vice versa. We will also note that Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., joined seven of their Republicans to confirm Sotomayor’s nomination. Yet the NRA gave them each an A- rating for their votes on gun issues and endorsed them for reelection this year. So this is either selective memory or the NRA applying its own logic differently to candidates. As for Landrieu, her campaign said she has supported pro-gun measures over the years, including a proposal that requires states to recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states. She also voted against an assault weapons ban supported by the White House in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The NRA also opposed the measure. Our ruling The NRA ad claims, ""Mary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights."" This is quite a leap in logic. After initially staking its claim to a background check bill that didn’t pass Congress — nor did it ""take away your gun rights,"" leaving women defenseless in their homes — the group now pins its claim on Landrieu’s vote to confirm Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. But that’s questionable, since there is no way to know in advance how a justice will vote. And the NRA has endorsed two other senators, Graham and Alexander, who cast exactly the same vote. Meanwhile, on the other major gun vote of this term, a key assault-weapons ban, Landrieu voted the NRA’s position. Given all this, to run an ad as scary as this one can only be described as fear mongering. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/oct/01/national-rifle-association/scary-nra-ad-claims-mary-landrieu-voted-take-away-/

Steve Southerland voted to extend the 2013 government shutdown, Gwen Graham says
","After a barrage of fighting words from incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, Democratic congressional hopeful Gwen Graham has come back swinging in the tight race to represent a northern Florida district. First, Southerland called Graham a ""Washington lobbyist,"" an attack that focused on what the just-out-of-law-school attorney was doing 25 years ago. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Now the daughter of Bob Graham, the former governor and U.S. senator, has dug into the first-term congressman’s voting record and accused him of being obstructionist. ""Believe me, I can handle Congressman Southerland’s campaign of lies and put-downs,"" Graham said in a recent television commercial. ""But his vote for the government shutdown? Now, that’s a problem. He cost taxpayers $24 billion. His shutdown hurt businesses and families, seniors and even our veterans. And when both parties finally got together to fix it, Congressman Southerland voted to keep the shutdown going."" Graham’s mention of the shutdown refers to the battle between Oct. 1, 2013, and Oct. 16, 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to fund President Barack Obama’s health care law and Obama refused to sign spending bills unless they included funding for the law. With the two sides in deadlock for more than two weeks, annual spending bills did not move through Congress and to the president’s desk. Without money to fund its operations, the federal government reduced its activities to those of protecting lives and property; many federal workers were furloughed, and many federal services were dormant. Democrats have tried to blame the GOP for the shutdown, with some success. But is Graham correct that Southerland tried to keep the unpopular gridlock going even when his Capitol Hill cohorts tried to compromise? The short answer: Basically, yes. Shutdown showdown During the runup to the shutdown, the GOP-led House, stacked with tea party-backed junior representatives like Southerland, strategized to ""defund Obamacare"" -- that is, not pass any spending bill that gave money for the president’s signature health care legislation. The battle was joined in earnest on Sept. 20, when the House voted, 230-189, to raise the nation’s $16.7 trillion debt limit only if Affordable Care Act funding was stripped out of the spending bill. Southerland released a statement that day reading, ""I do not want to see a government shutdown."" He called the vote ""a decisive step forward in our fight to ensure that the federal government is properly funded"" while ensuring ""our nation’s credit rating will be protected, while moving one step closer to a permanent delay and dismantling of government-run health care."" He then went on to vote for three House bills stripped of Obamacare funding prior to Oct. 1, which his campaign manager Luke Strickland said was proof Southerland ""didn't support and didn't vote for the government shutdown."" It was well-known that the Democratic-held Senate would not accept such a bill sent from the House, and the bills went nowhere. Negotiations broke down and on Sept. 30, the federal government was shuttered. The House made several attempts to pass spending measures with similar provisions against Obamacare, but they continued to get bounced by the Senate. (Southerland, like most of his Republican colleagues, repeatedly approved these attempts.) Finally, after 16 days, the Senate passed a spending bill that raised the debt ceiling and funded the government through Jan. 15, 2014, by a bipartisan vote of 81-18. (Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was one of the Republican’s in the nay column; when he tried to say he voted to fully fund the government, we ruled the claim Mostly False.) The House soon relented, voting 285-144 for H.R. 2775, with 87 Republicans in support.  But the key to checking Graham’s claim is that Southerland did not cross the aisle. Had enough additional Republicans joined him in voting no, the shutdown would have continued. Southerland’s campaign manager noted that while the lawmaker voted for several measures to fund essential services and to create the working group that focused on finding a compromise, his convictions led him to vote against the bipartisan bill that ended the stalemate. ""After all of the uncertainty caused by the shutdown, Steve believed we needed a long-term solution that addressed the root causes of the crisis, not another stopgap that could have put us right back in the same boat months down the road,"" Strickland told PolitiFact Florida. It’s not like Southerland’s ashamed of his anti-Obamacare position. His online House profile boasts that he has voted to ""to repeal, replace, and defund Obamacare over forty times."" He did speak about the vote after H.R. 2775 passed and the government reopened. He said he ""fought tooth and nail from day one to avert a shutdown"" and blamed the Senate for rejecting the House spending bills. Southerland said the end result wasn’t something he could stomach, but he didn’t mention the looming specter of default that overshadowed the faceoff. ""I had no choice but to oppose (Senate Majority Leader Harry) Reid’s bill because it provides short-term spending without addressing the long-term drivers of this shutdown, including an exploding national debt and glaring inequalities under the president’s health care law,"" Southerland said. (For the record, the bill was hammered out by Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and the Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.) ""I simply can’t justify to my constituents a system where corporations and labor unions deserve a one-year compliance delay and government officials get special premium subsidies while average American families receive neither,"" Southerland continued. ""I hope both parties in Washington learned a lesson from this shutdown and we get serious about addressing these issues before again bringing the nation to the brink."" Our ruling Graham said Southerland ""voted to keep the shutdown going."" The ad refers to an Oct. 16, 2013, no vote Southerland cast against a bipartisan Senate bill that funded the government and ended the shutdown. By the time it reached the House floor, it was clear to lawmakers that their vote would effectively be deciding whether to end the shutdown or not. If more Republicans had joined Southerland in voting no, the shutdown would have continued. Regardless of Southerland’s personal feelings about a shutdown, Graham is focusing her attack on his vote -- and his vote was a clear ""no"" to ending the shutdown. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/01/gwen-graham/steve-southerland-voted-extend-2013-government-shu/
