Dewhurst claim misses on his annually being the No. 1 pick of Texas law enforcement agencies
","In a Dallas-area call on behalf of a jailed niece, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Texas law enforcement agencies consistently rank him fairest of them all. In his Aug. 3, 2013, call to the Allen Police Department, a recording of which was later released in response to a request from NBC 5, KXAS-TV, Dewhurst inquired into what he needed to do to hasten the release of Ellen Bevers, described in the station’s news report as a schoolteacher detained for allegedly shoplifting at a grocery store. His call did not yield special treatment; Bevers was released after posting bond the next day, according to an Aug. 22, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. But critics including Dewhurst challengers in the 2014 Republican primary charged him with trying to throw his weight around. Readers zeroed in on a curious Dewhurst claim. ""Sergeant, you don't know me,"" Dewhurst is heard saying on the police call, ""but I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas."" First and foremost? Agencies do not rank officeholders, we found, though law officer associations make candidate endorsements as do other advocacy groups with an interest in what happens in government. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed out that Dewhurst was endorsed by several officer groups in his 2006 re-election race and in his 2012 U.S. Senate race. Also, Considine noted, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas deemed Dewhurst its Texas Crime Fighter of the Year in 2003, his first year in what many consider the state’s most powerful post. A Nov. 24, 2003, association press release credits Dewhurst with steering reforms in drunken-driving laws and helping on other measures. CLEAT spokesman Charlie Wilkison is quoted describing Dewhurst as a ""real friend"" to the state’s law enforcement community. By telephone, Wilkison, poised to become the group’s executive director, told us that in 2012 the association gave Dewhurst a lifetime achievement award thanks to his consistent support over the years. Especially notable, Wilkison said, Dewhurst has repeatedly volunteered to keynote a biennial Texas Capitol ceremony honoring fallen officers at which he comforts survivors including children, one by one. Wilkison said he believes that in the call to the police department, Dewhurst meant to say he was No. 1 with law enforcement groups, instead making a common semantic mistake by saying ""agencies."" Like representatives of other law enforcement advocacy groups that have supported Dewhurst in elections, Wilkison agreed that agencies do not rank officeholders; the agencies are supposed to be politically disinterested. Kevin Lawrence, executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association, another influential group, said by phone that it has enjoyed a great relationship with Dewhurst. ""Law enforcement agencies have no business endorsing candidates,"" Lawrence said, and while associations or unions make candidate endorsements, they do not pick one officeholder over another--assigning ranks, that is--unless the officeholders face each other on the ballot. ""Associations don’t sit around saying who is our favorite politician,"" Lawrence said. Gary Chandler, a Department of Public Safety sergeant and president of the DPS Officers Association, later said by phone: ""We don’t rank the government officials or public officials,"" instead focusing on trooper salaries and benefits. Then again, Chandler said: ""As government works, the lieutenant governor of Texas is a very powerful person. We have worked with David Dewhurst the last three"" legislative ""sessions at least."" He said that personally, Dewhurst ""has been my No. 1 guy,"" though every legislator ""is important to us when it comes to accomplishing our goals… I wouldn’t mind calling them all No. 1 at some point."" Lacking any sign of agencies ranking officeholders, we turned back to Considine, who said the cited endorsements demonstrate Dewhurst's appeal to law enforcement organizations. Our ruling Dewhurst said  that ""every year, I'm the No.1 pick of all the law enforcement agencies in Texas."" This declaration falters in substantive ways. Law enforcement agencies do not rank elected officials against one another in any way. Nor do law enforcement advocacy groups, though Dewhurst has drawn multiple re-election endorsements. Then again, such endorsements do not occur every year. The election for lieutenant governor occurs every four years. We rate this claim as False. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Rene Garcia calls Miami-Dade the 'No. 1 donor county' in Florida
","When politicians gathered in August for the Florida Cabinet meeting in Miami, Sen. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, had a message about how the state treats Miami-Dade County, which we could boil down to this: No fair! In his welcome to Gov. Rick Scott and the Cabinet, Garcia said that Miami-Dade is the ""No. 1 donor county in the state."" In government-speak, a ""donor county"" is a county that gives more revenues to the state than it receives. (Fussing about being a donor county is a common refrain  we’ve heard about Miami-Dade -- as well as about Broward and Palm Beach.) Is Miami-Dade the chief Santa Claus of Florida, sending generous gifts to the state and only getting back stocking stuffers in return? Garcia points to sales taxes We asked Garcia for documentation to support his claim. A legislative aide sent us a chart showing sales taxes collected in 2012-13. Miami-Dade collected the highest amount of sales taxes -- $2.6 billion -- while Orange County was second with $2.2 billion. But county-by-county sales tax comparisons aren’t a perfect indicator of what residents in a county contribute, for a variety of reasons. For starters, in some counties -- including Miami-Dade and Orange -- a portion of those sales taxes are paid by tourists. Visit Florida estimates that in 2012 tourists generated 23 percent of the state's sales tax revenue, while the state’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research estimates the figure at 13-15 percent. ""Every county is different and has special circumstances that affect sales tax collections,"" wrote Lily Oliveros, Garcia’s legislative aide, in an email. ""Residents of some small counties do a lot of shopping in adjacent larger counties; that does not mean that those residents are not paying their fair share of taxes."" We asked Garcia if he had additional data to support his claim and he told us ""it has been very difficult to get an accurate accounting of money going out and coming back in to each county."" There are two ways that a reader could have interpreted Garcia’s claim that Miami-Dade is the ""No. 1 donor county in the state."" It’s possible to interpret that to mean most tax revenues contributed, or to mean the imbalance between what the county gives and what it gets back. We sought some clarity from Garcia. ""I was referring to size of our population,"" he said. ""This will however be a great case study to look at next session."" The problems with trying to rank counties Two key experts on Florida’s budget -- Amy Baker, the state’s chief economist and Kurt Wenner, an expert at Florida TaxWatch -- told us they have never reached a conclusion as to which counties give more in tax revenues than they get back from the state. Both cited several problems with attempting to create such a ranking. Some tax data isn’t available by county: for example corporate income taxes. And on the spending side, some state infrastructure projects benefit more than one county. ""To apply the ‘donor’ label, you would have to know the complete dollar value of both sides of the equation, and that information isn’t readily available on a definitive basis,"" Baker said. Wenner pointed to another problematic example: a college in a county getting state money that benefits students from more than one county. ""Counties aren’t their own little fiefdoms,"" Wenner said. ""There are not walls around them. It’s hard to allocate spending and revenue to a particular county and do it well. There’s a lot of blurred lines."" And despite the cries about being a donor county, Miami-Dade legislators have a good record of bringing home the bacon, or as Florida TaxWatch calls it, turkeys. The county had the largest number of projects that Florida TaxWatch labeled turkeys for the 2013 session. In 2008, the Miami Herald spent three months quantifying the amount that Miami-Dade and Broward counties sent in taxes and fees to the state and how much the counties get back. Reporter Gary Fineout (now with the Associated Press) examined sales-tax revenues, documentary taxes, gas taxes, health care assessments, intangible taxes, insurance and utility taxes, slot machine revenues, and lottery sales. Not all tax revenues were available for a breakdown by county -- for example the cigarette and utilities tax, so the Herald came up with an estimate. Then the Herald calculated spending on education, healthcare, transportation, criminal justice, salaries of public institutions and some general-fund expenditures. Some spending was omitted since it was difficult to assign a county -- for example, how do you account for a prison in northern Florida that houses many inmates from South Florida. The conclusion: In 2007, the two counties sent at least $7.15 billion to the state, while the state government spent about $6.69 billion on them. (The article didn’t rank all counties in the state.) Then House Speaker Marco Rubio, now Florida’s Republican U.S. senator, told the Herald at the time that it was simplistic to suggest that his county Miami-Dade was getting ""run over by other parts of the state,"" because many parts of the budget are driven by formulas based on population. For example, Miami-Dade received about $2.4 billion for K-12 education in 2013-14 through the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), which includes state and local education funds. The school district is the largest in the state and not surprisingly received the highest total. Total reimbursements to Medicaid providers were higher in Miami-Dade County -- $3.5 billion -- than any other county in Florida in 2011-12. That money is a combination of state, federal and local dollars, said Shelisha Coleman, a spokeswoman for the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. Our ruling Garcia said that Miami-Dade County is the ""No. 1 donor county in the state."" Garcia points to Miami-Dade contributing the most in sales taxes to the state. This isn’t surprising, though, since it is the largest county and a big tourism market. But budget experts warned us that it is difficult to create a ledger with spending and revenues and assign all those dollars to particular counties. Also, some money received by the county is based on a population formula and some revenues sent to the state are from tourists, not resident taxpayers. So far, we have seen no proof that Miami-Dade earns that top donor label spot, nor can we name any other county. At PolitiFact we believe the burden of proof is on the person making the statement and Garcia hasn’t done that here. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Twitter, Tweet by Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo quoting Sen.

Lawmaker uses tax credit scam to drive support for bill
","A Georgia congressman unveiled some disturbing details to bolster support for a bill he recently filed to stop illegal immigrants from receiving child tax credit refunds. ""What has happened is that illegal aliens have been given the right to claim a child tax credit, and it's so bad that one guy in Indianapolis was discovered he had claimed 20 children and 19 of them lived back in Mexico — a cost of $29,000 a year to taxpayers,"" said U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah who is running for a U.S. Senate seat. Sound outrageous? PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether this is true? Did an Indianapolis man collect $29,000 from the federal government in tax credits for 19 children who live in Mexico? Kingston made the comments during an Aug. 1 interview with Newsmax TV, a conservative-leaning website. He has repeated the claim on his congressional website. The details we found showed some clarity is necessary in this case. On July 22, Kingston filed the bill, House Resolution 2278, in the House of Representatives. The legislation would require a parent or guardian to put a child’s name and other information on an income tax return to get the tax credit. The legislation was co-sponsored by 13 other House members, including Georgia Republicans Paul Broun (who is also running for the U.S. Senate) and Lynn Westmoreland. Kingston’s resolution was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. The Internal Revenue Service allows as much as $1,000 in tax credits for each child, depending upon the parent’s or guardian’s income. Currently, those child caregivers can submit their Social Security number or an individual tax identification number to get a credit. A nine-digit number issued by the IRS allows U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants to file tax returns. In September 2011, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Inspector General Office filed a report that the federal government paid $4.2 billion in 2010 to illegal immigrants who collected child tax credits. The Treasury Inspector General said in a news release that accompanied the report that the IRS and the Treasury Department need to clarify whether illegal immigrants should receive the credits. Kingston noted the report on his website. ""An investigative reporter in Indianapolis, IN recently uncovered cases in which illegal immigrants were claiming the credit for relatives who did not even live in the United States,"" Kingston wrote. ""One illegal immigrant interviewed admitted to claiming 20 children and collecting returns totaling $29,608. In reality only one child was observed to live at the residence while 19 others lived in Mexico and had never visited the United States."" In 2012, Indianapolis television station WTHR aired an investigative report on illegal immigrants in that area receiving child tax credits. The reporter interviewed a man who said four illegal immigrants were using his address to file tax returns. ""His address is being used to file tax returns by four undocumented workers who don’t even live here,"" the reporter said. ""And what’s more? Those four claimed 20 children live inside this trailer home in Southern Indiana. And as a result, the IRS sent the illegal immigrants tax refunds totaling $29,608."" WTHR’s story has been cited in several emails by people outraged by what the station reported. ""This tax loophole dips right into YOUR pocket defrauding you ….. The honest taxpayer,"" according to one email with a weblink to the WTHR story that was posted on FactCheck.org. The reporter, Bob Segall, told PolitiFact Georgia that two of the four illegal immigrants who used the address were siblings of the man who lived there. The other two were friends. Segall said he was unaware of any other reports that one illegal immigrant in the Indianapolis area received more than $29,000 in child tax credits. A Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a telephone call and email seeking comment. Chris Crawford, a spokesman for Kingston, offered us an explanation via email. ""[H]is intent is clear here. This is an absolute waste of precious taxpayer resources that must be stopped whether it is one person or 100,"" Crawford said. ""For the IRS to not only know but to have been repeatedly warned about this problem is absolutely outrageous."" To sum up, Kingston said one illegal immigrant admitted claiming 20 children for child tax credits, although 19 of them lived in Mexico. The person, he said, received refunds totaling $29,608. Our findings showed that the congressman’s claim, made on his congressional website and in a television interview, was not entirely correct. Kingston’s dollar figure was accurate. But four illegal immigrants -- not one -- used someone’s address to collect money for the tax credits. We rate Kingston’s claim Mostly True.","[('Newsmax, ""Rep.

Michael Bloomberg says New York is safest big city in United States
","Following a federal court decision rebuking New York City’s ""stop-and-frisk"" policy as racially discriminatory, Mayor Michael Bloomberg penned a Washington Post op-ed titled, ""‘Stop and frisk’ is not racial profiling."" He began the op-ed with a strong defense of the policy -- namely, that it works. ""New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city’s,"" Bloomberg wrote. He said the improvements are due in large part to the policy, in which police officers stop and search people they suspect might be involved in criminal activity. We won’t address the wisdom of the policy, which is the focus of intense debate. Instead, we’ll look at the question of whether ""New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city’s."" The numbers: Is New York the safest big city? We turned to the most recent full-year data from the FBI, which used 2011 figures. Since a previous NYPD news release had compared New York City to both the 10 biggest cities and the 25 biggest cities, we will use those parameters here as well. In the charts below, violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter; forcible rape; robbery; and aggravated assault. Property crimes include burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicle theft. The following chart lists the 25 largest cities in America, in descending order by population. The last two columns show where the city ranks by crime rate, with 1 being the lowest crime rate.

The numbers: A steeper crime reduction than any other big city? The FBI website has comparable crime data going back to 1995, so we looked at the change in each of these cities between 1995 and 2011. Once again, we list the 25 largest cities in America, in descending order by population. The last two columns show where the city ranks by reduction in the total crime rate between 1995 and 2011, with 1 being the biggest reduction in the crime rate.   City Total crime rate per 100,000 pop., 1995 Total crime rate per 100,000 pop., 2011 Percent increase or decrease, 1995-2011 Rank by biggest crime decrease among 10 biggest cities Rank by biggest crime decrease among 25 biggest cities New York 6,076 2,324 - 62 percent 2 2 Los Angeles 7,680 2,785 - 64 percent 1 1 Chicago NA NA NA -- -- Houston 7,588 6,024 - 21 percent 9 22 Philadelphia 7,078 5,069 - 28 percent 8 19 Phoenix     10,880 4,937 - 55 percent 3 5 San Antonio 7,994 6,465 - 19 percent 10 23 San Diego 5,548 2,625 - 53 percent 4 8 Dallas 9,464 5,738 - 39 percent 7 14 San Jose 4,387 2,602 - 41 percent 6 13 Jacksonville 9,001 4,987 - 45 percent 5 11 Indianapolis 4,460 6,783 + 52 percent -- 24 Austin 8,132 5,572 - 31 percent -- 17 San Fran. 8,190 4,707 - 43 percent -- 12 Columbus 9,192 6,800 - 26 percent -- 20 Fort Worth 8,617 5,231 - 39 percent -- 14 Charlotte 9,576 4,899 - 49 percent -- 9 Detroit     1,1939 8,359 - 30 percent -- 18 El Paso 7,063 2,880 - 59 percent -- 3 Memphis 10,514 8,081 - 23 percent -- 21 Boston 9,493 3,951 - 58 percent -- 4 Seattle 10,482 5,712 - 46 percent -- 10 Denver 6,873 4,227 - 38 percent -- 15 Baltimore 13,323 6,248 - 53 percent -- 6 Washington 12,166 5,712 - 53 percent -- 6   By this measure, New York ranks second, by a narrow margin, to Los Angeles. Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for Bloomberg, said that New York does rank first if you go back to 1993, when the city introduced its data-based policing approach, and he cited a 2011 book by University of California-Berkeley law professor Franklin E. Zimring, The City that Became Safe: New York's Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control. We checked with Zimring, who agreed that Bloomberg is on safe ground with his claim. Zimring said the steepest declines occurred in the early 1990s and would not have been captured entirely in our data. New York City’s drop ""is the steepest ever for a major U.S. city with a credible statistics program,"" Zimring said. Are such comparisons valid? So, judging by the numbers, Bloomberg is on target. But is he justified in making a multi-city comparison, or is that just comparing apples to oranges? While everyone does it, experts say it can be a blunt measurement. The FBI -- the source of the statistics Bloomberg used -- is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Here are a few of the factors that the FBI and other experts cite: • No two cities are alike. Bloomberg’s preferred ranking consists of cities (which would not include separately incorporated suburbs) rather than metropolitan areas (which would include suburbs). In addition, New York includes the primarily suburban borough of Staten Island. • Crime reporting rates can vary by city. Whether due to police habits or citizens' actions, different cities may not have the same level of diligence in reporting crimes, especially for the most numerous type of violent crime (aggravated assault) and the most numerous type of property crime (larceny-theft). • Using total crime as the measurement mixes both violent and property crime. The method Bloomberg used counts every violent crime and property crime equally, so every murder is statistically equivalent to every car theft. Changing the category being calculated can make a big difference. In 2011, New York City had a better overall crime rate than Los Angeles, but New York had a higher violent crime rate -- 621 violent crimes per 100,000 population, compared to 524 for Los Angeles. Still, despite some concerns about Bloomberg’s use of the statistics in this way, the criminologists we checked with agreed that the mayor has something to crow about. ""One thing that is quite obvious is that almost every neighborhood in the five boroughs can be said to be on the way up, whereas cities like Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis have quite a few neighborhoods that can be termed dead or dying,"" said Eugene O’Donnell, criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, agreed. ""New York has done a great job,"" he said. ""But urban one-upmanship does no one any good. Whether they’re first, second or third in the nation is splitting hairs."" Our ruling Bloomberg said, ""New York is the safest big city in the nation, and our crime reductions have been steeper than any other big city’s."" Both the FBI and criminologists express concern about making this type of multi-city comparison, and other measures, such as violent crime, don’t put New York at the No. 1 slot. Still, the numbers do broadly back up his claim. We rate the claim Mostly True.","[('Michael Bloomberg, ""‘Stop and frisk’ is not racial profiling"" (Washington Post op-ed), Aug. 18, 2013.', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-keeps-new-york-safe/2013/08/18/8d4cd8c4-06cf-11e3-9259-e2aafe5a5f84_story.html'), ('New York Police Department, ""Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly Announce New York City Remains the Safest Big City in America According to FBI Uniform Crime Report"" (news release), Sept. 13, 2010', 'No link'), ('FBI, Crime in the United States, Table 8: Offenses Known to Law Enforcement by State and City, 2011', 'http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2010_nyc_safest_big_city.shtml'), ('FBI, Crime in the United States, 1995', 'No link'), ('Baruch College, ""Top 100 U.S. Cities ranked by Population, 2011 estimates""', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_by_state_by_city_2011.xls/view'), ('Government Technology, ""New York City Safest Big City in America, FBI Report Finds,"" June 9, 2008', 'No link'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Judge Rules NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Practice Violates Rights,"" Aug. 12, 2013', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/1995/95sec2.pdf'), ('Christian Science Monitor, ""Stop-and-frisk: NYC council overrides Bloomberg vetoes, curbing policy,"" Aug. 22, 2013', 'No link'), ('Time, ""Viewpoint: What NYPD Really Needs: Polite Police"" (column by Franklin E.

Cuccinelli overstates McAuliffe's role in Lincoln Bedroom scandal
","The Lincoln Bedroom in the White House looms in this year’s gubernatorial race. Within the history of the ornate chamber, Republican Ken Cuccinelli says, lies proof of Democrat Terry McAuliffe’s questionable ethics. ""He’s the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom,"" Cuccinelli said of his opponent during an Aug. 10 appearance before Northern Virginia business leaders. Cuccinelli is referring to details of a scandal that erupted in 1997 as Congress investigated charges that President Bill Clinton and McAuliffe masterminded a program that allowed top patrons of the Democratic Party to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom. McAuliffe, at the time, was finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee. We looked into the claim that the White House sleepovers were McAuliffe’s idea. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli, sent an email citing a variety of old news reports and copies of documents that she said prove ""the Lincoln Bedroom scandal originated from a McAuliffe memo."" So let’s travel back in time. On Dec. 27, 1994, McAuliffe had breakfast with Clinton in the White House.  A month earlier, mid-term elections established Republican majorities in the House for the first time in 40 years and in the Senate for the first time in eight years. McAuliffe wanted to come up with a plan to reconnect demoralized Democratic supporters with Clinton in preparation for the president’s reelection two years later. About a week after the meeting, McAuliffe sent a memo to Nancy Hernreich, Clinton’s director of Oval Office operations, suggesting the president meet party supporters at meals, coffees, golf games and morning jogs. McAuliffe also listed ten of the party’s ""top supporters."" In his 2009 book, ""What a Party,"" McAuliffe wrote that he thought there was ""nothing controversial"" about the memo. ""A candidate was going to spend time with his supporters. What a shocker that was,"" he wrote. ""I was careful how I worded the memo because the Clinton White House leaked like a sieve, and the only question in my mind was how many minutes it would take before a copy of this memo would be hand-delivered to The Washington Post. Little did I know that this would become the infamous Lincoln Bedroom Memo."" The one-page note became the focus a probe by congressional Republicans into fundraising at the Clinton White House. The memo did not propose that donors should stay overnight at the White House, but the prospect of sleepovers was mentioned in notes that were later scrawled on the front and back of the document. Hernreich said in a June 20, 1997, deposition to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that she wrote the word ""overnights"" on the front of the memo, next to the list of ten top supporters. ""I don’t honestly know if that was my idea or if it was the president’s idea and under what circumstances I wrote that,"" Hernreich said. Donald Bucklin, an attorney for the committee, asked Hernreich if the sleepovers idea could have come from any conversation she might have had with McAuliffe. ""If I indeed had that conversation with Terry -- I’m not certain I did -- but if I indeed had it, then it could have, although it just as well could not have come from him,"" Hernreich said. ""Honestly, I just don’t know, really."" On the back of the memo, Clinton wrote a note to Hernreich saying ""ready to start overnights right away."" McAuliffe told the committee in a June 6, 1997 deposition that he never got his memo back with the notes written on it. McAuliffe denied coming up with the idea for the overnights. But he acknowledged to Gus Puryear, an attorney for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, that the DNC recommended donors who should be invited to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom. Puryear: Did you ever personally propose that someone be included in an overnight stay at the White House? McAuliffe: ""Generally Gus, how this would happen is someone may call and say they’d like to do it. I would have turned it over to (DNC staffers), and they probably would have sent it to the political office. There were many recommendations, I believe, from many people."" Puryear: ""Do you remember any person that you recommended?"" McAuliffe: ""I cannot, no, but I’m not saying they didn’t call my office. I take a lot of pride in what I did and how I did it. I was not a concierge service."" So who came up with idea for the sleepovers? Clinton, in a February 1997 deposition, said it was his brainchild. ""Terry McAuliffe sent a memo suggesting things we ought to do to re-establish contact, which I thought was a good memo. And I told him to proceed,"" Clinton said, according to a Feb. 27, 1997, New York Times reprint of his remarks. ""And I told Nancy Hernreich in addition to that that I wanted to ask some of my friends who had helped me when I got elected President, that I hadn’t been in touch with, to come to the White House and spend the night with me."" Clinton maintained the White House overnights were not intended to rev up donations, saying ""the Lincoln Bedroom was never sold."" But the GOP investigation concluded the stays were ""an important means by which the DNC raised funds from contributors."" It pointed to a White House document that listed 51 ""long-time friends"" who stayed overnight. Forty-nine of those people, the GOP said, contributed a total of $4.1 million to the DNC for the 1996 elections. Democratic members, in their own findings said that ""the committee found no evidence of a systematic scheme to trade overnight visits at the White House for campaign contributions."" Cuccinelli’s campaign, in backing its claim that McAuliffe came up with the sleepover plan, also directed us to an editorial in the Chicago Sun-Times on Sept. 7, 1999, that said McAuliffe is known in Washington as ""the guy who invented the idea of having President Clinton invite major campaign contributors to be lured and rewarded with sleepover nights in the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House."" The campaign also cited a Feb. 2, 2001, editorial in The New York Times that criticized McAuliffe for supporting Clinton’s fundraising schemes, calling him ""a walking symbol of the wretched excess of the Clinton years."" Our ruling Cuccinelli, in attacking McAuliffe’s ethics, says the Democrat is ""the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom."" McAuliffe authored a memo in early 1995 listing ways Clinton could connect with top Democratic patrons. But the original note did not mention White House sleepovers; that idea was later added in the handwriting of others. McAuliffe has always denied he came up with the scheme; Clinton in 1997 took full responsibility for the idea. No doubt, McAuliffe strongly backed the sleepovers and recommended heavy hitters that should be offered a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. But we see no evidence that McAuliffe ""invented the scheme."" We rate Cuccinelli’s statement False.","[('Ken Cuccinelli’s comments at governor’s forum, Aug. 10, 2013.', 'http://whitehouse.c-span.org/Video/ByRoom/Lincoln-Bedroom.aspx'), ('Cuccinelli for governor ""Terry McAuliffe ethics tutorial, Volume 2: The Lincoln Bedroom,"" July 12, 2013.', 'No link'), ('E-mails from Jahan Wilcox,spokesman for Cuccinelli for Governor, March 15, 2013.', 'https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/02/25/clinton.money/memo.lrg.gif'), ('E-mail from Brennan Bilberry , spokesman for McAuliffe for Governor, March 14, 2013.', 'No link'), ('E-mails from Katie Delacenserie, archivist with the U.S. Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, May 3, May 13 and May 15, 2013.', 'https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/02/25/clinton.money/'), ('Associated Press, ""McAuliffe, Cuccinelli swap venom at governor forum,"" Aug. 10, 2013.', 'No link'), ('Terry McAuliffe, ""What a Party,"" 2009, pages 103-105, 130-141.', 'https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/12/us/friendship-counts-clinton-s-top-fund-raiser-made-lots-for-himself-too.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm'), ('C-Span, ""The Lincoln Bedroom,"" accessed August 21, 2013.', 'No link'), ('Lincoln Bedroom memo, via CNN All Politics, Jan. 5, 1995.', 'http://www.motherjones.com/politics/1997/05/big-game-hunter'), ('U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, ""Investigation of the illegal or improper activities in connection with 1996 federal election campaigns,"" May 10, 1998.', 'No link'), ('Deposition of Terence R.

Mayor correct on state stadium spending limitations
","Plans to build a new $1 billion stadium in downtown Atlanta may sound like a project with limitless cash. But there are boundaries concerning what can be spent, according to a key player in the effort. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed recently took to the radio to discuss the fractured negotiations with Mount Vernon Baptist Church’s leaders to buy its property. The land on which that historic church sits is necessary to build the new sports facility on a preferred site. State officials have said they cannot offer any more than the highest appraised value it receives,  $6.2 million in this case. The church initially said a fair price is about $20 million. PolitiFact originally rated Reed’s claim False. But state Attorney General Sam Olens disagreed, saying the mayor was correct. Reed, too, asked us to rethink our rating. PolitiFact decided to do more digging and reconsider its original ruling, drawing in more expertise. (You can read the original fact-check by going to this link: http://www.politifact.com/georgia/kasim-reed-stadium/.) The mayor said the state, specifically the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which is in charge of negotiations with the church, can only offer a certain amount of money. Reed explained during an Aug. 7 interview with Sports Radio 680 The Fan. ""The state has some limitations on what they can pay above the appraised price. ... We’re not going to be able to pay Mount Vernon $19.5 million because of the constraints that the state has in what they can pay,"" Reed said on the station’s program ""The Front Row."" The mayor went into more detail about a minute later. ""State law says that once the state appraises a piece of property, they can only pay a certain amount above appraisal,"" Reed said. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the mayor is correct. Is the state limited on how far it can move the financial goal posts to strike a deal with the church? The Atlanta Falcons have been working with the city, the GWCCA and others on a deal to build a new stadium, replacing the Georgia Dome, which is owned by the state. The city would prefer to build the new stadium on land south of the Dome, in large part because of its accessibility to MARTA rail lines. In order to build on that site, the city would need land where two longtime churches stand, Friendship Baptist Church and Mount Vernon. The initial deadline to work out a deal with the churches was Aug. 1. Although the city struck a deal with Friendship, the GWCCA was unable to do so with Mount Vernon. Reed held a news conference Aug. 6 asking all involved to continue the discussions. The $6.2 million value is included in a two-page revised appraisal letter completed July 30 for the state. The letter provides an ""as-is"" value for the church. The letter lists the value for the church at $30 per square foot, or roughly $3.4 million for 113,000 square feet. An additional $2.8 million is included for parking revenue. Reed’s communications director, Sonji Jacobs, referred to language in the Georgia Constitution, known as the Gratuities Clause, to explain the mayor’s point. State Properties Commission spokeswoman Cindy Presto referenced the same language in the constitution -- Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VI(a) -- when we contacted the agency seeking help. It reads: ""Except as otherwise provided in the Constitution, (1) the General Assembly shall not have the power to grant any donation or gratuity or to forgive any debt or obligation owing to the public, and (2) the General Assembly shall not grant or authorize extra compensation to any public officer, agent, or contractor after the service has been rendered or the contract entered into."" Said Jacobs: ""Basically, if the state does not pay appraised value, it could be thought to be providing an unearned benefit, which is not allowed under Georgia law."" Olens said in an email to PolitiFact that his office has for decades interpreted the Gratuities Clause in the state constitution as limiting the state to ""paying fair market value for property, absent some additional source of value that the state receives from the transaction."" The Attorney General’s Office believes there’s no gray area concerning state guidelines on appraisals, said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for Olens. ""It’s a black and white issue,"" she said. Kane said the appraisal value, absent a special circumstance, is considered the fair-market value that can be paid for a property. The proposed $1 billion stadium, she said, is not considered a special circumstance. When there is a dispute in appraisals, the state agency in some cases may accept the higher appraisal, Kane said. ""But as a general matter, the highest appraisal is the limit of what an agency may pay absent special circumstances,"" she said. ""No such dispute exists here, and there are no special circumstances."" The Attorney General’s Office has been involved in the negotiations with Mount Vernon. Kane said her office is unaware of any instances in which the state Supreme Court ruled contrary to attorney general opinions concerning the Gratuities Clause. The attorney general is the top attorney for state agencies, Olens said. He said the GWCCA must abide by attorney general rulings like this one. Olens is correct if a state agency is buying the property, Emory University law professor Frank Alexander said. ""An attorney general’s opinion under Georgia law is the opinion of the attorney general. It is usually seen to be binding for the AG’s clients, which are the state agencies,"" Alexander said. GWCCA spokeswoman Jennifer LeMaster said the sole purchaser of the Mount Vernon property would be the state, or the GWCCA as the state agency involved in the negotiations. On the purchase price guidelines, the agency defers to the attorney general, she said. Reed has worked independently to reach a deal with the church, announcing recently that Mount Vernon would agree to $15.5 million. But any amount over the $6.2 million would have to come from another party, likely in the form of a gift, LeMaster said. Will the deal for Mount Vernon be limited only to the $6.2 million in state money? Or will ""some other resources,"" as Reed described them in the interview, come into play. Stay tuned. Reed’s statement is based largely on the state attorney general’s interpretation of a portion of the Georgia Constitution, which is appropriate because the land will be purchased by a state agency. Given that, we reverse our earlier ruling. We rate Reed’s statement True.","[('SportsRadio 680 The Fan interview with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, Aug. 7, 2013', 'http://www.stationcaster.com/player_skinned.php?s=87&c=9961&f=1717251'), ('Email from Cindy Presto, spokeswoman, State Properties Commission, Aug. 12, 2013', 'No link'), ('Emails from Sonji Jacobs, communications director, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, Aug. 14, 2013', 'http://www.gwcc.com/about/stadium/reports/emails.pdf'), ('Email from Natalie Dale, spokeswoman, Georgia Department of Transportation, Aug. 16, 2013', 'No link'), ('Emails between Georgia World Congress Center and Mount Vernon Baptist Church ', 'http://law.ga.gov/opinion/95-25'), ('Email interview, Hugh Wood, attorney, Wood & Meredith LLP, Aug. 8, 2013', 'No link'), ('Email from Lauren Kane, spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, Aug. 23, 2013.', 'http://law.ga.gov/opinion/95-25'), ('Georgia Attorney General opinion 95-25, May 18, 1995,', 'No link'), ('http://law.ga.gov/opinion/95-25', 'http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/GAConstitution.pdf'), ('Georgia Constitution, Gratuities Clause, Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VI(a)', 'No link'), ('Georgia Supreme Court ruling, ""Gwinnett County School District, et. al. vs. Cox,"" May 16, 2011', 'http://www.gasupreme.us/sc-op/pdf/s10a1773.pdf'), ('Georgia Department of Transportation, ""What Happens When Your Property Is Needed For A Transportation Facility,"" revised January 2011', 'No link'), ('Phone interview, Ron Plunkett, president, Georgia Association of Assessing Officials, Aug. 8, 23, 2013', 'http://www.dot.ga.gov/localgovernment/Documents/Right-of-Way/ROWBrochure-English.pdf'), ('Revised appraisal by Pamela Smith, July 30, 2013', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview, Frank Alexander, professor, Emory University, Aug. 22, 2013', 'http://www.gwcc.com/about/stadium/reports/appr/updated%20Pam%20Smith%20appraisal.pdf'), ('Telephone interview, Jennifer LeMaster, communications director, Georgia World Congress Center Authority, Aug. 23, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/aug/26/kasim-reed/mayor-correct-state-stadium-spending-limitations/

Cory Booker has overseen “five years in a row” of increases in violent crime, murders in Newark, Steve Lonegan claims
","High unemployment, a dropout rate forcing students into a life of crime and poverty, and an annual increase in violent crime, including murders, for five consecutive years. That picture, according to Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, reflects Newark under the leadership of Democratic Mayor Cory Booker. As Lonegan competes with Booker to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg, the former Bogota mayor made those claims during an Aug. 15 radio interview on ""Focal Point with Bryan Fischer,"" a program of the American Family Association. ""He’s had violent crime up five years in a row, murder up five years in a row. This is what he’s done to Newark,"" Lonegan said. ""So he’s done using Newark as a stepping stone. Now he wants to go to Washington, D.C. and do exactly the same thing to the country."" While Lonegan is correct that Newark has seen an increase in overall violent crime over the course of Booker’s tenure, his statement is inaccurate and misleading, according to crime statistics compiled through the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. Lonegan is wrong to say violent crime and murders have increased ""five years in a row,"" since there were decreases in some of those years. In addition, the numbers in three of the four violent crime categories in 2012 were below their levels from 2007, Booker’s first full year in office. Lonegan spokesman Will Gattenby said the candidate was trying to make the point that violent crime in Newark has increased significantly since 2007. Booker took office in July 2006. ""The number of violent crimes per year has increased during Cory Booker’s tenure,"" Gattenby said in an e-mail. The UCR program also includes data on overall property crime -- which has dropped since the start of Booker’s tenure -- but this fact-check is focused on violent crime, since that was the subject of Lonegan’s claim. Under the UCR program, violent crime is defined to include murders, forcible rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Over the past five years, each category has seen a mix of yearly decreases and increases. To analyze Lonegan’s statement, PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed UCR statistics for Newark for 2007 through 2012. The 2012 figures, reported by the Newark Police Department, are preliminary. While Lonegan said there have been increases for ""five years in a row,"" overall violent crime only increased annually in three of the five years between 2008 and 2012. Murders increased in four of the years. Overall violent crime dropped in 2009 and 2012, compared to the preceding years. Murders have increased every year since 2009, but in 2008, there was a nearly 36 percent drop to 67 murders from 104 in 2007. In recent years, the number of murders has increased minimally, going from 90 in 2010 to 95 in 2012. Between 2007 and 2012, overall violent crime in Newark increased from 2,415 offenses in 2007 to 3,219 last year, marking an increase of about 33 percent. But that increase was driven by only one of the four violent crime categories. In 2012, the only category higher than its respective 2007 figure was robberies. There were 1,976 robberies last year, marking a nearly 79 percent increase over the 1,104 in 2007. By comparison, the 95 murders in 2012 were almost 9 percent less than the 104 murders in 2007. In fact, since 2008, the number of yearly murders in Newark has never exceeded the 2007 level. In 2012, the numbers of forcible rapes and aggravated assaults were down from their 2007 levels by about 8 percent and roughly 4.7 percent, respectively. In a statement, Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Booker campaign, said in part: ""Mr. Lonegan is again using statistics misleadingly. Crime is down in Newark since Cory Booker took office."" Our ruling In a radio interview, Lonegan claimed that under Booker, Newark has seen ""violent crime up five years in a row, murder up five years in a row."" That statement is accurate in the sense that overall violent crime has increased over the past five years. But violent crime and murders have not gone up ""five years in a row,"" since there were decreases in some years. Also, the increase in overall violent crime between 2007 and 2012 stems solely from a rise in robberies. The other violent crime categories in 2012, including murders, were below their 2007 levels. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that overall violent crime has not increased in every year of Booker's tenure. During the five years cited by Lonegan, overall violent crime increased in three of those years.  But overall violent crime was higher in 2012 than it was in 2007, Booker's first full year in office.

Alberta Darling says Wisconsin’s neighbors make a felony of second-offense drunken-driving
","Whenever state officials debate tougher penalties for drunken driving, critics raise concerns about the high cost of additional jail time for offenders. State Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, the co-leader of the latest get-tough push, recently confronted that critique head-on while arguing to make third-offense drunken-driving a felony in Wisconsin. ""We can’t just say, ‘It costs too much,’"" Darling said in testimony before an Assembly committee Aug. 15, 2013. ""What does that say to the victims and the victims’ families, that it costs too much to make a third do-over a felony? Why does it have to be a fourth offense as a felony?"" Then she made a geographical appeal, twice saying during the hearing that Wisconsin is ""way out of line"" with some Midwestern neighbors. ""The states surrounding us, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana, have the second offense as a felony,"" Darling said. ""That tells me that that is a reasonable public policy, that other states that are like-minded, that are Midwesterners with similar values, feel that’s what is appropriate. To me that counts. We are way out of line, that you get three do-overs."" It’s well known that Wisconsin is the only state in which first-offense drunken driving is not charged as a crime; it’s treated as a civil matter featuring stiff money forfeitures. In fact, the second is still a civil forfeiture if the new offense is more than 10 years after the first, though it’s a criminal misdemeanor if it’s within the decade. But we wondered if the gap between the Badger State and our close neighbors on felony OWI is as stark as Darling described. So we compared Wisconsin’s law to that in the three states Darling mentioned, plus border states Minnesota and Michigan. Darling did not explicitly mention them, but they meet her definition of ""surrounding us"" (especially compared to Indiana, which doesn’t touch Wisconsin). We’ll confine our review to incidents that involve no aggravating factors such as causing injury or having children in the car. Here’s what we found: Wisconsin: The fourth offense here is a felony that carries a prison term of six months to six years -- but only if a previous offense was within the last five years. Otherwise, that fourth offense is a criminal misdemeanor with a 60 day to 1 year term, state penalty information shows. The third offense is now a criminal misdemeanor. The bill that Darling and Rep. Jim Ott, R-Mequon, have introduced with 13 co-sponsors would change that third offense to a Class H felony with a minimum of 45 days of imprisonment. And the bill would make fourth offense OWI a felony regardless of the timing of prior convictions. Much stiffer sentences would apply if the fourth is within five years of a prior incident. Iowa: Drunken driving becomes a felony quicker than under current Wisconsin law, but upon the third offense, not the second as Darling said. The first and second offenses are both criminal misdemeanors -- an aggravated one in the case of second. Illinois: As in Iowa, it’s the third offense that is a felony. The first two offenses are criminal misdemeanors. Michigan: The same as Iowa and Illinois -- third offense is a felony in Michigan. Indiana: The second offense is a felony if it’s within 5 years of the prior conviction. If the time gap is wider, it gets charged as a misdemeanor -- and that holds true even if it’s a third or fourth offense or more. Minnesota: As in Wisconsin, drunken driving without any aggravating factors is not charged as a crime until the fourth offense. Minnesota sweeps in offenses from the prior 10 years, though, compared with Wisconsin’s five. In sum, four out of our five closest neighbors clearly make drunken driving a felony faster than does Wisconsin. Minnesota, by contrast, is much like Wisconsin on this score. So ""out of line"" clearly would apply. But ""way"" out of line? It’s a bit of a subjective phrase, but Darling defined it in a specific way -- that the others make drunken driving a felony on second offense. By that measure, Darling was wrong -- with one exception. Among the surrounding states, only in Indiana is OWI a felony at second offense, and only if the offense is within five years of the first episode. Bob Delaporte, a Darling aide, told us Darling misspoke in saying some of Wisconsin’s neighboring states make it a felony at second offense. Before we close, a disclaimer. This analysis was confined to a simple look at when a felony classification kicks in. We did not try to sort out here the many complexities involved in determining whether one state’s law is truly ""tougher"" or ""weaker"" when factors such as plea bargaining and sentencing variations are considered. Still, a felony conviction undeniably packs a special punch, in terms of the loss of rights and stigma. ""A felony is such a career killer,"" said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois attorney and national expert on drunken driving penalties. Nationally, about half the states mirror Wisconsin’s current approach or are more lenient in terms of when -- or if -- a felony charge enters the picture, various state surveys show. Our rating Darling said Wisconsin’s drunken-driving penalties are ""way out of line"" with ""states surrounding us,"" which ""have the second offense as a felony."" In contrast to Wisconsin, where fourth offense can be a felony, four out of five of the state’s closest neighbors make it a felony faster than Wisconsin. But only one does so at the second offense as Darling said. Three put the threshold at third offense, and another puts it at fourth, as in Wisconsin. There is a gap between Wisconsin and neighboring states, so there’s an element of truth here, but for the most part that gap is not as wide as Darling said. We rate her claim Mostly False.","[('Wisconsin Eye, video archive, Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing on OWI bills, Aug. 15, 2013', 'http://www.wiseye.org/Programming/VideoArchive/EventDetail.aspx?evhdid=7880'), ('Interview with Bob Delaporte, aide to Sen.

Global warming skeptic says global surface temperatures have not increased in the last 16 years
","Sometimes it's the contradictions that drive PolitiFact to check a statement. In a commentary published Aug. 5, 2013, in The Providence Journal, Steve Goreham, executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, was critical of the science behind the warnings that Earth is getting hotter due to pollution. His first paragraph made this assertion: ""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years."" Yet three days earlier, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record. All 10 have occurred since 1998. Who's right here? We decided to check Goreham's factoid. We contacted him to ask where he got his numbers and how his claim stacked up with NOAA's. ""The short answer is that both are correct,"" he said in an email. ""Temperatures have been flat for the last 16 years and 2012 was one of the 10 warmest years on record."" We weren't sure how they could both be correct, so we again asked Goreham what he was using for data. We didn't hear back immediately, so we started looking on our own. Our first stop was the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database. Those data show that over the past 16 years -- 1997 through 2012 -- 15 have been the warmest on record. The readings go back to 1880. But how did the temperatures change during that period? In 2012, the global temperature was 0.43 degrees Fahrenheit higher over land than it was in 1997. Over land and water, the difference was 0.11 degrees. That's not flat. But temperatures naturally fluctuate so much from year to year, It's misleading to just compare two points in time. Goreham is talking about the overall trend, which climate experts use to see long-term changes over time. To find a trend, you have to do a more sophisticated calculation, preferably over a much longer period than 16 years. But 16 years is the period Goreham chose -- and what many other global warming skeptics have focused on -- so we'll stick with that for now. The trend line shows that the annual global temperatures listed by NOAA rose by 0.141 degrees during that stretch. To put this in perspective, when you're only dealing with a 16-year period, a lot depends on when you want to start looking. If you shift the timeframe back by just one year, beginning with 1996, the increase more than doubles, to 0.351 degrees. When we heard back from Goreham after asking about the NOAA database, he said we would ""probably"" see flat temperatures beginning in 1997. He also suggested we look beginning in 2001 to 2012 and said the temperature trend in that period would be flat. In fact, it was a bit negative. But that's not the 16 years he cited in his claim. Why start 16 years ago? It includes 1998, when an El Nino made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. There's another problem: When you get into temperature changes that small and time frames that short, the natural variability of climate can be so large that any ""trend"" might be the result of chance. ""Generally, for these short periods, if you're within 0.05 [of a degree Celsius] per decade you're not significantly different from zero,"" said John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, one of the country's best-known skeptics of global warming. (Over a 16-year period, that means the change would have to be higher or lower than 0.144 degrees Fahrenheit to be significant.) ""None of the data sets show anything much different from zero since the last 16, 17 years,"" he said. Since the 1998 El Nino, ""it's been pretty flat. There's been a slowdown in the trend."" So by Christy's gauge of what would be significant, the 0.141 degree increase from 1997 through 2012 seen in the NOAA database is essentially no increase, as Goreham said. In addition to the NOAA database, we looked at the two other major climate databases, one from NASA and the other from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. We used a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, which supports the global warming theory as do the vast majority of climate scientists. Its Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Although they would indicate a significant rise by Christy's off-the-cuff definition, a more precise calculation done by the Temperature Trend Calculator showed that none of the increases exceeded chance. Thus, the global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s have stalled. The Met Office has begun referring to the last 16 years as ""the recent pause in warming."" Officials there have issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: ""There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. ""The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space,"" Brecha said. ""So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up."" One last note. Goreham, in his commentary, was citing the 16-year trend in a broader context. He and other warming skeptics argue, with some justification, that the newest global readings are so far afield from the alarming temperature increases that were once predicted by climate computer models, it raises serious questions about whether scientists understand Earth's changing climate as well as they think they do, and whether it's worth spending trillions of dollars to try to influence it. But we'll save that controversy for another fact-check. Our ruling Steve Goreham said ""Global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years."" The databases we checked generally show small increases during that period, but not enough to be statistically significant, thanks to a short timeframe and a starting point that included an unusually warm year in 1998. That's why, at the same time, NOAA data clearly show that global temperatures in 15 of the last 16 years have been the hottest recorded. So Goreham is correct that the temperature trend has been flat, but it's flat at record highs. Because his statement reflects cherry-picked numbers and leaves out important details that would give a very different impression, we rate it Half True.

Was the Oregon Legislature within 'one vote' of enacting firearms legislation?
","If you think back, you might remember a time during the 2013 legislative session when there were talks about a slate of measures to help curb gun violence. But much like the gun control debate on the national stage, nothing came to pass and the issue was largely abandoned.   In a recent opinion piece for conservative political blog Oregon Catalyst, Sen. Doug Whitsett, a Republican from Klamath Falls, says, if not for one vote, the whole gun control narrative could have been completely different.   ""More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly,"" he wrote. ""Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms.""   He then listed seven of them and continued: ""Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights.""   That’s quite the statement. We decided to take a look.   Whitsett argues that the Senate was deadlocked on this issue. There were 14 Republicans in the Senate, all of whom were opposed to the gun legislation. If the 16 Democrats had all voted in favor, the legislation would have passed. But, he notes, Sen. Betsy Johnson, a Democrat from Scappoose, was opposed. Hers was the vote that kept these bills from becoming law.   That strikes us an oversimplification of the process.   We looked at the measure history for each of these seven bills he’d mentioned by number.   Two of the measures -- the only two he mentions that originated in the House -- never got hearings in their committees. It’s a stretch to say they were a single vote from becoming law when they never even made it out of committee, let alone to the Senate, where Johnson serves. One Senate bill was in a similar situation.   Four other Senate bills he mentioned did get hearings and were all passed out of committees with recommendations that they be passed by the full Senate. However, Senate President Peter Courtney sent them all to the Rules Committee where they died a quiet death.   By Whitsett’s account, the reason they were sent off to die in Rules was that Courtney knew they had no chance of passing, thanks to the Republicans -- plus Johnson.   ""It was my understanding that had we not had 15 ‘no’ votes in the Senate, they would have passed with flying colors,"" Whitsett said. Without Johnson ""it would have been the typical 16-14 party line vote.""   He may be right on certain bills. Johnson definitely helped defeat Senate Bill 700, which would have expanded background checks for gun purchases, as The Oregonian’s Jeff Mapes reported.   Even so, that bill and the others would have had to make it through the House. Whitsett said he was under the impression the House had the votes to pass the gun bills. We can’t know for sure. House Speaker Tina Kotek had made it clear that jobs and schools were her priorities, not guns.   We chatted with Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, one of the most vocal supporters of the various gun-control bills. She said Whitsett was right that the unified Republican opposition certainly helped table the subject. Still, Burdick added, had those bills made it out of the Senate, there was no sure bet they’d make it through the House, too.   ""The background checks bill would have had a very good chance,"" she said, referring to Senate Bill 700. ""The other ones would have had a little tougher time.""   Whitsett said that gun-control advocates were within ""one vote of enacting each"" of the seven bills into law. Had he focused on Senate Bill 700 specifically, we might be inclined to agree. But some of the other bills did not even receive a hearing and there is no guarantee that others would have passed in the Senate, let alone received the 31 votes needed in the House.   We rate this claim False.","[('Oregon Catalyst, Sen Doug Whitsett: Oregon gun bills wrap-up, Aug. 16, 2013', 'http://oregoncatalyst.com/24708-sen-doug-whitsett-oregon-gun-bills-wrapup.html'), ('The Oregonian, Sen.

Florida interim education commissioner gives props to state's graduation rate improvements
","As Florida kids enjoyed the last lazy days of summer, political players were squabbling about a series of hot education controversies. In a split vote, the Board of Education decided to soften school grades. The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a complaint challenging the state’s race-based education goals. Sen. Marco Rubio came out against federal Common Core standards -- putting him at odds with the state’s other potential Republican presidential contender, Jeb Bush. And Bush bashed conservative pundits’ claims about Common Core. Meanwhile, Education Commissioner Tony Bennett resigned following allegations that he took steps to prevent a charter school led by a prominent Republican donor from getting a ""C"" in Indiana, where he formerly held a similar job. Bennett’s resignation led to renewed arguing about Florida’s school grading system. But hey, nothing like back-to-school week for a fresh message about optimism. In an Aug. 19 letter in the Miami Herald, interim commissioner Pam Stewart wrote that though challenges remain, Florida’s teachers and parents have many reasons to be proud. ""National rankings show that Florida is moving in the right direction. High school graduation rates continue to increase at the fastest rate in the nation, with Florida leading the nation in the rate of Hispanic graduates,"" she stated. We assigned ourselves some homework about the state of our state’s graduation rates. Diplomas Count data For the national comparison, the Florida Department of Education pointed in part to Education Week’s Diplomas Count analysis of graduation rates based on standard diplomas. The most recent analysis covered 2000-10. It is true that Florida made major gains in the graduation rate. But that’s because Florida started at such an abysmally low rate: 49.9 percent in 2000, among the lowest in the country at the time. (And as of 2010, Florida remained slightly below the national average.) Florida’s graduation rate rose to 72.9 percent in 2010 -- a 23-percentage-point increase second only to Tennessee. Much of the increase in graduation rates was due to higher rates of graduation for Latinos and blacks. As for Hispanics, Florida had a 77.1 percent graduation rate -- the highest in the country but barely in front of Virginia at 77 percent and Maryland at 76.7 percent. Diplomas Count uses a formula that captures grade-to-grade promotions each year between ninth and 12th grades and graduation. Other ways to count graduation rates Diplomas Count, which uses federal data, is only one way to measure graduation rates and has been criticized by some education experts. Florida’s overall or Hispanic-only graduation rate can vary depending on the methodology and the years examined. The federal government pointed us to two other ways to measure graduation rates: a new cohort method, which examines how many students who enter ninth grade graduate four years later with a standard diploma, and the average freshman graduation rate, which is an estimate of the percentage of an entering freshman class graduating in four years. The cohort method showed for 2010-11 that Florida’s overall graduation rate was 71 percent -- lower than all but five states (Alaska, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon) and the District of Columbia. (Louisana’s rate equaled that of Florida’s.) Since the cohort method is new, for a historical perspective we turned to the average freshman graduation rate. That data shows Florida’s graduation rate increased by a handful of points between 2003 and 2010, but so did some other states. (Florida also has its own state reports, which show gains in recent years.) Robert Balfanz, an education expert at Johns Hopkins University, examined the data between 2006 and 2010 -- the years when rates began to move nationally -- and found Florida was the ninth fastest improving state. In the case of Hispanics, under both the cohort and average freshman graduation rate methods, several states had a higher rate than Florida. Balfanz pointed to Hispanic rates in a few large states to show that Florida has a high graduation rate but doesn’t hold a unique record. The average freshman graduation rate for 2010 showed a Hispanic graduation rate of 71.1 in Florida -- slightly less than California and less than Texas at 77.4 percent. The cohort data showed Florida just a smidge under California, but again less than Texas. ""Most researchers believe that the adjusted cohort method offers the promise of more accurate and more uniform rates,"" said Sterling Lloyd, of the entity that produces Diplomas Count. (A Harvard economist wrote extensively about the shortcomings of various methods of calculating graduation rates.) We wondered: Why would Florida Hispanics fare better than Hispanics elsewhere? "" ‘Hispanics’ is a meaningless category for educational purposes,"" said Richard Rothstein, an education research associate at the Economic Policy Institute. ""Florida’s ‘Hispanics’ are not comparable to ‘Hispanics’ in other states because Florida’s include a larger proportion of middle-class Cubans, and a smaller proportion of lower-class Mexicans. Without knowing anything else, you would expect middle-class Cubans to perform at a higher level than lower-class Mexicans, because of the literacy levels at home, if for no other reason."" Economics Nobel prize winner James J. Heckman and Paul A. LaFontaine, authors of The American High School Graduation Rate: Trends and Levels, have argued that Diplomas Count is ""exceedingly inaccurate"" because of the ""assumption that the number of students enrolled in 9th grade is the same as the number of students entering high school. This assumption artificially lowers the estimates of current graduation rates, especially for minorities who are more likely to be retained (repeat ninth grade)."" They also argue that grade retention differs sharply across states and localities. Our ruling Florida’s interim education commissioner Pam Stewart said ""high school graduation rates continue to increase at the fastest rate in the nation, with Florida leading the nation in the rate of Hispanic graduates."" That’s true -- under the Diplomas Count measurement for 2000-10. But Stewart omitted a couple of key points: Florida’s graduation rate was incredibly low and among the worst in the country in 2000 and even with the climb upward it remains below the national average. Also, Stewart is relying on the method of calculating graduation rates that puts Florida in the best light. Other methods do not show Florida as earning the top-increase spot and do not put Florida’s Hispanics at No. 1.

Marco Rubio fears Obama could 'basically legalize' all undocumented immigrants 'by the sign of a pen'
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has a dire message for conservatives who oppose immigration reform: Do something to improve the status quo, or President Barack Obama could make the situation much worse. ""I’ve been saying now I believe that this president will be tempted, if nothing happens in Congress, he will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen,"" Rubio said in a recent interview with Tallahassee talk radio host Preston Scott. Rubio, an author of the immigration proposal that passed the Senate this summer, said such a move could doom GOP immigration priorities of stepped-up border security and E-Verify checks in the Senate proposal. We cannot fact-check the future, but we thought it appropriate to examine whether Rubio’s worst-case scenario could actually happen. Could Obama essentially legalize ""11 million people by the sign of a pen"" like the DREAM Act population? No blanket citizenship It’s easy to interpret Rubio’s statement as Obama conceivably granting all-out citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants via an executive order. That could not happen. Doing so would violate the country’s separation of powers. Congress determined the laws governing how a person can legally reside in the country, so Obama cannot give out green cards, paths to citizenship or permanent residency en masse, experts told us. He does not have the authority to override laws simply by proclamation. ""Executive orders have tended to be quite focused, not open-ended over time,"" said Kevin Johnson, University of California Davis School of Law dean. ""Such an order would likely be subject to quite possibly successful legal challenge, with the claim being that legalization would be contrary to an act of Congress, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act."" But all-out citizenship is not exactly what Rubio warned against. Rubio is very familiar with this subject, having tried to craft a proposal similar to the DREAM Act, a law that would have provided legal residency to immigrants brought to the country by their parents. But in June 2012, amid stalled DREAM Act efforts, Obama announced a new administrative policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that allowed undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation and allows them to work in the country. So far, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has approved at least 430,000 people for this form of deferred action. An angry Rubio said Obama made it harder for any legislation to pass. To Rubio, Obama’s policy ""basically legalized"" this group of illegal immigrants and was improper -- and he’s not alone in this perspective. Giving someone a renewable status with work authorization and other benefits without punishment is de facto legalization, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that opposes the Senate bill and is for stricter immigration control. Others say deferred action does not amount to legal status because the classification is temporary. The action puts an individual in legal limbo while allowing them to possibly apply for a driver’s license and work without fear of immediate deportation, said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a professor at the Pennsylvania State Dickinson School of Law and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights. The Department of Homeland Security justified the policy by saying it was within the ""prosecutorial discretion"" of the executive branch. Obama: ‘I’m not a king’ We’ve arrived at a significant part of our fact-check: Could Obama grant deferred action to the entire population of illegal immigrants, not just Dreamers? Obama has shot down that possibility, stressing the need for a comprehensive bill. ""I’m not a king,"" Obama said in January to Telemundo. ""You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And, you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law."" Still, the administration has considered the pros and cons of a broad-based legalization program that excludes people who are a security risk, according to a leaked 2010 DHS memo. The draft memo detailed many risks for such a move, including blowback from Congress and the impression the department secretary is abdicating ""her charge to enforce immigration laws."" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant pointed us to a National Journal piece that examined an idea among immigration activists that involves persuading Obama ""to freeze the current undocumented population in place through an administrative order, give them work permits, and hope for a better deal under the next president, with the hope that he or she is a Democrat,"" according to the story. They want Obama to expand the deferred action program to other immigrants here illegally, such as those who work, are caregivers, or are immigrant parents of children who are citizens. ""It’s not an empty threat,"" Frank Sharry of America’s Voice told POLITICO. ""If Republicans block reform with a path to citizenship, immigration reform activists will look at all their options, including broad executive action."" Deferred action for all? Experts told us Obama indeed has broad executive power over deportations and granting temporary work permits. But it’s a stretch to say he could legally offer all undocumented immigrants that deal. If he wanted to order a stay of deportations across the board, he would have to provide a strong justification, such as a lack of resources to do the job, said Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas School of Law professor who co-authored an argument against the constitutionality of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. ""But he could do that only briefly, and only in what I’d consider pretty extreme circumstances,"" Delahunty said. On the other hand, the country’s immigration laws grant Obama and the Department of Homeland Security lots of wiggle room in granting temporary work permits and refusing to widely deport people, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. A widespread stay, though, would be ""a crazy scenario,"" he said. Even some of Obama’s loudest critics on immigration policy don’t think he would go that far. ""It could be done. Obama’s gotten away with as much, but I don’t think he’d do it,"" Krikorian said. ""That would be a bridge too far even for the pusillanimous appeasers among Republicans in Congress."" Experts thought it more conceivable that Obama would chip away at the undocumented immigrant population little by little by building on the deferred action policy for children who came to the country as minors. An expansion would have to come with caveats, such as cut-off dates and clean criminal histories. ""It would be the mother of all political battles,"" said Carl Hampe, a private immigration lawyer who was counsel for the Senate subcommittee on immigration from 1983 to 1991 and worked for the Department of Justice under President George H.W. Bush. ""As a purely theoretical legal question, is there a plausible argument that the president has that legal authority? Some would argue yes."" There’s also an argument that halting deportations alone would do little to offer relief to the country’s millions of unauthorized immigrants. They would still be in a legal limbo because most of the 400,000 or so people currently being deported are those who’ve committed crimes, said Lynden Melmed, who served as former chief counsel of the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the George W. Bush administration. Our ruling Rubio said that absent immigration reform from Congress, Obama ""will be tempted to issue an executive order like he did for the DREAM Act kids a year ago, where he basically legalizes 11 million people by the sign of a pen."" Could Obama offer deferred action for the entire population of undocumented immigrants? His executive powers over deportations are strong, but most experts say that’s an extreme scenario and susceptible to legal challenges, not to mention political fallout. More likely is that Obama could extend deferred action to more subsets of the undocumented population, pushing them lower on the priority list and into a deal-with-you-later category. That might be relief for them, but it’s also a legal limbo that falls short of legalization. We rate the statement Mostly False.","[('Interview with Alex Conant, Rubio spokesman, Aug. 19, 2013', 'https://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/daca-13-8-15.pdf'), ('Interview with Bobby Whithorne, White House spokesman, Aug. 19, 2013', 'No link'), ('Interview with Kevin Johnson, UC Davis School of Law dean, Aug. 19, 2013', 'http://www.nationaljournal.com/whitehouse/immigration-plan-b-focuses-on-white-house-20130808?mrefid=mostViewed'), ('Interview with Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, Pennsylvania State Dickinson School of Law professor and director of Center for Immigrants’ Rights, Aug. 19, 2013', 'No link'), ('Interview with Hiroshi Motomura, UCLA School of Law professor, Aug. 20, 2013', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/sen-marco-rubio-tours-florida-to-repair-image-damaged-over-immigration/2136352'), ('Interview with David A.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Carly Fiorina']","
Only four countries 'legalize abortion after 5 months,' Carly Fiorina says
","Former Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina talked abortion on ABC’s This Week on Aug. 18, 2013. When host George Stephanopoulos pointed out Republicans’ failure to capture the single-woman vote in 2012, she responded by saying, ""I think first we have to turn it around by having reasonable discussions around the things that are labeled extreme."" The former Hewlett Packard CEO went on to say that many Republicans are abortion rights advocates, and that Texas Gov. Rick Perry was not making an ""extreme"" move by tightening regulations on abortions. ""There are only four countries in the world that have -- that legalize abortion after five months -- China, North Korea, Canada and the U.S,"" Fiorina said. We won’t delve into the question of whether Texas’ law is extreme. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on whether only four countries have legal abortion after five months. For the purposes of evaluating this claim, we’ll set five months equal to 20 weeks, since Fiorina was referring to Texas’ new law, which restricts abortions after that time. What the laws say The U.S. requirements for legally obtaining an abortion vary by state, but the national standard was handed down from the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Lawmakers and physicians refer to the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus as ""viability."" The decision sets the standard that mothers can choose to have an abortion until the point of viability. In citing the leading obstetics publication as a guide, the ruling suggests viability starts at 24 weeks into the gestation period, which starts on the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period. So women in the United States can get an abortion for any reason, not necessarily medical, until at least 24 weeks of gestation. This is known as elective abortion. After 24 weeks, or whenever the resident’s state prohibits elective abortion, the woman can get a therapeutic abortion under a few exceptions: life in danger, physical health or mental health. China, North Korea and Canada do not have federally enforced limits on elective abortion. Gestation period restrictions in Canada, unlike the other two nations, are regulated at the local level, said Johanna Fine, a Center for Reproductive Rights spokeswoman. Provinces can range from 10 to 20 weeks for the maximum gestation period. So Fiorina is mostly right about these four nations. However, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which published a 2013 chart that several reproductive rights experts referred us to, Singapore and the Netherlands also fit Fiorina’s criteria. Both nations allow unrestricted abortion through week 24 of gestation, after which therapeutic abortion is possible. Fiorina’s statement also leaves off an important qualifier. She doesn’t mention that there are dozens of countries that permit abortions after 20 weeks for different reasons. Common exceptions to the gestational period requirement mean women may be able to get therapeutic abortions based on physical health, mental health or socioeconomic status. Fiorina’s point is that the four countries she listed all permit women to get abortions until about that time frame without any of those exceptions, but she omits the bit about exceptions. Just 29 countries (here we include countries to mean independent states and semi-autonomous regions whose populations exceed one million) outlaw abortion entirely, with no exceptions to save the woman’s life. Thirty-seven other countries that routinely outlaw abortion, including Paraguay, Afghanistan and Uganda, make clear exceptions to save mothers. Another 59 will do so in general to preserve the mother’s physical health on a broader scale, with Israel, New Zealand and others also accepting mental health reasons as valid exceptions. India and Japan belong to a group of 13 countries that grant even wider exceptions that include access to the procedure for socioeconomic reasons based on factors like age of the woman or very low income. The remaining 61 countries legalize elective abortions with varying gestational period requirements, with the U.S., Canada, North Korea, China, Singapore and the Netherlands being the six countries with the widest acceptable time periods. ""It’s not so much whether abortion is legal, it’s under what circumstances it's legal,"" said Mindy Roseman, the Human Rights Program academic director at Harvard Law School. ""Even where abortion is highly restricted, it’s legal for the health of the woman."" Our ruling Fiorina said only four countries allow legal abortions five months into the gestational period. The United States, Canada, North Korea and China do fit that measure, but Singapore and the Netherlands, which Fiorina left off her list, do as well. Far more countries permit abortions in certain circumstances in which the pregnancy would damage the woman’s well-being, be it physical, mental or economic. Fiorina’s claim is based in fact but misses the mark, so we rate it Half True.","[('ABC, ""This Week,"" Aug. 18, 2013', 'https://abcnews.go.com/watch/this-week/SH559082/VDKA0_rkdo59y9/this-week-0818-the-egyptian-political-crisis'), ('Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, ""Abortion Law and Policy: Comparisons Between the U.S. and Canada,"" Feb. 2006', 'No link'), ('Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada, ""How to Get an Abortion in Canada,"" Feb. 2006', 'http://www.arcc-cdac.ca/postionpapers/54-US-Canada-Abortion-Law-Policy.pdf'), ('Center for Reproductive Rights, ""The World’s Abortion Laws Map 2013 Update,"" June 2013', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Jessica Rodgers, National Right to Life spokeswoman, Aug. 20, 2013', 'http://www.arcc-cdac.ca/postionpapers/15-How-To-Get-an-Abortion-in-Canada.pdf'), ('Email interview with Marjorie Dannenfelser, Susan B.

"['Rhode Island', 'Robert Healey']","
Healey says many states are discussing eliminating the lieutenant governor position
","
The fight for the lieutenant governor’s office in Rhode Island has centered on one basic question: should the state keep the office, or eliminate it?

Perennial candidate Robert J. Healey Jr. is running on the platform that the job is a do-nothing position that should be eliminated. He said he’d work to do just that if elected.

In a recent commentary piece in The Providence Journal, Healey observed other states ""survive quite well"" without a lieutenant governor, including New Hampshire, Maine, and ""progressive Oregon.""

Healey added, ""And of the states that have a lieutenant governor, many (Illinois, Louisiana, Utah, Florida, Massachusetts, Connecticut and California, to name a few) are currently discussing the need for such an obsolete office.""

We decided to take a look.

First, a few basics: 

Forty-five states and five U.S. territories have an officeholder who holds the title ""lieutenant governor."" They include New Jersey, which seated its first lieutenant governor this year. Arizona voters will decide Tuesday whether to create one.

Healey sent more than a dozen citations of newspaper and magazine articles to support his statement that there is much buzz about eliminating the office.

Most are opinion or commentary pieces with no evidence of current wider discussion, broad-based movements or any legislative action. Several articles did reference legislative efforts, including in Illinois and Louisiana; however those never got off the ground. The stories preceded the failed attempts.

Among the articles was an August 2010 editorial in The Register Citizen in Connecticut, which, rather than endorsing any of the four primary candidates for the office, recommended instead that the office be eliminated.

One of the candidates, Lisa Wilson-Foley,  said she would refuse a salary, driver and car and would evaluate after two years whether the office should be abolished. She lost by a wide margin.

To check the seven states Healey specifically mentions, we contacted state librarians, legislators, and editors at major newspapers.

We heard from people in five states. We found nothing to support Healey’s claim that those states ""are currently discussing"" the need for the office.

For example, Dan Harrie, political editor for the Salt Lake Tribune, told us ""No, there’s been no talk of eliminating the office of lieutenant governor at all.""

Carrie Rose of the Connecticut Legislative Library told us there are no official discussions about eliminating the office in that state.

Bob Shaw, politics and government editor at the Orlando Sentinel, said there has been criticism of the cost of the office, ""but there has not been any movement to get rid of it. No legislation filed, no constitutional amendment discussed, or anything like that.""

""In my world, none of those states are currently discussing it,"" said Julia Hurst, director of the non-partisan National Lieutenant Governors Association. She said she would define discussion as ""someone filed a bill,"" present tense.

In Illinois and Louisiana, for example, ""a piece of legislation [was] introduced in both states in the most recent legislative session – in Illinois, it did not get out of its originating body, and in Louisiana, it did not get out of its originating committee,"" she said. ""In some states a bill can live for two years. That’s not the case in either one of those states ...""

Similar legislation was attempted in South Carolina but never got off the ground.

Louisiana State Rep. Cameron Henry, whose bills never moved out of committee, said in a phone interview that he plans to file a bill in the next session ""to keep the lieutenant governor’s office, and merge the secretary of state’s job with it.""

When we presented Healey with our findings, he said, in his view, ""When people are talking about it in editorials or newspapers, people are talking about the issue. That’s pretty much about the issue.""

In our view, his statement that many states are ""currently discussing"" the need for the office suggests substantially more than just people or columnists giving their opinions, or recent efforts that have failed.

We rule his statement Barely True.","[('\nInterviews:\nState Rep. Cameron Henry, Louisiana, Sept. 23, 2010', 'http://www.wolfereports.com/tag/sc-lieutenant-governor/'), ('\nState Sen.

"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Elizabeth Roberts']","
Printed words undercut truthfulness of Lt. Gov. Roberts' health insurance savings claim
","
In her bid for reelection, Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts cites her efforts to keep health insurance costs down in Rhode Island.

In her television ad called ""Clear,"" a narrator says: ""Elizabeth Roberts? She led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes and saved Rhode Island families over $150 million dollars.""

Meanwhile, the words on the screen say ""Elizabeth Roberts,"" ""stopped insurance rate hikes,"" and ""saved over $150 million.""

So what you see is a claim that Roberts ""stopped insurance rate hikes"" and what you hear is ""led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes.""

We wondered what was behind the claim.

Roberts campaign manager Daniel Meuse told us that the ad referred to a 2009 request by Blue Cross and UnitedHealthCare of New England to raise rates. (Our files show the requested increases were as high as 16.3 percent. The insurance companies ultimately withdrew their requests, but succeeded in getting increases this year.)

First of all, Roberts, as the lieutenant governor, has no ability to block rate hikes. That authority lies with Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller.

Meuse acknowledged that Roberts lacks any authority to stop a rate hike. But he said that she deserves credit for leading the campaign against the hikes, which is the claim made by the narrator.

Meuse said Roberts met with business groups and rallied them against the proposal. ""She was the only public official who went and testified.""

So we decided to check on her role as a leader of the opposition.

A June 2, 2009 Providence Journal story about a Warwick news conference reported that Roberts joined business leaders to protest the proposed increases. We got through to three of the five business people mentioned in the story and asked whether Roberts led the fight. All agreed.

J. Michael Vittoria, president of the Rhode Island Business Group on Health, which represents 75 small and large employers, said there was plenty of opposition to the rate hikes proposal and it probably would have been expressed to some degree, but Roberts and her office successfully focused it.

""If the question is whether she was responsible for making that happen? My opinion is, yes she was. I'm not saying it wouldn't have happened without her doing it, but I think she was the point of the spear there,"" said Vittoria. ""Essentially, she led the way in terms of getting a number of different businesses together to articulate what everybody felt anyway.""

""I would absolutely characterize her as someone who led the fight for the repeal of this increase,"" said Donald Nokes, president of NetCenergy in Warwick, who joined Vittoria and Roberts to lobby against the plan on talkradio. ""It came at a very bad time and it just wasn't something we felt should be accepted.""

Linda Lulli, an associate vice president for human resources at Bryant University, agreed that Roberts helped rally opposition. ""In think the visibility and that level of involvement of the stakeholders, I think, had some influence on the changes that were made by the [insurance] carriers and their positions.""

As for the $150 million estimate, Koller told us in an email that ""the 150 figure was my office's estimate, at that time, of the annual aggregate incremental costs which employers would have paid for health insurance had the rates submitted by the three insurers been approved.""

One other important point: Roberts talks about saving Rhode Island families over $150 million dollars. But in employer-sponsored health plans, employees usually pay a portion of the premium. It's the businesses that save most of the money. In addition, many employees do not have families.

For that reason, when it comes to the verbal claim, the Roberts assertion isn't completely true.

And because the words that appear on the commercial make the untrue claim that she blocked the increase, it further undercuts her -- to use the Stephen Colbert word -- truthiness.

So rate her seem claim as Half True.","[('\nYouTube.com, ""Clear,"" LtGovRobert\'s channel, accessed Oct. 28, 2010\n\nInterview, Daniel Meuse, spokesman, Elizabeth Roberts campaign, Oct. 28 and 29, 2010\n\nProJo.com, ""Health insurers withdraw rate increase request in R.I.,"" July 3, 2009\n\nProJo.com, ""Update: Critics blast health insurance increases in R.I.,"" March 18, 2010\n\nProjo.com, ""\'Businesses say health-care hikes unreasonable,\'"" June 3, 2009\n\nInterview, J.

"['Stimulus', 'Virginia', 'Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee']","
DCCC says Scott Rigell's car dealership made over $400,000 off the ‘Cash for Clunkers’ bailout.
","
An arm of the national Democratic Party labeled Virginia Beach businessman and Congressional hopeful Scott Rigell a hypocrite for criticizing federal stimulus spending after cashing in on its benefits.

Rigell, a Republican, owns Freedom Automotive, which operates three dealerships in Hampton Roads. He’s challenging Democratic incumbent Glenn Nye for Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District seat.

A TV ad sponsored by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee paints Rigell’s participation in the Cash for Clunkers program as a direct contradiction of his campaign criticism of the stimulus bill, which helped pay for the program.

""Hypocrisy. That’s politics these days. And now politician Scott Rigell is campaigning on his opposition to bailouts,"" the ad says. ""But Rigell's car dealership made over $400,000 off the 'Cash for Clunkers' bailout. Rigell rails against the bailout, but his business raked in the cash.""

Asked to source the claim, the DCCC pointed to U.S. Department of Transportation statistics as well as stories in The Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot, daily newspapers in Hampton Roads. 

But first, what is Cash for Clunkers? The 33-day program during the summer of 2009 provided federal subsidies for people trading in older cars to buy new vehicles. The hope was to jump start the auto industry in the midst of the recession.

Did Rigell’s dealerships participate in Cash for Clunkers? Yep. Rigell  acknowledges it, and according to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Rigell’s three dealerships received a total of $441,000 in rebates for 106 sales.

But that doesn’t mean the rebates translated into $441,000 in profits for Rigell’s dealerships, as the ad implies. Under the program, dealers gave consumers instant instant rebates of up $4,500 for their clunkers to be used as down payments on new cars. The dealers would then file paperwork with the federal government and get reimbursed.

Rigell’s profit would have come from the mark ups of the 106 new cars he sold under the program. Rigell’s campaign declined to reveal its mark-up figures. In 2009, U.S. auto dealers grossed an average $1,183 on on each new car sold, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Under that math, Rigell would have had a gross profit $125,398 attributable to Cash for Clunkers.

Why woulda Republican who has vocally opposed the stimulus bill opt to participate in one of its programs? Rigell says it was just business.

""Some of our customers asked to participate in that program and I couldn’t imagine saying no, you’ve got to go somewhere else,"" Rigell said at a recent Hampton RoadsChamber of Commerce meeting.

Through a spokesman, Rigell told PolitiFact that he was protecting his 240 employees by participating. Although he made money from the program, Rigell says he is not happy about it.

""I resentthe government for putting our family business in that position,"" he said. In The Virginian-Pilot, Rigell described the clunkers program as ""an ill-advised program forced upon me as a businessman in this environment.""

So let’s look back at the facts.

Rigell has indeed campaigned against the federal stimulus, as the ad claims. There’s no doubt that Cash for Clunkers was part of the stimulus and that the program boosted the bottom lines of Riggell’s dealerships.

But we can’t place a dollar amount on the benefit to Rigell. The ad wrongly suggests that his dealerships’ $441,000 in rebates were straight profits and there’s reason to believe Rigell’s actual gain from Clunkers was considerably smaller. So we find the claim to be Half True.","[('\n\nRigell at Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce meeting, Sept. 27, 2010\n\nThe Virginian-Pilot, ""In 2nd Congressional District race, ad war heats up"", Oct. 6, 2010\n\nThe Virginian-Pilot, ""GOP candidates focus fire on top spender Rigell"", June 4, 2010\n\nEmail with Eric Bolton, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Oct. 26, 2010.\n\nInterview with Jesse Ferguson, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Oct. 26, 2010.\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation, \xa0Cash for Clunkers database, accessed Oct. 26, 2010.\n\nEmail with Crystal Cameron, Scott Rigell for Congress 2010, Oct. 26, 2010.\n\nInterview with Michael Allen, public affairs director for the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, Oct. 29, 2010.\n\nNational Automobile Dealers Association, NADA Reports dealer Profits Increased During First Five Months of the Year,June 29, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCGlFfAFMQk&feature=related')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/30/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-scott-rigells-car-dealership-made-over-4/
"['Education', 'Florida', ""Committee for Florida's Education""]","
Group claims Gelber is against scholarships for Jewish schools
","
Halloween inspires some eye-catching campaign mailers, including one in the race for Florida's next attorney general. An electioneering group sent a mailer in mid October 2010 with a photo of Democratic candidate Dan Gelber on the front that describes him as ""Toxic to Jewish Education'' with those words written in dripping blood-red, scary-looking type.

Has he been lacing kosher meals at Jewish schools with arsenic? Ordering lead paint to be used at yeshivas? Oy vey!

The other side of the mailer provides more details. It states: ""Dan Gelber: On the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools. ... Call Dan Gelber and remind him that there is nothing pathetic about our children's right to obtain a Jewish education!""

Gelber, a Jewish Democrat, is running against Republican Pam Bondi on Nov. 2, 2010. But it wasn't Bondi who distributed the mailer: it was the Committee for Florida's Education, an electioneering communication organization. 
Though Bondi's campaign has repeatedly been quoted in news articles denying involvement, there is a connection to her campaign. The Miami Herald reported Oct. 29, 2010, that Bondi campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley is married to John Kirtley, vice chairman of the American Federation for Children, a national pro-voucher group, which gave $255,000 to the Committee for Florida's Education. Mr. Kirtley is also a Tampa-based Republican fundraiser and the American Federation was the only donor to the Committee for Florida's Education.

Kim Kirtley sent an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida: ""In response to your questions -- I reiterate that neither the campaign, or me personally, had any knowledge of the flier. John and I are both professionals who work in the political process, but his work is his own, and mine is my own.""

For this Truth-O-Meter, we will research, is Gelber ""on the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools?""

Let's note at the start that the state and the mailer call these ""scholarships"" though they are often referred to as vouchers. And Gelber has been a firm opponent of vouchers ever since they appeared in Florida 10 years ago.

The mailer cites a handful of votes Gelber took involving school vouchers, as well as some of Gelber's quotes in newspapers during the past decade. We will examine both.

School voucher background

Then-Gov. Jeb Bush signed a law in 1999 starting vouchers, which he called ""Opportunity Scholarships,"" that allowed students who attended schools that received an ""F"" two years in a row based on FCAT scores to transfer to private schools or higher-performing public schools. In 2001, the state started the Tax Credit Scholarship Program to allow corporate donors to give money to nonprofit scholarship-funding organizations, which then give scholarships to poor children. The companies in turn received tax breaks from the state.

In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court struck down the private school portion of the 1999 program, and the Legislature passed a bill to allow students who received those Opportunity Scholarships in the past to get the tax credit scholarships if they qualified based on having a low income.

Today, the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program gives a maximum scholarship of $4,106. For the 2010-11 school year, 524 of these vouchers are used at Jewish schools out of 29,651 -- or about 1.7 percent, according to Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters.

The students must be eligible for free or reduced-price lunches to qualify.

Multiple mailers about Gelber

Now, back to the committee that produced the mailers.

Elnatan Rudolph, chair of the Committee for Florida's Education, is a Jewish political consultant who lives in New Jersey and is a former Teaneck, N.J., council member. He would not tell us his current party affiliation but said in the past he has been affiliated with both parties. He said he has relatives in Florida, including some who attend Jewish private schools.

The committee has sent seven mailers about Gelber to 50,000 South Florida voters, Rudolph said. It also sent a mailer about Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink, and did newspapers ads on Gelber, Sink and Democratic CFO candidate Loranne Ausley. One of the newspaper ads about Gelber, which ran Oct. 22 in the Jewish Press of Pinellas County, was a ""Wanted"" poster for ""crimes against Jewish education.... Voting 'No' on funding for Jewish schools."" All of the mailers and newspaper ads are about vouchers.

Gelber's votes and quotes

Gelber, first elected to the state House in 2000 and the state Senate in 2008, has voted several times on vouchers. The mailer cites bills that Gelber voted ""no"" on that ultimately made it into law:

• HB 21 May 4, 2001: A bill that related to taxation, including providing credit against taxes for contributions to nonprofit scholarship-funding organization.

• SB 256 May 4, 2006: In the wake of the Florida Supreme Court declaring the 1999 Opportunity Scholarships unconstitutional, this bill allowed those students receiving Opportunity Scholarships -- if they were poor -- to transfer to the tax credit scholarships.

• HB 653 May 2, 2008: Expanded the corporate income tax scholarship program, including making foster care children eligible.

• HB 453 April 28, 2009: Made some revisions to the scholarship program.

• SB 2126 March 24, 2010: Made still more changes to the program. 
Let's note here that none of those bills involved Jewish schools specifically.

Now a look at the newspaper clips the mailer cited:

• ""This program needs major reformation. It's an embarrassment."" St. Petersburg Times, Sept. 24, 2003. The article was about the state education commissioner at the time, Jim Horne, calling for an investigation into the Silver Archer foundation after about $400,000 in voucher money went missing. The article doesn't quote Gelber on his views on missing vouchers money, but here is his full quote: ""I don't want to prejudge Silver Archer -- I don't know what they did -- but this program was an invitation for fraud waste and abuse. This program needs major reformation. It's an embarrassment."" This article doesn't support the claim in the ad -- it just shows Gelber was concerned about fraud.

• ""Pathetic is zealously pursuing voucher programs that are not merely unconstitutional, but that bleed resources from a school system that can't afford to lose a dime."" Gelber wrote an editorial for the South Florida Sun Sentinel July 4, 2005, that listed several things he found ""pathetic"" in response to Bush calling the Florida Democratic Party pathetic for payroll tax lapses.

• ""Floridians want us to fix public schools not push some right wing agenda to privatize schools."" Gelber was quoted in the Miami Herald Feb. 16, 2006, in an article about Bush calling for a constitutional amendment on private school vouchers about a month after the Florida Supreme Court tossed out the state's first voucher program as unconstitutional.

• ""We are funding vouchers while rolling back Bright Futures."" Gelber was quoted in the Tampa Tribune March 30, 2010, in a story about the Democratic attorney general primary race. (He isn't quoted as bluntly bashing vouchers in this article although Rudolph sent us an Oct. 11, 2009, Palm Beach Post article in which Gelber and  fellow Democratic state Rep. Dave Aronberg, who lost to Gelber in the August primary, clashed on vouchers. The bill expanded eligibility for tax credits to insurance companies but didn't enlarge the $118 million scholarship program, the Post wrote. Aronberg voted for the bill while Gelber voted against it.)

Gelber responds 
Gelber disputes the claim because he said it portrays him as voting for something specific to Jewish schools, while the vouchers apply to private schools in general.

""There was no vote on Jewish schools,'' said Gelber in an interview. ""I don't support the voucher program.""

Gelber campaign manager Christian Ulvert added in an e-mail:

""Dan Gelber aggressively fought for stronger accountability and for reforms in an effort to protect taxpayer dollars. And while he opposes voucher programs because they drain resources from the public school system, they are here in Florida and as such should have strong accountability measures.""

We asked Rudolph why he felt it was a fair statement to suggest that Gelber was ""on the record against scholarships to help our needy children attend Jewish private schools"" when in fact his votes related more broadly to private schools -- only a small fraction Jewish, less than 2 percent.

""He voted directly against money that is going to help needy Jewish children attend Jewish day schools. There is no way to say he voted against the whole program but did not mean it for one specific group,'' Rudolph said in an interview. ""He voted against a program that funds needy Jewish children being able to afford to go to Jewish day schools. ... That's a fact."" 
Our ruling 
We say no, that's not a fact. While Gelber has repeatedly voted against and criticized vouchers for any students, he has no record at all of voting against Jewish education, and it's a crass twist of logic to claim otherwise. Characterizing his long opposition to the voucher program as a direct vote against needy Jewish children is flat-out wrong. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.","[('\nJewish Press of Pinellas County, Dan Gelber ""Wanted"" poster ad, Oct. 22, 2010\n\nCommittee for Florida\'s Education, Dan Gelber ""Toxic to Jewish Education"" mailer Page 1 and Page 2, October 2010\n\nFlorida Division of Elections, Committee for Florida\'s Education, Oct. 28, 2010 report\n\nFlorida Senate website, HB 21, May 4, 2001\n\nFlorida Senate website, SB 256, May 4, 2006\n\nFlorida Senate website, HB 653, May 2, 2008\n\nFlorida Senate website, HB 453, April 28, 2009\n\nFlorida Senate website, SB 2126, March 24, 2010\n\nThe South Florida Sun-Sentinel, ""Dan Gelber says attack ad is insulting and inaccurate"", Oct. 25, 2010\n\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""State suspects voucher foundation broke law,"" Sept. 24, 2003\n\nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel, ""Pathetic label fits school woes,"" July 4, 2005\n\nMiami Herald, ""Bush"" vote on vouchers; Gov Jeb Bush said he would push for a constitutional amendment to save Florida\'s private school voucher programs,"" Feb. 16, 2006\n\nPalm Beach Post, ""AG candidates Aronberg and Gelber clash on vouchers, bash Republicans,"" Oct. 11, 2009\n\nMiami Herald, ""Attack ad against Gelber prompts lawyers to come to his defense,"" Oct. 29, 2010\n\nPalm Beach Post, ""Tougher voucher rules proposed,""Aug. 29, 2003\n\nTampa Tribune, ""Attorney General hopefuls spar gently,"" March 30, 2010\n\nInterview, Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters, Oct. 28-29, 2010\n\nInterview, Dan Gelber campaign manager Christian Ulvert, Oct. 28-29, 2010\n\nInterview, Attorney General candidate Dan Gelber, Oct. 29, 2010\n\nInterview, Committee for Florida\'s Education chairman Elnatan Rudolph, Oct. 28-29, 2010\n\nInterview, Pam Bondi campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley, Oct. 29, 2010', 'https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B4fjL1-0K8piMmYwZmRhOGUtYTdlNC00ZmI4LWEwMmItNTUyNDMyMzk5M2Zi&hl=en')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/30/committee-florida-education/group-claims-gelber-against-scholarships-jewish-sc/
"['Abortion', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Women', 'Florida', 'Kevin Rader']","
Kevin Rader says ""extremist"" supporters of his opponent would make abortion illegal in all cases
","
In stark, black-and-white montages of tear-streaked female faces, District 27 state senate hopeful Kevin Rader blasts his Republican opponent in a campaign ad for her anti-abortion views.

Rader, a Democrat and state House member, accuses Republican Lizbeth Benacquisto of strongly opposing abortion and having ties to extremist conservative groups that would criminally prosecute rape victims for having abortions. 
""Lizbeth Benacquisto strongly opposes a woman's right of choice,"" the ad states. ""The extremist groups who support her would make these women into criminals. She supported an extreme law to require pregnant women to pay for  and view a sonogram before they could exercise their right of choice. Her allies would make choice illegal in all cases, including rape, incest, even to save a woman's life. Vote no on Benacquisto, keep extremism out of our state Senate.""

The ad enraged Benacquisto, a city councilwoman in Wellington, who responded with her own ad and the revelation that she was raped 23 years ago as a University of Florida freshman. She underscored her support for an exception to abortion for rape victims, saying she would ""never stand down when any woman has been abused,"" and demanded Rader pull the ad.

Rader's camp said the only way that will happen is if Benacquisto renounces the support given to her by far-right, conservative right-to-life groups. 
With such a high emotion level in this campaign, we thought Rader's claim about Benacquisto's supporters was worth a look.

Benacquisto is pro-life, and she makes no secret of it on her website and in questionnaires.

Same with her support of the ultrasound legislation, though she has noted in various interviews she has concerns about its impact on rape victims. In a candidate questionnaire from the Christian Coalition of Florida, she added, ""I consistently support this because I am pro-life.""

Benacquisto holds support from a handful of conservative, anti-abortion groups. Among those are the Christian Coalition, the Florida Right to Life PAC and the Christian Family Coalition. Though they haven't donated financially, both Florida Right to Life and the former Christian Coalition executive director have offered endorsements, and she headlined at least one event, a breakfast for the Christian Family Coalition on Oct. 16.

Florida Right to Life believes life begins at conception and ends at natural death, and all points in between are to be defended. It labels abortion ""infanticide,"" which is a crime. And the Christian Coalition of Florida states, ""Although legal in the United States, we believe abortion is no less than murder of an innocent human life."" Using this logic, abortion equals murder and murder is a crime. Therefore, those who have abortions would be criminals.

The Christian Family Coalition, based in Miami, says it ""works to introduce pro-family legislation at the state and local levels of government. It informs and educates citizens on where candidates stand on the issues that affect the traditional family unit."" The group’s website includes a link to ""abortion,"" but contains just news articles and press releases in which it is mentioned. 
Each of those three organizations also closely follows abortion-related legislation. They post opinions on everything from parental notice to making the violent death of any fetus -- viable or otherwise -- cause for a first-degree murder charge.

But none appear to flat-out say they would support abortion regardless of whether a woman was raped, abused by a family member or faced with death. They skirt the issue. For example, Florida Right to Life says, ""We promote, uphold and support reverence and respect for human life without regard to condition, quality, age, race, religion, color or whether born or unborn.""

On the National Right to Life page, the only reference to exceptions is a 2005 survey indicating only 0.5 percent of women have abortions due to rape, while 4 percent undergo it for the mother's health.

Rader's campaign manager, Michael McCall, said, ""The problem with something like that is if you take an organization like Florida Right to Life, their very core is making abortion illegal. They won't list every case in which they support banning abortions, because they support banning abortions in all cases.""

It's clear that groups supporting Benacquisto have firm stands against abortion, but they're not spelled out precisely. What is clear, though, is that the groups don't offer up any exceptions. So we don't expect Rader's campaign to find any.  We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('\nKevin Rader campaign ad, Oct. 27, 2010', 'http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/video-campaign-ad-vote-no-on-lizbeth-benacquisto-998708.html'), ('\nFlorida Catholic Conference 2010 Candidate Questionnaire Project, Lizbeth Benacquisto:\n\n""Saying She Was Raped, State Senate Candidate Benacquisto Says Rival Rader’s Attacks Crossed the Line,"" Palm Beach Post, Oct. 28, 2010\n\n""Abortion the Latest Flash Point Between Rader, Benacquisto in State Senate District 27,"" Palm Beach Post, Oct. 27, 2010\n\n""Christian Family Coalition Hosts Kick-Off Breakfast in Palm Beach with Lizbeth Benacquisto,"" Christian Coalition press release, Oct. 21, 2010.\n\nPalm Beach Post, ""Florida Abortion Bill with Sonogram Requirement nears Decision by Governor,"" June 6, 2010.\n\nFlorida Right to Life website', 'No link'), (""\nChristian Family Coalition website\n\nLizbeth Benacquisto's campaign website"", 'http://www.flacathconf.org/CQP2010/Responses/Benaquisto_Lizbeth.html'), ('\nLizbeth Benacquisto campaign ad, Oct. 28, 2010', 'No link'), ('\n""Florida Right to Life PAC Endorses Lizbeth Benacquisto,"" campaign press release, Aug. 23, 2010\n\n""Former Christian Coalition Director Touts Lizbeth’s Conservative Leadership,"" campaign press release, Aug. 2, 2010\n\nInterview with Michael McCall, Rader\'s campaign manager\n\nChristian Coalition of Florida website on protecting life\n\nChristian Coalition of Florida 2010 Voters Guide survey\n\nFlorida Division of Elections, campaign finance reports for Lizbeth Benacquisto, obtained Oct. 28, 2010', 'http://www.cfcoalition.com/about_us.php')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/29/kevin-rader/kevin-rader-says-extremist-groups-support-opponent/

Crossroads GPS says North Dakota's economy is 'reeling,' but is it?
","
The pro-Republican group Crossroads GPS recently began airing ads in at least eight House districts, all using virtually identical language to decry the state of the economy and the Democratic agenda in Congress.

Here's the ad for North Dakota, which blasts the stewardship of incumbent Democratic Rep. Earl Pomeroy. Pomeroy faces a stiff challenge this year from Republican Rick Berg.

""North Dakota's economy is reeling, and Congressman Earl Pomeroy is making it worse,"" says the ad, which was released Oct. 25, 2010. ""While he should be helping us, he's supporting Nancy Pelosi and her failed agenda, voting for billions in new debt and reckless spending, including Pelosi's $800 billion stimulus boondoggle, filled with sweetheart deals and handouts to special interests. Reckless spending, massive debt, helping Pelosi, not us. Earl Pomeroy, wrong for North Dakota.""

We were tipped off that something was amiss when Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress, published an article on Oct. 28, 2010, that noted that the Pomeroy camp was challenging the description of North Dakota's economy as ""reeling.""

With barely disguised glee, a Pomeroy spokesman, Brenden Timpe, fired a barb at Karl Rove, who helped organize Crossroads GPS and its affiliate, American Crossroads.

""Next time Karl Rove wants to funnel secret money to North Dakota to influence our elections, he ought to visit our state first or at least pick up one of our newspapers,"" Timpe said. ""If he did, he would know that North Dakota’s economy is doing quite well, thank you very much, and Earl has been a strong partner in that progress.""

How well is North Dakota doing as the rest of the country muddles through a rough patch for the economy? On a relative basis at least, quite well indeed, thanks to a surge in natural resource extraction and relatively little decline in a housing market that never really boomed.

Here are some statistical benchmarks we located.

-- Unemployment. Today, North Dakota has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 3.7 percent. That's just over one-third -- yes, that's one-third -- of the national unemployment rate of 9.6 percent.

And this low unemployment rate is nothing new. North Dakota's annual unemployment rate for 2009 also ranked as the best in the nation at 4.3 percent, compared to a 9.3 percent rate nationally. In 2008, North Dakota ranked second (3.2 percent, compared to 5.8 percent nationally). In 2007, it ranked eighth (3.1 percent, compared to 4.6 percent nationally). And in 2006, it ranked seventh (3.2 percent, compared to 4.6 percent nationally).

-- Personal income. Total personal income in North Dakota rose 23 percent between 2006 and 2009, compared to 8 percent nationally. It rose by 12 percent in North Dakota between 2007 and 2009, compared to 2 percent nationally. And it fell by 1 percent between 2008 and 2009, compared to a national decline of 2 percent. So personal income in North Dakota did fall between 2008 and 2009, but it fell more slowly than the national rate, and it followed on two years of personal income growth, far ahead of the national rate.

The story is much the same for per capita personal income. It rose by 21 percent between 2006 and 2009 and by 10 percent between 2007 and 2009 before falling by 2 percent between 2008 and 2009.

-- Gross domestic product. GDP information by state is not available for 2009, so the full impact of the recession is not yet measurable. But the data that's available shows that the state enjoyed a nice boom between 2006 and 2008. State GDP rose by 12 percent between 2006 and 2007, compared to 1.9 percent nationally. And it rose by 9 percent between 2007 and 2008, compared to zero increase nationally. So on this score, North Dakota did well indeed.

When we asked Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, if the group had any defense for its characterization, he said, ""Unemployment is up significantly in the last two years in North Dakota, and much of that is due to the massive debt created by (President Barack) Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Earl Pomeroy.""

But let's put it into context: The unemployment rate in North Dakota rose from 3.4 percent two years ago, in September 2008, to 3.7 percent in September 2010. The number of unemployed North Dakotans has risen from 12,365 to 13,714 -- a total of 1,349 people, or less than 1 percent of the civilian, non-institutionalized population in the state. We think most Americans would be happier with that kind of economy than the one in their own state.

Judging by the ads on Crossroads GPS' website, we think the Pomeroy camp's charge that the ad is ""cookie cutter"" is accurate. At the very least, Crossroads was careless in the degree to which it adapted its ads to each state's specific context. In these sorts of economic times, it verges on the ridiculous to say that North Dakota's economy is ""reeling."" We rate the ad Pants on Fire!",[],/factchecks/2010/oct/29/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-north-dakotas-economy-reeling-/

Charlie Crist claims stimulus saved thousands of firefighter, law enforcement and educator jobs
","
On the campaign trail for the U.S. Senate, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist defends his support for the federal stimulus by pointing to jobs saved by the emergency infusion. In a state that voted eight years ago to keep class sizes small, he’s especially fond of mentioning educators. He touted education jobs twice in a debate Oct. 24, 2010 — the second time adding detail about public safety workers.

In the first few minutes,  he said:

""We utilized those moneys in order to stem the tide in losing jobs in the Sunshine State. 20,000 educators today would be out a job if we hadn't utilized the Recovery Act moneys. Another 60,000 of my fellow Floridians would be out of work today without the opportunity to be able to utilize those moneys in a responsible way.""

Before the debate with Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek had reached its halfway point, he added:

""But I also agree with the congressman when he talks about the fact that the Recovery Act saved 60,000 jobs among law enforcement officials, firefighters in the state of Florida, plus another 20,000 educators.""

A comment that specific just begs for the Truth-O-Meter. Did the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 really save 60,000 jobs among law enforcement officials and firefighters, plus 20,000 educators?

Crist’s campaign referred us to the governor’s office, where we caught up with press secretary Sterling Ivey. He sent us a link to the standard reference the governor would use for such data, the most recent Recovery Act Summary from the Florida Office of Economic Recovery. It breaks out two types of numbers for Florida: actual workers affected, and ""jobs,"" measured in full-time equivalents.

Quickly, things spiraled downhill for the ""60,000"" claim. The count for the Department of Justice — 935 jobs — would include some law enforcement officials, Ivey said. So would some of the 617 jobs attributed to the Department of Law Enforcement. Firefighters might be counted with Department of Homeland Security, but DHS claimed zero jobs in Florida funded by its $4.6 million award.

As we looked at the document , Ivey summarized: ""The numbers aren't going to add up for you.""

The educator claim fared better.

A line item for ""Education State Fiscal Stabilization"" looked promising: It showed 19,767 jobs funded by the Recovery Act. Other state and federal education categories showed nearly 7,900 additional jobs.

But Ivey couldn’t tell us how much of that work belonged to ""educators"" vs. other types of personnel. For that, we would have to ask the Florida Department of Education directly.

The department was able to provide us with Recovery Act numbers for ""instructional personnel,"" a reasonable synonym for ""educators."" In 16 categories, it identified 19,166 instructional full-time equivalent jobs affecting 31,003 employees for the quarter ending June 30, 2010. So, with a little rounding of the lower ""jobs"" number, Crist’s claim stands. And since he chose the word ""educators,"" which refers to people, not jobs, he probably would have been safe even with the higher number. If he had widened his word choice to encompass all types of positions at the Department of Education, he could have touted support for 27,600 jobs or 42,600 workers.

So how was Crist close — even conservative — on one number, and so woefully off on the other? Campaign spokesman Danny Kanner didn’t answer our request for an explanation. But the number of ""actual workers"" affected by Recovery Act funds in the quarter ended in June was near 80,000. Subtract from that about 20,000 educator jobs, and you have what sounds like a reasonable number for the rest: 60,000. Of course, there are two major problems here: 80,000 wasn’t the ""jobs"" number, it was the higher ""actual workers"" measure. ""Jobs"" totaled just 34,298. So a true statement would have been that the Recovery Act funded 20,000 jobs for educators and 14,000 other jobs. Or that it benefited 31,000 educators and 48,000 other Floridians. Either way, it’s simply inaccurate to attribute every non-education job or worker to law enforcement and firefighting.

So how does the Truth-O-Meter rule? Crist absolutely mangled the claim about ""60,000 jobs."" He had a much better grasp on ""20,000 educators."" That makes him only a quarter right, so we rule his statement Barely True.","[('\nPolitiFact Florida, ""Charlie Crist says he didn’t endorse stimulus bill,"" Nov. 5, 2009\n\nCNN ""State of the Union"" transcript, accessed Oct. 24, 2010\n\nDanny Kanner, campaign spokesman for Gov.

Sharron Angle says Sen. Harry Reid twice voted against making English the national language
","
The Sharron Angle campaign calls its ad""The Wave.""

But you may know it as the ad that prompted Joy Behar of ABC's The View to say: ""I'd like to see her do this ad in the south Bronx. Come here, b----. Come to New York and do it.""

Condemned in some Democratic and Hispanic circles as""racist,""the ad portrays Angle's opponent in the Nevada Senate race, Harry Reid, as a friend to illegal immigrants.

Here's the text of the ad: ""Waves of illegal aliens streaming across our border joining violent gangs, forcing families to live in fear. And what is Harry Reid doing about it? Voting to give illegal aliens Social Security benefits, tax breaks and college tuition, voting against declaring English our national language twice and even siding with Obama and the president of Mexico to block Arizona's tough new immigration law. Harry Reid....it's clear whose side he's on, and it's not yours.""

In a fact-check of a previouscampaign ad, we dealt with Angle's claims that Reid voted to give illegal immigrants Social Security benefits (Barely True) and special tax breaks (False).

Here, we're checking the claim that Reid voted against ""declaring English our national language, twice.""

During a big push for a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2006, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., proposed an amendment (S.AMDT.4064) ""to declare English as the national language of the United States and to promote the patriotic integration of prospective U.S. citizens.""

The amendment would have required all official government functions, including steps toward citizenship, to be conducted in English. It also sought to establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English, unless required by law. Arguing for the amendment, Inhofe said providing multilingual assistance costs the government more than $1 billion per year. Under the Inhofe's proposal, immigrants seeking to become permanent legal residents would have had to prove they had learned English.

Reid made an impassioned speech from the Senate floor on May 18, 2006, denouncing the bill as ""racist"" and ""divisive."" Here's a sampling of some of his comments to give you a flavor of Reid's position:

-- ""While the intent may not be there, I really believe this amendment is racist. I think it is directed basically to people who speak Spanish.""

-- ""I think we should make sure that people who are 911 operators can immediately switch to somebody who can speak Spanish.""

-- ""Today, as I speak, the language of America is English. We want people to integrate, to learn English, but they need tools to do this no matter what their native language. This amendment takes some of those tools away, and we need all of those tools.""

-- ""The fastest growing component of adult education in America today is English as a second language. This will slow that down. This amendment impacts English speakers, reporting of crimes, reporting of diseases, involvement in commerce. Next, is it going to impact upon the right to vote?""

-- ""This amendment is divisive. We should be here to unify our country, not divide it by ethnicity or language differences. I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Everyone who speaks with an accent knows that they need to learn English as fast as they can. Success in America means the ability to speak English. That is the way it is now. We don’t need this amendment. Speaking English is critical to the functioning of anyone in our country. It is the language of our government, of our nation, and as I have indicated before, air traffic controllers and diplomacy. This amendment, I believe, is unconstitutional. It raises serious concerns that American citizens could lose some of their rights.""

-- ""This amendment directly conflicts with several provisions of federal law, I believe, that guarantee the right of non-English-speaking students to learn English in our public schools.""

-- ""This amendment conflicts with provisions of federal law that require language materials or assistance to be provided to voters in some areas of non-English languages, where there is evidence of educational discrimination resulting in high illiteracy and low registration turnout.""

-- ""There has been substantial evidence of harassment, intimidation, even violence against language minority voters. This provision makes a blatant violation of the 14th and 15th amendments and criminal provisions of the Voting Rights Act more likely to occur.""

-- ""By the very terms of this amendment, persons accused of crimes would be denied the ability, I believe, to receive information material in their native language to assist in their own defense. This clearly violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment of our Constitution.""

-- ""I have talked about public health. This amendment will stand in the way of efforts made to facilitate the transmission of vital information necessary for the receipt of health care and public safety, including informed consent by non-English-speaking patients.""

-- ""I hope we reject this amendment. It is bad policy. It is un-American. It turns back the clock on the substantial gains that language minority citizens have made. I hope that there will be a resounding vote against this. I have no problem going home today and telling the people of the State of Nevada: English is the language of America. We are not going to change that with this amendment. This is divisive, it is mean spirited. I think it is the wrong way to go.""

So tell us how you really feel about the amendment, Senator.

Needless to say, Reid voted against it, but with the help of 11 Democrats, the amendment passed 62-35.

Interestingly, the Senate also passed a subsequent amendment (S.AMDT.4073) proposed by then Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., ""to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States, and to preserve and enhance the role of the English language."" Reid voted for that amendment, which passed by a vote of 58 to 39.

The immigration reform bill did not pass that year, however, and when a second stab at comprehensive immigration reform was undertaken in 2007, Inhofe again proposed an amendment (S.AMDT.1151) ""to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States, and for other purposes."" Reid again voted against it, though the measure passed 64-33. But that immigration reform bill never came to pass either. To this day, no ""official language"" exists at the federal level.

The bottom line here is that Reid twice voted against amendments to ""declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States,"" even as he voted for an amendment ""to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States."" The ad says Reid twice voted against declaring English our national language. Reid not only voted against the bills, he was quite vocal in his opposition. We rate the ad's claim True.","[('\nYouTube, Sharron Angle campaign ad, ""The Wave,"" Oct. 25, 2010\n\nPolitico, ""Robert Menendez calls Sharron Angle\'s ad racist,"" by Scott Wong, Oct. 27, 2010\n\nLibrary of Congress website, S.Amdt 4064, Amendment to declare English as the national language of the United States, May 17, 2006\n\nLibrary of Congress website, S.Amdt 4073, Amendment to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States, May 18, 2006\n\nLibrary of Congress website, S.Amdt 1151, Amendment to to declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States, June 6, 2007\n\nTulsa World (Oklahoma), ""Inhofe pursues English-only bills,"" by Jim Myers, May 7, 2009\n\nCapitol Hill Press Releases, Press release: ""Inhofe Offers English Amendment to Fraud Bill,"" April 22, 2009\n\nThe Washington Times, ""Reid calls language proposal racist,"" by\xa0 Charles Hurt, May 31, 2006\n\nCongressional Quarterly Weekly, ""Senate Plunges Back Into Debate,"" by Elizabeth B.

Is Ohio treasurer candidate Josh Mandel a ‘decorated’ Marine?
","
Any voter who has seen TV commercials for Republican Ohio treasurer candidate Josh Mandel know he has a military background. Part of Mandel’s campaign strategy is to weave his military service into his candidacy, and the military images prevalent in the commercials work toward that goal.

In the commercials, Mandel is described as a ""Decorated Marine.""

""Decorated Marine, two-tour Iraq war vet – Josh Mandel’s led a life of integrity and results,"" says the narrator for the commercial titled, ""Tested and Trusted.""

Since Mandel has attached his candidacy to his military service, we decided to check what it means to be a decorated Marine, and if Mandel fits the bill.

Mandel, a state representative from Lyndhurst, provided a list of nine medals earned during his service, including two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals he earned for his tours of Iraq.

""When you earn decorations, you’re a decorated Marine,"" he said. ""It’s pretty cut and dried.""

The U.S. Marines Corps agreed.

Major Shawn Haney, a public affairs officer for the Marine Corps’ manpower and reserve affairs department, which maintains personnel files, confirmed Mandel had received medals that qualified him as a decorated Marine.

""He has awards that he would wear,"" Haney said. ""If he calls himself a decorated Marine, he’s not incorrect.""

A decorated Marine is ""a Marine who receives an award during his or her service,"" Lt. Gregory Wolf, another media officer for the Marine Corps, told PolitiFact in an e-mail. Wolf said Mandel’s medals put him in that category.

Mandel, 33, enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves in 2000, shortly before he graduated from Ohio State University. He served two tours in Iraq – one in 2004, the other in 2007-08 – for a combined 15 months. Mandel served as an intelligence specialist both times, working with other Marines to build relations with local Iraqis and figure out who among the civilians could pose a threat to troops trying to maintain peace.

Mandel’s Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals are known as personal medals, meaning they were awarded for individual acts Mandel performed.

The criteria for earning the achievement medal, according the Marine Corps, is for ""meritorious service or achievement in a combat or noncombat situation based on sustained performance or specific achievement of a superlative nature, and shall be of such merit as to warrant more tangible recognition than is possible by a fitness report or evaluation sheet, but which does not warrant a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal or higher.""

Haney, of the manpower and reserve affairs department, pointed out that Mandel’s achievement medals, while earned in Iraq, do not include the valor device, which denotes performance in combat.

Other medals he earned, such as the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, are known as unit medals, given to soldiers who participated in specific operations defined by the military.

Given the list of medals Mandel has earned and the Marine Corps’ inclusive definition of the term ""decorated Marine,"" Mandel certainly qualifies.

We find the statement True.","[('\nJosh Mandel for State Treasurer, ""Tested and Trusted,"" posted to YouTube Sept. 22, 2010\n\nInterview with state Rep. Josh Mandel\n\nInterview with Maj.

Tom Perriello says Robert Hurt wants to reopen Medicare ""doughnut hole"" in prescription drug plan
","
It is legislation that shall remain nameless. But that didn't stop freshmen Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello of Virginia from attacking his opponent for opposing a provision in it, whatever it is.

Perriello's ad, called ""Seniors Can't Afford a World of Hurt,"" accuses his opponent, Republican state Sen. Robert Hurt, of wanting to reopen the so-called ""doughnut hole"" in Medicare prescription drug coverage for seniors.

The ad begins in darkness with an elderly woman saying, ""Bad people are trying to scare seniors into thinking our Medicare is going to get cut."" She's apparently referring to Republican ads that have suggested Democrats cut Medicare when they approved the health care law.

""Poppycock!"" says the woman, turning on a light. ""Tom Perriello has voted to protect my Medicare and to save me 50 percent on my prescriptions.

""Mr Hurt would reopen that darn doughnut hole,"" she says. ""And would start bankrupting Medicare in just six years. Shed some light on the facts and you'll see...Seniors can't afford a world of Hurt.""

First, let's be clear what we're talking about here: the controversial health care bill passed by Democrats earlier this year.

You might not get that from the ad, unless you caught the fine print in the ad that sourced H.R. 3590. Of course, you'd also have to know that H.R. 3590 is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka the health care reform bill. Talk about soft-pedaling a controversial issue.

Now, about that darn doughnut hole. The ""hole"" is a gap in coverage in the Medicare prescription drug program, which was passed by Congress in 2003.

In 2010, seniors in the Medicare Part D program must pay the first $310 for prescriptions before coverage kicks in. For subsequent total drug costs between $310 and $2,830, the government will pay 75 percent and beneficiaries pay 25 percent.

Then comes the hole: Starting at $2,830, beneficiaries must pay the entire costs until they hit an out-of-pocket limit of $4,550. After that, ""catastrophic coverage"" begins, with the government paying 95 percent of costs.

The health care bill Democrats passed in March would phase out that gap over the next 10 years. This year, beneficiaries who reach the doughnut hole will receive a $250 rebate. After that, federal subsidies will enable the patient's share of the payment to be gradually reduced from 100 percent to 25 percent by 2020. At 25 percent, the doughnut hole range will have the same co-pay rate as the prior range.

Closing the ""doughnut hole"" in the Medicare prescription drug plan was one of Obama's campaign promises, which PolitiFact tracks on our Obameter. In March, after the bill passed and was signed by Obama, we rated it a Promise Kept.

Now, has Hurt said he wants to reopen the hole?

He has been crystal clear about his opposition to the health care bill. At a Tea Party debate in March, for example, Hurt warned the bill would ""kill jobs,"" add more regulation and higher taxes and amount to ""government-run health care.""

Hurt has signed the DeFundIt.org pledge to withhold budget funding for the new health care law if he is elected. And he has vowed to fight to repeal the law altogether.

OK, so the health care bill would eventually close the Medicare doughnut hole, and Hurt has vowed to defund and ultimately repeal the health care bill. Does that mean, necessarily, that he would reopen the doughnut hole?

Republican leaders in Congress offered an alternative health care bill back in November of 2009. We read through the bill and couldn't find any plan to close the doughnut hole. Republicans said the main goal of their alternative plan was to lower the cost of health insurance in general.

We also couldn't find anywhere that Hurt has spoken publicly on what he would do, specifically, about the Medicare doughnut hole. Hurt's campaign said he favors health care reform based on market oriented solutions that maintain quality of care and reduce costs.

Back in March, the Hurt campaign told the The Daily Progress, in Charlottesville, Va., that Hurt supports ""commonsense, market-based health care reforms"" such as portability of plans, tort reform and allowing young people to remain on their parents' health insurance coverage for longer.

""However, Senator Hurt does not believe that Draconian cuts to Medicare affecting every senior citizen in the 5th District, half-a-trillion in higher taxes, medical decisions made by bean-counters in Washington and not doctors in Charlottesville -- not to mention the largest increase in government power in generations -- is the answer to healthcare reform,"" Hurt's strategist, Chris LaCivita, wrote in an e-mail to the paper.

We followed up with the Hurt campaign to get his position specifically on the doughnut hole.

""Working to close the doughnut hole is an area that we all can agree should be addressed,"" said Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for the Hurt campaign.
 
The ad's claim is based on Hurt's position that he wants to repeal the Democrats' health care bill in general, and it included a provision to phase out the doughnut hole. Hurt has not explicitly said he wants to reopen the hole, so Perriello is connecting some dots to make his case.  In fact, Hurt's campaign says that while he wants to repeal the health care bill, Hurt believes working to close the doughnut hole is an area that should be addressed. That doesn't strike us as a full-throated pledge to close the gap the way the Democratic bill did, but it suggests Hurt is willing to consider retaining that aspect of the health care law. So we rate the ad's claim Half True.","[('\nYouTube, Tom Perriello campaign ad, ""Seniors Can\'t Afford a World of Hurt,"" Oct. 6, 2010\n\nH.R. 3590, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\nPolitiFact, Obama campaign promise: ""Close the \'doughnut hole\' in Medicare prescription drug plan,"" by Louis Jacobson, March 26, 2010\n\nYouTube, Sen.

NRCC targets Mike McIntyre over Social Security
","
Scaring voters about what could happen to Social Security if your opponent wins the election is a time-honored tradition in political ads, especially when Democrats are making the accusation. But in something of a twist, the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the campaign arm of House Republicans -- is using Social Security as a cudgel against a Democrat, seven-term Rep. Mike McIntyre of North Carolina.

Here's the transcript of the ad:

Narrator: ""Mike McIntyre and Nancy Pelosi are not being honest with North Carolina seniors.""

McIntyre: ""I'll never risk your Social Security.""

Narrator. ""But McIntyre and Pelosi's big spending is robbing our Social Security trust fund. Social Security is billions in debt, and this year will be operating in the red. And now for the second year in a row, there's no cost-of-living increase for North Carolina seniors. Mike McIntyre and Nancy Pelosi: Their spending is putting our Social Security at risk.""

We've written at some length about the question of whether Social Security is ""billions in debt"" and ""operating in the red."" So this time, we thought we'd tackle the notion that McIntyre and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- the ad's boogeyman and boogeywoman -- are responsible for the fact that ""for the second year in a row, there's no cost-of-living increase for North Carolina seniors.""

We'll begin by pointing out that North Carolina seniors aren't alone in this fate. Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, are calculated on a national basis, not by individual state.

But how are they calculated? Here's the long answer.

Until 1975, it took an act of Congress to adjust Social Security payments for inflation. But a law enacted in 1972 and signed by President Richard Nixon created a formula to automatically calculate the increase every year. The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment was tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).

The government compares that index in the third quarter (July, August and September) of the current year to the third quarter of the previous year. Until recently, every year since the formula was put into effect, that calculation led to a cost-of-living increase. In fact, high oil prices in the summer of 2008 helped produce a sizable COLA increase in January 2009 of 5.8 percent -- the highest increase in more than a quarter century.

But lower energy prices and the effects of the recession combined to reduce the CPI-W during the period used to calculate the 2010 Social Security increase. So in a break with tradition, there was no upward adjustment for Social Security recipients for this year. When we last looked at this question in January 2010, we reported that for someone with a $3,054 monthly benefit -- a comparatively generous amount, based on what a steady earner at the maximum level would get every month if he or she had retired in 2009 at age 70 -- the amount forgone this year was $1,099 over the course of the year compared to what would have been added with a 3 percent cost-of-living adjustment. Most recipients would take a much smaller hit, according to Social Security Administration tables.

And earlier this month, the Social Security Administration announced that there will be no increase for Social Security recipients in 2011, either.

So the ad is correct that Social Security beneficiaries will go without an inflation bump for the second straight year. But that's not the whole story.

First, there may not be an increase in benefits for next year, but it's because on the whole, seniors' cost of living isn't increasing. (That's the idea anyway; individual circumstances can and do vary.) And beneficiaries had already received a big bump for 2009. If current patterns hold, seniors should finally be due for a new bump in benefits for 2012.

Second, some people contributing to Social Security will actually benefit from not having a Social Security increase. When benefits don't go up, neither does the $106,800 limit on earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax.

Third -- and most important for analyzing the ad -- McIntyre and Pelosi had nothing at all to do with eliminating the COLA for 2010 and 2011. As we indicated, whether or not Social Security hands out an increase is determined by a mathematical calculation -- not by Congressional prerogative. Short of changing the decades-old law, there's nothing McIntyre or Pelosi could have done to provide beneficiaries with an increase in either of the two years.

However, there's one more factor worth noting. Pelosi and other Democrats have proposed giving seniors a one-time $250 payment in lieu of a cost-of-living adjustment, as was done after the first non-COLA announcement. But nothing g can be done until after the election. It is this proposal that the NRCC uses to back up the claim.

In an interview, an NRCC spokesman argued that the proposed COLA ""fixes"" may not win passage because of recklessly large spending by Congressional Democrats.

The NRCC has a point, but Pelosi's office says that a vote is planned for November, and in any case, it strikes us as a bit of a convoluted explanation for the ad's claim. The simpler explanation -- and the one that we think most viewers would take away from the ad -- is that McIntyre and Pelosi had something directly to do with eliminating a cost-of-living increase for two consecutive years in the first place. Even though the ad carefully avoids an explicit accusation that McIntyre and Pelosi voted to eliminate the COLA, we think the ad implies otherwise. So we rate this part of the ad Barely True.","[('\nNational Republican Congressional Committee, ""Mike McIntyre Is Putting Social Security At Risk"" (ad), Oct. 23, 2010', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjflkPZOVWI'), ('\nPolitiFact, ""Chain e-mail says Congress raised own salaries while acting to kill Social Security benefit hikes,"" Jan. 22, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact, ""Democratic exaggerations about \'privatizing Social Security,\'"" Sept. 2, 2010', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/22/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-congress-raised-own-salaries-whi/'), ('\nPolitiFact Texas, ""Bachmann says Social Security is running a deficit and borrowing from the general treasury,"" June 11, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nAssociated Press, ""Gov\'t: No increase for Social Security next year,"" Oct. 15, 2010', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2010/sep/02/democratic-exaggerations-about-privatizing-social-/'), ('\nNancy Pelosi, ""Pelosi Statement Supporting the Seniors Protection Act, Providing Relief for Seniors"" (news release), Oct. 14, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nE-mail interview with David John, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, Oct. 27, 2010', 'https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2010/jun/24/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-social-security-running-deficit-and-/'), ('\nE-mail interview with Paul Van de Water, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Oct. 27, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nE-mail interview with Nadeam Elshami, spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Oct. 28, 2010', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/15/AR2010101500411.html'), ('\nInterview with Andy Sere, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, Oct. 28, 2010', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-targets-mike-mcintyre-over-social-security/

Group says GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker gave himself a $50,000 raise as Milwaukee County executive

A group that backs Democrat Tom Barrett in the 2010 campaign for governor of Wisconsin accuses the Republican nominee, Scott Walker, of fattening his own wallet as Milwaukee County executive.

In a flier, the group Advancing Wisconsin casts Barrett as a fighter for jobs and education and as a cutter of waste. Walker is denounced as favoring big corporations over families on taxes and opposing a minimum wage increase ""even though he increased his own pay by $50,000.""

That’s a claim that might raise both your eyebrows.

Walker was elected county executive in 2002 in the wake of a scandal over lavish county pensions. One of Walker’s campaign pledges, which he kept, was that he would return $60,000 of his pay to the county every year.

At the time, the county executive’s salary was $132,724. In 2004, the County Board cut the salary to $129,114 in 2004. (It’s important to note only the board, not the county executive, can change the salary.)

As support, Advancing Wisconsin cites a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story from March 2008. The article notes Walker said then if re-elected in April 2008, he would return $10,000 of his salary each year to the county.

Walker was re-elected and now gives back $10,000, rather than $60,000.

To Advancing Wisconsin, that’s increasing his pay by $50,000, even though Walker is still taking home less than what his salary provides.

Hmmm.

If you were one of the many people who suffered a pay cut during the Great Recession, and your employer later restored most of that money, would you feel you had received a pay increase?      

In Walker’s case, the pay cuts were voluntary, but otherwise the scenario is the same.

We asked Advancing Wisconsin executive director Meagan Mahaffey if she had more to back up her organization’s claim. She said that when Walker made his 2002 promise to return $60,000 per year, he ""did not indicate that it was a temporary pledge.""

Nor did he say it was an eternal one.

And Walker was upfront with voters when he set the salary giveback for his current term as county executive at $10,000 per year. He was re-elected on that basis.

So let’s review our math.

In support of Democrat Tom Barrett, Advancing Wisconsin is claiming Republican candidate Scott Walker ""increased his own pay by $50,000"" as Milwaukee County executive. To be sure, Walker used to give back $60,000 of his pay and he’s now giving back $10,000. It’s a smaller giveback, but follow us closely here, still a giveback. To say otherwise, is a cheap shot and, frankly, turns math on its head.

We’ll light up the group’s shot in the dark: Pants on Fire.","[('\nAdvancing Wisconsin campaign flier\n\nE-mail interview with Advancing Wisconsin executive director Meagan Mahaffey, Oct. 22, 2010\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker would lower salary givebacks, March 19, 2008\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin, GOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker says he has given back more than $370,000 of his salary to Milwaukee County, Oct. 6, 2010', 'http://media.journalinteractive.com/documents/barrett_walker_1022101.pdf')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/29/advancing-wisconsin/group-says-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-scott-walke/

Oregon House Republicans say Will Rasmussen was caught misstating his residency
","
House Republicans recently put out a typical looking hit piece on Democratic candidate Will Rasmussen. The mailer features an astonished looking senior in a blue tank top next to the words, ""What did Will Rasmussen say?""

There are several grainy photos of Rasmussen in black and white. On the back, there’s something about him wanting higher taxes -- the usual stuff -- and about his falsely stating how long he’s lived in House District 37.

The mailer reads: ""Will Rasmussen only moved to our community one year ago -- but lied about it thinking he wouldn’t get caught. In fact, he told one local paper that he’d lived here almost twice as long as he really had and then didn’t fess up until they took him to task.""

Rasmussen, an attorney with Miller Nash, faces Julie Parrish in the general election. Rasmussen beat out two other Democrats in the primary.

But in campaigning for the primary, Rasmussen gave a funny sounding answer in his March endorsement interview with Willamette Week. Asked how long he had lived in the district, he replied: ""About a year. I moved here, I moved to the district to buy my first house last fall ....""

WW reporter Beth Slovic later confronted Rasmussen with a record showing he closed on a West Linn condo on March 4. Rasmussen then said he had moved into an apartment in West Linn in September 2009.

Voter records show he updated his registration to reflect the new condo April 2, 2010 -- a day after WW’s story.

So let’s recap: Rasmussen moved to West Linn in September 2009. (A clerk at Clackamas County elections says he registered to vote at an address in West Linn in October 2009.) Seven months later, he tells a reporter he has lived in West Linn ""about a year.""  

Rasmussen’s campaign confirms the residency dates. His campaign manager, Christopher Edmonds, writes: ""When Will interviewed with WW, he said he'd lived in district about a year and at the time he'd lived there about seven months.  WW made a big deal out of nothing.  Of course Will meets the residency requirement.""

Slovic says in response: ""His 'about a year' statement unraveled with just two phone calls...How long he's lived in the district is not that big of a deal, given he meets the minimum requirement for residency. So why would he stretch the truth on something so trivial?""

Why, indeed? Rasmussen does meet the constitutional residency requirement, which is to have lived in the district one year at the time of election. But that wasn’t the question. Seven months is nowhere near a year, no matter how much you stretch the word ""about.""

The House Republican group said Rasmussen ""lied."" It's not possible for us to determine whether he made the misstatement deliberately, with the intent to deceive, but he definitely got the facts wrong. So we find the group's claim True.

Candidates claims to run ""civil"" campaign veer off track
","
Well, everybody seemed to be on the same page when it all started.

The 3-month-old race between former Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, and former Congressman Nathan Deal, a Republican, to determine who will become Georgia's next governor was to be a civil affair, hard-focused on the key issues. Or, so said both campaigns at the outset.

Just listen to Deal spokesman Brian Robinson in a Sept. 13 metro Atlanta television interview:

""They [voters] want a positive vision and Nathan Deal will offer [that] in tone and in message.""

Or Barnes himself in an Aug. 11 TV interview:

""You know, it’s a Southern tradition to be civil and polite. … just because we have differences, doesn’t mean that we have to call each other names.""

Oh really now? 
We thought today -- four days before Election Day -- would be a good time to look back at those lofty campaign goals as the governor’s race nears the finish line. Voters go to the polls on Tuesday to choose between Deal, Barnes or Libertarian John Monds. 
And they’ll have to wade through a lot of noise from one of the nastiest campaigns in recent Georgia history to cast their ballots for the state's next chief executive. 
Here are a few of the campaign’s lowlights, brought to you by the campaigns and their Republican and Democratic surrogates: 
--  Dale Peterson, a failed GOP candidate for Alabama’s agriculture chief, weighs in with a YouTube video for Deal on behalf of the Republican Governors Association. 
Wearing a white cowboy hat and brandishing a vintage lever-action rifle across his shoulders, Peterson reminds viewers that Georgia voters fired Barnes in 2002 after one term in office: ""He screwed things up so badly y'all chunked him out."" 
Peterson adds: ""He's just the same old amb’lance chaser he’s always been."" 
-- The Barnes camp enlisted its own cast of colorful rural types in a television ad that featured two old geezers sipping coffee in a folksy cafe. They incrementally ramp up the trash talk as they bash Deal. Finally one of them delivers a zinger: 
""He’s slippery as a bag of snakes,"" one man intones as the pair breaks into howls of laughter. 
And those were just warm-up exercises in character assassination that prefaced what was to become outright fabrication by both camps. 
-- The Barnes camp conceded that it added fake audio questions to the soundtrack of a TV ad that shows Deal leaving a debate, apparently trying to evade reporters.
""Why won't you answer questions?"" a male reporter appears to yell at Deal in the ad. Then a woman yells: ""Why won't you answer questions?"" Trouble was, those reporters did not exist. The Barnes camp simply added audio to make the footage appear more dramatic.

-- The Deal camp, meanwhile, ran a TV ad showing a ""quote"" from a Barnes campaign aide that was never uttered. The ad quoted Barnes spokeswoman Anna Ruth Williams saying, ""Barnes represented the child molester."" She never said those words. The Deal campaign later attributed the quote to an ""Ann Williams.""

And then there were the just-plain-awful, highly misleading attacks by both camps on the other candidate’s voting records two decades back:

-- In one, Barnes accused Deal of trying to weaken Georgia's rape shield law. PolitiFact Georgia earlier ruled that Half True because it left out critical context. A male narrator in the ad asks viewers to consider ""How many rapes would go unreported?"" if the rape shield law had been weakened.

-- Deal, meanwhile, accused Barnes of trying to make it more difficult to convict child molesters. PolitiFact Georgia ruled that one Barely True, finding it contained only a trace of truthfulness. ""Barnes voted against a bill in the state Senate that would have made it easier to gain convictions in child abuse cases,"" Deal said in a press release. 
University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said this year’s campaign is one for the books when you rate it on the Nastymeter. 
""It’s unprecedented for Georgia,"" Bullock said. ""It’s been the harshest campaign we’ve seen for governor.""

Much of the uncivil behavior was predictable. Both campaigns had huge war chests, and well-heeled allies on both the Democratic and Republican fronts were more than willing to join the fray. Polls have shown the race relatively close, which always makes for a bruising campaign. And both Barnes and Deal have long political records each side can target.

Kennesaw State University professor Kerwin Swint, who teaches a class on campaigns and elections, said Barnes and Deal have resorted to attack ads for a simple reason: They work.

""It does with regular voters because they’re more likely to pay attention,"" said Swint. ""It puts attention on the other candidate’s vulnerability.""

But it also leads to an uninformed electorate, numbed by the endless attacks and counterattacks. Somewhere amid it all, the real issues confronting Georgia get lost.

Smoke is rising from this gubernatorial battleground, and it long ago obscured both camps' vows to run a ""civil"" and ""positive"" campaign. The race has been about as uncivil and negative as they come.

We give both the Deal and Barnes campaigns our lowest rating: Pants On Fire.","[('\nTelephone interview with Barnes campaign spokeswoman Anna Ruth Williams, Oct. 25, 2010\n\nTelephone interview with Kennesaw State University professor Kerwin Swint, Oct. 27, 2010\n\nTelephone interview with University of Georgia professor Charles Bullock, Oct. 27, 2010\n\nE-mail from Barnes campaign spokesman Emil Runge, Oct. 26, 2010\n\nRoy Barnes in TV interview with Channel 2 Action News, Aug. 11, 2010\n\nSavannah Morning News, ""Barnes, Deal bash each other with hard-hitting ads,"" Oct. 16, 2010\n\nNathan Deal for Governor television ad, ""How""', 'http://savannahnow.com/news/2010-10-16/barnes-deal-bash-each-other-hard-hitting-ads-0'), ('\nWXIA-TV, ""Deal’s anti-Barnes ad""', 'No link'), ('\nNathan Deal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson, television interview with WGCL-TV\n\nPeterson ad:\n\nBag of snakes ad:', 'http://www.11alive.com/video/default.aspx?bctid=643152611001#/Barnes+Responds+to+Claims+of+Campaign+Attack+Ads./643152611001')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/29/nathan-deal-and-roy-barnes/candidates-claims-run-civil-campaign-veer-track/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'Bill White']","
Bill White says most jobs added during Rick Perry's tenure were government or minimum wage
","
Gov. Rick Perry frequently crows about the Texas economy, lately saying that in his near-decade as governor, Texas has gained more than 850,000 jobs. 
In an Oct. 15 interview, Perry's Democratic opponent didn't challenge that number. However, Bill White told the Texas Tribune: ""Of those 850,000 jobs, most were public-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs."" 
Huh. We hadn't heard that. 
Katy Bacon, White's spokeswoman, later said that White thinks that being able to attract high-wage jobs is crucial to the state's long-term economic growth. Texas is a national leader in low-wage jobs, she said, sounding a down note that reminded us of Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Linda Chavez-Thompson's claim that Texas leads the nation in its share of minimum-wage employees, a statement we rated True in May. 
In 2009, 474,000 Texas workers — 8.5 percent of the hourly work force — earned the federal minimum wage or less, according to a March 11 news release from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the highest proportion of low-wage earners in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the release said. 
We wondered how many of those jobs were created on Perry's watch, per White's claim that most of the employment gains touted by the governor were jobs that paid minimum wage or were in the public sector. 
First, some background: The 850,000 figure touted by Perry and dissected by White reflects the net increase in nonfarm jobs in the state from January 2001, soon after Perry became governor, through June 2010 (actual gain = 853,400). In September, we rated True the statement in Perry's ""Texas: Open for Business"" TV ad that ""we've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined."" However, updated statistics show that through August, the net jobs gained had decreased to 818,500. We also noted that the Texas State Data Center has projected that the Texas population grew by about 4 million between 2001 and 2010. 
When asked to back up White's breakdown of the job gains, the White campaign provided a spreadsheet of calculations using bureau data to show the rise in both government-sector jobs and minimum-wage jobs in Texas. The campaign looked at several time periods, including the one favored by the Perry campaign, January 2001 to June 2010, and others that incorporated the most recent data available, through August 2010. 
In an accompanying letter, Tom McCasland, a research analyst for White's campaign, said their calculations showed that government and minimum-wage jobs accounted for 62.8 percent to 69.5 percent of the total job gains. For the time period corresponding to the 850,000 figure (January 2001 to June 2010), the relevant portion of the job gains was 67.5 percent, according to McCasland's information. 
But in reviewing their math, we found several wrinkles: 
1) The bureau's information on public sector and minimum-wage jobs come from different sources that gather data at different time intervals, said Cheryl Abbot, the bureau's regional economist in Dallas. The employment information by sector is compiled monthly while the minimum-wage job situation is examined annually. In this case, that means the time periods for the two categories don't match exactly. 
2) Our calculation of the increase in minimum-wage jobs in Texas during Perry's tenure (259,000) didn't match White's (267,000). Why the discrepancy? We used the bureau's most recent information to compare the number of minimum-wage jobs in Texas in 2001 and 2009. McCasland said he had used older bureau information and had compared 2002 with 2009. 
3) Another issue: The federal minimum wage increased three times between 2001, when it was $5.15 an hour, and 2010 — rising to $5.85 in 2007, to $6.55 in 2008, and to $7.25 in 2009. These stair-step jumps brought some above-minimum wage jobs down into the minimum-wage-or-below fold. During the years the minimum wage held steady at $5.15 (1998-2006), the number of Texas workers making at or below that amount actually declined slightly, except for a small uptick in 2003. 
From 2006 to 2009, Abbot said, ""just over 300,000 more Texans"" entered that low-paid category. However, ""we have no way of determining if those are actually 'new jobs' or, more likely, workers whose pay rate is now equal to or below the increased federal minimum wage,"" she said. 
That's a fair point, McCasland said. Then he made one of his own: ""Because Gov. Perry continues to talk about net job creation, it is appropriate to look at how many of those net jobs end up as minimum-wage jobs, either because they were created as such or because they become minimum-wage jobs by failing to keep up with inflation."" 
Lastly, we realized White's calculations assume that government jobs and minimum-wage jobs are entirely separate categories; what if there's overlap and White counted some jobs twice? Abbot told us that's possible but that there's no way to know because the bureau doesn't have data broken down that way. 
""The best I can tell you is that at the national level — which may or may not represent Texas at all — among all hourly-paid public sector workers, 2.3 percent were paid at or below the prevailing minimum wage"" in 2009, Abbot said. 
Texas Workforce Commission spokeswoman Ann Hatchitt told us the commission doesn't keep detailed information on minimum-wage workers in Texas, including how many are in the public sector. 
What we know: Texas added 853,400 jobs from January 2001 through June 2010. Of those, 308,800 were government jobs. That's about 36 percent. 
To prove White's statement that most (more than 50 percent) of the new jobs were public-sector and minimum wage, an additional 117,901 would have had to be jobs that paid at or below minimum wage. But we can't calculate that because the bureau's count of minimum-wage jobs doesn't discriminate between brand-new jobs and pre-existing ones that were swept into the count when the minimum wage went up. 
We asked experts including University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh and Bruce Kellison, associate director of UT's Bureau of Business Research, whether we could make a ballpark estimate of how many of the job gains under Perry were minimum wage. Each of them said nope, primarily because employment data doesn't break it out. 
Summing up: White's campaign presented raw numbers suggesting that about two-thirds of the jobs added on Perry's watch were either government-sector or minimum-wage. But that methodology lacks critical information that could easily lead to a different conclusion. That's why we rate the statement Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.","[('\nTexas Tribune, ""Bill White: The Full Hour Interview,"" Oct. 15, 2010, start with 34:00', 'https://vimeo.com/15913005'), ('\nE-mail from Katy Bacon, communications director, Bill White for Texas, Oct. 25, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact Texas, ""Texas has the highest proportion of workers earning minimum wage or less,"" May 13, 2010', 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/102710_baconemail1.pdf'), ('\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Southwest Information Office, ""Minimum wage workers in Texas: 2009,"" March 11, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact Texas, ""Gov.

A.G. candidate Little says Kilmartin has only three years of experience in his own law practice
","
Christopher Little, the Moderate Party's candidate for attorney general, has been attacking the qualifications of his Democratic opponent, Peter Kilmartin, by saying he has meager experience as a lawyer.

""Only the insider candidate could have a hope of being attorney general with only three years experience in his own law practice. But that's what Kilmartin has,"" Little says in a television ad as it displays the words ""Started private practice in 2007.""

After the Kilmartin campaign issued a news release labeling Little's accusation ""completely false,"" we decided to see if the Truth-O-Meter would agree.

Kilmartin's campaign says he has been a practicing lawyer since 1999, when he was admitted to the Rhode Island Bar. And Kilmartin has been touting his additional experience working as the officer in charge of the Pawtucket police prosecution bureau from 2001-2004.

Kilmartin spokesman Brett Broesder sent us a copy of a Citizens Bank statement showing that Kilmartin opened up a business account prior to May 1, 1999; the address lists a law office at 393 Armistice Blvd, Pawtucket, where his name is on the sign beneath the names of three other attorneys.

When asked for evidence of an early case that Kilmartin handled as a practicing attorney, Broesder sent along a District Court eviction notice for nonpayment of $425 in rent, listing Kilmartin as the landlord's lawyer. The date: July 14, 1999.

Of course, one eviction notice does not a legal career make, so we asked for more, especially after we were unable to find Kilmartin's name listed in the ""lawyers"" section of any edition of the Verizon Yellow Pages from 2001-2005.

In response, the campaign supplied us with copies of Kilmartin's Schedule C forms from his 1999-2005 tax returns.  Schedule C is for reporting business profits and expenses. His business is listed as ""legal services"" and gives a new address of 598 Armistice Blvd., which is Kilmartin's residence.

But the dollar amounts are blacked out, so we have no idea of the scope of his business, how many clients he has had over the years, or whether the blacked out figures were profits or losses. We asked his campaign to at least tell us his minimum or maximum income for any of those years. His spokesman declined.

So it appears that although Kilmartin wasn't actively advertising his services to the general public (at least through the phone book), Kilmartin was doing at least some private practice work eight years earlier than Little's ad asserts.

The Little campaign responded to our query by sending information showing that Kilmartin retired from the police department in 2007. Spokesman Robert LaChance asserted that between his police job and his work as a state representative in the General Assembly, Kilmartin could not have been an ""active"" lawyer until 2007 because he had other responsibilities.

LaChance said the ""active practice"" designation is important, citing R.I. Supreme Court rules that say an out-of-state attorney is allowed to skip part of the Rhode Island Bar Association examination only if he or she has been in full-time practice for at least five years.

But that rule doesn't apply to Kilmartin, who has had the right to practice in Rhode Island for more than a decade.

LaChance said that ""As far as what most lawyers would consider legal experience, [Kilmartin] has only been doing that for three years"" when he retired from the police department.

Maybe so.

But Little's claim in his commercial makes no distinction between being a full-time (""active"") or part-time lawyer. It says he has ""only three years experience in his own law practice.""

Kilmartin's tax forms, showing that he was doing some degree of legal work -- as limited as it might be -- well before 2007 shows otherwise.

The Truth-O-Meter rules that Little's claim is False.",[],/factchecks/2010/oct/29/christopher-little/g-candidate-little-says-kilmartin-has-only-three-y/
