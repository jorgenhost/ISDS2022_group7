Donald Trump's false claim that Oakland, Ferguson are 'among the most dangerous in the world'
","Donald Trump named Oakland and Ferguson among the ""most dangerous"" cities in the world in a recent New York Times magazine interview. Reporter Robert Draper asked Trump to name the most dangerous place in the world he’s been. ""Brooklyn,"" the Queens-native-turned-Manhattanite joked. Then he said.""There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously."" Seriously? Trump’s right that a few places in the United States have some of the highest murder rates across the globe — but Oakland and Ferguson are not among them. Experts also pointed out that homicide and other crimes in these cities disportionately affect certain demographics, so it’s not a one-danger-fits-all scenario. Factoring in other security concerns, such as war, terrorism, kidnappings, natural disasters, and other types of violence, even high-crime American cities start looking pretty safe compared to the rest of the world. Murder he tweeted Before we dive into the data, we should note that comparing crime across countries is difficult and discouraged due to disparities in legal definitions, incident reporting and data collection, and social and political contexts. Homicide rates, however, are generally safe to compare. By that metric, four American cities crack the top 50 most dangerous places in the world, as others have noted. The Mexico-based nonprofit Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad Publica y la Justicia (CCSP) compiles an annual list of the highest murder rates in the world in cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants. Out of the 50 cities in its 2015 rankings, 21 are in Brazil, eight are in Venezuela (including the murder capital of the world, Caracas), and five are in Mexico. At No. 15, St. Louis is the top-ranking U.S. city in 2015 with a rate of 59.23 per 100,000 inhabitants. Baltimore comes in at No. 19, Detroit is No. 28 and New Orleans is No. 32. Though Trump highlighted one specific murder near Oakland last year on Twitter (the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco) and repeatedly warned of riots in Ferguson following the shooting death of Michael Brown in 2014, the homicide rates in both places are nowhere near as high as the places listed by CCSP. According to FBI data from 2014 (the latest complete year on record), Oakland reported 80 murders for a population of 410,000 for a rate of 19.51. Ferguson, with two murders for 21,000 people, had a rate of 9.48. Oakland and Ferguson do not appear in the CCSP ranking of the highest murder rates in the world. Here’s how the two cities cited by Trump stack up next to the top 50:  Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf blasted Trump’s claim on Twitter, writing, ""The most dangerous place in America is Donald Trump's mouth."" But Trump would have actually been right about Oakland in 2012, when it placed at No. 43 on CCSP’s list with a homicide rate of 33.10. That was a peak year for Oakland though, and the city didn’t rank in 2011, 2013 or 2014 either. In 2012, four more U.S. cities (Flint, Mich.; Jackson, Miss.; Newark, N.J.; and Birmingham, Ala.)  with populations of 100,000 or more had a higher murder rate than the No. 50 city of Barranquilla, Colombia, with its rate of 29.41. Ferguson’s crime rates, meanwhile, are nowhere near the higher reaches of violent crime in the United States, let alone the world. Because of its small population size, its murder rates vary wildly from any given year. For example, there were five murders in 2011 giving it a rate of 23.5 but the town reported no murders in 2010 for a rate of 0. Ferguson is also part of the greater St. Louis area. Frank Zimring, a crime expert at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that most high-crime American cities have a high concentration of African-Americans, who are also the vast majority of the victims. At its peak in 2006, Zimring noted, only six of Oakland’s 149 homicide victims were non-Hispanic whites. ""Whether or not a city is dangerous to you because of the homicide rate, you have to look at who’s being killed,"" said Matthew Bradley, the regional security director for the Americas at the travel security company, International SOS. ""It is the profile of the person who’s there that matters."" Make America Safe Again? Of course, murder isn’t the only danger people face. Overall, no American city is ""among the most dangerous in the world.""   International SOS is the world’s largest travel-security firm and operates in around 1,000 cities in 90 countries including conflict zones like Baghdad, Iraq, and high-crime cities like Caracas, Venezuela. ""We don’t have any city in the United States rated as high or even medium risk — all are low risk,""  Bradley said. ""I can name at least 20 cities more dangerous than St. Louis."" It’s not just about risk; it’s also about the ability to mitigate risk, Bradley explained. So International SOS looks at a variety of factors beyond crime rates like anecdotal evidence, news and social media reports and the capabilities of local authorities. For example, after the Paris terrorist attacks in November 2015, the likelihood of more bombings was still very low because French authorities responded swiftly with hundreds of raids. However, International SOS raised Istanbul’s risk to medium after a series of bombings in the city that authorities had not been able to deter. Despite high crime rates in certain hotspots in specific U.S. cities, police and other authorities are typically responsive and able to contain emergencies. ""The national security apparatus of the United States provides resources that can’t be matched by any place in the world. No country can match that,"" Bradley said. Global consulting firm Mercer, which releases an annual ranking of quality of life standards around the world, shared its safety rankings with PolitiFact. Out of 230 cities, the lowest-ranked U.S. cities were Atlanta, Detroit and St. Louis, all tied at No. 107. Meanwhile, San Francisco tied with Chicago, Honolulu and Houston as the safest U.S cities at No. 54. So where are the most dangerous places in the world? Mercer named Baghdad as the least-safe city in the world. Other war-torn and terrorized cities like Damascus, Syria, Nairobi, Kenya, and Tripoli, Libya, rounded out the 20 least-safe places. The consulting firm’s list matches up with the U.S. State Department’s list of travel warnings. As of May 25, the State Department is discouraging visiting 37 countries for a number of security reasons, from pervasive violence in Venezuela and the Congo to war zones in Syria and Iraq. International SOS, meanwhile, currently has an evacuation status in place for Syria, Yemen, Libya and a few other countries ravaged by conflict. Unlike Caracas, Baghdad and Johannesburg, mitigating risk in a city like Damascus is difficult if not near impossible. Travelers there face improvised explosive devices and other unpredictable threats. In short, there are definitely more dangerous places than Oakland, Ferguson and other American cities. ""I don’t have my head on a swivel in Doylestown, Pa.,"" Bradley said. ""If I ever walked outside my house in Honduras — well, I never did."" Our ruling Trump said, ""There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously."" Four American cities — though not Oakland or Ferguson — have some of the highest murder rates in the world. However, experts told us homicide rates alone are not enough to gauge whether a city is dangerous or not. In considering other security threats like war, terrorism, kidnappings, and other violence as well as the ability to mitigate risks, U.S. cities are nowhere near the most dangerous in the world.

Donald Trump's Pants on Fire claim that US is letting in 'tens of thousands' of terrorists now
","Donald Trump has advocated for a ""temporary"" ban on Muslims coming into the United States to prevent any terrorists from crossing the border. But are there already tens of thousands of terrorists coming into the country now? That’s what he claimed in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. ""Look, we are at war with these people, and they don't wear uniforms,"" Trump said during the May 23, 2016, interview. ""It's not your traditional war where it's a war against Germany, Japan, or whoever. This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now."" As with some previous Trump comments we’ve analyzed, this remark is all over the place, making it hard to parse. And the Trump campaign did not get back to us to clarify what he meant. Still, we decided to take a closer look. On the one hand, by referring to ""vicious, violent people,"" Trump seems to be referring to terrorists and violent extremists. But there is no evidence that tens of thousands of terrorists are being admitted into the United States today -- much less that they are being ""allowed"" in, as if there is a visa preference program for terrorists. On the other hand, Trump is in the numerical ballpark if he’s referring to the number of refugees being admitted into the United States every year -- something else he’s expressed reservations about. Currently, the United States accepts 70,000 refugees from around the world -- not just the Middle East -- and that number is poised to grow to 100,000 in 2017 due to scheduled increases from Syria and Iraq. However, this would mean that Trump is saying that all or nearly all refugees are terrorists, including the many who are not even Muslim and who don’t come from the Middle East. This is decidedly not the case, experts agreed. ""Donald Trump is conflating the terrorists with those who flee terror,"" said Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS, originally known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. ""We are not letting in terrorists, we are letting in refugees from terror. His likening refugees to terrorists is not unlike those who said German Jews from Nazi Germany should be denied immigration because they posed a security risk."" Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that is critical of illegal immigration, speculated that when Trump was referring to ""tens of thousands"" he may have been conflating the number of refugees and the much larger population of undocumented immigrants, and also conflating run-of-the-mill violent criminals with terrorists. ""It is correct to say there are tens of thousands of violent criminal aliens,"" Camarota said. ""But remember the total noncitizen population who could be subject to removal is huge, and in any human population of this size there will always be tens of thousands who are criminals."" Of course, even if Trump’s statement could be manhandled into an interpretation that possessed some degree of accuracy, it was still wrong as he stated it. ""Trump is certainly wrong on the facts here,"" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. That said, Gartenstein-Ross added that more reasonable concerns could have been expressed with less ""hyperbolic"" rhetoric. The recent migrant flows from Syria and Iraq into Europe, he said, have provided greater cover for terrorists than experts had predicted early on, and while the United States is not facing as much risk from its ongoing inflow of refugees, that risk is not zero. Just going by the math, some small fraction of refugees can be expected to either be well-concealed operatives who made it through the screening process or, much more likely, people who self-radicalize after arriving in the United States. Still, Gartenstein-Ross agreed that there is no evidence that ""tens of thousands of them"" are already here, as Trump said. Our ruling Trump said, ""Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. … This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now."" There is no evidence that ""tens of thousands"" of terrorists are coming into the United States, much less that they are being ""allowed"" in on purpose. While there may be legitimate counter-terrorism concerns about refugee flows, Trump’s overheated rhetoric complicates rather than clarifies the situation.

Has Old City, ‘land of the 1,000 Snookis,’ mellowed out?
","Old City has had a party reputation the last few years. Bars dominate 2nd and 3rd streets between Market and Chestnut. Philly Mag memorably christened it the land of 1,000 Snookis in a 2010 article. But according to the inaugural ""State of Old City"" report released earlier this month by the neighborhood organization Old City District, the Snookis have moved out and the Sheldon Coopers have moved in. Old City is now inhabited by a booming young, college-educated population and a cluster of tech and marketing businesses. In an interview about the findings with the Philadelphia Business Journal, Old City District executive director Job Itzkowitz expounded on the good news by comparing current Old City to the old party-filled days. ""We used to have more than a dozen clubs and that’s what we were known for,"" he said, ""and now we’re down to two.""    It sure seems like Old City has a nightlife scene that can get a little… douchey? … on Friday and Saturday nights. And if you’re out there, it sure seems like there’s more than two clubs around. We decided to see whether Old City has changed as much as Itzkowitz claims. Let’s start by talking about the definition of a club. Itzkowitz said he was referring to what he termed nuisance establishments, crazy bars with sketchy promoters who brought in disorderly crowds that spilled onto the sidewalks and streets. ""Go back and look at the bars in the 2010 (Philly Mag) article and see how many of them still exist,"" he said. That article mentioned 32 Degrees, Heat, Grey Social Lounge, Cebu, Dreemz, Moda, Blurr, Triada, Bleu Martini and Red Sky as troublesome bars. Only Bleu Martini remains. Barry Gutin, owner of Old City’s Cuba Libre, used to own 32 Degrees. He said club ownership ""can be done well or done poorly."" His definition of a club is a place that is open late at night and have no food or only a small menu to satisfy PLCB requirements. Cuba Libre, for instance, would not fit the bill. Neither would other popular Old City establishments like National Mechanics and Plough and the Stars. The only places that mostly meet that definition are Recess Lounge, Brasil’s Nightclub, B Side Hookah Lounge and Infusion. Bleu Martini actually has a full menu of entrees like filet mignon, sea bass and surf ‘n’ turf. ""If you’re asking are there fewer clubs now and fewer problems now, the answer is yes,"" Gutin said. ""There were a lot of places trying to make money and lowering their standards for clientele to try and survive."" In a regulatory sense, the PLCB separates restaurants from clubs by type of license. Almost all of Old City’s numerous bars have restaurant licenses. The lone place with an active club license in the neighborhood is Recess Lounge. HughE Dillon, Philly celebrity watcher, said Old City used to be ""an out of control, rumble in the street kinda late night area,"" but has lately been pleased with what he regards as a safer late night scene. ""Now,"" he said, ""people just seem to rush to get in line at Big Ass Slices 218 Market Street, when the bars let out.""      Our Ruling Old City District executive director Job Itkowitz claimed the number of Old City clubs had declined from more than a dozen to two. We found at least 10 clubby establishments that have closed in the last several years, and going by different interpretations of ""club"" Old City has somewhere between one and four clubs.    We rule the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/may/25/job-itkzkowitz/has-old-city-land-1000-snookis-mellowed-out/

Scott Walker, who cut funds to Wisconsin university system, says system has its largest budget ever
","The 2015-’16 academic year ended with pomp, circumstance -- and skirmishes between Gov. Scott Walker and professors in the University of Wisconsin System. Walker, irked by no-confidence votes faculty are taking against the system’s leadership, fired attacks on University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors (including one we rated Pants on Fire). Several days later, on May 16, 2016, Walker kept up the offensive in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. ""We have some of the best schools in the country, no doubt about it,"" Walker told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. ""But we’ve got to stop feeding into this national perception that how much you pay in tuition suddenly is a correlation to what the value is. Yeah, you want to have a reasonable level of support for the system; and we do. ""In fact, by the way,"" Walker continued, ""the University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been. The amount of money they get from state government is only a fraction of what they have overall. So, for all this hysteria out there, they have never had more money to spend in the UW System."" With the 2015-’17 state budget, Walker and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature cut $250 million over the two years from the UW System. That was an 11 percent reduction in state support and a big reason for the no-confidence votes. So, we wondered about Walker’s claim that UW System’s budget is the biggest it’s ever been. He’s essentially correct, but with some caveats. Walker was referring to the system’s all-funds budget -- which, as the name suggests, is comprehensive. It includes state tax dollars, but also an array of other funds, such as tuition, revenue from enterprises such as dormitories and athletics, federal research dollars and gifts.   We asked for budget figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for the entire history of the UW System, which began in 1973-'74. Here’s a look at the last six years, when the figures were highest. Year All-funds budget -- actual All-funds budget -- adjusted for inflation 2010-’11 $5.591 billion $6.077 billion 2011-’12 $5.589 billion $5.889 billion 2012-’13 $5.901 billion $6.092 billion 2013-’14 $5.997 billion $6.101 billion 2014-’15 $6.098 billion $6.105 billion 2015-’16 $6.194 billion* $6.059 billion As you might expect, the current all-funds budget (2015-’16) is the largest on record. But with an asterisk. That’s because in 2015-’16, for the first time, the UW System included unspent tuition money carried over from the previous year in its all-funds budget. If that money wasn’t included, the 2015-’16 all-funds budget would have been $6.059 billion -- the second-highest ever, behind 2014-’15, rather than $6.194 billion. Adjusted for inflation -- a better measure for comparing figures over time -- the 2015-’16 all funds budget is slightly smaller than in four of the five previous years, but still near the top. State support Walker made it clear his claim was about total funding for the UW System, and that state money covers only a portion of the system’s budget. But it’s worth noting that, adjusted for inflation, state support of the system -- known as general purpose revenue -- is in a historic decline, according to figures from the fiscal bureau. The highest state support, adjusted for inflation, was in the first year of the system, 1973-’74 -- at just under $1.52 billion. That figure hit an all-time low of $1.03 billion in 2015-’16. UW System officials often cite the reduction in state support because they have generally have more flexibility in spending state tax dollars than with revenues that are designated for certain purposes. Our rating Walker said: ""The University of Wisconsin System budget is the biggest it has ever been."" The system’s 2015-’16 all-funds budget -- which includes not only state tax dollars but federal funds, tuition and other income -- is $6.194 billion, the biggest since the system was created in 1973-’74. But adjusted for inflation, the 2015-’16 all-funds budget is among the biggest, though not the biggest. And the 2015-’16 figure includes unspent tuition revenue that hadn’t been counted in the all-funds budget in previous years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2016/may/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-who-cut-funds-wisconsin-university-sy/
"['Arizona', 'Immigration', 'Ann Kirkpatrick']","
Did John McCain support the Dream Act, then vote against it?
","U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick says Sen. John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington, D.C. On immigration, she said of her U.S. Senate rival, McCain’s changes are especially striking. ""He told dreamers that he’ll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it,"" Kirkpatrick, D-Flagstaff, said in a May 8 interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act would have allowed undocumented children brought to the United States permanent resident status if they, among other provisions, completed two years of college or military service. We wondered if McCain really flipped his position on the Dream Act, as Kirkpatrick claimed. We found that McCain’s stance shifted slightly over more than a decade, but that does not equate to a cut-and-dried flip-flop. McCain’s voting record About a decade ago, McCain supported versions of the Dream Act. He even co-sponsored the 2003 and 2005 versions of the Dream Act, neither of which came to a vote. He did not sponsor the 2007 version of the bill. He also didn’t vote on it. McCain was campaigning for the Republican nomination for president. One of his opponents, Fred Thompson, had derided the legislation as ""stealth amnesty."" When the bill came up again in December 2010, McCain voted against it. The legislation eventually failed after a 55-41 vote in the Senate. What changed? Responding to conservative criticism, McCain stopped pushing for the Dream Act — unless it came with border security. Beefing up the border In November 2007, a month after his skipped vote on the 2007 Dream Act, McCain told the Myrtle Beach Sun-News that he would ""vote against anything unless we secured the borders."" A few months later in February 2008, McCain told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., that ""it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first."" He did not mention the Dream Act in his remarks. After his ""nay"" vote on the legislation in 2010, the senior senator said in a statement that he had ""great sympathy"" for the affected students, but he couldn’t put their needs above law-abiding Americans. ""There simply isn't sufficient political support to do anything before we secure our borders,"" McCain said, ""and there won’t be until we do."" What Kirkpatrick told Sharpton mimics an attack ad her campaign posted earlier in May. The ad claims McCain ""has been on every side of immigration"" and appears to show two clips of the Arizona senator speaking out both for and against the Dream Act. Kirkpatrick’s campaign spokesman provided a clip of McCain’s remarks at an immigration council in San Diego in July 2008 during McCain’s bid for the White House. In the clip, a young woman asks McCain if he would support ""our Dream Act."" McCain said ""yes, yes."" Left unmentioned in Kirkpatrick’s talking point is how he also said existing laws needed to be enforced. ""Yes. Yes. Thank you. But I will also enforce the existing laws of a country. And a nation’s first requirement is the nation’s security, and that’s why we have to have our borders secured. But we can have a way and a process of people obtaining citizenship in this country. And we cannot penalize people who come here legally and people who wait legally. And so that’s a fundamental principle on which we have to operate."" The campaign then contrasts that with McCain’s vote in 2010.   McCain’s campaign spokeswoman pointed out that the senior senator co-sponsored the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration bill, which included a pathway to citizenship that included the Dream Act and also included provisions for border security. He voted yes. The Dream Act portion of the bill, which House Republicans refused to conference after it passed in the Senate, would have created a five-year path to documentation for immigrants, as long as they met requirements such as having a GED or high school diploma. Our ruling Kirkpatrick said, ""McCain told dreamers that he’ll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it.’"" Her statement leaves out important context. McCain’s views has shifted on the Dream Act, but his waning support hasn’t been the complete flip-flop Kirkpatrick makes it out to be. He did vote against the 2010 Dream Act, years after introducing similar measures in the Senate. But he supported the Dream Act in some form after the vote. He voted yes on the 2013 comprehensive immigration legislation that included pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought here as children from other countries. McCain made border security the priority before getting a Dream Act. On balance, we rate Kirkpatrick’s claim as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/17c3bb15-cc01-4495-acb5-16e93f457f77",/factchecks/2016/may/24/ann-kirkpatrick/did-john-mccain-support-dream-act-then-vote-agains/

Waterboarding works, US Senate candidate (and former CIA officer) Todd Wilcox says
","U.S. Senate candidate Todd Wilcox said the controversial interrogation practice of waterboarding isn’t torture but an effective tool in the global war on terror. It gets results, he said. In an interview published in the Miami Herald on May 20, Wilcox blamed the White House for limiting the country’s ability to gain intelligence from alleged terrorists. ""I can tell you that the enhanced interrogation techniques that have since been banned by this administration — specifically waterboarding — work,"" said Wilcox, who is vying for the Republican nomination to replace Sen. Marco Rubio. ""They work on the terrorists, and there's a proven history of that."" Wilcox didn’t consider the practice to be torture, and also said while he didn’t advocate overusing waterboarding, it’s an option that should be available for interrogators.  We wanted to know if waterboarding — strapping a prisoner to a board or table and then pouring water over a cloth covering their mouth and nose to simulate drowning — was a proven method of questioning someone. Torture vs. interrogation Waterboarding was one of the ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" used on terrorism suspects by American interrogators in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. President Barack Obama banned the practice by executive order in 2009. It’s recently been revived in politics after GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump advocated for waterboarding and ""a hell of a lot worse"" should he be elected. Wilcox, an Orlando defense contractor, noted to PolitiFact Florida through his spokeswoman that some high-ranking officials including former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and former CIA Director Leon Panetta credited waterboarding for producing valuable intelligence. The former Green Beret and CIA officer told the Herald that he has ""access to a lot of information that the rest of the public may not know"" from which to draw his conclusion. But PolitiFact can’t make a judgment based on information that's classified or otherwise not readily available to the public, so we don't consider that assertion as proof. Wilcox didn’t elaborate further on his assertion there was evidence waterboarding worked. But those declarations are lacking real evidence, either historically or in the recent past, experts told us. Waterboarding has long been considered a poor way to extract information, Reed College political science professor Darius Rejali said. Only a handful of case studies about waterboarding’s effects are available. Those examples involved Nazi Germany’s Gestapo in Norway and France; the French in Vietnam and Algeria; and the United States in the Philippines at the turn of the last century. In each case, the benefits of waterboarding were suspect at best, Rejali said. To start, interrogators aren’t in a position to know whether a prisoner is divulging anything factual, Rejali said. They think they have the training and can tell what’s the truth, but they can’t. The prisoner, meanwhile, is likely willing to say anything to make the interrogation stop. One of the most prominent examples of waterboarding’s alleged success is that of Abu Zubaydah, whom the Bush administration had initially considered al-Qaida's chief of operations. Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times, among being subjected to other techniques, and confessed to planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. But Zubaydah was mentally ill and had actually been in charge of scheduling people to move in and out of al-Qaida training camps after joining the group following 9/11. Much of the information he supplied was unreliable, but also provided before he was waterboarded. He revealed so much, critics say, because he didn’t know many real details. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence examined the CIA’s program when Democrats controlled the Senate. Their final report, about 6,700 pages long and approved in 2012, remains classified. A 525-page redacted executive summary was released in December 2014, followed by a minority report from the committee’s Republicans and a CIA response. The summary said that enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding were not effective for getting intelligence from people detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The committee examined 20 prominent cases (including Zubaydah’s) that reportedly ""saved lives,"" according to the CIA and the Bush administration. Some of these cases specifically cited waterboarding as a tactic used, but the committee concluded that in each example, either key information was gathered before enhanced interrogation began, the information was already available prior to interrogation, or the interrogation had nothing to do with the information obtained. Rejali pointed out most officials defending waterboarding were people whose jobs were at stake over the practice. Patrick Eddington, a former CIA analyst now at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Senate investigation showed the agency was aware waterboarding and other techniques could potentially be considered torture. ""The SSTI report makes it very clear, through the publication of CIA internal documents, that CIA personnel up to and including Director (John) Tenet knew that they were basically going to be breaking the law,"" Eddington said. There is little in the way of experimental data on waterboarding, because as you may imagine, there are a variety of reasons subjects don’t usually line up to submit to simulated drowning. (One subject in a BBC documentary confessed to being ""born a bunny rabbit"" after mere seconds, with no memory of saying as much.) But Trinity College Dublin’s Shane O’Mara, a professor of experimental brain research, told Newsweek there is scientific evidence that waterboarding physically prevents a person from providing reliable information. The sensation of suffocating activates survival instincts, not memory recall, O’Mara told the magazine. Furthermore, a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) hurts cognition and the increase of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) induces panic. In effect, putting a person under severe stress to make them talk also makes it difficult for them to recall or communicate anything worth extracting. Rejali noted that along with the historical and scientific strikes against waterboarding, there’s a third element to consider. To put it bluntly, while much of the Senate’s report is still classified, there’s no proof that the CIA’s waterboarding program was effective enough to convince more brutal regimes to use it. ""If the Americans had found the golden fleece of torture techniques, no one has noticed and no one is copying,"" Rejali said. The most commonplace methods of making someone talk are still torturing with electricity or beating them with sticks, he said, although those techniques still don't guarantee anything that's said results in actionable intelligence. If waterboarding was considered truly effective, for example, ""thousands of torturers in China would be using this. But they don’t.""    Our ruling Wilcox said, ""I can tell you that the enhanced interrogation techniques that have since been banned by this administration — specifically waterboarding — work."" While many top officials defended the CIA’s use of waterboarding in the past, there is no irrefutable evidence the practice provides results. Experts said there are few historical accounts of success, and even those are suspect.

Hillary Clinton claim about Donald Trump paying no federal taxes ignores the years when he did
","Releasing federal tax returns has become a rite of passage for presidential candidates. Donald Trump, who has marched to his own drummer in many ways this campaign season, has been the exception, refusing to release them. During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton chided Trump for keeping his returns secret. When Todd asked Clinton if Trump had done anything that should be praised, Clinton offered a non sequitur, saying Trump ""needs to release his tax returns. The only two we have show that he hasn't paid a penny in taxes. ""And yet he goes around talking about 'make America great.' You know, that means paying for our military. That means paying for our roads. That means paying for the V.A. That means a lot of things. And if you've got someone running for president who's afraid to release his tax returns because it will expose the fact that he pays no federal income tax, I think that's a big problem,"" Clinton said. We decided to see whether the only two tax returns made public show that Trump didn't pay a penny. Clinton has one thing correct here -- public records do indicate that there were two years in the 1970s when Trump paid nothing in federal taxes. But she got a few key points wrong. Namely, the same public records show three other years in which Trump did pay federal income taxes. Also, the public records Clinton referred to are not Trump's actual tax returns. When we checked with the Clinton campaign, they referred us to a Washington Post story headlined, ""Trump once revealed his income tax returns. They showed he didn’t pay a cent."" The source for the story is a document uncovered and posted online by the Washington Post's Fact Checker Glenn Kessler. He used it to show that, contrary to Trump's claim that ""there's nothing to learn"" from his tax returns, the returns can reveal a great deal about a presidential candidate. Kessler gave Trump's statement that there was ""nothing to learn"" four Pinocchios. The key document relevant to Clinton’s statement is a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzing Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. Page 33 reports on Trump's income and federal tax payments for 1975 through 1979. The report says that Trump did, in fact, pay federal taxes for three of those five years, a fact omitted in the Washington Post headline and story. It does not include the actual returns. The report says Trump paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 because, according to the tax rules, he lost money. Here's the rundown. For perspective, we've also listed the amounts in 2016 dollars. Year Income Federal tax Income (in current dollars) Federal tax (in current dollars) 1975 $76,210 $18,714 $338,923 $83,225 1976 $24,594 $10,832 $103,416 $45,548 1977 $118,530 $42,386 $467,980 $167,348 1978 $406,379 loss $0 $1,491,268 loss $0 1979 $3,443,560 loss $0 $11,348,617 loss $0 New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement, which verified his income, losses and deductions, said Trump's losses came from the operation of his various properties. But the report reveals no specifics, so the details of his tax returns for those years remain a mystery. Trump has made it clear in interviews and debates that he works aggressively to pay as little in taxes as possible. We also contacted Trump's campaign. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Clinton said, ""The only two (Donald Trump tax returns) we have show that he hasn't paid a penny in taxes."" We don't know a lot about Trump's tax situation, a fact exacerbated by his unwillingness to release his full tax returns. Public records show that Trump did not pay federal income taxes in two years -- 1978 and 1979 -- which is what Clinton was referencing. But the same records include information from three other years -- 1975, 1976, and 1977 -- when Trump did pay federal income taxes. The records we have are not full tax returns, which makes learning more about those years (or any others) difficult. Clinton’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57f065ce-c900-41c3-890a-b356b3dbd8a8",/factchecks/2016/may/24/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claim-about-donald-trump-paying-no/

George Holding accuses Renee Ellmers of breaking party ranks on controversial immigration vote
","In their first debate, three candidates for the Republican nomination for North Carolina’s U.S. House District 2 squared off last week on who deserves to represent the area in Washington, D.C. The district was recently redrawn to include most of the suburban Wake County areas around Raleigh as well as all or part of the more rural Harnett, Johnston, Wilson, Nash and Franklin counties. In an oddity created by the new boundaries, two of the primary candidates are incumbents now fighting for the same seat. Throughout the debate, Rep. George Holding attempted to paint himself as a staunch conservative who won’t budge on controversial issues. Rep. Renee Ellmers attempted to paint herself as a more pragmatic conservative who would rather get things done. That fight was perhaps most apparent in a back-and-forth on immigration policy. Holding accused Ellmers of being too liberal in a 2015 vote. ""We had an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants,"" Holding said. ""Mrs. Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against that amendment."" It’s true that Ellmers was the only Republican to vote no on that particular amendment, which was tacked onto a bill regarding Department of Homeland Security funding. She was also one of 10 Republicans who voted against the bill as a whole. However, the amendment in question did more than just prioritize the deportation of dangerous sexual criminals. It also would’ve prioritized people convicted of domestic violence or less serious, misdemeanor sexual crimes. And it was because of fears over unintended consequences of those extra provisions – which Holding neglected to mention – that Ellmers has long said she voted no. Immediately after the 2015 vote, Ellmers said in an interview with McClatchy’s D.C. bureau that she opposed it because it ""may remove protections for victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse."" That was the same stance taken by the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Both groups urged a ‘No’ vote, saying the amendment would lead to domestic and sexual violence going unreported. ""Victims of domestic violence often do not seek help when they know that the consequences to the perpetrator (for example, a spouse or parent, or perhaps other family member) may result in the perpetrator’s deportation,"" the task force wrote to members of Congress. ""This often takes place due to their financial dependence, and even close relationship to the perpetrator."" The bishops agreed, writing: ""While presented as a measure that helps domestic violence victims, we fear that it actually would discourage many such victims from reporting abuse."" The amendment and the bill as a whole passed the House despite that opposition. But the amendment in question was removed by the Senate, which passed the bill and sent the new version back to the House, which approved it even though it didn’t include the amendment. President Obama then signed the bill into law. That chain of events led Ellmers, during the recent debate, to shoot back at Holding. ""That amendment was completely meaningless, and you know it was,"" she said. And even though Holding brought up sexual criminals, the amendment would have changed nothing for the most egregious offenders. Undocumented immigrants who commit felonies – including serious sexual crimes like rape – were already given top priority for deportation. Ellmers referenced that in the debate: ""As far as deporting those who are the worst offenders – those illegal immigrants who are pedophiles – my goodness, are we not doing that now?"" It was a rhetorical question. But according to the government, we are indeed doing just that. In 2014, the Department of Homeland Security listed its highest priorities for deportation: convicted of a felony, convicted of gang-related crimes, caught at the border or suspected of being a terrorist or spy. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report on the 2015 fiscal year said 98 percent of the 235,413 people deported that year met one of its criteria or were otherwise considered a threat to public safety. At the debate, Ellmers also said she voted no because she thought Republicans should have worked with Democrats to find a compromise instead of letting President Obama set the country’s immigration policy while Congress remains in a boondoggle. ""I find it interesting that we are still in a place where we are having this conversation about what we are not getting done,"" Ellmers said. Our ruling Holding said Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against ""an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants."" Holding was correct about Ellmers’ conspicuous break from party ranks. But his description of the amendment was a bit misleading, since anyone convicted of a felony for a sex crime was already prioritized for deportation. Ellmers has also long said she voted against the bill due to fears that it would lead to less reporting of domestic violence. That’s a key piece of context that was missing from Holding’s assessment of her record.

Celia Israel says per-student education spending flat with 2017 expenditures $381 behind 2003
","An Austin Democrat critical of the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court for upholding the legality of the Texas school finance system asserted that unless lawmakers act, per-student spending will lag what it totaled more than a dozen years ago. In a press release circulated May 13, 2016, the date of the court’s decision, state Rep. Celia Israel urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to ""fully fund public education."" Israel went on: ""When adjusted for inflation, per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003."" Is all of that so? Israel cites Center for Public Policy Priorities To our inquiry, Israel’s chief of staff, Jennie Kennedy, said by email that Israel relied on an April 2016 report by the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that advocates lawmakers on issues affecting low-income Texans. We turned to the report, ""The Texas School Finance Challenge and What to Do About It,"" which has a nearly identical spending claim, stating: ""When adjusted for inflation, per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that relatively flat spending trend per student, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003."" Over the years, a chart in the report indicates, total per-student spending was relatively flat, ranging from a 2013 inflation-adjusted low of $9,813 per student to a 2009 high of $11,621. From 2002 through 2017, the chart suggests annual average per-student spending of nearly $10,479 -- meaning $273 less than what was spent in 2003 and $108 more than expected spending in 2017. And, as Israel said, the $10,371 in expected spending in 2017 would run $381 less than the shown $10,752 in per-student spending in 2003. Indeed, per the chart, that 2017 spending will run behind per-student spending in 10 of the 14 years from 2003 through 2016--though it’s poised to outpace spending in four of the presented years. We realized too you can reach a smaller long-term spending difference--or even an increase--by focusing on a different timeframe. For instance, according to the chart, the expected 2017 spending will lag per-student spending in 2004 by (just) $97--and the expected spending will outrun school spending in 2005 by $111 per student, also exceeding per-student spending in 2012 through 2014--by margins of $262 per student (2014) to $558 (2013). Finally, the shown 2017 spending will run just $4 per student behind $10,375 in spending in 2015 though it’s pegged to be down $69 per student from spending in 2016.  SOURCE: Report, ""The Texas School Finance Challenge and What to Do About It,"" Center for Public Policy Priorities, April 20, 2016 We asked the center to show its work; spokesman Oliver Bernstein emailed us the related spreadsheet, which initially prompted us to notice that the presented figures represent 2015 dollars. State spending up? Also, the spreadsheet shows, the center broke out annual changes in local, state and federal spending, also adjusted for inflation. Seemingly dramatic: Some $4,236 per student in school expenditures by state government in 2017 stands to outpace comparable spending in 2003--by $254. In contrast, local spending will be down nearly $600 a student and federal aid will be about $60 per student less than what it was, according to the sheet. What gives? By email, a center analyst, Eva DeLuna Castro, reminded us the uptick in state spending reflects a legislative decision in 2006 to pay down local school property taxes with state aid; that move fuels a continuing cost to the state of $14 billion every two years. In the report, a note below the chart says the center reached its figures by analyzing data from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budget issues, and Texas Education Agency. So we asked those agencies about the center’s conclusions. Legislative Budget Board analysis By email, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson said the agency doesn’t make such spending comparisons. But a board staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, told us by email that its own inflation-adjusted analysis indicates that in 2017 dollars, Texas schools will have $10,111 in total per-student aid in 2017--up $33 from $10,078 in per-student spending in 2003. DeSilva emailed a chart showing the figures as well as that 3.9 million students attended Texas schools in 2003 with a little more than 5 million expected in 2017. DeSilva wrote: ""The source of the statement you're checking may be using different data points such as measures of inflation or constant dollar year."" We knew that was right about the dollar year. And when we asked, DeLuna Castro confirmed by email that the center had employed a federal inflation index, the Implicit Price Deflator for state/local government from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the center’s view, DeLuna Castro said, that index better reflects costs to school districts than the general Consumer Price Index applied in the board-provided analysis. ""Why it’s different: Governments are more likely to face the rising costs of health care (teacher health insurance premiums, for example) and of road construction that the CPI doesn’t capture,"" DeLuna Castro wrote. How about it, budget board; wrong inflation index? To the contrary, DeSilva said by email there's no consensus about using the IPD rather than CPI when analyzing education spending. ""The CPI is well-known,"" DeSilva wrote, and the board uniformly employs it to analyze state spending in all areas. Finally, DeLuna Castro emailed us her run at adjusting per-student spending figures by using the CPI to account for inflation. By this approach, public school spending in 2017 stands to outpace per-student spending in 2003 by $148 per student, per the spreadsheet DeLuna Castro shared, though the 2017 spending looks to trail per-student expenditures in 2006-08, 2012, 2015 and 2016. Our ruling Israel said: ""When adjusted for inflation, per student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003."" Per-student funding has held relatively flat, data shows. But the ""$381 less"" conclusion rests on cherry-picking a timeframe and relying on an inflation index not favored by the main agency that advises lawmakers on budget issues. Try a different timeframe and/or the CPI and you can get contrary results--even, in some instances, greater spending in 2017. We rate this statement Half True.

"['Ohio', 'Drugs', 'Health Care', 'Rob Portman']","
Portman: Drug overdoses 'exceeded car accidents as the No. 1 cause of death in Ohio'
","Here’s something on which liberals and conservatives can agree: Heroin is bad. The epidemic of drug overdoses has captured media attention on a national scale, and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman is using it to his political advantage. The Republican senator, up for re-election in a tight race, has taken to every platform to push his proposed anecdote, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The measure, which provides funding for a range of addiction prevention and treatment services,  passed in the Senate on March 10. Since then, Portman has spoken about the issue weekly on the Senate floor, on national news networks, and on syndicated radio with pundit Hugh Hewitt. As Hewitt’s guest May 17, Portman said, ""We’re probably top five in the country, sadly, in terms of heroin overdoses. It’s now exceeded car accidents as the No. 1 cause of death in Ohio."" The epidemic seems like it can’t be overstated. But Portman did just that with the omission of a couple of key words. We checked with the Portman campaign, and they linked us to an Ohio Health Department report, 2014 Ohio Drug Overdose Data: General Findings, which counted 2,531 unintentional drug overdoses in 2014, the highest number on record for Ohio. The report said that opioids (prescribed drugs, heroin and fentanyl) were the driving factor behind unintentional drug overdoses in Ohio. The very first line of the report explores how that stacks up to other injury-related deaths. It reads, ""Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2014, ahead of motor vehicle traffic crashes — a trend which began in 2007."" According to Melanie Amato, the department’s spokesperson, the categorization of ""injury-related"" deaths includes incidents such as fatal falls, car accidents, drownings, homicides, and unintentional overdoses. ""Injury-related"" is an important distinction. There are a lot of ways to die that aren’t classified as injury-related. Portman is missing those two key words. We found data from the Centers for Disease Control that determine actual leading cause of death in Ohio in 2014. We made this chart using the agency’s mortality statistics:    (Amato explained that the CDC’s number of drug deaths is higher than the health department’s by 213 deaths because the CDC’s definition of ""drug poisoning"" doesn’t distinguish between intentional and unintentional overdoses. The Ohio Department of Health counts intentional overdoses separately, as suicides.) Nationally, CDC data shows that Ohio ranks fifth for states with the most heroin overdose deaths, behind West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire and Kentucky. That means Portman was right about the Buckeye State being in the top five. Portman has used the comparison between lethal overdoses and car crashes before. We scoured his press releases and videotaped statements for other references to the statistic, and found it in at least two more places. Portman got it right on April 7, on the Senate floor, when he said, ""Since 2007, drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than any other cause of accidental death, surpassing car accidents.""   But another occasion in the Senate, on May 12, he again said, ""The No. 1 cause of death now in my home state of Ohio is not car accidents anymore. It is overdoses. It’s overdoses from prescription drugs and heroin.""   Our ruling Portman said Ohio is ""probably top five in the country, sadly, in terms of heroin overdoses. It’s now exceeded car accidents as the No. 1 cause of death in Ohio."" He has a point about Ohio having the fifth-most drug overdose deaths in the nation for 2014. But he forgot two key words that make an important distinction about the types of deaths he is counting: ""injury related."" CDC data shows that when you count long-term health problems such as cancer and heart disease, drug poisoning is eighth on the list of things killing Ohioans. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26d5d9db-60af-4803-8aa0-97e95b4e64ba",/factchecks/2016/may/23/rob-portman/portman-drug-overdoses-exceeded-car-accidents-no-1/
"['Negative Campaigning', 'Virginia', 'Randy Forbes']","
Randy Forbes tells half the story about Scott Taylor's court record
","U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes recently mailed out an attack brochure in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District accusing his Republican primary opponent - Del. Scott Taylor of Virginia Beach - of flouting the law. The flier has a picture of Taylor with a devil-may-care grin. ""Scott Taylor is attacking Randy Forbes because his own record isn’t very clean,"" the brochure says. Underneath, Forbes makes four negative claims about his opponent’s personal and professional behavior. The first one says ""Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four different courts across the country, at times failing to even appear, and having a warrant issued for his arrest."" The conviction claim is repeated on a Forbes-authorized website that says Taylor is ""unfit for office."" It has a photo of Taylor holding a superimposed sign - the kind that used to appear in identification photos of inmates - saying, ""Scott Taylor RULE BREAKER."" We wondered whether the congressman’s statements about Taylor’s court record are correct and complete. Forbes, in the brochure and on his website, provides no explanation of the verdicts and legal actions that he says went against Taylor. Footnotes merely list courts in four localities and case numbers. Dean Petrone, a Forbes media consultant, sent us a list of court actions against Taylor that were found largely in a LexisNexis search of Taylor’s background. We confirmed the records on our own. It turns out that Taylor, a former Navy SEAL, has a history of fast driving. And all of the court convictions that Forbes cites as evidence of his opponent’s unsuitability for Congress result from traffic tickets. Records show that Taylor got 12 speeding tickets from 1999 to 2013. Three of those citations were for reckless driving in Virginia, which means going 20 mph or more above the speed limit. Taylor’s highest rate of speed, in a 2006 ticket issued in Rutherford County, N.C., was 99 mph in a 65-mph zone. Ironically, Taylor also got a ticket in Norfolk in 2008 for impeding traffic, which means driving too slow. He was cited in 2007 for failing to yield the right of way in Virginia Beach. So there’s a total of 14 moving violations against Taylor and no record of any of the tickets being dismissed by a judge or resulting in punishments other than fines.   Now, let’s get to the specifics of Forbes’ claims: ""Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four courts across the country … "" Records show that Taylor was found guilty of driving violations by courts in five localities. Three of the courts were in Virginia: Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Northampton County. The other two were in Rutherford County, N.C., and Talbot County, Md. ""at times failing to appear … "" In seven instances, Taylor was found ""guilty in absentia."" That means he did not exercise his option to appear in court to dispute the ticket. The judges, in Taylor’s absence, heard the cases, found him guilty, and assessed fines and court costs. That’s different from ""failing to appear,"" which means a person was supposed to show up in court and did not. This leads to the last part of Forbes’ statement. ""and having a warrant issued for his arrest."" Records show there was one time, in March 2004, when a judge charged Taylor with failure to appear and later issued a bench warrant for his arrest. This happened in Virginia Beach General District Court, shortly after Taylor had been cited for reckless driving. Scott Weldon, Taylor’s campaign manager, told us Taylor didn’t show up in court because he had been sent on a lengthy military training exercise. Records show that in June 2004, Taylor was cleared of the failure-to-appear charge. We should note that all but one of Taylor’s driving offenses occurred from 1999 to 2010. Records show he received his last ticket in November 2012 when he was pulled over in Talbot County, Md. If you’re wondering, we also examined records that would detail any problems with Forbes’ driving record and found no infractions. Our ruling A Forbes campaign brochure says, ""Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four courts across the country, at times failing to appear and having a warrant issued for his arrest."" Taylor has been convicted in five courts. He was charged with failing to appear in court once, not multiple ""times"" as Forbes says. And there was one time, in 2004, when a bench warrant was issued for Taylor’s arrest. The problem is that Forbes, in setting up Taylor as lawbreaker, gives voters only half of the story. He contours language and images to suggest Taylor is no better than a criminal, but dodges actually saying so. Forbes doesn’t mention that all of Taylor’s convictions concerned driving violations, mostly speeding. He doesn’t mention that the failure-to-appear charge against Taylor was dropped later. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL, says he missed the 2004 court date - triggering the arrest warrant - because he had been sent on a lengthy military training exercise. There are no angels in this fact check. Taylor’s driving record is fair game for criticism. Forbes’ attack is partially accurate but skips important details. So we rate his claim Half True.

"['Global News Service', 'Foreign Policy', 'David Miliband']","
Refugee aid head: World's poorest increasingly found in fragile/conflict nations
","Global poverty increasingly is becoming concentrated in areas torn apart by conflict and unrest, International Rescue Committee president David Miliband recently told a Washington, D.C., audience. ""43 percent of the world's extreme poor now live in conflict and fragile states,"" Miliband said May 18, 2016, at the Center for Global Development. Speaking with World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, Miliband made the case for the World Bank to increase its economic development operations. ""The mandate of the World Bank is to tackle poverty,"" Miliband said. ""So the geography of poverty has changed fundamentally in the last 15 years."" We decided to see if the shift Miliband described is truly under way. It is, though the limited data suggests it’s largely thanks to the success of fighting poverty in non-fragile countries. The clearest evidence comes from this chart in a 2013 Brookings Institution report.  As you see, the number of people living in poverty in non-fragile states has declined at a much greater rate than those living in fragile states. Gary Milante, who directs the security and development program for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said people should be careful about what they take away from this chart. ""Poverty is not becoming concentrated in fragile states because there are more fragile states,"" Milante said, ""rather that fragile states don’t make progress the way the rest of the world does."" Be cautious with the data Every expert we reached warned us that while the overall trend is clear, the precise numbers are not. When you think about it, you need two good yardsticks: one for poverty and one for fragility and conflict. And both have to be applied consistently over time. That’s not simple. ""The cutoffs for poverty and the methods to estimate household income have shifted over time,"" said Ben Oppenheim, who co-authored the report that included the 43 percent figure Miliband used. Definitions of a fragile state may have shifted over time as well. Oppenheim and his colleagues used a list from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which relied partly on an index from the widely cited Fund for Peace. Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, told us it’s unclear if the Fund for Peace is ""measuring the same thing over time."" ""If Nigeria or Madagascar are added to the list one year, or taken off, you suddenly have spikes or dips of tens of millions of poor, so it would be much more difficult to discern the trends you're talking about,"" Milante added. The Brookings report, meanwhile, used a fixed list of countries, regardless of whether they moved in and out of state of conflict or fragility. Our ruling Miliband said that the geography of poverty has fundamentally changed in the past 15 years and is increasingly concentrated in conflict and fragile states. Broadly speaking, the numbers back that up -- because non-fragile states are doing a better job of raising people out of poverty. The biggest cautionary note from experts is that we lack consistent measures of fragility and the list can change significantly from year to year. The statement is accurate, but one has to apply it cautiously. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a82c1824-f518-499c-bfcc-7b61b9691390",/factchecks/2016/may/23/david-miliband/refugee-aid-head-worlds-poorest-increasingly-found/
"['Abortion', 'Virginia', 'NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia']","
A flawed NARAL Virginia claim: 1 in 3 women will have an abortion
","NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia says abortions may be more common than you think. ""One in three American women will have had an abortion by the time she reaches the age of 45,"" the group says on its website. Alena Yarmosky, a spokeswoman for the group, said the figure comes from a 2011 study by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women’s access to birth control and abortions. Guttmacher’s research often is cited by people on both sides of the abortion issue. The goal of Guttmacher’s study was to update its 1992 estimate that 43 percent of U.S. women would have at least one abortion by the time they turn 45. Abortion rates had declined since 1992, and researchers wondered whether that meant that the percentage of women who would have an abortion at some point in their lives also had dropped. We should note that the lifetime incidence estimate is different from the overall abortion rate in the U.S., which measures how many women underwent the procedure during a given year. A woman who has had two abortions, for example, would be counted in the abortion rate twice. But she would be counted only once in computing the lifetime incidence of abortions. Guttmacher updated its estimate through a complicated process. It surveyed nearly 9,500 women in 2008 using formulas that took into account their ages and whether they had undergone a first abortion to come up with its lifetime incidence estimate. Guttmacher concluded ""the cumulative first-abortion rate increases with age, and women aged 40 and older had a rate of 300.9 per 1,000 women."" ""Put differently, an estimated 30.1% of women aged 15–44 in 2008 will have an abortion by age 45 if exposed to prevailing abortion rates throughout their reproductive lives,"" the report said. That’s close to the one-in-three incidence, or 33 percent, NARAL cites. But there’s a caveat. Guttmacher said its estimate stands as long as ""prevailing abortion rates"" continue. The abortion rate, however, has not held steady. According to Guttmacher, it fell from 19.4 per 1,000 women in 2008 - when the lifetime incidence estimate was made - to 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women in 2011, the latest figures available. This raises the question - as our fellow fact checkers at PolitiFact Texas and The Washington Post have noted - of whether Guttmacher’s estimate based on 2008 data remains relevant. The answer is, no one knows. Rachel Jones, co-author of the Guttmacher report, told us in an email that it’s possible - but far from certain - that the percentage of women expected to have an abortion before age 45 would go down with the abortion rate. Jones said Guttmacher plans to take a another look at the lifetime incidence of abortions. ""We will not have an updated estimate for several years,"" she said. Our ruling NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia says ""one in three American women will have had an abortion by the time she reaches the age of 45."" That’s roughly the estimate the Guttmacher Institute made five years ago based on 2008 data. Guttmacher said its estimate would stay solid as long the nation’s abortion rate in 2008 remained constant. The abortion rate has dropped, however, and that draws into question whether the percentage of women who will undergo the procedure at least once also has gone down. The answer is unknown; research has not been updated. Although there’s a basis for NARAL’s claim, the statistic it cites as fact actually is an estimate that might be outdated. So we rate NARAL’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2016/may/23/naral-pro-choice-america/flawed-naral-virginia-claim-1-3-women-will-have-ab/

Austrian politician goofed in testing Coca-Cola sample for COVID-19
","An Instagram post is promoting the claim of an Austrian politician who argued that COVID-19 tests were junk because even a sample of Coca-Cola tested positive for the disease. ""Austrian parliamentary member Michael Schnedlitz just exposed the defectiveness of the government’s Covid-19 tests by demonstrating how even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for Covid-19,"" said the Dec. 15 Instagram post. The post includes a picture of Schnedlitz and an inset picture of a can of Coca-Cola and what is purported to be a COVID-19 rapid test device. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the politician did conduct the test on a kit meant for testing blood samples for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, and he said it yielded a positive result. But Dialab, the Austrian company that makes the rapid tests, said that happened because Schnedlitz didn’t handle or execute the test properly. Guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for similar rapid tests supports Dialab’s explanation. Schnedlitz posted a video on his Facebook page showing him dabbing a swab into a glass with a dark liquid and then gently tapping that swab on a COVID-19 rapid test device. Minutes later, he lifts the testing device and says that there is a positive result (according to YouTube’s auto-generated English captions of his speech in German). The caption for the Dec. 10 video (translated from German to English by Facebook) said: ""Today I did a corona test live in Parliament. The corona mass tests are worthless! This also showed a simple experiment in Parliament where a Coke got a positive result!"" Schnedlitz’ post argued that the government was wasting taxpayer money on the tests. ""Today I proved in Parliament how moronic the government's corona mass tests are,"" Schnedlitz said in a follow-up Facebook post, according to the translated version. While Schnedlitz may have gotten a positive result, his conclusion about the tests isn’t supported, Dialab said, because his method was wrong. Had the test been conducted properly, the result would have been negative, Dialab said in a Facebook post, according to Facebook’s German to English translation. One error Schnedlitz made is that he did not add a buffer to the Coke ""sample"" before testing it. ""In a properly executed test, the sample is always swirled first in a liquid (buffer) that keeps the pH constant,"" the company wrote. COVID-19 tests should also be conducted by hospital staff or people trained to administer them, Dialab said. Dialab’s Facebook post included a video of a test on a sample of Coke — treated first with a buffer — and it yielded a negative result. Dialab on its website lists its COVID-19 testing products, including the type used by Schnedlitz. That type of test seeks to detect COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies in serum, plasma or whole blood samples. PolitiFact reviewed instructions for some COVID-19 IgG and IgM rapid tests that have been given emergency use authorization by the FDA in the United States. Those instructions call for the use of a buffer in the testing procedure. That aligns with Dialab’s explanation of how its test works. An Instagram post said, ""Austrian parliamentary member Michael Schnedlitz just exposed the defectiveness of the government’s Covid-19 tests by demonstrating how even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for Covid-19."" Schnedlitz did place a sample of Coke on a rapid test for COVID-19 antibodies and said it tested positive. But the company that makes the test said that isn’t surprising — because Schnedlitz didn’t do the test correctly. He left out a key step that would have yielded a negative result. Schnedlitz proved not that the testing device is defective, but rather that he did the test incorrectly.

No, key swing states did not cast electoral votes for both Trump and Biden
","As presidential electors across the U.S. formally affirmed Joe Biden’s win, some social media users hoped that Republican electors who cast symbolic votes for President Donald Trump in key swing states could secure a second Trump term.  One of these posts makes a series of misleading claims to craft an intricate theory of how Trump could still win the election despite losing both the electoral and popular votes.  ""PA/GA/WI/MI/AZ/NV,"" reads a Dec. 15 Instagram post. ""6 states will cast their votes for Trump AND for Biden. A state has sent dueling electors only once when 3 states sent dueling electors for Hyde and Tillman..."" The post goes onto claim that this development will lead to a second Trump term.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Multiple legal experts and academics told us that the post is not based in fact.  It’s ""somewhere between fantasy and hogwash,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Before a presidential election, state political parties nominate their candidates for the office of presidential elector.  Under Article II of the Constitution, each state legislature has complete discretion as to how it chooses its electors. Since the late 1800s, all electors have been appointed by popular vote. (Electors in Maine and Nebraska are chosen by popular vote at the congressional district rather than state level.)  During presidential elections, a vote for a particular presidential candidate is actually a vote for the slate of electors nominated by that candidate’s political party. The electors that win the popular vote in each state become eligible to cast votes in the electoral college for their party’s candidate.  This year, Biden won the election in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, and so his electors in those states became legally eligible to cast votes for him.  On Dec. 14, these electors gathered in state capitols and signed six ""certificates of ascertainment"" along with state governors, cementing Biden’s win.  However, in key swing states, would-be Trump electors — often referred to as ""shadow electors"" — gathered on the same day as the certified Biden electors and cast symbolic votes for Trump. Election law experts told us that the votes of these shadow electors, however, have no legal significance because they were not certified by state governments.  Since Biden won the popular vote in all states mentioned in the post, the only electors with legal standing to cast electoral votes are those approved by their state’s respective governors and certified pursuant to state law, said Rebecca Green, professor and co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School.  All of the legally-recognized, state-appointed electors in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada cast their votes for Biden.  ""In no case among the states in question were Republican slates approved by their state's respective governors and certified to be electors,"" said Robert Alexander, an electoral college expert and professor of political science at Ohio Northern University. ""This means their votes should not be counted."" It’s inaccurate to say that these states sent ""dueling slates"" of electors to the House to be counted. In each state, only a single slate of electors has received legal backing.  Some of the uncertified Trump electors have justified their actions by comparing themselves to Hawaiian electors during the 1960 election. In that case, Democratic electors in the state cast a conditional vote for John F. Kennedy even though the official electors had already voted for Nixon. During the vote-counting process, the House and Nixon himself recognized Kennedy as the state’s winner.  However, legal experts told us that the events of the 1960 election have little relevance to the current situation.  In Hawaii, a court-backed recount was already underway at the time both slates of electors cast their votes. Although Nixon had won the initial count by a 141-vote margin, the results of the recount seemed to be favoring Kennedy.  When Kennedy did win the recount, Hawaii Gov. William Quinn withdrew the state’s backing from the Republican electoral votes and certified Kennedy as the winner.  ""The state first certified Nixon, then certified Kennedy, and Congress counted the Kennedy electors – while making clear it was not establishing a precedent in doing so,"" said Richard Pildes, a constitutional law professor at the New York University School of Law.  By their own definition, the shadow electors would only come into play if courts attempted to throw out the officially-cast electoral votes. And courts across the country have repeatedly affirmed that Biden legitimately won the swing states in question.  ""The legal basis for the competing slates of electors here have been rejected by dozens of state and federal courts throughout the nation, repeatedly,"" said Michael Morley, assistant professor at Florida State University College of Law. The post says that the current situation is similar to the ""Hyde and Tillman"" election, an apparent misspelling of the Hayes-Tilden election of 1876.  Legal experts and academics rejected the comparison to the 1876 election, where multiple states sent dueling slates of electors to the House, and a political bargain struck between the parties handed the presidency to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes.  ""The current statutory framework didn’t even exist at that time,"" said Morley. ""Right off the bat, it’s different."" The Electoral Count Act of 1887, a federal law written in part due to the confusion during the 1876 election, established new guidelines for the counting of electoral votes that are still in place today.  An Instagram post says that ""6 states will cast their (electoral) votes for Trump AND for Biden,"" which will lead to a second Trump term.  Although unofficial shadow electors did meet to cast votes for Trump in these states, these votes have no legal standing and do not qualify as certified electoral votes.  The conditional electoral votes cast by these uncertified electors would only come into play if courts attempted to throw out the officially-cast electoral votes, and courts across the nation have repeatedly affirmed the legitimacy of Biden’s win in these states.  This post is False. ​",/factchecks/2020/dec/16/instagram-posts/no-key-swing-states-did-not-cast-electoral-votes-b/

No, the AMA didn’t rescind statement on hydroxychloroquine
","Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh falsely claimed that the American Medical Association rescinded a previous statement and came out in support of hydroxychloroquine, the drug pushed by President Donald Trump for months as a potential treatment for COVID-19. ""Now all of a sudden the AMA (said) — although very quietly — that hydroxychloroquine is okay,"" Limbaugh said Dec. 15, telling his millions of listeners that the group’s past statements were meant to hurt Trump. ""It’s perfectly fine. Go ahead and use it if you want. It can be helpful."" Limbaugh read from an article in the Published Reporter, a website based in South Florida. The website wrote that the AMA ""rescinded"" a statement related to hydroxychloroquine.  Limbaugh accused the AMA of ""knowingly lying about hydroxychloroquine."" But as the Poynter Institute reported, the AMA never retracted its statement on the drug. The Published Reporter and other websites that spread similar claims have walked back their reports, and the AMA addressed the matter on Twitter. ""In March, AMA urged caution about prescribing hydroxychloroquine off-label to treat #COVID19,"" the AMA wrote, with a link to Poynter’s Covering COVID-19 newsletter by Al Tompkins. ""Our position remains unchanged. Evidence-based #science & practice must guide these determinations.""   In March, AMA urged caution about prescribing hydroxychloroquine off-label to treat #COVID19.

Limbaugh did not respond to a request for comment.  The AMA’s March 25 statement, issued jointly with pharmacists’ groups and updated in April, signaled opposition to doctors prescribing hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment or preventative measure, and to facilities ordering the drug in excessive amounts.  The statement cautioned that ""no medication has been FDA-approved for use in COVID-19 patients"" and warned of supply-chain disruptions for patients who rely on hydroxychloroquine for other chronic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.  The statement also said ""novel off-label use of FDA-approved medications is a matter for the physician’s or other prescriber’s professional judgment."" It encouraged ""patient-centered care decisions"" but said ""evidence-based science and practice must guide these determinations."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June revoked its emergency use authorization for use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 therapy. The agency later cautioned against the drug’s use for the virus outside of the hospital setting after a review of safety issues. There is little sign that hydroxychloroquine is effective for coronavirus patients. A resolution submitted ahead of a November meeting of the AMA’s policymaking body proposed that the group retract the March statement. The resolution called for an updated statement ""notifying patients that further studies are ongoing"" and supporting physicians’ use of judgment to prescribe the drug off-label to patients with early COVID-19 symptoms.

Yes, Government Shutdowns Help Slow COVID-19 When Combined With Additional Measures, Experts Say
","In early December, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a regional stay-at-home order to curb the state’s record spread of COVID-19, which has skyrocketed 117% to 1.6 million cases over the past two weeks. The new business and travel restrictions were tied to intensive care unit capacity and kicked in within days across most of the state, shutting down bars, wineries, movie theaters, salons, barber shops, all restaurant dining and limiting retailers to operating at no more than 20% capacity. ""The bottom line is if we don’t act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news conference on Dec. 3 when he introduced the order.   Shortly after, the state’s GOP lawmakers criticized the move, saying it would harm business and claiming there’s no evidence government ""lockdowns"" work.  ""Government imposed lockdowns do NOT reduce cases or stop spikes,"" California state Asm. James Gallagher claimed on Twitter. ""Neither science or reality justify the Governor’s announcement today – just look at how California’s case count compares to less restrictive states."" Gallagher represents much of the northern Sacramento Valley, including Butte, Tehama, Sutter, Yuba, Colusa and Glenn counties.  ""By now, it should be obvious that the lockdowns have failed to contain this virus,"" added Rep. Tom McClintock, whose district includes Sacramento’s eastern suburbs and Sierra Nevada communities, speaking on the U.S. House floor on Dec. 9. For months, there’s been robust debate about whether government shutdowns go too far and unnecessarily harm society and the economy.  That’s a debate that will continue and not something we can fact-check. But Gallagher’s claim that government shutdowns don’t reduce COVID-19 cases or stop spikes is more clear cut.  We sifted through the research and asked public health experts to weigh in.  Do Government Shutdowns Work? Experts and several studies show government-imposed shutdowns do work to slow COVID-19 when combined with mask mandates, social distancing and hand hygiene requirements. They also depend on the public’s willingness to comply with the orders. Here’s one recent example: A state-mandated stay-at-home order in Delaware this spring, combined with public mask mandates and contact tracing, led to an 82% reduction in COVID-19 cases, an 88% drop in hospitalizations and a 100% decline in deaths, according to a November study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""These strategies are effective in limiting potential exposure to [COVID-19] and reducing community transmission when implemented as part of a multicomponent strategy,"" the study concluded. ""No single mitigation strategy is likely to be effective alone,"" it added. Newsom’s new regional stay-at-home order takes a similar approach. It calls for shutting down several business sectors. But it also requires ""100% masking and physical distancing,"" in sectors that remain open.  Nowhere in the order does it say the government shutdowns by themselves are sufficient to slow the virus.  Success Depends On Public Cooperation Another study, conducted by economics professors at the University of Kentucky and published in May in Health Affairs medical journal, found that social distancing mandates by state and local governments in the U.S. on average reduced the daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases by 5.4% after one to five days, 6.8% after six to 10 days, 8.2% after 11 to 15 days, and 9.1% after 16 to 20 days. Notably, it concluded the ""effectiveness"" of these orders ""depends critically on the cooperation of the public.""  ""For example,"" the study continued, ""although California’s first-in-the-nation shelter-in-place order [from March] carries threats of fines and incarceration, its effectiveness fundamentally relies on social pressure.""  Lee Riley is professor and chair of infectious disease and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. He said the confusion over whether shutdowns work is understandable, considering states with some of the toughest mandates are also experiencing the biggest spikes. ""The problem is when these restrictions are eased or lifted, that’s when we see the resurgence,"" Riley explained. ""This is what people are looking at and saying the restrictions don’t work. And that’s absolutely incorrect. Restrictions do work.""  Riley said places such as China, Singapore and Taiwan all imposed rigorous restrictions and contained the coronavirus spread. ""Yes, the restrictions do work and if they’re maintained for a long enough period, then they can eventually mitigate the transmissions completely.""  Previous Fact Check Last month, PolitiFact examined a similar claim by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott who said shutdowns are ""ineffective,"" before adding that workplace gatherings are not a common way for COVID-19 to spread.  For that fact check, experts told PolitiFact that if measuring strictly transmission rates and case numbers, shutdowns have proven to be effective in managing spread. They also noted that Abbott’s statement ignores workplaces where proper precautions are difficult to achieve from meatpacking plants to the construction industry.  PolitiFact rated Abbot’s claim as False. ‘Correlation Is Not Causation’  In an interview, Gallagher, the California state lawmaker, said he stood by his claim that shutdowns don’t reduce cases or stop spikes, describing the evidence as inconclusive.  He suggested that the decline in coronavirus cases this spring could have resulted from people’s voluntary actions to distance and use good hygiene upon hearing about the virus, and not because of lockdowns. ""Correlation is not causation,"" Gallagher said. ""Just because something happens to happen at the same time that you’re doing X, doesn’t mean that there wasn’t some other variable that was leading to that.""  Riley said Gallagher’s theory doesn’t hold up.  ""If good hygiene and voluntary social distancing are what contributed to the decrease in cases, why are we seeing another surge all over the country?"" the professor asked.  ""The point of the lockdowns is to decrease chances of social gathering and social interaction, which is the most effective way to assure social distancing,"" Riley added. ""This lawmaker is correct that social distancing works, but lockdowns help to increase the social distancing."" Gallagher provided links to several opinion pieces and letters that he said demonstrate lockdowns don’t work. One was a link to the Great Barrington Declaration, a letter three scientists authored that endorses herd immunity and supports a completely reopened society for those with no underlying health conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  Since its publication in early October, however, PolitiFact found the document has been widely criticized by scientists and denounced by top health officials and thousands of doctors around the world.  The paper was signed by scientists and health experts across the world. But a British broadcast station found that some of those who signed the letter online used fake names, including ""Dr. Person Fakename"" and ""Dr. Johnny Bananas."" The signatures were later made private. Gallagher also cited an opinion piece by a chief investments officer for an analytics firm; a free-market think tank’s magazine column that cites the Great Barrington Declaration; an article in the journal Nature that says a combination of ""non-pharmaceutical interventions,"" such as business closures, social distancing or mask-wearing, ""is necessary to curb the spread of the virus,"" but that less disruptive restrictions can be as effective as more drastic ones.  Additionally, Gallagher cited a study published in Safety Science that concluded Germany’s decline in COVID-19 infections in the spring was due to the cancellation of mass events and voluntary behavior changes, but not the government restrictions that followed.  Germany announced it will start a lockdown this week until at least Jan. 10 to curb the spread of the pandemic. The Science Is ‘Pretty Clear’  Erin Mordecai is an assistant professor in biology at Stanford University whose research focuses on the ecology of infectious disease. She has conducted research on the relationship between virus transmission and mobility data in California and Georgia. She said mobility, measured based on mobile device movements, generally declines immediately following stay-at-home orders. That reduction in mobility corresponds with a decline in transmission and ultimately the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, she said. ""The science shows pretty clearly that non-pharmaceutical interventions---business closures, social distancing, mask-wearing---including so-called ‘government lockdowns’ do work to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" Mordecai wrote in an email. Right now, she added, there’s a strong argument for shutting down in- person contact as much as possible. ""If our ICUs are nearing their maximum capacity, as we're seeing here in California now,"" she wrote, ""one of our best tools for avoiding a total public health disaster---people dying in hospital hallways, makeshift COVID wards thrown together in gymnasiums, or at home because they're too afraid to go to the hospital---is to rapidly hit the brakes on transmission, which means avoiding contact with others outside our household, especially indoors, where transmission is more likely."" Our Ruling California state Asm. James Gallagher claimed ""Government imposed lockdowns do NOT reduce [COVID-19] cases or stop spikes.""  Infectious disease experts, however, say government shutdowns do work by reducing social interaction which, when maintained, cuts down on the spread of COVID-19.  Several studies, including from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, show government-imposed closures, when combined with mask-wearing, social distancing and hand hygiene, are effective.  The studies and experts also point out there’s no single strategy that works on its own. California officials have imposed business restrictions while promoting additional strategies to combat COVID-19.

Kelly Loeffler’s support of a tax cut that expires isn’t support of a tax hike

Near the end, the narrator adds, ""but Loeffler’s for raising taxes on Georgia’s middle class."" The reference is to Loeffler’s support of the 2017 tax cuts law signed by President Donald Trump, according to a citation in the ad. But the ad’s characterization of Loeffler’s stance is wrong. For individuals, most of the cuts enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire at the end of 2025 — meaning, after that, taxes will rise. But for the middle class, Loeffler supports making the cuts permanent. The law reduces taxes on individuals — through lower tax rates and other measures — and on corporations. While most of the cuts for individuals expire at the end of 2025, the cuts for businesses are permanent. The vast majority of middle-income taxpayers are getting tax cuts in the initial years of the law and even after the tax cuts expire, the net effect is roughly zero, according to estimates by the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation and the centrist Tax Policy Center. By 2027, though, every income group below $75,000 will see a tax increase. Loeffler has been in the Senate a year, having been appointed to fill a vacancy. Her Senate and campaign offices did not reply to our requests for information. But she has stated support for making the tax cuts ""for working and middle class families"" permanent.

Trump tweet wrongly suggests there were defects with Michigan voting machines
","In a Dec. 15 tweet, Trump claimed there was a ""68% error rate in Michigan Voting Machines. Should be, by law, a tiny percentage of one percent."" He suggested Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson would face legal scrutiny for the alleged errors. ""Did Michigan Secretary of State break the law? Stay tuned!"" Trump wrote. Trump was reacting to a consultant’s report that a judge made public Monday in connection with an election lawsuit in Antrim County, in northern Michigan, where a misapplied software update initially led to incorrect unofficial results being reported on election night. But Trump’s tweet misinterprets the findings of the report, which itself presents a misleading picture. Michigan vote tabulators do not read ballots incorrectly 68% of the time. Nor is that statement true if applied only to the Antrim County tabulators in the Nov. 3 election. And the report Trump reacted to, while ambiguous and inaccurate on the subject of errors, does not make that claim. The report is signed by cybersecurity analyst Russell James Ramsland Jr. of Allied Security Operations Group, a firm whose representatives have provided analyses and affidavits for lawsuits brought by Trump allies, falsely alleging voter fraud and election irregularities. In one such analysis on voter turnout, Ramsland mistook voting jurisdictions in Minnesota for Michigan towns. In another, filed in support of a federal lawsuit in Michigan, he made inaccurate claims about voter turnout in various municipalities, misstating them as much as tenfold. The scrutiny of Antrim’s ballots arises from an error in the reporting of unofficial results on election night, which initially showed voters in the heavily GOP county casting more votes for Democrat Joe Biden than for Trump. Trump allies have seized on that error, and other alleged irregularities, in their fruitless quest for evidence of election rigging through equipment made by Dominion Voting Systems. State and county officials say the reporting error, which was corrected soon after the election, was the result of human error by County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican, before the election. Guy said that after learning some candidates in local races were omitted from the ballot, she needed to update the ballot information stored on media drives attached to the tabulating machines. But she mistakenly made the changes only in some precincts, instead of all of them, leading to mismatched data when the unofficial countywide tallies were being compiled, and an inaccurate report of the unofficial results, Guy and Benson have said. The investigation of Antrim’s equipment arose from a different issue in the case. In granting a request for ""forensic imaging"" of the data and software inside the Dominion tabulators, Judge Kevin Elsenheimer of Michigan’s 13th Circuit Court was responding to concerns about a closely decided proposal to allow a marijuana dispensary in the village of Central Lake. Ramsland’s firm, Allied Security, conducted the investigation. In his report, Ramsland claimed, ""The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is of 1 in 250,000 ballots (.0008%)."" On the Antrim machines, he wrote, he ""observed an error rate of 68.05%."" The FEC regulates campaign finance, not voting equipment, and has no such guideline. The federal agency that does deal with voting equipment is the Election Assistance Commission. Antrim County’s Dominion tabulators are certified by the EAC. In Michigan, 65 out of the state’s 83 counties use voting systems manufactured by Dominion. Moreover, the error rate identified by Ramsland is not a measure of ballot counting errors. Ramsland did not have access to the paper ballots as part of his investigation, according to Jake Rollow, a spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office. Ramsland acknowledged that he was not referring to ballot tabulation errors, even though the purported benchmark he compared it to is ""1 in 250,000 ballots."" Rather, Ramsland wrote, the error rate applies to the 15,676 ""total lines or events"" in Antrim’s tabulation logs. ""Most of the errors were related to configuration errors that could result in overall tabulation error or adjudication,"" he wrote, without giving more detail or saying that they did result in such errors. The EAC certification requirements that Antrim’s Dominion machines had to meet establish certain error thresholds for the computer code that runs the systems, but the tabulation logs track something else. Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser to the elections program at Democracy Fund explained in an email to the Free Press that tabulation logs ""aren’t the lines of code that run the system. They're logs of activities occurring in the process of tabulation. The lines of code that are reviewed in certification are the actual software codes."" She said Ramsland’s report was ""confusing many, many things."" PolitiFact Michigan called Allied Security Operations Group and left a voice message requesting to speak with Ramsland. The call was not returned. The White House and Trump campaign did not respond to email inquiries regarding Trump’s tweet. And the EAC also did not respond to requests for additional information regarding its certification process. State officials say they are not sure what Ramsland is referencing when he reports a 68% error rate.  Guy, the Antrim County clerk, believes that the 68% error rate reported by Ramsland may be related to her original error updating the ballot information. The software generated scores of error reports when the county initially merged election results from various tabulators that did not contain the same ballot information, she said. ""The equipment is great — it’s good equipment,"" Guy said. ""It’s just that we didn’t know what we needed to do (to properly update ballot information). We needed to be trained on the equipment that we have."" Trump claimed that there was a 68% error rate in the tabulation machines used in Michigan, far more than the law allowed. The apparent source for his claim is a report from an investigation of tabulation equipment from one county that purportedly identified a 68.05% error rate. The author of the report said the error rate applied not to the number of ballots counted, but rather to the lines or events listed in the tabulators’ activity logs. Trump’s tweet refers to a ""law"" about benchmark error rates. There is no such law. The report he alluded to refers to FEC guidelines that don’t exist either. Election officials have explained that the error in unofficial election night reporting in Antrim County was the result of human error, not an error with the software or tabulation machines used in the county.

Trump’s wrong. 15% natural immunity doesn’t equal a vaccine.
","During a Dec. 8 press conference about Operation Warp Speed, President Donald Trump likened the spread of coronavirus throughout the population — which experts agree bestows some immunity on the people who became ill — to having a COVID-19 vaccine. ""You develop immunity over a period of time, and I hear we’re close to 15%. I’m hearing that, and that is terrific. That’s a very powerful vaccine in itself,"" said Trump, who was responding to a reporter’s question about what his message to the American people was as the holidays approach and levels of COVID cases in the U.S. continue to rise. It wasn’t the first time Trump had given credence to the idea that if enough people in a population gain immunity to a disease by being exposed to it, the illness won’t be able to spread through the remainder of the population — a concept known as ""herd immunity."" However, experts have warned that attempting to achieve herd immunity naturally, by allowing people to get sick with COVID-19, could result in more than a million deaths and potentially long-term health problems for many. A better way to achieve protection across the population, experts say, is through widespread vaccination. So, we thought it was important to check whether 15% is anywhere close to the herd immunity threshold, and whether this level of natural immunity could be considered ""as powerful as a vaccine."" The White House did not respond to our request for more information about the comment or about Trump’s 15% figure. It may be derived from a Nov. 25 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report using mathematical models to estimate that 53 million Americans — about 16% of the population — have likely been infected with COVID-19. Those models took into consideration the nation’s number of confirmed cases, and then used existing data to calculate estimates of the number of people who had COVID-19 but didn’t seek medical attention, weren’t able to access a COVID-19 test, received a false-negative test result or were asymptomatic and unaware they had COVID-19. It’s important to note this estimate is based on data from February through September — and we’re now in mid-December, so the share of Americans who have been infected with the coronavirus would likely be much higher. For instance, an independent data scientist, Youyang Gu, estimated that 17.5% of Americans have had COVID-19 as of Nov. 30. His estimate is published on his website, COVID Projections. Experts have said that a 15% infection rate among Americans is nowhere close to the threshold needed to reach herd immunity against COVID. ""To get to herd immunity, an estimated 60-80% of people need to have immunity (either through natural infection or through the vaccine),"" Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University, wrote in an email. ""We are a very long way off from that."" Also, Wen said, scientists still don’t know enough about how effective natural immunity is in defending against COVID-19. It appears that once someone has had COVID-19 and recovered, the antibodies their body produced can protect them for at least several months. But, there have also been reports of COVID-19 re-infection. That’s why medical experts urge everyone to get vaccinated, whether they have had COVID-19 or not. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently set the saturation level for herd immunity even higher — between 75% and 80% — in an interview with Axios. At that point, he said, ""you create an umbrella of herd immunity — that even though there is virus around, it is really almost inconsequential because it has no place to go, because almost all of the people are protected."" Both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have shown 95% effectiveness at protecting people from developing COVID-19 in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use. This Thursday, an independent panel will consider whether to recommend that the FDA authorize the emergency use of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine. So, that leads to the next question: Is 15% natural immunity among the American population anywhere close to a ""powerful vaccine,"" as Trump alleges? No, said the experts. And there’s nothing ""terrific"" about that level of infection within the community. ""Fifteen percent ‘natural immunity’ is nowhere close to as powerful as a vaccine,"" Dr. Rachel Vreeman, director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, wrote in an email. Assuming that natural immunity is effective, reaching a level of 15% of the population would prevent only those individuals who have had COVID from getting sick again, said Stephen Morse, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University. ""But [it] won’t do much to prevent virus spread in the community, because there are still so many susceptible people,"" Morse wrote in an email. Plus, 15% of the American population having had COVID-19 ""has come at a high cost,"" Morse wrote. To achieve 15% natural immunity, more than 300,000 people in the U.S. have been sacrificed. Though Trump was in the ballpark when he referenced the share of Americans who have been infected with the coronavirus, his overall point -- that the natural immunity these people acquired is a powerful vaccine -- does not hold up. Experts repeatedly have warned that not enough is known about the immunity people appear to gain after recovering from a COVID-19 infection to know how effective or lasting it is. And there have been reported cases of COVID re-infections. Also, experts agree more than 70% of the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated in order to reach herd immunity. Fifteen percent is nowhere close to that threshold and should not be considered as effective as a COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, that 15% statistic brought with it hundreds of thousands of deaths.

No, chip on COVID-19 vaccine syringes would not be injected or track people
","A video circulating on social media wrongly claims that some COVID-19 vaccines could include microchips to let government officials track patients. That’s inaccurate. The Dec. 9 video spread on Facebook and Instagram as the U.S. distributed its first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In the interview, Walker described how ApiJect’s prefilled syringes could include optional chips to show when a vaccine dose is expired or counterfeit. The video uses selective editing and misleading text overlays to give the impression that the ApiJect’s radio-frequency identification technology would enable government officials to track the vaccinated population.  ""The chip would give officials information on who has and has not been vaccinated, as well as when doses expire,"" the text over the video says. ""The chip tracks the location of the patient.""  A pair of screenshots from a social media video falsely claiming some COVID-19 vaccines could include microchips to track patients. But in reality, the optional chip would be on the syringe label, spokespersons for ApiJect and the Department of Health and Human Services told PolitiFact. It would not be injected into patients with the vaccine, nor would it allow those patients to be tracked in any way. Fact-checkers from Reuters and Lead Stories previously debunked the video’s claims. Elizabeth Johnston, who describes herself as a blogger, author and activist, posted the video with a watermark from her website. We reached out to her, but she did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In his May interview with CBN News, Walker described ApiJect’s partnership with the U.S. government to expand production of injection devices for a future COVID-19 vaccine. The company had recently entered into a $138 million contract with the Pentagon and HHS. (In the interview, Walker is misidentified as ApiJect’s CEO.) The interviewer asked Walker about ""the optional RFID chip"" on the prefilled syringes that could help health workers tell if a vaccine dose was expired or counterfeit. ""What that chip does is it has the unique serial number for each dose,"" Walker said. ""It is designed so that there is no counterfeiting. It is designed so that we'll know exactly that the right dose hasn't expired."" Walker went on to explain that the chip ""only refers to the dose"" of the vaccine in the prefilled syringe. ""There’s no personal information, no patient information,"" he said. ""It's simply like a barcode. Only we know instantaneously where and when that dose has been used."" But the video circulating on social media omits that section of the interview. It mutes Walker’s words and, in a text overlay on the screen, says the chip ""would give officials information on who has and has not been vaccinated"" and ""tracks the location of the patient."" Steven Hofman, a spokesperson for ApiJect, rejected the video’s claims. ""No chip is vaccinated into anyone,"" he said in an email to PolitiFact. The technology is optional for purchasers of the syringes and ""would go on the label on the outside of the container holding the vaccine,"" Hofman said. So far, it hasn’t been requested by any government or private company, he said. And if it were, it wouldn’t be able to track people. ""The chip does not and will not collect any personal information on who is vaccinated,"" Hofman said. The chips could record where each shot was administered, but they ""would not and could not record information on who has been vaccinated."" The chips could also help keep tabs on the devices as they ship to pharmacies and other locations for vaccine administration, an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.  ""The video is inaccurate,"" the statement said. ""ApiJect technology doesn’t inject a microchip into a person receiving the vaccine."" PolitiFact has debunked numerous false claims about tracking devices in vaccines. Experts previously said microchips are too large to be injected when patients are vaccinated. ""Even the smallest version of RFID chips are rather large, such that none would ever fit into a vaccine needle,"" Dr. Wilbur Chen, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, told PolitiFact in April. A Facebook video said an optional microchip for COVID-19 vaccines ""would give officials information on who has and has not been vaccinated"" and ""tracks the location of the patient."" The chips are part of the label for ApiJect’s prefilled syringes, and they help identify the vaccine doses, not patients.

Wisconsin one of few states that ban absentee ballot processing before Election Day
","It took all day and then some for Milwaukee election officials to count their mountain of absentee ballots in the 2020 presidential election And those 170,000 votes proved decisive. When the ballots were added to the state total about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 4, Wisconsin swung from a lead for President Donald Trump to a lead for former Vice President Joe Biden. A later canvass and recount confirmed Biden won the state by about 21,000 votes. But the swing and timing sparked an avalanche of misinformation, with Trump and an array of other Republicans claiming there was something nefarious about the late arrival of Milwaukee’s votes. Of course that’s ridiculous: We’ve noted in multiple False and Pants on Fire ratings that the absentee votes from Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold, were long expected to heavily favor Biden and to come in late. The controversy stems from limitations in state law on when election workers can process absentee votes — limitations that were unchanged despite the massive increase in this kind of voting amid the pandemic. State Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee, raised this point in a letter to the state’s Republican legislative leaders, seeking a bipartisan task force to improve Wisconsin’s voting system. ""Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day,"" Carpenter said in the Dec. 11, 2020, news release. ""Allowing this simple change would stop the false accusation that tens of thousands of ballots are secretly being dumped after midnight changing the outcome of the election. We all know our current process and know that is not true. It is just a matter our laws requiring workers to wait until 7:00 AM on Election Day to begin tabulating."" Is Carpenter right that Wisconsin law handcuffs election officials in a way most states don’t? The short answer is yes. The longer answer depends a bit on how you define processing. The National Conference of State Legislatures compiled details on how each state handled absentee ballots for the 2020 election. Their research showed many states limit counting of absentee votes to Election Day — about 30 in all. But few go as far as Wisconsin in not allowing any ballot processing until that day. Only Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming require that ballots not be processed until Election Day. (Michigan requires smaller cities to wait until Election Day, while those with 25,000 or more people can start a day early.) The timelines vary among the other states, with some allowing ballots to be processed as soon as they are received, while others begin the process a set amount of time before Election Day. A New York Times breakdown of when states are allowed to begin ""pre-processing"" ballots — defined as verifying signatures, opening envelopes and flattening ballots to get them ready for tabulation — shortened that list further, showing only Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin limiting this to Election Day. We saw dramatically different vote reporting dynamics in states that allow this earlier ballot processing. In North Carolina, for example, where absentee votes can be processed five weeks before the election and counted two weeks before, an early lead for Biden turned into a Trump win as in-person votes were added to the tallies later in the day. Carpenter said Wisconsin is one of the few states that don’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day. However we define that processing, it’s clear Wisconsin in the extreme minority. Just a handful of states ban election workers from beginning work on absentee ballots before Election Day.

Jon Ossoff isn’t for ‘total’ amnesty, backs a lockdown only if sought by experts
","Republican Sen. David Perdue has taken to characterizing his opponent in the Georgia runoff as being extreme. During a Dec. 7 interview with talk show host Sean Spicer, President Donald Trump’s former press secretary, Perdue said that he strategically skipped a debate with Democrat Jon Ossoff the night before because he was ""letting this guy talk."" Then Perdue made a claim about Ossoff’s platform on two different policies — and exaggerates them both. ""We witnessed last night something I didn’t think we’d ever see, and that is a debate participant lose a debate with himself,"" Perdue said. ""I mean, the more he talked, the more we could see he had no preparation. If you look at what he was talking about, he had no idea what to do with COVID. He wants total, blanket amnesty, and he wants a total lockdown."" The outcome of that contest — along with another Jan. 5 Georgia runoff between GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnoff — will determine whether control of the Senate remains with the GOP or shifts to the Democrats. Perdue’s campaign manager also claimed that Ossoff took the seemingly unrelated policy positions — amnesty, for illegal immigration, and a lockdown, for the pandemic. And Perdue later repeated his claim in a radio interview. Ossoff backs a path to legal status, not ""blanket"" amnesty, for immigrants living in the United States illegally. He isn’t seeking a lockdown to respond to COVID-19, but indicated he would support one if public health experts recommend it. Perdue’s campaign did not respond to our request for information for this fact-check, but it’s clear his reference to amnesty regards illegal immigration. Some view amnesty as permission for immigrants living in the country illegally to simply remain in the United States. The idea of ""blanket amnesty"" suggests a formal, legal act, in which the government pardons a group for violating immigration policies and allows them to obtain permanent residency. There is no evidence Ossoff supports that approach.  Others view amnesty as any measure that is favorable to any immigrants living here illegally, even if it includes a list of tough measures they have to meet. Indeed, there can be various forms of it. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, paved the way for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become lawful permanent residents if they met certain requirements. Ossoff says he wants to provide a pathway for immigrants living in the United States illegally to gain a legal status, not for merely granting them legal status without conditions or requirements. The immigration section of Ossoff’s campaign website says he will ""support an immigration policy that strengthens our borders, puts American workers first, respects human rights, and creates a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who are already here and otherwise follow the law, especially those brought here as children."" In the debate, Ossoff was asked what he would do for immigrants who are living in a ""gray area"" in the United States. Ossoff reiterated the stance on his campaign website. Ossoff’s campaign told us Ossoff has not put out further details on how a person would reach legal immigration status. Ossoff has indicated he would back a lockdown to respond to COVID-19 if public health officials deemed one necessary. Ossoff’s COVID-19 policy emphasizes providing more health care resources and ""emergency cash"" to individuals and businesses, but it also calls for ""strong distancing policies now, not later, including shelter-in-place orders where necessary."" In the debate, Ossoff was asked by Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Greg Bluestein what the federal government should do to contain the virus and if he would endorse a new lockdown if public health experts supported one. Ossoff said he would listen to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and public health experts. Pressed by Bluestein about a lockdown, Ossoff said: ""I will listen to the public health experts, and if they recommend that more aggressive mitigation measures are necessary to save lives, it would be foolish for politicians to ignore their advice."" Ossoff made similar remarks a week earlier in a CNN interview.  Asked if he would support harsher restrictions in Georgia, such as closing restaurants and businesses temporarily, Ossoff said ""I think we should follow the expertise of public health experts,"" including the CDC, ""and if that is the consensus of the public health community, we need to take that advice very seriously."" Anchor Dana Bash followed up asking: ""So, if they said shut things down temporarily, you would be all for it?"" Ossoff replied: ""If the CDC and its leadership gave a strong indication that those kinds of stronger mitigation measures are necessary to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, it would be malpractice for politicians to ignore that advice."" Perdue said Ossoff ""wants total, blanket amnesty and he wants a total lockdown."" Ossoff backs a path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally who meet a set of requirements, not a blanket amnesty without conditions.

Chart showing “deadliest days in American history” contains some errors
","There’s no question the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the deadliest events modern Americans have ever grappled with. But how its death toll compares with other tragedies and natural disasters is being misconstrued in a social media post that purports to list and rank the ""deadliest days in American history.""  The graphic shows that four of the eight deadliest days since the country’s founding took place between Dec. 2 and Dec. 7, 2020. The image places daily COVID-19 deaths from those days alongside death tolls from the Galveston Hurricane, the battle of Antietam, Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This post, which was forwarded to us by a reader, was also flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Most of the figures cited are accurate and the general thrust of the claim is valid: The pandemic has produced staggeringly high daily death counts that reached 3,411 on Dec. 9 — a high that came after the image was created. Families have relayed haunting stories of heartbreak as their loved ones have died in isolation without the comfort of family members close by.  However, the post contains some problems: It does not take into account daily deaths not linked to a specific cause, and it omits some historical events that resulted in greater numbers of fatalities. Although the image purports to be a list of the ""deadliest days in American history,"" it only lists fatalities related to specific mass-fatality events. It leaves out the number of deaths from all causes.  For example, the list cites Dec. 4, 2020, as having a death toll of 2,861.  It’s true that 2,861 people were reported on that day to have died of COVID-19, according to the CDC’s Data Tracker. This number doesn’t include any of the people who died from causes besides COVID-19, such as murder, heart attacks or cancer.  In 2017, an average of 7,708 deaths occurred each day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The list doesn’t provide an accurate list of the top eight deadliest days in American history.  Perhaps the most notable omission from the list is also the most directly analogous to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 1918 flu pandemic savaged the United States between Sept. 1 and Dec. 31, 1918, killing an estimated 381,019 people in those four months alone. That’s an average of around 3,123 people per day.  Other notable mass fatality events left out of the chart include: The Battle of Gettysburg, where an estimated 10,000 soldiers were either mortally wounded or killed over three days of fighting.  The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which killed 3,400 people according to an official fatality count conducted by archivist Gladys Hansen.  The San Ciriaco hurricane, which killed 3,369 people in Puerto Rico on Aug. 8, 1899.  The Lake Okeechobee hurricane, which killed an estimated 2,500-3,000 people on Sept. 16, 1928.  And while the chart seems to focus on events that have claimed lives on U.S. soil, it does not explicitly say that. The D-Day invasion during World War II claimed the lives of 2,501 Americans, according to the National D-Day Memorial Foundation. Liz Skilton, an associate professor of history at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, who specializes in natural disasters, disapproved of the way the image compared different types of disastrous events by placing them side by side. ""Different types of disasters rarely ever can be compared directly as there are different sets of hazards and reactions to these hazards that influence the outcome of events,"" she said. ""This is not to say disasters cannot be compared at all, it just means that making direct comparisons between them in an oversimplified way is damaging to our understanding of their impact and could even harm our ability to react to these incidents appropriately."" All that said, the numbers that the chart does rely on are generally accurate.  The Battle of Antietam resulted in about 3,600 deaths, and the attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in about 2,400 deaths according to the National Park Service.  The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 killed an estimated 8,000 to 12,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The 9/11 attacks killed an estimated 3,000 people according to the 9/11 Commission Report. The COVID-19 deaths in the chart are taken directly from the CDC’s Data Tracker.  A viral image claims that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused 4 of the 8 ""deadliest days in American history."" The image omits some historical events and only lists fatalities linked to specific causes.  However, the broad claim of the image is accurate: the COVID-19 pandemic has seen daily death totals that have surpassed those of events memorialized as national tragedies, including Pearl Harbor and 9/11.  We rate this image Half True. ​",/factchecks/2020/dec/11/facebook-posts/chart-showing-deadliest-days-american-history-cont/

Two vaccine trial participants died, but the FDA didn’t connect their deaths to the vaccine
","A recent blog post about the deaths of people who volunteered for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine trial sounds scary but it’s misleading, and lacking context.  ""BREAKING,"" the headline of the story on a blog called Health and Money News says. ""FDA announces 2 deaths of Pfizer vaccine trial participants from ‘serious adverse events.’""  The story goes on to say that ""a newly released document on the FDA website shows that 2 participants died as a result of ‘serious adverse events’ from the experimental Covid vaccine.""  But that’s not quite right. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Here’s what you should know.  The Food and Drug Administration recently released a briefing document for the Dec. 10 meeting of its vaccine advisory panel, which recommended that the FDA give Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization.  The document details safety data collected during Pfizer’s vaccine trials, including ""serious adverse events,"" which the FDA defines as ""any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient."" Serious adverse events include deaths and non-fatal events, such as appendicitis. Among 43,448 people enrolled in Pfizer’s vaccine trial, six people died. Two of those people had received the vaccine and four had received a placebo.  According to the briefing document, both vaccine recipients who died were older than 55. One person suffered a heart attack 62 days after the second dose of the vaccination and died three days later. The other person, who had ""baseline obesity and pre-existing arteriosclerosis"" — a hardening of the arteries — died from arteriosclerosis three days after the first dose.  All six deaths, including those of the placebo recipients, ""represent events that occur in the general population of the age groups where they occurred, at a similar rate,"" the document says. In other words, none of the deaths were attributed to the vaccine, and the briefing document endorsed its emergency-use authorization, saying it had a ""favorable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns."" According to the document, only three serious adverse events were determined by an investigator to be related to the vaccine or how the vaccine was administered: a shoulder injury, an irregular heartbeat, and swollen lymph nodes.  The blog post says that the FDA announced that two Pfizer vaccine trial participants had died from serious adverse events. A report from the FDA said that while two people who had received the vaccine had died, it didn’t say the vaccine caused their deaths, as this blog post suggests.

Chart comparing 2020 US death toll with previous years is flawed, uses incomplete data
","Posts on social media are attempting to downplay the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using a chart that shows that the 2020 U.S. death toll hasn’t changed much from previous years. The chart, titled ""US deaths per year,"" displays figures comparing deaths in the country for the last five years, ranging from just over 2.7 million in 2015 to 2.9 million in 2019. It says the toll for 2020, as of Nov. 16, is ""2,487,350."" Some versions also include a whole-year projection of 2,818,527. ""People died before Covid. Amazingly the death rate hasn’t changed. How can that be with such a deadly virus????"" one user wrote.   But the comparison is flawed for a few reasons. The 2020 statistics cited are not the final figures, and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that hundreds of thousands of excess American deaths are attributed to the virus this year. Lastly, it ignores that COVID-19 has killed over 290,000 Americans to-date, the highest virus death toll in the world.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The numbers listed from 2015 through 2018 are legitimate and come from the CDC. The health agency reported 2,712,630 deaths in the U.S. in 2015, 2,744,248 in 2016, 2,813,503 in 2017, and 2,839,205 in 2018. While the final numbers for 2019 have not been released, the CDC’s provisional count for the year — 2,855,000 — comes close to the chart’s 2,900,689 figure, though it’s not clear how they reached the number. The chart’s 2,487,350 figure leading up to the week of Nov. 16, 2020, reflects CDC data, but it’s not a complete depiction of how many Americans died in 2020.  Not only does the figure not account for the final six weeks of the year, it doesn’t represent the first few weeks, either. The weekly provisional deaths table doesn’t begin until the week ending Feb. 1, 2020. What’s more, these numbers are continuously updated due to reporting lags, which the CDC says can range from one week to eight weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.  The provisional tally for the year, as of Dec. 11, has already gone up to 2,728,104.  Meanwhile, in another report, the CDC estimated that COVID-19 has caused almost 200,000 excess deaths in the U.S. from late January through early October. Excess deaths are defined in the report as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time.  ""Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19,"" the agency reported. Lauren Rossen, a data scientist with CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told PolitiFact that the numbers of deaths in 2020 are ""without a question NOT on par with previous years"" and that claims that the numbers are equivalent are based on misinterpretations and misuse of the available data. Since we don’t have all the data for 2020, Rossen said a more accurate analysis would need to involve comparing the number of deaths that occurred in the first 44 weeks, or so, of the year with the number of deaths that occurred over those same weeks in previous years.  ""Looking at the number of deaths each year through week 44 (the most recent weeks are incomplete in 2020 due to the length of time it takes to receive and tabulate death certificates), we can see the totals over the same time periods each year. There have been nearly 317,000 more deaths in 2020 than in the same time period of 2019,"" Rossen said. A chart circulating online claims to demonstrate that the annual U.S. death toll has not changed significantly in 2020 amid COVID-19.  This is wrong and ignores that the virus has killed more than 290,000 Americans to-date, the most in any country in the world.  The data used for 2019 is not final and the figures presented for 2020 are incomplete. Other CDC data also refutes the claim’s premise, with an estimation of hundreds of thousands of excess American deaths attributed to the virus this year. False. ",/factchecks/2020/dec/11/facebook-posts/chart-comparing-2020-us-death-toll-previous-years-/
