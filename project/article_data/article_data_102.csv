Craig James says Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton seek treaty to ban the use of U.S. firearms
","
Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Craig James of Texas drew a standing ovation this week after warning that President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seek an international agreement banning the use of guns on U.S. soil.

James, sitting on stage at a Grassroots America candidate forum in Tyler on May 16, 2012, said: ""I’m going to stand up because I want to make sure you don’t forget what I’m going to say right now."" An Austin American-Statesman reporter recorded his remarks.

""If anybody in this room has not been following this, the United States, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms,"" James said. ""I want you to know that the Second Amendment is about to be busted and if we don’t stand up and stop this and scream and make sure that Washington, D.C. hears us, then we’re in trouble with the Second Amendment.

""Where is the next part that they take away? This is insane,"" James said. He subsequently urged everyone to make sure friends and neighbors understand the U.S. is trying to ban and get rid of the Second Amendment, which says: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

""Don’t let them fool you any other way. We don’t want to wake up one morning and realize that we have to send our firearms (away) – and I’ve got a bunch of ‘em,"" James said. The ovation followed.

Asked to elaborate, James’ spokeswoman Meredith Turney said the next day that James was probably referring to his support for legislation offered by U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas.

Turney guided us to a May 17, 2012, Senate floor speech in which Moran pointed out that a UN conference scheduled for July 2012 could lead to an international treaty regulating trade in conventional arms including tanks, helicopters and missiles. Whether the treaty includes limits on civilian firearms, Moran said, remains to be seen.

He also said he expects any treaty impinging on domestic gun rights to fall short of winning the constitutionally required two-thirds’ Senate approval needed for ratification.

Moran’s Second Amendment Sovereignty Act, introduced in March 2012, bars U.S. funds from being committed or spent in connection with treaty negotiations to restrict the Second Amendment rights of citizens or to regulate the domestic manufacture, assembly, possession, use, transfer or purchase of firearms, ammunition or related items.

In his speech, Moran said his measure also is intended to back the Obama administration’s position that the U.S. will not agree to any treaty infringing on the constitutional rights of American citizens or to provisions that would alter or diminish existing rights to manufacture, assemble, possess, transfer or purchase firearms, ammunition or related items.

Moran said he was referring to a letter he fielded from the State Department in August 2011. We failed to land a copy, but in a more recent, April 16, 2012, speech to the Stimson Center in Washington, Thomas Countryman, an assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, summarized the administration’s goals for the arms trade treaty conference in part by saying provisions limiting domestic gun rights would not be embraced.

""We will not support outcomes that would in any way infringe on the Second Amendment,"" Countryman said. ""...This has been the position of the executive branch since 2009, and it remains our position today. We will not support or agree to any treaty that would do so. We believe that the international community can draft a treaty on international arms transfers that would both increase international security and still protect sovereign rights of nations. That is the treaty that the United States will pursue in July and for which we expect there will be widespread support.""

As we looked into James’ claim, we noticed our friends at FactCheck.org looked into a similar claim in December 2009. That analysis, headlined ""International Gun Ban Treaty?,"" says Obama, reversing course from his predecessor, George W. Bush, agreed in 2009 to work with other UN member nations toward a conference possibly leading to an arms trade treaty. The article says that on Oct. 28, 2009, the UN General Assembly voted 153-1 to move forward in preparation for a conference, with the United States voting ""aye.""

Critics including former UN Ambassador John Bolton aired suspicions that any such treaty would require nations to restrict the domestic ownership of firearms, FactCheck.org reported, though a related General Assembly resolution acknowledged the right of nations to regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through national constitutional protections on private ownership. Another provision, the story says, acknowledges that countries have a right to arms for ""self-defence and security needs and in order to participate in peace support operations.""

Also noted by FactCheck.org: Two weeks before the cited General Assembly vote, Clinton insisted that any decisions at the conference on the treaty would be made by ""consensus,"" meaning that every country would have veto power on the negotiated agreement, according to an Oct. 14, 2009, Reuters news article, and it wouldn’t go into effect without the approval of all. In short, FactCheck.org said, no treaty will take effect if the U.S. disagrees.

So, the United States plans to participate in a conference possibly resulting in a treaty regulating the international arms trade, but the Obama administration has said it won’t support limits on the Second Amendment.

We followed up with Turney by asking if James had evidence of Obama and Clinton pushing to ban the use of firearms. She replied by email that James is ""very concerned that citizens need to keep pressure on the administration to defend the Second Amendment, especially heading into UN treaty negotiations.""

Our ruling

We found no evidence of Obama or Clinton indicating they want the UN conference on an arms trade treaty to ban the use of firearms; the recent speech by an administration underling states the government will not back a treaty that infringes on the Second Amendment.

This claim runs so substantially counter to reality, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/may/17/craig-james/craig-james-says-barack-obama-and-hillary-clinton-/

Lloyd Doggett says he represents or has represented about half of the residents of Congressional District 35
","
Appearing with fellow Democrats seeking a new U.S. House seat, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin defended his decision to run in the 35th Congressional District, which snakes from downtown San Antonio north into southeastern Travis County.

On the April 13, 2012, edition of KLRN-TV’s ""Texas Week,"" Doggett pointed out that this is the second decade that the state’s ruling Republicans, including Gov. Rick Perry, have tried to knock him out of the House by drawing district lines seemingly to his disadvantage.

Doggett, who is not seeking re-election in his newly Republican-leaning 25th Congressional District, said that, in contrast, ""the district that I am running in for re-election to Congress is the district that has more of my current constituents than any other district in the state. I represent or have represented about half of the district; the other half is new.""

Sylvia Romo of San Antonio, the Bexar County tax assessor-collector, objected, saying that 55 percent of the 35th district is in Bexar County. Inaccurate, Doggett said, and then the program’s host, Rick Casey, offered up that 47 percent of the district is in Bexar County with 31 percent in Travis County; that is where Doggett resides.

""But I don't just represent Travis County,"" Doggett replied. ""I represent Lockhart and San Marcos and Kyle. And when you include the areas that I serve in Congress, it's just under half of this total district.""

Phew. Is Doggett right?

By email, Doggett campaign spokeswoman Ashley Bliss-Herrera passed along a population analysis of the 35th district from the Texas Legislative Council, which helps state legislators draft legislation. Bliss-Herrera said the analysis shows that nearly 315,300 of the district’s nearly 698,500 residents, or 45 percent, live in the Travis, Hays and Caldwell county portions of the district. And, she said, Doggett has represented those areas before.

We provided Bliss-Herrera with another population analysis by the legislative council indicating that about 41 percent of the 35th district’s residents were previously in the 25th district now represented by Doggett. According to the council, the 35th district also sweeps in residents of the 10th, 20th, 21st, 23rd and 28th congressional districts that will be moot after the next Congress is sworn in.

Bliss-Herrera said the latter analysis does not account for parts of Travis County in the 35th district that Doggett has represented in the past. Doggett was initially elected to succeed Rep. J.J. ""Jake"" Pickle in 1994, representing what was then the 10th district taking in nearly all of Travis County.

This wrinkle seems believable, though we were unable to confirm as much from available legislative council data.

All told, then, it’s evident that Doggett has represented 41 percent of the district he seeks to represent. It’s also plausible that he’s represented 45 percent. That’s approaching half.

Mitt Romney once distanced himself from Ronald Reagan, but no longer
","
Ronald Reagan is the ultimate icon for Republicans. But has Mitt Romney flip-flopped on his support for the Gipper?

The flip-flop charge was raised by the Democratic National Committee in an video advertisement. Separately, one of Romney’s Republican primary opponents, Newt Gingrich, charged that Romney has demonstrated insufficient warmth for the late president.

In this item, we’ll ask whether Romney has flip-flopped on his degree of support for Reagan.

We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did.

What Romney said during his 1994 Senate campaign

In 1994, when Romney was challenging Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the two had a debate in which Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claimed that child poverty rates rose during the Republican administration of Reagan and his vice president, George H.W. Bush.
   
""Under the Reagan/Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know we’ve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs,"" Kennedy said. ""If you’re not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, you’re going to see the breakdown of the family as well.""
   
Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldn’t be used to score ""political hits,"" prompting Romney to fire back that he wasn’t politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was.
   
""I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all,"" Romney said. ""I talked about what I’d do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.""

We looked and couldn’t find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan, beyond the 1994 debate comment. Still, this example does strike us as a high-profile and unmistakable case of rhetorical distancing on Romney’s part.

Romney’s statements as a presidential candidate

By the time Romney began running for president -- which meant courting a staunchly conservative Republican base, rather than independents and Democrats as he had in Massachusetts -- Romney’s tone changed.

During his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bush’s tax cuts during a campaign event in New Hampshire.

""That's failing Reagan 101,"" Romney said, holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire.
   
Then, in a debate in October 2007, Romney was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, ""I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan.""

Romney has continued to offer praise of Reagan as the 2012 campaign approached.

In May 2010, Romney spoke at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif. He was talking about America’s position in the world.
   
""I’m optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them.""
   
After some applause, Romney continued by elaborating on Reagan-like policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased ""that wonderful line"" of Reagan’s:
   
""(Reagan) said, ‘Of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong.’ And he’s absolutely right,"" Romney said.
   
We found other examples of Romney's fealty to Reagan's legacy:
   
• When he proposed a detailed economic plan last year, Romney included a provision for a new ""Reagan Economic Zone,"" an international free-trade area designed to reward nations that have ""embraced free enterprise and open markets.""
   
• On Dec. 16, 2011, at a Fox News-sponsored debate, Romney referred to Reagan in explaining his change of heart on abortion. Both Romney and Reagan started off favoring abortion rights before shifting to an anti-abortion stance.
   
""I've learned over time, like Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and others, my experience in life over, what, 19 -- 17, 18, 19 years has told me that sometimes I was wrong,"" Romney said. ""Where I was wrong, I've tried to correct myself.""
   
• On Dec. 15, 2011, the Romney campaign unveiled a group called ""Reaganites for Romney,"" featuring officials who served in political or policy roles during the Reagan Administration.
   
""These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world,"" said Romney. ""The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships.""

Our ruling

In 1994, as a candidate running against a liberal icon in a liberal state, Romney said he was ""not trying to return to Reagan-Bush."" Then, 13 years later as he ran for the GOP presidential nomination, Romney spoke approvingly of the former president. Ever since, Romney’s affection for Reagan’s presidency has only grown.

Mitt Romney rejected state tax pledge before signing national one
","
These days, it’s hard for candidates to claim they truly oppose taxes if they haven’t put it in writing.

As a presidential candidate in 2012, Mitt Romney signed a pledge to forswear tax increases. In fact, in his official tax proposal, Romney has advocated across-the-board tax cuts.

But has he been consistent over the years about putting his commitment not to raise taxes in the form of a pledge?

The question about Romney and the tax pledge was raised in late 2007, when the Democratic National Committee released a 30-second ad and a four-minute video charging, among other things, that Romney had changed his position on signing a no-tax pledge. We checked the ad shortly after it came out.

In this report, we’ll put that question to the Flip-O-Meter.

We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did.

Romney and the 2002 gubernatorial campaign

During his 2002 campaign for governor of Massachusetts, Romney said he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group.

Here’s how the Boston Globe covered the news:

""In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge,"" the newspaper wrote. ""Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing.""

The article went on to quote Romney saying, ""I am not in favor of increasing taxes. … At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues.""

The Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. ""I'm against tax increases,"" Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. ""But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth.""

Barbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he’d met with her for half an hour. ""He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges,"" she suggested to the Globe.

Meanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted Eric Fehrnstrom, then Romney’s deputy campaign manager, saying, ""Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear.""

In an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge ""government by gimmickry,"" the newspaper reported.

Put it all together and you have a candidate who didn’t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general.

Romney’s decision on a pledge in late 2006

On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate in the 2008 presidential election to sign a prominent taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, an influential anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist.

""In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense,"" Norquist said in a news release. ""Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests.""

Romney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it.

""For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases,"" Romney said in the ad. ""I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy.""

In this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate.

It’s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context.

The Massachusetts text was a ""pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes.""

The Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to ""oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses … and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.""

Still, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements.

Our ruling

In 2002, Romney refused to make ""a pledge in writing"" on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that’s a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2012/may/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-rejected-state-tax-pledge-signing-nati/

Wisconsin recall challenger Tom Barrett says Gov. Scott Walker says ""no"" to equal pay for women
","
We’ve rated statements by three Wisconsin politicians about a law that eliminated the right of discriminated workers to sue in state court -- and none of the three earned better than a Mostly False.

Will Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett be added to the list?

Barrett, the Democratic challenger to Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election, made his claim in a TV ad released May 10, 2012.

In the ad, which makes several attacks on Walker, the narrator claims that Walker says ""no to equal pay for equal work for women.""

On the screen are male and female stick figures; an equals sign with a slash through it sits between them. The words ""Associated Press, 4/7/2012"" also appear, indicating the ad’s source is a news article.

The phrasing and the imagery in the ad suggest Walker opposes equal pay for women who are doing the same jobs as men.

Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told us the ad refers to an AP article in the Wisconsin State Journal about several bills signed two days earlier by Walker that Democrats say amounts to a Walker ""war on women.""

The new law repealed a change -- passed in June 2009 when Democrats controlled state government -- that allowed workers to pursue discrimination claims against their employers in state court.

Walzak argued that Walker was saying no to equal pay for women because the new law affects women who suffer workplace discrimination, and that Walker did so ""at the highest level"" that a governor can, by signing a law. He also argued that the old law, by allowing state court suits, deterred employers from discriminating and penalized those that did. The state’s anti-discrimination workplace law, he said, ""is only as good as its enforcement.""

Some employee attorneys contend the new law is a blow to equal pay because it takes away the option of a state lawsuit, which they say is easier and less expensive than one filed in federal court. Moreover, most but not all workplace discrimination claims can be filed in federal court.

In the nearly three years the old law was in effect, however, no state lawsuits were filed. We cited that when we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that the law was a ""gravy train"" for lawyers.

We also pointed out -- in rating False a claim by former Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk that women ""can’t do something"" about pay discrimination -- that a federal suit for damages is an option for most discriminated workers; and that all workers claiming discrimination can seek ""make whole"" remedies, such as back pay, through a state or federal agency.

And we rated Mostly False a statement by state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, that the old law ensured women would not be paid less than men.

Now it’s Barrett’s turn.

Our rating

Barrett said Walker says ""no to equal pay for equal work for women,"" suggesting Walker doesn’t want women to be paid the same as men for doing the same job, or that he has taken steps to ensure unequal pay.

Walker signed a law that removes one of the legal avenues women had to fight discrimination in pay. But such discrimination remains illegal and women who believe they are paid less because of their gender still have three options for pursuing their claims.

We rate Barrett’s claim False.

Rep. Bill Pascrell says New Jersey's transit system is largest in USA
","New Jersey’s transit system could begin seeing more customers if Port Authority toll hikes slated for December take effect.

That might be good for revenue, but the system is already overburdened, according to U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.), who spoke about the issue during a May 3 interview on WOR-AM’s ""The John Gambling Show.""

""New Jersey has the largest transit system in the entire country,"" said Pascrell, who will face Rep. Steve Rothman in the June 5 Democratic primary for a newly redrawn congressional district. ""One third of the budget of the transit system comes from the federal government, so what you’re doing is pushing ... folks that continue to drive our bridges and tunnels, (you) are not giving them relief to have an option to use mass transit, which is overburdened as it is right now.""

New Jersey has a major transit system but is it really the largest in the U.S.?

Not quite, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

""It depends on how you measure it,"" said Martin Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University.

Let’s start by noting that not all transit systems are the same. New Jersey has a statewide transit system, meaning its fleet of trains and buses, for example, cover much of the state. Most other transit systems in the country are regional, meaning coverage in part of a state or a portion of two states.

""Congressman Pascrell was referring to NJ Transit, the largest statewide transit system in the country,"" Pascrell spokesman Paul Brubaker told us in an e-mail.

So what’s the difference between the transit systems? Politics, Robins said.

New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, is funded by fare-payers and the state, but few political jurisdictions in New York state benefit from the MTA. NJ Transit has a built-in constituency in the Legislature because it serves much of New Jersey, he said.

Now, let’s check how New Jersey ranks.

""(If you’re looking at) which system carries the most people, has the most equipment operating every day, New Jersey clearly does not have the largest transit system in the country. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York is the largest,"" Robins said.

But in terms of statewide systems, New Jersey’s is the largest, Robins said.

The American Public Transportation System agreed.

""They’re not the largest transit system,"" said Virginia Miller, a spokesman for the advocacy group, which seeks to improve public transportation by making it available and accessible across the country. ""No one’s bigger in North America than (the MTA). They’re one of the biggest in the world. New Jersey is the highest statewide system.""

Based on 2010 figures in the APTA’s 2012 Public Transportation Fact Book, NJ Transit ranks second in the nation in terms of passenger miles, and seventh for unlinked passenger trips.

The Federal Transit Administration does not rank transit systems, but collects certain data from those systems that receive federal funding. Based on that, the FTA confirmed the MTA tops NJ Transit in terms of ridership, size of bus fleet, size of budget and miles of commuter rail.

Our ruling

Pascrell claimed during an interview on ""The John Gambling Show"" that New Jersey’s transit system is the largest in the nation, but didn’t distinguish that there are statewide systems and regional systems. Still, transportation experts and agencies we spoke with don’t discount the congressman’s statement. New York’s MTA is the biggest overall and New Jersey is within the top 10. In terms of statewide systems, New Jersey’s is, indeed, the largest. We rate the statement Mostly True.

Bob Latta says Obama promised the stimulus plan would have unemployment at 6 percent by now
","
For almost three years, going back to mid-2009, a top talking point for Republicans has been that President Obama ""promised"" that the stimulus bill -- the two-year spending package he championed to revive the economy -- would keep unemployment below 8 percent.

PolitiFact has examined the claim numerous times, and each time rated it Mostly False.

But the claim still circulates. We heard it most recently from Rep. Bob Latta of Bowling Green, who represents Ohio's 5th District, with a new wrinkle.

In a campaign statement endorsing Mitt Romney and criticizing the ""broken promises"" of Obama, Latta writes: ""President Obama promised Americans that his stimulus plan would revitalize the economy and that unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now.""

The claim about current unemployment being 6 percent added something new. We asked Latta's office how he backed it up.

As support for both the 6 percent and 8 percent figures, they pointed to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser.

The report, which others also have cited, projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.

The chart projects the current unemployment rate at about 6 percent with the stimulus, and about 6.5 percent without it.

As Latta's staff rightly noted, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just above 10 percent in early 2010 before falling to 8.1 percent in the most recent period.

But what we saw from the administration in January 2009, before Obama took office, was a projection, not a promise. We could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making a public promise. And the projection came with heavy disclaimers.

""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

A footnote that goes with the chart states: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action.""

The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong.

""None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January,"" Romer said in a July 2, 2009 interview on Fox. ""I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated.""

Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus.

In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein said the projections made in January were off because economic numbers for fourth-quarter 2008 weren't yet available. When they were released, they revealed the economy was in worse shape than economists realized. The baseline -- the prediction of what the economy would have done without the stimulus -- was far too optimistic

The implication of Latta's statement is that rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus didn't work. Many economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other.

There is an element of truth here: The incoming administration did predict that unemployment would peak at just under 8 percent if Congress approved the stimulus package and that it would be about 6 percent now.

But Latta's statement suggests Obama was offering some sort of guarantee.

The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had ""significant margins of error"" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity."" It was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. Those are critical facts that Latta’s claim ignores.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Latta’s claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/may/17/bob-latta/bob-latta-says-obama-promised-stimulus-plan-would-/

Obama ad claims Romney, Bain left misery in wake of GST Steel takeover
","
Mitt Romney’s business record is the central narrative of his presidential campaign -- and the main line of attack by his rivals. Is he a savvy businessman who understands the factors that make economies thrive? Or a corporate raider who makes rich profits for himself while often leaving working people as collateral damage?

You can guess which storyline President Barack Obama’s campaign is weaving. A new ad from Team Obama tells the story of GST Steel, a company taken over by Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney led for years before his entrance into politics.

In the ad, we meet several steelworkers who lost their jobs eight years after Bain took over GST. The plant, which went through several owners, first opened in 1888. At its peak it employed 4,500 people in jobs that ensured college for the kids and a secure retirement.. But by the mid 1990s, the plant was struggling against competition and operating with outdated equipment. Bain bought the mill in 1993, took on debt, changed the management and paid dividends to investors. It created a new parent company, GS Industries, and acquired other steel businesses, building its reach, and its debt. Then steel prices dove, and the company had no cushion to weather the difficult times. In 2001, the parent company filed for bankruptcy protection — and shut down the Kansas City plant.

""It was like watching an old friend bleed to death,"" former employee Joe Soptic says in the ad.

Then we hear Romney’s voice: ""As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, it breaks my heart.""

We’re checking a statement from an Obama campaign news release announcing the ad. It sums up the GST story this way: ""After purchasing the company, Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy.""

First, some background

The Kansas City plant produced wire for mattress springs and tires, as well as high-carbon balls and rods used by the mining industry to pulverize rocks. In 1993, owner Armco was looking to sell it, and selected Bain because the firm ""had earned a sterling reputation for turning companies around,"" according to a Reuters story from January 2012 about Bain’s takeover.

Bain Capital, in a statement responding to Obama’s ad, says it ""undertook an ambitious plan in 1993 to turnaround GSI, a struggling manufacturer of specialty steel products that was slated for closure if no investor could be found.  We invested more than $100 million and many thousands of hours into this turnaround, upgrading its facilities in an attempt to make the company competitive.""

Bain and its partners decided to buy the mill for $75 million, with Bain itself putting up about $8 million to gain majority control of the company, renamed GS Technologies Inc. 
We’ll examine each claim in the statement. So first, we address whether Bain ""loaded"" the steel company with debt.

‘Loaded it with debt’

After its initial $8 million investment, the new company issued $125 million in bonds — paying $65 million to stockholders in 1994, according to GS Technologies Operating Co. filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bain collected a $36.1 million dividend, according to Reuters.

GS Technologies announced plans to spend $98 million modernizing the Kansas City plant and in 1995, issued another $125 million in bonds to pay for a merger with another wire rod maker in South Carolina. Bain reinvested $16.5 million of its earlier dividend, Reuters wrote.

GST’s total debt in 1995: $378 million.

""Paying distributions with debt is not uncommon,"" Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, told Reuters. ""The only thing that strikes me as a bit unusual is the size of the dividend. There would be logic in them saving some cash for a downturn.""

Josh Kosman, a New York Post reporter and author of the book The Buyout of America: How Private Equity is Destroying Jobs and Killing the American Economy, said Bain reinvested its dividends so it could merge with the other steel company.

""They needed to get bigger, to have more earnings to be able to handle the debt,"" Kosman told PolitiFact.

Plans were put in place to take the company public, but other problems intervened.

According to a 2002 story in the Boston Globe, plant workers said the company’s new owners brought in an inexperienced management team that had no expertise in steel manufacturing, although filings show several top executives did have experience at steel companies.

In April 1997, the company faced its first labor strike in 40 years. The walkout stretched over 10 weeks, becoming bitter, divisive and sometimes violent.

Then prices for electricity and natural gas skyrocketed. A power bill in September 1998 was more than double what it had been in 1997, a costly increase because the plant depended so heavily on electrical equipment.

Meanwhile, a flood of cheap steel imports drove down prices in the late ‘90s, the company reported. In 1998, it worked with other steel companies and United Steelworkers of America to petition the government for limits on wire rod imports.

But Kosman, the book author, argues that the debt acquired under Bain was the overriding problem.

""After quickly raising profits, (Bain) had the company, less than one year after the buyout, borrow another $61 million to pay themselves a dividend. This left little room for error as profit, $32 million in 1995, could barely cover the increased interest expenses, rising from $9 million to $24 million,"" Kosman told us in an email.

""Even when profits fell below interest payments in 1998 and 1999 due to cheap imports, there was enough operating profit to survive if not for the interest expense.""

In its 2001 bankruptcy filing, GS Industries listed total debts of $554 million.

‘Closed the Kansas City plant’

Along with the bankruptcy filing came the announcement that GS Industries was shutting down the Kansas City mill.

Some 750 employees were put out of work.

In a news release, the company said the bankruptcy was triggered in part by ""the critical need to restructure the company's liabilities.""

How much of that was Romney’s fault?

Mark Essig, GS Industries’ former CEO, never met Romney. Essig came aboard in January 1998, the year before Romney left to run the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.

""His name never came up in conversation,"" Essig told PolitiFact. ""In my tenure at GSI, he wasn't involved at all.""

Of course, by the time Essig came on board, the bulk of the debt had already been acquired, during years in which Romney ran Bain. (That’s very different from another Bain investment we examined, KB Toys, in which Bain Capital didn’t get involved until after Romney left.) Romney wasn’t on GS Industries’ board of directors, but several Bain employees were.

Still, Essig points to a complex picture. Nearly half of U.S. steel companies filed for bankruptcy around the same time that GS Industries did. Major customers of the Kansas City plant did, too, Essig said.

""Prices went down, costs had gone up, and it was kind of the perfect storm,"" he said. ""Our debt load was a factor, no question about it. But there were companies without that debt load that also filed bankruptcy.""

Meanwhile, Essig pointed out, closing the Kansas City plant allowed GS Industries to save other plants.

""In that respect, we viewed it as a partial victory,"" Essig said.

Romney, who had left the company, retained his title as CEO of Bain Capital but was not involved in day-to-day operations.

""I take personal responsibility for making the investment,"" Romney said in a statement at the time of the plant closure, according to the Globe. ""But I didn't manage these companies. Our philosophy at Bain Capital was to support management teams in companies where we saw potential for growth, or in companies that were in financial distress that we thought we might be able to save.""

Essig, who voted for Obama in 2008 but this year plans to vote for Romney, doesn’t blame him.

""No matter how you look at it or what side of the fence you're on, a plant closing is a tragedy for people. I think when you try to tie it to a person and say, Mitt was responsible for this — a lot of steel companies went out of business at that time, and Mitt had nothing to do with it,"" he said. ""That was a macro-industry tidal wave that hit that plant. I bet if the Bain folks had to do it over again, they wouldn't have gotten involved with it. It can't be treated lightly, but to lay it at the doorstep of Mitt, I think, is not accurate.""

‘Walked away with a healthy profit’

Bain had always turned impressive profits, and the GS Industries deal was no exception. The Los Angeles Times wrote last year that a prospectus from 2000 showed Bain delivered an average annual return of 88 percent from 1984 to 1999.

The L.A. Times said Bain invested a total of $24 million in the entire steel company deal (including the merger in South Carolina) and ended up with a $50 million return -- ""a 100 percent gain.""

Reuters also noted that Romney continued receiving dividends from Bain after he left, and Bain collected $900,000 a year from the steel company for management consulting services through 1999.

‘Leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy’

Following the bankruptcy, GS Industries announced it would not provide workers with severance pay, health insurance, life insurance and pension supplements that had been promised.

GS Industries also left the company’s pension underfunded by $44 million and in 2002 the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. bailed it out.

Basic pension payments were covered, Reuters wrote, but not the supplement agreed to with the union.

Our ruling

Obama’s ad, and the news release announcing it, packed a lot of claims about Romney’s tenure at Bain Capital and how it handled its investment in a Kansas City steel mill.

We are checking this claim: ""After purchasing the company, Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy.""

We found, through corporate filings, interviews and investigations by other news organizations, that the statement is accurate but needs some clarification. First, it’s true that Bain added significantly to GST’s debt load while paying dividends to itself. The plant’s closure, however, happened after Romney had left daily operations at Bain, though he led Bain during six years of its majority investment in the plant. And other, outside factors were at work, making the steel industry a tough business. Steel prices were low and electricity costs were high, and those forces drove other steel mills out of business around the same time.

The statement’s last two claims are solid: Bain (and Romney) made a profit from taking over GST, and the employees lost many benefits their union had negotiated, including supplemental pension payments. The federal government had to step in to shore up the fund.

Mitt Romney said there are ""49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies""
","
During a campaign stop in St. Petersburg on May 16, 2012, Mitt Romney said he intended to make government work better and save money in the process.

As an example, he cited the federal government’s efforts to provide job training.

""Do you know how many federal job training programs there are? 49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies,"" he said.

Romney said he would look to consolidate programs and send them to the states.

""I want to take those dollars, put them together and give them to the state of Florida and say, ‘You create the program that’s best for your own people, that puts people to work.’ ""

We had never heard that there were ""49 different federal jobs programs,"" so we decided to check it out.

Our research eventually led us to independent reports from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a respected independent agency that investigates how the federal government spends money. The Romney campaign pointed us to the GAO as well.

The agency conducted a thorough study on job training programs run by the federal government and published its findings in 2011. (The report studied fiscal year 2009.) The GAO concluded that the federal government had 47 programs run by nine different agencies, numbers very close to what Romney said.

In later reports, the agency recommended that Congress look into streamlining the programs by combining administrative functions and locating different programs together at a single site.

The GAO also noted that more information is needed to measure the true effectiveness of the programs.

""Almost all of the 47 programs tracked multiple outcome measures related to employment and training, and the most frequently tracked outcome measure was ‘entered employment,’ "" the agency stated. ""However, little is known about the effectiveness of employment and training programs because, since 2004, only five reported conducting an impact study, and about half of all the remaining programs have not had a performance review of any kind.""

We should note that 47 programs sounds like a lot, but it doesn’t necessarily mean programs can be combined. It might not make sense, for example, to combine the ""Disabled Veterans’ Outreach Program"" with the ""Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers Program,"" or the ""Native American Employment and Training Program"" with the ""National Guard Youth Challenge Program.""

Finally, the 47 programs are not equal in size or scope. The GAO reported that seven programs accounted for 75 percent of the $18 billion spent on job training, while two programs (""Wagner- Peyser funded Employment Service"" and ""Workforce Investment Act Adult"") served about 77 percent of all participants.

Our ruling

Romney said that there are ""49 different federal job training programs that report to eight agencies."" The most recent comprehensive report we found on the matter found 47 job training programs under nine agencies. Also, a smaller subset of agencies account for a majority of spending on job training and number of people served. We rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.

Did George LeMieux vote for Barack Obama's jobs bill?
","
A new ad from Connie Mack says his Republican rival George LeMieux is a liberal -- and ""once a liberal, always a liberal.""

The ammunition: LeMieux’s votes during his brief time in the U.S. Senate. Former Gov. Charlie Crist appointed LeMieux to serve out the term of Mel Martinez, who resigned. LeMieux served from September 2009 to January 2011.

Mack and LeMieux are competing for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to go against Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson. (Mack is now a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Fort Myers.)

Mack’s ad shows President Barack Obama, mixing the president’s remarks with narration about LeMieux.  It goes like this:

Obama: ""Two Republican senators, Sens. George Voinovich and George LeMieux …  because of their decision, this jobs bill will finally pass.  ""

Narrator: ""George LeMieux was one of only two liberal Republicans who voted for Barack Obama’s liberal jobs bill that failed to help our economy.  ""

Obama: ""Sens. George Voinovich and George LeMieux .. and because of their decision, this jobs bill will finally pass, and I want to thank them.  ""

Narrator: ""George LeMieux: once a liberal, always a liberal.  "" (The ad closes with LeMieux huddling with Crist.)

We’re going to take out the Mack campaign’s ""liberal"" adjectives and focus on the facts of the matter: Was LeMieux one of two Republicans who voted for Obama's jobs bill?

The bill in question is the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010 (H.R. 5297), which Obama signed into law on Sept. 27, 2010.

As the name suggests, the law was aimed at getting money to small businesses and stimulating the economy. The law made about $30 billion available to small business, primarily through the Small Business Administration and its lending program for community banks. The law also included $12 billion worth of tax breaks for small business, mostly by changing tax rules on business expenses.

Opponents of the law said at the time that the lending program was similar to the Troubled Asset Relief Progam, or TARP. ""It had the mini-TARP in there, with no real help to small businesses, as far as I'm concerned,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the Washington Post  in 2010.

LeMieux and Voinovich were two Republican senators who voted with Democrats to move the bill through the Senate. The Mack campaign pointed us to these votes when we asked for evidence for their ad.

LeMieux and Voinovich cited widespread unemployment in their respective states (Florida and Ohio) as reasons to support the bill.

Back then, LeMieux answered questions about his support on MSNBC’s Morning Joe:

""Well, there's not been much I could agree on with the Democrats in Congress, because most of it's been job-killing. But this bill that (Sen.) Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and I worked on together is actually going to help small businesses in Florida. You know, Joe, that we've got nearly 2 million in Florida. They're suffering, and this bill will cut taxes by $12 billion for small businesses and increase lending to your local community bank, so that they can give dollars to small businesses and put people back to work. Doesn't raise the deficit, doesn't raise the debt, doesn't raise taxes. It made a lot of sense to me.""

LeMieux spokesman Anna Nix responded with similar comments when we asked her on May 15, 2012, about the attack ad.

Our ruling

Mack’s ad puts a lot of spin on the basic facts when it says, ""George LeMieux was one of only two liberal Republicans who voted for Barack Obama’s liberal jobs bill that failed to help our economy.  "" Certainly that ""liberal"" tag is what gives the ad its bite. 

Here, we’re simply checking whether LeMieux was one of two Republican senators who voted for a jobs bill supported by the president. That is the case. We rate that statement True.",/factchecks/2012/may/16/connie-mack/did-george-lemieux-vote-barack-obamas-jobs-bill/

Barack Obama advisers recommend a one-percent fee on all financial transactions, e-mail claims
","
Social Security beneficiaries beware: an e-mail hitting local inboxes claims President Barack Obama backs a scheme to tax your monthly check.

But the online missive falls short on facts.

""President Obama's finance team is recommending a one percent (1%) transaction fee (TAX). Obama's plan is to sneak it in after the November elections to keep it under the radar,"" the e-mail, which was sent to PolitiFact New Jersey on May 12, said. ""This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution - banks, credit unions, savings and loans, etc. Any deposit you make, or even a transfer within your own bank from one account to another, will have a 1% tax charged.""

""If your paycheck or your Social Security or whatever is direct deposit, it will get a 1% tax charged for the transaction,"" the e-mail claims.

Don’t empty your bank accounts and plan a life off the grid quite yet. Neither the president nor his financial team are recommending such a measure, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The idea comes from a Pennsylvania congressman’s proposal.

U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat, first advanced the concept in the House in 2004 when he introduced a bill that would have required a study on eliminating all federal taxes on individuals and corporations and replacing that revenue stream with transaction fees.

The bill had no co-sponsors and died in committee. Fattah introduced similar legislation several times after his first attempt calling for a study. Only one of those bills gained a co-sponsor, but none of them made it out of committee.

In 2010, Fattah ditched the calls for a study and introduced a bill -- called the ""Debt Free America Act"" -- to implement a one-percent transaction fee on ""any transaction that uses a payment instrument, including any check, cash, credit card, transfer of stock, bonds, or other financial instrument.""  Any transactions involving stocks were excluded from the fee.

With the fee, the bill ""intended to raise sufficient revenue to eliminate the national debt"" and ""phase out the income tax on individuals.""

The Debt Free America Act is the legislation the e-mail claims Obama and his financial team are recommending, though it’s the work of one congressman and the proposal never left committee.

Since the e-mail, a version of which PolitiFact Rhode Island deemed Pants on Fire in November 2010, started circulating, Fattah reintroduced the legislation.

The most recent bill, introduced in March 2011, still applies a one-percent transaction fee, but excludes personal bank account transactions in addition to transactions involving stocks.

It has no co-sponsors and was again referred to committee, where it remains.

Our ruling

An e-mail claims that the president’s finance team recommends a ""1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution.""

That’s ridiculous. A Pennsylvania congressman has sponsored a bill that would levy a one-percent fee on some financial transactions. But nearly every year he has introduced the legislation it gained no support. And none of the bills have ever left committee.

Obama -- and his financial team -- have nothing to do with the legislation.

We set this e-mail claim ablaze. Pants on Fire!

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Corrections and Updates', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney evolved significantly in his position on abortion
","
UPDATE: This article has been changed to reflect that the issues section of Romney's campaign website does address abortion, under the heading ""Values."" Our ruling remains the same. 
Mitt Romney has faced years of accusations that he’s flip-flopped on various issues. One issue where Romney has clearly changed his position is abortion.
   
We should note that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did.

First, we’ll look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later.

Here are two of the clearest statements of his position.
       
•  In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in every state, Romney added, ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.""
       
•  In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.""
       
We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career. (A few other media sources that provide a detailed accounting of the nuances of Romney’s abortion views can be found here and here.)

What about Romney’s views today? Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views in detail.  
       
""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.
       
""I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world.
       
""I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written.""

Romney repeated strong anti-abortion views throughout the 2012 presidential primaries.

For instance, during a town meeting in Hopkinton, N.H., on Oct. 10, 2011, Romney answered a question about his position on abortion this way:

""What I would like to see happen would be for the Supreme Court to say, look, we’re going to overturn Roe v. Wade and return to the states the authority to decide whether they want to have abortion or not, state by state. That’s the way it was before Roe v. Wade. So I am firmly pro-life."" 
And on his campaign website, Romney said he ""believes that life begins at conception and wishes that the laws of our nation reflected that view. But while the nation remains so divided, he believes that the right next step is for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade – a case of blatant judicial activism that took a decision that should be left to the people and placed it in the hands of unelected judges. With Roe overturned, states will be empowered through the democratic process to determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate."" 
It’s also worth noting that Romney has not denied a change of heart on abortion.

He traces it to a statehouse meeting with Harvard University stem-cell researcher Douglas Melton on Nov. 9, 2004. By Romney’s account, he was stunned to hear Melton say that ""we kill the embryos after 14 days."" (Two years after the meeting, Melton sharply contradicted that account, telling the Boston Globe that Romney ""mischaracterized"" his position and saying that he and Romney ""didn't discuss killing or anything related to it. I explained my work to him, told him about my deeply held respect for life, and explained that my work focuses on improving the lives of those suffering from debilitating diseases."" An exhaustive journalistic review of Romney’s stances on abortion by Slate’s William Saletan, however, suggests that Romney’s view of what transpired in the meeting is plausible.)

In an interview with the conservative blog RedState in September 2006, Romney said, ""My position changed during the stem-cell research debate. The provost of Harvard and the head of stem-cell research came into my office and at one point said that stem-cell research was not a moral issue because they killed the embryo at 14 days. And it hit me hard at that very moment that the Roe v. Wade philosophy had cheapened the value of human life. And I said to my chief of staff, who was with me in the meeting, as we came outside, ‘I am no longer content with the description of my position. I want to call myself pro-life.’ ""

Our ruling
       
Romney’s views on abortion are significantly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Indeed, Romney has acknowledged that his views on abortion have changed over the years.

On Mitt Romney and whether humans are causing climate change
","Do humans contribute to global warming? There’s been a robust debate over whether Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on this question. In this item, we’ll try to determine whether he has.

We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did.

Romney’s campaign website is silent on climate change. But in Romney’s 2010 book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, he wrote that ""I believe that climate change is occurring — the reduction in the size of global ice caps is hard to ignore. I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to factors out of our control.""
   
Then, in a town hall in New Hampshire in June 2011, a voter asked Romney whether he thought climate change existed and was caused by human activity. Here’s part of Romney’s answer (the full exchange can be seen on C-SPAN starting at the 21:00 mark):
   
""I don't speak for the scientific community, of course. But I believe the world is getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don’t know how much our contribution is to that, because I know there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past, but I believe that we contribute to that. So I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing.""

Romney added that he opposed the United States unilaterally adopting a cap-and-trade plan if other countries weren’t taking similar steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. A cap-and-trade plan would require industry to pay for their carbon emissions with new permit fees. There would be a limited amount of permits (the ""cap""), but companies would be able to buy and sell the permits among themselves (the ""trade"").

Later, in an Aug. 24, 2011, event in Lebanon, N.H., Romney said, ""Do I think the world's getting hotter? Yeah, I don't know that, but I think that it is. I don't know if it's mostly caused by humans. … What I'm not willing to do is spend trillions of dollars on something I don't know the answer to.""

And Romney discussed the issue in an Oct. 3, 2011, interview with reporters and editors of the New Hampshire Union Leader. (It was recorded here by C-SPAN; check around the 22-minute mark.)

Romney said, ""One, I believe what I said before, I think it's getting warmer. Two, I believe we contribute to it. And three, I don't know by how much -- a lot or a little. And so I am not willing to adopt multi-trillion dollar programs to reduce greenhouse gases in America. They don't call it America warming, they call it global warming.""
   
Both the book excerpt and the three New Hampshire comments suggest pretty clearly that Romney sees a role for humans in climate change, though he’s less committal about how large an impact humans are having.

But at a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pa., a few months later, Romney offered a somewhat different perspective. His comments were videotaped and promoted by the liberal advocacy website Think Progress.
   
A voter asked Romney, ""What is your position on man-made global warming and would you reject legislation, such as cap and trade, which is based on the idea of man-made global warming?""
   
""My view is that we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us. My view with regards to energy policy is pretty straightforward. I want us to become energy secure and independent of the oil cartels. And that means let’s aggressively develop our oil, our gas, our coal, our nuclear power.""
   
Much of Romney’s underlying policy proposals -- reducing foreign oil dependence; increasing the use of natural gas and nuclear power; and opposing cap-and-trade  -- remained the same in both comments.

But this time he left out human activity as a cause of global warming. Rather than saying, as he had in the past, that we don’t know how much of a role humans are playing in climate, Romney said, ""We don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

After Romney’s remarks were widely reported, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Boston Globe that Romney was not flip-flopping.

""This is ridiculous,"" she said in a statement. ""Gov. Romney’s view on climate change has not changed. He believes it’s occurring, and that human activity contributes to it, but he doesn’t know to what extent. He opposes cap and trade, and he refused to sign such a plan when he was governor.""
   
We were unable to find any remarks since then about whether he thought human beings contribute to global warming or not.
   
Our ruling
   
In June 2011, Romney said he believed ""the world is getting warmer"" and that ""humans contribute to that."" In October 2011, by contrast, Romney said that ""we don’t know what’s causing climate change on this planet.""

It’s unclear to us whether this was an inadvertent omission or a calculated attempt to say divergent things to different audiences.

Is West Virginia the ‘oldest’ state, as Jim Justice says?
","As the number of COVID-19 cases was rising in West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice warned that the state’s elderly population would be vulnerable if the virus’ spread was not contained.  ""West Virginia, you are the oldest state,"" Justice said at a July 27 press briefing, at the 9:22 minute mark. ""You are the most chronically ill state. You have the most lung problems of any state. You are sitting right with all the border states––all the way around you––you are sitting within a rock’s throw of two-thirds of the population of the whole country. You could explode in the most negative way that you could ever fathom."" Some of these metrics were too nebulous to measure, but we decided to take a closer look at age. Does West Virginia have the highest population of elderly residents in the country? We found that it doesn’t, but that it does rank near the top. There are at least two obvious ways to analyze how old a state’s population is. One of those is the percentage of the population made up by people 65 or older. According to 2019 Census Bureau data, 20.5% of West Virginia’s population is made up of people at least 65 years old. That ranks West Virginia the third highest of any state, behind Maine and Florida. (Puerto Rico, which is not a state, would rank higher than any of these three states.) Another way to measure a state’s age is to take the median age of the population. Census data for 2018 shows that West Virginia’s median age was 42.7 years. That ranked it fourth in the country. Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont all had higher median ages, as did Puerto Rico. Justice would have been correct two decades ago. The 2000 Census found that West Virginia did rank first in the country in median age, edging out Pennsylvania. Justice did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Justice said that West Virginia is the oldest state in the nation. Justice has a point that West Virginia has an older population than many states, and as recently as two decades ago it did rank No. 1. However, today, it’s not the oldest, by two different measures. West Virginia has the third-highest population of 65-and-over residents and the fourth-oldest median age of any state. So Justice wasn’t correct to say that his state is the nation’s oldest, but it does rank near the top.

Debunking (again) a 14-year-old post on immigrants in Los Angeles
","If you believed the statistical claims in a recent Facebook post being shared by thousands, you would think that Los Angeles is overrun by law-breaking immigrants. The factually flawed Facebook post that claims the Los Angeles Times as its source has long roots; it’s been circulating in various forms since at least 2006. Yet it’s no truer today than it was when fact-checkers first started looking into these faulty stats. PolitiFact found significant inaccuracies in many of the post’s assertions as recently as 2018. We rated another assertion in the new post Pants on Fire in 2009. And the bulk of the claims in the recent post have been debunked by such fact checkers as Snopes.com as long ago as 2006. Here is an abridged rundown of the assertions contained in the recent Facebook post, which the Los Angeles Times itself has long said are not, in fact, attributable to its work. ""1) 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card. (Donald Trump was right ) ""2) 95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens. ""3) 75% of people on the most wanted list in Los Angeles are illegal aliens. ""4) Over 2/3 of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal, whose births were paid for by taxpayers. ""5) Nearly 35% of all inmates in California detention centers are Mexican nationals; they are here illegally. ""6) Over 300,000 illegal aliens in Los Angeles County are living in garages. ""7) The FBI reports half of all gang members in Los Angeles are most likely illegal aliens from south of the border. ""8) Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal. ""9) 21 radio stations in LA are Spanish-speaking. ""10) In LA County, 5.1 million people speak English; 3.9 million, speak Spanish . (There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.) ""All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times."" The post also says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose picture accompanies the post, ""wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits (including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds)!"" Let’s take a closer look at some of the post’s specific claims. As Snopes.com first noted, this figure also appears, without additional sourcing, in 2005 congressional testimony by Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. ""In Los Angeles, 95% of all outstanding warrants for homicide (which total 1,200 to 1,500) target illegal aliens,"" she wrote in her testimony. ""Up to two-thirds of all fugitive felony warrants (17,000) are for illegal aliens."" When we contacted Mac Donald in 2018, she said, ""This information was given to me by a member of the (Los Angeles Police Department), who was making a rough estimate. It refers to fugitive warrants; homicide suspects who were in the country illegally often return to their home countries when they are sought on a warrant."" Even if this number was accurate at the time — and it was provided anonymously rather than being an official statistic — it is a ""rough estimate"" that is a decade and a half old. Those qualifications do not appear in the meme circulating today. Mac Donald never cited this figure in her 2005 testimony. We were unable to find any supporting evidence for it. Medi-Cal is the name of California’s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state, including, to a certain extent, undocumented immigrants. In 2018, a spokeswoman for California's Department of Health Care Services provided PolitiFact with statistics for 2012 and 2013. The percentage was 13.4% in 2012 and 12.6% in 2013. We rated this statement False. This is, at best, an assumption, because there’s no official data to back it up. Neither the FBI or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has officially estimated the percentage of gang members who are in the United States illegally. A 2011 FBI assessment said there were 1.4 million active street, prison, and outlaw motorcycle gang members affiliated with more than 33,000 gangs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It’s unclear how many of the 1.4 million were here illegally. In a 2017 six-week operation targeting all gang members, ICE arrested 1,378 individuals; 933 were U.S. citizens and 445 were foreign nationals. ICE didn’t have a breakdown of the foreign nationals’ immigration status. This is another instance where the numbers just don’t add up to support the claim. (In 2012, we rated it Pants on Fire.) Using updated data, there were about 9.7 million people in subsidized housing in 2017, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  So 60% of the 9.7 million would mean that about 5.8 million of those housing-subsidized residents were people here illegally, which experts have told us ""seems implausible"" and ""nonsensical."" A 2015 report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low levels of immigration, estimated that in 2012, 4% of households headed by immigrants in the country illegally used housing programs. ""While households headed by illegal immigrants make some use of housing and cash programs, their use is lower than that of households headed by the native-born for these programs,"" the study said. On Sept. 7, 2009, the Los Angeles Times published a column by Hector Tobar. He listed these assertions in order to debunk them and to decry what was then a new phenomenon of people sharing thinly sourced facts via chain emails. ""The authors of the chain e-mail and the phony government report fear what Los Angeles has become — a multilingual, multiethnic city with multicultural tastes,"" Tobar wrote. ""They search for information to persuade others to be afraid, but the actual numbers don’t quite add up to the big monster they think is out there. So they make the numbers bigger. Or they just make them up. And they spread them around until all that fear and anger turns into a big hate."" This one comes from a different direction, but it has also been circulating since at least 2006, just before the Democrats won control of the House. As far back as 2009, we rated it Pants on Fire. Pelosi’s office told PolitiFact that ""internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated."" She added, ""My record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors."" Snopes.com and FactCheck.org also debunked this assertion. Facebook posts said that according to the Los Angeles Times, ""95% of warrants for murder in Los Angeles are for illegal aliens,"" more than two-thirds of all births in Los Angeles County ""are to illegal alien Mexicans"" on Medicaid, ""nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties are illegal,"" and Nancy Pelosi ""wants to put a windfall tax"" on retirement fund profits. The assertions in this post not only range from unsupported to incorrect, but they have been circulating consistently for almost a decade and a half despite repeated debunkings by fact-checkers as well as the Los Angeles Times itself. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

2005 chloroquine study had nothing to do with COVID-19 and the drug wasn’t given to humans
","Chloroquine is back. The anti-malarial drug first showed up as a possible COVID-19 treatment around May 2020, when President Donald Trump said he had been taking its chemical cousin, hydroxychloroquine, to prevent getting infected with the virus. Since then, some studies have found that the drugs could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, but the research is not conclusive. There are currently no FDA-approved medicines specifically for COVID-19. (Chloroquine is chemically similar to hydroxychloroquine, but it is a different drug that’s primarily used to treat malaria. Both carry a particular risk for people with heart problems, plus other possible side effects.) Now, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been thrust back into the spotlight as misinformation about the drugs’ effectiveness and safety recently reappeared online. RELATED: Don’t fall for this video: Hydroxychloroquine is not a COVID-19 cure One such post on Facebook falsely claims that Americans have been deceived because health officials at the National Institutes of Health have known all along that chloroquine is effective against ""COVID.""  The post reads:  ""N.I.H. 15 years ago published a study on chloroquine. It is effective against COVID-(1). We are being lied to America!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is flawed.  First, there’s no such thing as ""COVID-1."" COVID-19 was named for the year it was discovered, not because it’s the 19th iteration.  Second, the 2005 study found that chloroquine was effective on primate cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, which is caused by a coronavirus. But while the two share similarities, SARS-CoV and COVID-19 are different diseases, and primate cells are far from human patients. Third, the study was indexed by the NIH’s National Library of Medicine, but the NIH was not involved. It was published in the peer-reviewed Virology Journal and conducted by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Montreal Clinical Research Institute. RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know The study was published in August 2005 and found that chloroquine has ""strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells"" and that it was effective on cells treated with the drug before and after exposure to the virus. The drug was not administered to actual SARS patients, and the study’s authors wrote that more research was needed on how the drug interacts with SARS in animal test subjects. ""Cell culture testing of an antiviral drug against the virus is only the first step, of many steps, necessary to develop an antiviral drug,"" Kate Fowlie, a spokesperson for the CDC previously told PolitiFact in an email. ""It is important to realize that most antivirals that pass this cell culture test hurdle fail at later steps in the development process."" Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant director of clinical virology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told us that a problem in virology is trying to determine the difference of how drugs work in cell culture in comparison to humans. ""Data on chloroquine is largely taken from these cell culture studies, but we now have trials in people on hydroxychloroquine that show it’s not as effective,"" Greninger said, ""and there’s new data out in the last week that suggests that some of the reasons could be because of the cell types that SARS coronaviruses grow in, and this original experiment was done on African green monkey kidney cells, which is not the tissue we are really worried about."" The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorizations for some medicines to be used for certain patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but it revoked the authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in mid-June due to concerns over the drugs’ serious side effects. There are currently no FDA-approved medicines for COVID-19.  ""It is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,"" FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton wrote. The NIH’s COVID-19 treatment guidelines, which were developed to inform clinicians on how to care for patients with COVID-19, also currently recommend against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, except in a clinical trial. But even those trials have been halted. The World Health Organization and the NIH announced in mid-June that they would stop hydroxychloroquine patient trials, citing safety concerns that include serious heart rhythm problems, blood and lymph system disorders, kidney injuries, and liver problems and failure. A Facebook post says that the NIH published a study 15 years ago that showed chloroquine was effective against ""COVID-(1)"" and that health officials have been lying to the American people. This is wrong. There’s no such thing as ""COVID-1"" and the study cited was not published by the NIH and had to do with animal cells infected with SARS, not COVID-19. The drug was not given to human patients and the study’s authors said more research was needed. Health officials caution against the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients, citing the possibility of serious side effects. There are currently no approved treatments for the virus. We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2020/jul/29/facebook-posts/2005-chloroquine-study-had-nothing-do-covid-19-and/

Mark Warner says he opposes defunding police, contrary to Daniel Gade's claims
","The national debate on law and order is spilling into Virginia’s U.S. Senate race, with Republican nominee Daniel Gade repeatedly saying incumbent Democrat Mark Warner wants to defund police departments. ""@MarkWarner & his party bosses are calling to defund police…"" Gade tweeted on July 22. ""Do you agree with @MarkWarnerVA and @TheDemocrats that we should defund our police?"" Gade asked in a July 23 tweet, which contained boxes for readers to vote ""yes"" or ""no."" We fact-checked Gade’s claim and found no evidence that Warner supports defunding police. To the contrary, the senator has often said he opposes such action. Let’s take a deeper look. Background Gade is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who lost his right leg in combat in Iraq. He has a Ph.D. in public administration and policy and is a professor at American University. This is his first run for public office. The ""defund"" movement calls on local governments to shift spending on law enforcement to programs that address economic and social issues for minorities. It came to the forefront after the May 25 death of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have depicted the defunding movement as a dismantling of police forces. Trump, who is running a law and order reelection campaign, has repeatedly accused Democratic nominee Joe Biden of wanting to defund police. PolitiFact National recently rated the claim False, pointing to a CBS interview in which Biden said he opposed the policy. Some protestors in the wake of Floyd’s death have called for the elimination of police forces.  But many supporting defunding say it doesn’t mean an end to policing but, rather, a reallocation of some of the money and work that has traditionally gone to police departments. For example, instead of dispatching police to routine problems involving the homeless or drug abusers, they say it would be better to send officials from other municipal departments that have training in treating such people. Some of the funds going to police, they say, would be better spent treating mental illness and addiction. Warner’s record Warner has said at least four times that he opposes defunding police. All of his statements came at least a month before Gade accused him of backing the policy.  During a June 8 Facebook town hall meeting, Warner said, ""Let me be clear, I don’t support defunding the police."" In a June 11 article by Channel 29 in Charlottesville, Warner was quoted saying, ""...I don’t think we should get caught in these slogans like defunding the police. To me, that’s not where I’m headed. I’m looking at reform, criminal justice reform."" On June 19, Channel 12 in Richmond aired a report on the policing positions of Warner; Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va; and Rep. Denver Riggleman, R-Va. The report said, ""All three disagree with the ‘defund the police’ slogan…"" The report was posted on Warner’s campaign site.  During a June 22 Facebook town hall meeting, Warner said of defunding police, ""I don’t think that slogan or that policy is something that I support."" Warner is among 36 Democratic senators that have endorsed a police reform bill by Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J. It would:  Make police officers more legally liable for misconduct;  Improve data collection so that an officer’s misconduct record would be available if he applied to work for another police force; Improve police training and ban chokeholds. Gade’s Response We were unable in three attempts to reach Gade’s campaign. Gade, however, responded to a July 23 blog - posted by Blue Virginia, a liberal website - accusing him of telling ""lies"" about Warner’s defunding stance.   Gade, replying on Facebook the next day, said Warner’s position on police reform is ""confusing."" He added, ""It’s time to get some straight talk. Mark, do you support defunding the police or not? We’re all awaiting your answer."" Our ruling On July 22, Gade said Warner is ""calling to defund the police."" He repeated the claim two days later. Warner, at least a month before Gade’s statements, said he is opposed to defunding police. The senator staked out his position in virtual town hall meetings, TV reports, and on his campaign website. The statements can be easily found, clear as day. We rate Gade’s claim False.  ",/factchecks/2020/jul/29/daniel-gade/mark-warner-says-he-opposes-defunding-police-contr/

How Early Should You Send In Your Mail-in Ballot To Make Sure It Gets Counted? It Varies By State
","Election officials across the United States are preparing for a surge of mail-in ballots this fall, as fears about voting in-person on Nov. 3 continue amid the COVID-19 pandemic.    But there are also fears about the mail-in voting process. Some are concerned, for example, that a crush of ballots dropped in the mail could result in delays in getting them to election offices and votes not being counted.  Several popular posts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter suggest people should allow ""at least 14 days roundtrip"" to ensure they can request, fill-out and send back their ballots on time.  Some posts say the U.S. Postal Service recommends this two-week period. They also claim that Election Day is really Oct. 20, and not the official date, Nov. 3, for those who want to vote by mail.  Here are two examples:  Do people really need to allow so much time for mail-in voting?  We set out on a fact check.  Our research All voters should check with their state and local election officials about mail-in voting deadlines. We found, however, that some states give far more time than others for ballots to be received, which chips away at the premise there’s a fixed deadline for all Americans who vote-by-mail.  In California, for example, election officials must accept mail-in ballots that arrive up to 17 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3. That’s the result of a new law passed this year.  In North Carolina, ballots are accepted three days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by that day. In Georgia, Hawaii, Connecticut and many other states, there’s no extension: ballots must arrive by the time polls close on Nov. 3.  ""The most common state deadline for election officials to receive absentee or mail ballots is on Election Day when the polls close,"" the National Conference of State Legislatures says on its website. ""Some states, however, accept and count a mailed ballot if it is received after Election Day but postmarked prior to the election."" Deadlines for all 50 states are listed on the NCSL website here.  Social Media Claim ‘Misses The Mark’ Amber McReynolds, a national expert on election administration and Denver’s former elections director, said the social media posts present a blanket warning that might be accurate for some states, but wrong for others.  Registered voters in seven states — California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Colorado and Vermont, plus Washington D.C. — don’t have to request a mail-in ballot. They’ll automatically receive one in the mail several weeks ahead of the election, removing one hurdle and some time in the process, McReynolds noted.  Voters in these states, and the dozens of others where people can request a mail-in ballot, can also return them at a drop box at designated locations to avoid concerns about postal service delays.  In California, voters can also return their vote-by-mail ballots at any in-person voting location, said Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the state’s Secretary of State’s Office. ""To say Election Day is October 20th or it takes 14 days misses the mark,"" added McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote At Home Institute, which advocates for putting voters’ needs first. ""It’s not taking into account all of these other factors."" That's not to say voters should wait until the last minute. Experts, including McReynolds, say people should make sure they are registered to vote, request a mail-in ballot as early as possible and return it well in advance of their state’s deadline.  One of the social media posts claims ""tens of thousands"" of ballots went uncounted in 2016. That is correct. In May, The Washington Post reported that of the roughly 33.2 million mail ballots received and tabulated during the 2016 general election, approximately 1 percent weren’t counted. That would amount to about 332,000 ballots. The reasons for rejection included the lack of a matching signature, problems with the return envelope and missing the deadline, the Post reported.  Response From Postal Service While the suggestion that Oct. 20 is the real vote-by-mail deadline is off base in several states, there is some truth to what the social media posts are saying about recommendations from the U.S. Postal Service.  In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for the agency wrote: ""We recommend that jurisdictions immediately communicate and advise voters to request ballots at the earliest point allowable but no later than 15 days prior to the election date."" It went on to say: ""The Postal Service recommends that domestic, non-military voters mail their ballots at least one week prior to their state’s due date to allow for timely receipt by election officials. The Postal Service also recommends that voters contact local election officials for information about deadlines.""  Many questions have been raised about the Postal Service’s financial challenges and whether it has the capacity to handle the load of mail-in ballots this fall.  The agency said its financial condition ""is not going to impact our ability to process and deliver election and political mail.""  ""The Postal Service has ample capacity to adjust our nationwide processing and delivery network to meet projected Election and Political Mail volume, including any additional volume that may result as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" it said.  McReynolds added that ballots represent a tiny fraction of the mail volume regularly handled by the postal service.  Our rating Several widely-shared social media posts suggest that Election Day for Americans who want to vote-by-mail is really Oct. 20 and not the official date, Nov. 3. They also say the U.S. Postal Service recommends allowing ""at least 14 days roundtrip"" to ensure they can request, fill-out and send back their mail-in ballots on time. We found some of this is accurate, but not for all states.  Some allow far more time for the receipt of mail-in ballots than others. Ballots are still counted in California, for example, 17 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Nov. 3. In many others, there’s no extension and ballots must be received on Election Day. But even in states that grant less time, voters have options. They can speed things up by using a ballot drop box or returning their ballot at in-person polling locations.  Giving some credence to these posts, we found the U.S. Postal Service does recommend the early request of mail-in ballots. It says voters should do that as early as possible and no later than 15 days before the election. It also recommends returning those ballots at least a week early and contacting local election officials about deadlines. In the end, these social media posts stretch the truth by suggesting there’s a fixed deadline of Oct. 20 to vote-by-mail in the United States. The Postal Service and elections experts encourage voters to act early, but deadlines vary by state.  We rate the overall claim Half True.  HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",/factchecks/2020/jul/28/facebook-posts/how-early-should-you-send-your-mail-ballot-make-su/

Opening a case file does not mean Joe Biden is a criminal suspect in Ukraine
","""If there were a serious criminal investigation against Joe Biden, I think we’d know about it."" That’s what Lincoln Mitchell, a war and peace studies scholar at Columbia University, told PolitiFact about a social media claim being shared about the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee barely three months before Election Day. The July 22 Instagram post is an image of a tweet posted two days earlier. The tweet reads: ""BREAKING: Democratic Presidential nominee @JoeBiden is formally being listed as a criminal suspect by high level Ukraine government officials, in a major case involving his son -- Hunter."" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""That is fake. Joe Biden is not listed as a suspect in any criminal case in Ukraine,"" Daria Kaleniuk, executive director and co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, told PolitiFact. Moreover, a court in Ukraine has no right to issue a notice of suspicion in a criminal investigation; that is done only by prosecutors, she told us. As we’ve reported: Hunter Biden, the former vice president’s son, held a paid directorship with a natural gas company called Burisma Holdings, beginning in 2014. It drew attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor Yanukovych. When Yanukovych went into exile after a popular revolution, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving his business. In 2015, Ukraine’s newly appointed prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin inherited some of the investigations. He was ousted in 2016 by the legislature. In 2018, Joe Biden said that while he was vice president, he had threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine unless Shokin was sacked. Biden said Shokin was failing to aggressively pursue allegations of corruption in Ukraine. The claim in the Instagram post cites a two-minute video from One America News Network, a conservative cable news service, that was viewed more than 1.2 million times.  The video states that a Ukrainian court ordered Biden to be formally listed in a criminal case and that the order cannot be appealed. The crime, according to the video, is the alleged firing of Shokin ""in exchange for dropping an investigation"" into Hunter Biden and Burisma. The report cites no sources. Andriy Derkach is a Ukrainian lawmaker and former member of Ukraine’s pro-Russia political party who has been called the ""Ukrainian Putin."" He has alleged that audio recordings he released of conversations between Joe Biden and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko showed corruption by Biden and treason by Poroshenko in their discussions about ousting Shokin, the prosecutor. News reports in May said Ukrainian prosecutors had launched a treason investigation of Poroshenko. President Volodymyr Zelensky said prosecutors had ""registered criminal proceedings"" at the request of Derkach, and ""they will investigate.""  Experts say the order involving Biden is much less than it appears. Kaleniuk told us that Derkach’s complaint was registered only because it had been rejected by prosecutors.  ""It doesn’t mean that Joe or Hunter Biden are suspects. It means that, according to Ukrainian criminal procedure code, all formal criminal complaints have to be registered by law enforcement agencies, and if they don’t do so, the claimant can force prosecutors to start formal investigation through court,"" she said. Ukraine expert Adrian Karatnycky, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, told PolitiFact that in Ukraine, ""criminal case files are opened pending investigations at the request of parliamentarians, on the basis media allegations, requests from civic groups and citizens. This is not the same as an actual criminal investigation. Such cases are registered and do not rise to the level of criminal investigations until the allegations are first vetted. ""Once a criminal investigation is launched on merit, the subject is informed in writing and asked to provide testimony, appear for interrogation, etc. And only after this is a criminal indictment potentially issued,"" said Karatnycky, who is also managing partner at New York-based Myrmidon Group, which does consulting on Ukraine. In a news story, the Kyiv Post reported that Judge Serhiy Vovk issued the order for the investigation on April 21, but it only became public on May 21. Vovk has a ""toxic reputation"" and has faced accusations of issuing illegal and politically motivated rulings, the story said. A claim that Joe Biden is formally listed as a criminal suspect in a case in Ukraine involving his son Hunter misconstrues the facts. A judge in Ukraine has ordered that a criminal case file be opened regarding Biden’s efforts as vice president to get Ukraine’s top prosecutor removed from office. But the opening of the file does not mean that a criminal investigation has been launched on merit and does not mean Biden has been listed formally as a criminal suspect.

Don’t fall for this video: Hydroxychloroquine is not a COVID-19 cure
","Millions of people, including the president of the United States, have seen or shared a video in which a doctor falsely claims there is a cure for the coronavirus, and it’s a medley starring hydroxychloroquine. The video shows several doctors in white coats giving a press conference outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. It persists on social media despite bans from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and it was published by Breitbart, a conservative news site.  The July 27 event was organized by Tea Party Patriots, a conservative group backed by Republican donors, and attended by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. In the video, members of a new group called America’s Frontline Doctors touch on several unproven conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. One of the most inaccurate claims comes from Dr. Stella Immanuel, a Houston-based primary care physician and minister with a track record of making bizarre medical claims, such as believing in alien DNA. ""This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,"" Immanuel said. ""I know you people want to talk about a mask. Hello? You don’t need a mask. There is a cure."" As of July 27, nearly 150,000 Americans had died because of the coronavirus. Could those deaths have been prevented by a drug that’s used to treat lupus and arthritis? No. Immanuel’s statement is wrong on several points. There is no known cure for COVID-19.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no specific antiviral treatment for the virus. Supportive care, such as rest, fluids and fever relievers, can assuage symptoms. ""There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19,"" according to the World Health Organization. In spite of Immanuel’s anecdotal evidence, hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other drugs is not a proven treatment (or cure) for COVID-19.  The Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In mid-June, the FDA revoked its emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. ""It is no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of HCQ and CQ may be effective in treating COVID-19, nor is it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks,"" FDA Chief Scientist Denise M. Hinton wrote. The WHO and the National Institutes of Health have also stopped their hydroxychloroquine studies. Among the safety issues associated with treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine include heart rhythm problems, kidney injuries, and liver problems.  While some studies have found that the drug could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, the research is not conclusive. Few studies have been accepted into peer-reviewed journals. And large, randomized trials — the gold standard for clinical trials — are still needed to confirm the findings of studies conducted since the pandemic began. In the video, Immanuel cited a 2005 study that found chloroquine — not hydroxychloroquine — was ""effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV,"" the official name for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. But the drug was not tested on humans, the authors wrote that more research was needed to make any conclusions, and SARS is different from COVID-19. Health officials advise everyone to wear masks in public. The reason why has to do with how the coronavirus spreads. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they expel respiratory droplets containing the virus. Those droplets can then land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. Since some people infected with the coronavirus may exhibit no symptoms, public health officials say everyone should cover their faces in public — even if they feel well. ""The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth face coverings are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing, frequent handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces,"" according to the CDC. In a viral video, Immanuel said there is a cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine can treat it and people don’t need to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. All of those claims are inaccurate. There is no known cure for COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment, and public health officials advise everyone to wear face masks in public.

Biden wrong that McDonald’s workers can’t jump to competing chains
","Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden showed sympathy for a beleaguered McDonald’s worker, but his tough words about the fast food giant got nearly every detail wrong. At a roundtable organized by the Service Employees International Union, a single mother told Biden about her struggle to take care of her son as COVID-19 has shuttered his school, while her pay barely allows her to get by. ""I don’t get any kind of benefits,"" said Adriana Alvarez. ""No parent who works hard and plays by the rules should have to go through what McDonald’s is putting us through."" Biden commiserated, saying McDonald’s relies on a strategy to suppress wages. ""McDonald’s is making billions of dollars, but here’s the deal,"" Biden said July 22. ""They’ve made you all sign noncompete contracts that you cannot go across town to try to get a job at Burger King. And maybe, and I’m not saying you could, but you get 25 cents an hour more. People who are hourly workers are required to sign noncompete: ‘I will not go anywhere to any business like the one I’m in to get a raise.’"" Line employees at McDonald’s franchises don’t command high wages, but Biden was wrong about the use of noncompete contracts.  Factcheck.org found several problems with this claim. Biden campaign spokesman Micheal Gwin said that Biden was making the larger point that low-wage workers face barriers to moving to better paid work.  Biden said McDonald’s workers sign employment contracts with language that blocks them for working for a competing fast food chain such as Burger King. They don’t. A noncompete agreement prevents someone from working for a competitor. That was not the case. Any McDonald’s worker who quit to work at a Burger King is free to do that. There was a time when they faced a different hurdle. They were blocked from moving from one McDonald’s franchise to another McDonald’s franchise. That is what economists have dubbed a no-poaching clause, and it applies only among franchises within the same chain. Until 2017, that was part of the agreement between the local franchise owners and McDonald’s Corp., the franchiser. The local owners could not lure workers away from each other. The workers would never see that clause, so  Biden was incorrect when he said they signed noncompete contracts. In 2017, a McDonald’s worker in Illinois sued the company because she was barred from getting a job at another McDonald’s restaurant where she would make more money. In March that year, McDonald’s announced it would no longer enforce that part of its franchise agreement and would no longer include it in future agreements. For other chains, the change took longer. In January 2018, the Washington state attorney general’s office began investigating the no-poach practice among a wide range of franchise companies. The investigation drew heavily on research by two Princeton University economists who found that 58% of franchise operations used this strategy and it likely kept wages down. By July 2018, more chains had agreed to drop the practice, both in Washington state and nationally. The list included Arby’s, Cinnabon, Buffalo Wild Wings and others. Burger King, Pizza Hut, Denny’s and five other chains signed similar agreements by September 2018. In the October of 2019, Washington’s assistant attorney general told Congress that 155 corporate chains representing 160,000 locations nationwide had dropped the practice. The International Franchise Association, a trade group, said in a statement that there’s no question that the ""clear trend is the franchise business is moving away from the use of these no-poach contracts."" The Biden campaign said the situation with no-poach clauses has moved in the right direction, but it's hard to say that the practice no longer exists. Biden said that McDonald’s workers sign a noncompete agreement that bars them from taking a better paying job with a competing chain. Until three years ago, McDonald’s did have a clause in its franchise agreements between the corporation and local owners that blocked them from hiring away staff from each other. McDonald’s ended that practice in March 2017, and since then, over 150 national chains have followed suit. That practice involves a no-poach clause, not a noncompete clause, which has to do with working for a competitor. McDonald’s workers do not sign a noncompete agreement.

Biden is right. Pay for home health workers is paltry
","In a speech this month, former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, offered the third installment of a four-part economic plan being rolled out in advance of the  Democratic National Convention in August. This set of proposals focused on caregivers — whether for children, older adults or people with disabilities — and is about ""easing the squeeze on working families who are raising their kids and caring for aging loved ones at the same time,"" Biden said. His campaign’s sweeping set of initiatives, which represent a $775 billion expenditure in a variety of programs, aims to get significant traction among middle-class voters, whose struggles with caregiving issues have been exacerbated during the coronavirus pandemic. When it came to home health workers, Biden zeroed in on their paychecks. ""They’re doing God’s work,"" he said. ""But home health workers aren’t paid much, they have few benefits. Forty percent are still on SNAP or Medicaid. So my plan is direct. It gives caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise."" That 40% is a striking number. After all, there are an estimated 3.3 million home health and personal care aides in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These workers provide a range of daily living services to millions of older Americans and people with disabilities, chronic illness or cognitive impairment — making them an important part of the health care continuum. As the baby boom population ages, demand for home health workers is expected to increase rapidly. And, because Biden put a spotlight on the role caregivers could have in boosting the economy, we decided to investigate further. We contacted the Biden campaign to find out the source for the 40% statistic. A spokesperson pointed us to information from PHI National’s Workforce Data Center. PHI is a New York-based advocacy organization that studies the direct-care workforce, which is frequently cited as a source on this topic. The group indicated that in 2017 42% of direct care workers, a category composed of personal care aides, home health aides and nursing assistants, received some form of public assistance — defined by PHI as food and nutrition assistance, public health insurance or cash assistance. A further breakdown of this broad job category showed that 53% of home care workers received public assistance, with 30% having received food and nutrition assistance and 33% Medicaid insurance coverage. Based on these figures, Robert Espinoza, PHI’s vice president of policy, said Biden was certainly in the ballpark. But there’s more. The two programs Biden mentioned by name — SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for low-income people — peg eligibility to income limits at or near the federal poverty level, which for an individual is $12,760. Those eligibility limits vary by program and state. Medicaid eligibility for adults depends on where they live, and ranges from 138% of poverty in states that chose to expand the program under the Affordable Care Act to a median of 40% of poverty in those states that didn’t. For SNAP, those limits are set at 130% percent of the poverty level for gross monthly income and 100% for net monthly income. For an individual, that’s $1,354 and $1,041, respectively. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median pay for home health workers is about $24,060 per year, and a 2019 report by PHI concluded that 47% of home health workers have incomes at or below 138% of the poverty level. These numbers further back up Biden’s assertion about the number of home health workers on Medicaid or SNAP. If anything, they suggest his 40% figure may be a lowball estimate. And one more bit of evidence that Biden was on the right track: The National Employment Law Project noted that many of these workers ""supplement their home care work with other jobs to make ends meet."" That PHI report asserted that half of home care workers have only a high school education and often work part time or inconsistent schedules. These jobs are also marked by high turnover rates. Biden said home health workers were paid very little, citing a statistic that 40% of these workers relied on public assistance programs like SNAP and Medicaid as evidence. According to the experts with whom we spoke, and the documents we consulted, Biden accurately described home health workers’ income and their reliance on these programs. His number appears to represent the low end of the spectrum. We rate this statement True.",/factchecks/2020/jul/28/joe-biden/biden-right-pay-home-health-workers-paltry/
"['History', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Joe Biden']","
The long history of racism in the US presidency
","At a town hall meeting, a home care provider spoke to former Vice President Joe Biden about racist rhetoric targeting Asian Americans during the pandemic. Biden responded by leaning into racism allegations against President Donald Trump. ""We’ve had racists, and they’ve existed, they’ve tried to get elected president. He’s the first one that has,"" Biden said July 22. Biden’s pointed statement was memorable for a few reasons: Not only was he calling the sitting president a racist, but Biden also asserted that no other racists held the office before Trump. Historians say this is wrong. Various presidents since the country’s founding can be considered racist, whether because they enslaved Black people, held racist beliefs, or used racist rhetoric. Multiple early presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, enslaved Black people. Andrew Jackson forced Native Americans from their lands, causing migrations in which many died. Andrew Johnson sought to undermine Reconstruction in the South after the Civil War. Woodrow Wilson, a Southerner with nostalgia for the antebellum South, re-segregated the federal government. Still others privately used racial slurs or believed whites were the superior race. ""If Mr. Biden wanted to call the president a racist, he should have done so and left it at that,"" said H.W. Brands, a history professor at The University of Texas at Austin. ""Bringing in history confuses the issue."" Not everyone sees eye-to-eye on who they consider racist. Nikki Brown, an Africana studies professor at the University of Kentucky, said a person’s race may play a role in which presidents they view as racist. White people might look for red flags like using racial slurs as a sign that someone is racist, Brown said, while Black people and other people of color may also point to a politician who ""supports laws that treat African Americans as inferior or unworthy."" Whatever definition you use, many presidents can be considered racist. The most obvious category would be presidents who personally enslaved people. Historians generally consider 10 of the first 12 presidents to fall into this category. (The exceptions were John Adams and his son John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts.) Most of these presidents were born in the slavery-era South. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, and John Tyler were born in and represented Virginia. Andrew Jackson was born in South Carolina and represented Tennessee; Zachary Taylor, who owned 100 people, was born in Virginia and resided in Louisiana; and James K. Polk was born in North Carolina and resided in Tennessee. Martin Van Buren was from New York, where slavery lingered after formal abolition. By the standard of enslaving people, ""the first 60 years of the U.S. republic would have been run by racists,"" Brown said. Within the category of presidents who enslaved people, some historians see gradations of racism. For instance, Washington not only enslaved people but also, as president, moved some of them to and from the then-capital of Philadelphia every few months. ""Pennsylvania had passed a law ensuring the freedom of enslaved people who resided in the state after a period of time,"" said Saint Louis University historian Lorri Glover. This gambit ""re-set the clock on their bondage and precluded their freedom."" On the other hand, Washington was initially opposed to Black troops during the Revolutionary War but changed his mind during the war, and he later said that his favorite unit was one that was half Black, said Paul Finkelman, the president of Gratz College in Pennsylvania who has written extensively about slavery. Washington also freed his enslaved people and set them up with land. Historians paint his contemporary, Jefferson, more negatively. In his writings, Jefferson ""said that Blacks are inferior"" and tried to justify it scientifically. While Jefferson claimed not to sell enslaved people except in limited cases, he regularly wrote to his plantation managers asking them to sell enslaved people because he needed the money, Finkelman said. And in her book, ""Founders as Fathers,"" Glover detailed the stark contrast between how Jefferson treated his acknowledged white family and his unacknowledged family with Sally Hemings, who was enslaved. A later president who enslaved people, Andrew Jackson, also worked for the forced relocations of Native Americans, during which many died.  The roots of the federal takeover of Indian lands, often undergirded by notions of white superiority, dated back to the first five presidents, Glover said. Subsequent presidents continued Jackson’s approach. ""Polk opened Texas, and, if he'd had his way, would have opened California too, to cotton planting with slaves,"" said Jason M. Opal, a McGill University historian.  John Tyler went so far as to join the Confederate government 16 years after he left the White House. Lesser known presidents like Millard Fillmore have racist pasts, too. Though he was a New Yorker who didn’t enslave anyone, Fillmore ""said absolutely horrible things about Black people,"" Finkelman said.  Fillmore signed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which ""made it possible to literally kidnap free black people in the North, bring them before a compliant federal commissioner, and drag them into slavery,"" Finkelman said. ""Freedmen Voting in New Orleans,"" a 1867 engraving. Andrew Johnson worked to undercut civil rights laws after the Civil War. (New York Public Library/Wikimedia Commons) After the Civil War, arguably the most racist president, historians say, was Andrew Johnson. A Southerner who succeeded the assassinated Abraham Lincoln, Johnson proceeded to undercut anti-discrimination policies in the South and was a pioneer in articulating ""white victimhood,"" Opal said. ""His racism is most tragic in American history, because it led to a true failure of Reconstruction,"" Finkelman said. Theodore Roosevelt held racist views reflected in his policies of imperialism. Roosevelt ""embraced his racism, believing it the solemn duty of the most civilized — white — race to uplift the rest,"" said Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.  At the same time, Roosevelt was sympathetic to immigrants and had lunch with the Black leader Booker T. Washington, an invitation that shocked Southern white leaders, Finkelman said. Woodrow Wilson, a Southerner by upbringing, re-segregated large portions of the federal government, down to separate bathrooms in federal buildings. Wilson also held a White House screening of the pro-Ku Klux Klan film ""Birth of a Nation,"" which dovetailed with his nostalgia for the Confederacy. Wilson once wrote that ""domestic slaves were almost uniformly dealt with indulgently and even affectionately by their masters."" Oswald Garrison Villard, a contemporary liberal journalist, wrote that Wilson’s administration ""has allied itself with the forces of reaction, and put itself on the side of every torturer, of every oppressor, of every perpetrator of racial injustice in the South or the North."" As open racism became less socially acceptable from politicians in the latter half of the 20th century, presidents’ legacies on race became more complicated. Presidents held racist views privately yet delivered legislation to advance equality at the same time.  Lyndon B. Johnson used a racial slur for Black people frequently, according to his biographers, including when Johnson nominated Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court instead of a less-famous black judge. Johnson was a ""good ol’ boy from Texas, so of course he was racist. He just didn’t govern like one, which frankly strikes me as more important,"" Engel said. Johnson fought for and signed the century’s most far-reaching civil rights laws.  Richard Nixon was captured on tape making numerous racist remarks, said John J. Pitney, Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. Yet Nixon’s legacy on civil rights was fairly robust, advancing the desegregation of schools and affirmative action in employment. So what about Trump? Trump challenged Biden’s remark that he was racist and compared his record with Abraham Lincoln, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation that freed enslaved Black people in Confederate states. Symone Sanders, a Biden campaign senior adviser, sought to clarify Biden’s remark: ""There have been a number of racist American presidents, but Trump stands out — especially in modern history — because he made running on racism and division his calling card and won."" As a businessman and politician over the years, Trump has made various statements that have been condemned as racist. • In the 1970s, the U.S. Justice Department sued Trump and his father for refusing to rent apartments to Black people. Trump Management filed a countersuit against the U.S. government before reaching an agreement in 1975. (The Trumps said the agreement was not an admission of guilt.)   • After the first Black president in U.S. history was sworn into office, Trump repeated the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born in Kenya.  • When Trump announced his presidential candidacy in June 2015, he said, ""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best."" He added, ""They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""  • As president in 2017, Trump said there were ""very fine people, on both sides,"" in reference to neo-Nazis and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va. • When speaking with lawmakers about immigration from Haiti, El Salvador and African countries in 2018, Trump reportedly said, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" He denied saying it in a tweet. • In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four congresswomen of color should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" All of them are American citizens, and three were born in the U.S. • Later that month, the president called Maryland’s 7th congressional district, which is majority Black, a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess"" and wrote that ""no human being would want to live there.""  • Trump has referred to the novel coronavirus as the ""kung flu"" and ""China virus"" throughout the pandemic. In 2019, the Pew Research Center found that 56% of Americans say Trump has worsened race relations, compared with only 15% who say he’s made progress. Biden said that no presidents who came before Trump were racist. Historians agree that various presidents can be considered racist. That includes those who enslaved Black people, those who used racist rhetoric and those who held beliefs that white people were superior to other races. Biden’s campaign later clarified the comment, but his original words are wrong.  We rate Biden’s history False.",/factchecks/2020/jul/27/joe-biden/long-history-racism-us-presidency/

The thread pointed to an announcement by Clay Marsh, the vice president and executive dean of West Virginia University Health Sciences, that the state was ranked No. 1 nationally in the rate of transmission. ""Today Dr. Clay Marsh announced that WV has the highest RT rate of any other state in the U.S.,"" the thread says.

It does, though the tweet lacks important context about the spread of the virus in the state and the country as a whole.   The West Virginia Democratic Party did not respond to inquiries for this article, but we did reach Marsh to discuss the relationship between the rate of transmission and the growth in coronavirus cases. He said scientists use two related but distinct measurements to study the spread infections such as COVID-19. One is R0, pronounced ""R-naught,"" and the other is known as Rt, or the effective reproduction number. Both measure how many people, on average, one infected person will infect. But they measure slightly different things. R0 captures how fundamentally infectious a germ is when it’s introduced into a new population. By contrast, Rt measures how much the infection is spreading at a particular moment in time, taking into account factors such as the percentage of people who have already become infected and the preventive measures being taken against the infection. ""With both of these scores, any rate that is more than 1 suggests that the disease is spreading, and any rate below 1 suggests that it is reducing,"" Marsh told PolitiFact.  On July 10, the day the Democratic Party’s tweet was posted, Marsh told WVMetroNews that the state’s Rt had increased from the nation’s second lowest rate two and a half months earlier to second-worst in the country. By that afternoon, CNN had posted an article citing Marsh and reporting that West Virginia had climbed to No. 1 nationally in Rt. Marsh told PolitiFact that Rt is valuable for showing which direction the state’s level of infections could be heading in the following weeks. But other metrics are important as well, he said. Marsh said he pays attention to the positivity rate -- the percentage of newly tested people whose results come back positive for the virus. The countries and states that have been most successful have kept this measurement below 3%, and West Virginia has toggled between 3% and 5% recently. (West Virginia is also one of only 11 states that are performing an adequate number of tests to control the spread, according to a New York Times analysis.) Marsh said he also looks at the total change in the number of cases, using a 7-day or 14-day rolling average, and how close in-state hospitals are to their capacity for the number of ICU beds and ventilators In other words, Rt gives researchers an idea about how fast the disease is spreading, but it’s not the only key to understanding the virus. Andy Shi and Xihong Lin from the Harvard Chan School of Public Health agree with Marsh’s assessment in an email interview with PolitiFact. ""Ultimately, what we are doing is we are trying to take a look at, ‘how do we measure today versus how did we measure a week ago, or two weeks ago, or a month ago,’ because that gives us a better idea about how our risk is changing,"" Marsh said.  The West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted, ""Under the leadership of @WVGovernor Justice, West Virginia now has the highest rate of COVID-19 spread from person to person than any other state."" On the day the tweet was posted, West Virginia did have one of the highest rates of transmission of any state. However, using this metric communicates only one part of the picture of how hard West Virginia is getting hit by the coronavirus.  Among other measurements, the absolute number of coronavirus cases ranks far below the level seen in current hot-spot states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas. And the state’s positivity rate for test results is close to the low level that experts like to see.

No, the Trump administration hasn’t fulfilled every state request for coronavirus supplies
","Fox News host Sean Hannity touted President Donald Trump’s coronavirus response, praising him for ""huge decisions that save lives"" and claiming, without evidence, that ""this administration has fulfilled every request from every state governor."" ""There have been zero unfulfilled equipment and supply requests from state governors,"" Hannity said July 21.  Trump made a similar comment at a press briefing hours earlier, saying the nation’s governors get ""everything they need"" and his administration has ""zero unfilled requests."" But Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, the chair of the National Governors Association, has disputed such claims, saying during a press conference the next day that ""it’s obviously not the case"" that governors have everything they need. ""We had a call today with, I believe, 48 governors from across America,"" Hogan, a Republican, told reporters. ""There are still things that we really need."" Hogan cited ""testing shortages"" as one area of concern. ""Not having supplies and running out of capacity across the country, it’s looking like it was back in March and April,"" he said, echoing the criticisms he made about the federal response in an op-ed headlined, ""Fighting alone.""  We’re not privy to private communications between governors and the White House. But we tried contacting all 50 states. Representatives from several told us they made requests for tests, personal protective equipment or other supplies that have yet to be filled — or were never filled. Hannity’s claim that the administration has met ""every request"" overstates the administration’s supply of testing and equipment to states in what, from the beginning of the crisis, has been an absence of a coordinated national strategy. ""We’re not a shipping clerk,"" Trump said in March. The White House and Fox News did not respond to our requests for comment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, Health and Human Services Department and private sector delivered about 190 million N-95 respirators, 785 million masks, 33 million face shields, 342 million gowns and over 20 billion gloves as of July 17, a FEMA spokesperson said. FEMA is still working with the governors. But amid soaring U.S. cases, news reports say some places are again experiencing long lines for tests, slow turnarounds for test results and shortages of personal protective gear. NBC News reported that internal documents show a dwindling federal stockpile of equipment.   Vehicles line up at a coronavirus testing site in Omaha, Neb., on July 23, 2020. (AP) ""There has been some progress on PPE and other equipment, as well as testing, but not all states have everything they need,"" said James Nash, press secretary for the National Governors Association. The governors spelled out priorities for the federal government in an April letter to Congress, calling for increased access to test kits and equipment and funding for contact tracing, social services, and small business loans, among other things. Some requests have been completely or partially fulfilled, Nash said. Others, including a request for congressional funding to stabilize state budgets and a request for the administration to delay changes to hospital reporting requirements, remain outstanding.  The Trump administration maintains that it is getting supplies where they’re needed. Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, the point person for coronavirus-related supplies, told the Washington Post in early July that he didn’t ""have the sense of there being severe shortages."" ""I’m not going to tell you we’re able to meet all demand, but there’s significantly less unfulfilled orders today than in April,"" Polowczyk said. About a dozen state officials responded to our queries about the federal government’s handling of requests. Taken together, their responses painted the picture of an administration that hasn’t been as attentive to some states as Hannity described.  Three states led by Democratic governors — Oregon, North Carolina and Washington — were particularly critical of the administration’s response, especially on testing.  ""Woefully insufficient support from the federal government in terms of testing supplies has hampered our ability to expand Oregon’s testing capacity,"" said Charles Boyle, a spokesperson for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown. When Oregon asked for more testing supplies, the federal government sent a list of vendors and ""suggested we call them on our own,"" said Robb Cowie, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority.  Oregon is also waiting on 500,000 masks, 330,000 gowns and 300,000 gloves, Cowie said. North Carolina has similarly sought to increase testing. State officials asked in mid July for more federal testing sites to be set up in addition to the 13 in operation, said Kelly Haight Connor, a spokesperson for the state department of health and human services. The state provided a list of nearly 60 zip codes where more testing is needed, but only one new site was added by July 22, Connor said. North Carolina had also received 57% of the swabs and 50% of the preservation substance for transporting specimens that it requested for July. ""There are currently nationwide barriers to further scaling widespread testing,"" Connor said. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee requested in a June letter that the administration use the Defense Production Act to produce more personal protective equipment.  Inslee spokesperson Mike Faulk called claims that governors have all they need ""misleading"" and cited data showing the federal government has provided just a fraction of the masks, respirators, gowns, gloves and ventilators that Washington has requested since late April.  ""We are hearing from businesses and workers across Washington that they’re struggling to access PPE on the private market, are subject to price gouging, and being forced to use extreme conservation measures to stretch limited supplies over longer periods of time,"" Faulk said. A handful of states are awaiting shipments or have orders under review. Maryland is waiting on a shipment date for a May order of 500,000 N-95 masks and 100 oxygen assemblies, said Charles Gischlar, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Health. A spokesperson for the North Dakota Department of Health listed requests for masks, gloves, gowns, boot covers and other equipment that haven’t been completely filled. Idaho also has requests that are under review, but a spokesperson for the state’s emergency management agency praised FEMA for fulfilling all other requests for personal protective gear. Some state representatives cited early problems but said the government has been responsive of late. Michael Pearlman, a spokesperson for Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, said the state didn’t receive as many rapid response tests early in the crisis as it had requested, but he added: ""I wouldn't say that Wyoming had specific requests that were not met."" The Pennsylvania Department of Health said the state has received most of what it has needed, but not everything it has requested. Spokesperson Nate Wardle said the state asked for about 1,000 ventilators early on, for example, but that it did not receive any.  ""We were told that we would receive them if there ended up being a need, which there has not been,"" Wardle said. In April, Wardle and representatives from more than 30 other states told us they were not aware of any COVID-19 patients needing a ventilator and not getting one. Representatives from other states — including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, and Ohio — said they have no outstanding requests. ""This administration has made things happen when we've asked,"" said Patrick Ptak, a spokesperson for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican. ABC News and CNN also queried all 50 states for their own fact-checks of Trump’s claims about the governors’ coronavirus needs. Both outlets heard from different states but found Trump’s claims to be inaccurate. Hannity said, ""This administration has fulfilled every request from every state governor."" That’s an exaggeration of the administration’s efforts to help states navigate the pandemic.  While some states said they have no requests outstanding, representatives from several others told us that they have requests they are waiting on or requests that were never filled.  Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland and chair of the National Governors Association, said ""it’s obviously not the case"" that governors have everything they need.

No, Tom Brady didn’t threaten to quit if teammates kneeled during anthem
","In his more than 20 years in the NFL, Tom Brady has usually avoided making public comments on political or hot-button topics. That’s why recent social media posts claiming that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback said he would quit if his teammates kneeled during the national anthem looked especially suspicious.  And sure enough, the quote is fake. It originated on a satirical website. That didn’t stop people from sharing it in posts without any disclaimers to indicate it was fabricated. One Twitter user posted the satire story’s headline, ""Tom Brady: ‘If Anyone on My Team Kneels, I Quit,’"" and then wrote, ""Do you agree with him?"" The phony quote originated on the America’s Last Line of Defense website, which contains a disclaimer that says everything posted on it is fiction. The site is run by a man named Christopher Blair, who has been publishing fabricated stories for years and says his goal is to trick conservatives into sharing false claims on social media. RELATED: If you're fooled by fake news, this man probably wrote it Brady, a six-time Super Bowl winner, typically refrains from making public comments on non-football topics, but he told Oprah Winfrey in a June 2018 interview that he respects players who choose to kneel in protest during the national anthem before football games.  ""I think there were a lot of really good, healthy conversations coming out of it in our locker room,"" Brady said in the interview. ""I respect why people are doing what they’re doing, and they’re doing it for different reasons, and that’s OK. You can do things for your reasons, they can do things for their reasons, and you have respect for that. But I thought it was great."" Posts claim that Brady said he would quit football if his teammates kneeled during the national anthem. He never said that. The quote came from a satirical website and was erroneously copied and shared in posts as if it were legitimate.
