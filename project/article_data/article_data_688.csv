Contrary to Tina Freitas, Emmett Hanger didn't vote for three largest Virginia tax plans
","Emmett Hanger, co-chairman of the budget-writing Senate Finance Committee, is under fire in a Republican primary this spring for supporting tax increases. The criticism is coming from challenger Tina Freitas, a GOP activist in the 24th Senate District, stretching from Staunton to Culpeper. Hanger has been the district's state senator since 1996 and served in the House of Delegates from 1983 to 1992. Freitas is opposing Hanger from the right on social and financial issues. ""I believe in your right to make to make (your) life everything it can possibly be through your hard work and ingenuity through the free market and voluntary cooperation,"" she said during an April 8 interview on Virginia Free Radio. ""On the other hand, you have my opponent who has voted for the three largest tax increases - proposed tax increases - in Virginia history,"" she added. We fact checked whether Hanger has, indeed, backed the three biggest proposed tax hikes in state history. Freitas’ list Freitas - the wife of Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper - sent us a list of the votes at the heart of her claim. They are: 1: A failed $1 billion annual tax increase proposed in 2006 by Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine to improve transportation. It would have raised levies on gas and motor vehicle sales. Hanger voted for the bill, telling us he thought it was fair and would help his rural constituents. The bill easily passed the Senate with bipartisan support, but died in a House committee. 2: A transportation tax package passed in 2013 that reaped $1.25 billion last year when it was fully phased in. The plan was proposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, and passed with bipartisan support. Its key elements were raising state levies on gas and general sales, and creating authorities in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads that have imposed regional taxes for roads. Hanger opposed the bill each of three times it faced an up-or-down Senate vote, telling us he thought the plan was ""convoluted,"" and not of ample help to rural areas. Freitas, in claiming Hanger supported the tax hikes, cites a procedural vote. The House and the Senate passed different versions of the bill and Hanger voted to allow the chambers to work out a compromise - a traditional courtesy in the General Assembly. When the compromise was reached, Hanger voted against it. 3:  A successful $700 million tax increase in 2004 proposed by Democratic Gov. Mark Warner to help education and other general services. The key component was a half-penny sales tax hike. Hanger voted for the package, which had bipartisan support. Half-century list Freitas’ stated that Hanger voted for the three largest ""proposed tax increases in Virginia history."" But the list she sent us doesn’t meet that criteria. We can’t go back to Virginia’s first legislature in 1619 and review every tax increase that’s been proposed, but we’re confident $100 million-plus packages are fairly modern developments. We reviewed major tax-increase proposals since the 1960s and adjusted them for inflation in 2019 dollars. Here’s list of the three highest proposals and Hanger’s role in them: 1: A failed $2.3 billion tax increase for education and transportation was proposed in 2004 by Sen. John Chichester, R-Stafford, who was chairman of the Finance Committee. The package would have significantly raised taxes on sales, income and fuel, among other things. Adjusted for inflation, the plan would have raised about $3.2 billion this year. The bill gave cover to Warner’s effort that year (discussed above) to win a more modest $700 million hike for education. Hanger voted for Chichester’s more expensive plan, telling us that the state had needs in transportation and education, and it was a good idea to raise taxes for both at the same time. The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support and was killed in a House committee. 2: Landmark legislation in 1966 by Democratic Gov. Mills Godwin that established the state sales tax - phased in at 3% over three years with an additional 1% option for localities. The tax, earmarked for public education and to help build the community college system, brought in $282 million for the budget year ending June 30, 1970, according to a report from the Department of Taxation. That’s equal to $1.9 billion this year. Hanger wasn’t in the legislature in 1966 and had no vote on the bill.  3: McDonnell’s 2013 tax increase for transportation, worth $1.25 billion this year. Hanger, as we noted, voted against the measure. All told, we checked Hanger’s record on six major tax increase proposals over the last half century. He voted for three of the bills, opposed two, and wasn’t in office when one was was considered. Hanger stands by all his votes. ""Fiscal responsibility requires paying your bills,"" he said. Our ruling Freitas says Hanger ""has voted for the three largest tax increases - proposed tax increases - in Virginia history."" Her list of the largest proposals is flawed and, in one instance, misrepresents Hanger’s up-or-down votes. Hanger’s record on taxes is nuanced; sometimes backing increases, sometimes opposing them. Of the three largest tax-hike proposals since 1966, Hanger voted for one, against one, and wasn’t in office when one was considered. So we rate Freitas’ claim Mostly False.  ","[('Tina Freitas, Interview on Virginia Free Radio (23:53 mark), April 8, 2019.', 'https://soundcloud.com/user-189305901-366707613/republican-tina-freitas-challenging-incumbent-sen-emmett-hanger'), ('Email from Freitas, April 25, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Legislative Information System, SB708, 2006 session; HB 2313, 2013 session; HB5018, 2004 session; SB635, 2004 session.', 'https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=061&typ=bil&val=sb708'), ('Interview with Sen.

Is the unemployment rate in Columbia among the lowest in the U.S.?
","Missouri Rep. Cheri Toalson Reisch has been working since 2017 to pass a bill that would prevent the state from prohibiting felons and other convicted criminals from working for businesses that sell alcohol and lottery tickets. During a discussion of the bill on April 1, Reisch brought up the job market in her district, pointing to low unemployment. ""We have an unemployment [rate of] 1.5 in Boone County, and we can’t find enough workers,"" Reisch said. ""This [bill] will allow employers to hire felons if they want to."" We decided to see if these unemployment figures hold up. When asked where she got her data, Reisch explained that she was referring to a figure that measured the unemployment rate in the Columbia, MO Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Boone County, during October 2017, citing a Columbia Tribune article. Reisch’s claims do match the preliminary statistics found in a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics news report released in November 2017, but more recent data shows that the unemployment rate has not stayed the same. The unemployment rate measures the number of unemployed people, which refers to those who were not employed during the time of measurement, were currently available for work and were actively looking for a job, as a percent of the civilian labor force. The Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that the average monthly unemployment rate in Columbia was 2.6 percent in February 2019. Unemployment rate varies seasonally, meaning that rates in October usually are lower than rates in February. In 2018, the average yearly unemployment rate was 2.4 percent.  Since 2010, unemployment rates in Columbia have been falling. For comparison, the unemployment rate in Columbia was 2.6 percent in February 2018 and 3.2 percent in February 2017. This difference between Reisch’s 1.5 percent and the 2018 annual estimate of 2.4 percent is the difference between ""a very tight labor market and a very, very tight labor market,"" Michigan State University economics professor Steve Woodbury said in an email. Is this difference statistically significant? The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not release confidence intervals for metropolitan statistical area unemployment rates, but we do know that these estimates are subject to sampling and other errors. Compared to other cities and towns in the U.S., Columbia does have a low unemployment rate.  When Reisch has repeated her claim on unemployment in the past, she has included this in her talking points. ""This [the 1.5 percent figure] is the second-lowest [unemployment rate] in the country,"" Reisch said on March 28. ""We cannot find enough employees.  We would like to put these felons to work. We need them to avoid recidivism and make a better live for themselves and their families."" Reisch said she based this claim on the same Bureau of Labor Statistics Data from October 2017. As of February 2019, Columbia is actually tied for the spot of 10th-lowest unemployment rate. There are several possible explanations for the low unemployment rate in Reisch’s district. Bernie Andrews, Executive Director of Regional Economic Development Inc., a Columbia and Boone County economic development organization, notes that Columbia has a diverse business economy based on stable industries such as education, health care and insurance. In addition, Columbia and Boone County both have high rates of education. The unemployment rate for people with a college education is lower than that of the average civilian population. According to Census data, 54.3 percent of people 25 or older in Columbia have a bachelor’s degree or higher. For Boone County, that figure is 45.9 percent. In comparison, the national average is 30.9 percent. Reisch said, ""We have an unemployment [rate of] 1.5 in Boone County, and we can’t find enough workers."" Reisch’s figures do not reflect the most recent data, but her point that her district has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation still stands. We rate this statement Half True.","[('Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Unemployment Rate in Columbia, MO (MSA), accessed on April 24, 2019', 'https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLMURN#0'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Metropolitan Area Employment and Unemployment — October 2017, Nov. 30, 2017', 'No link'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Unemployment Rates for Metropolitan Areas, Not Seasonally Adjusted, accessed April 24, 2019', 'https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/metro_11302017.htm'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, accessed April 24, 2019', 'No link'), ('U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Unemployment rate 2.1 percent for college grads, 4.3 percent for high school grads in April 2018, May 10, 2018', 'https://www.bls.gov/web/metro/laummtrk.htm'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, 2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, accessed on April 24, 2019', 'No link'), ('Interview with Bernie Andrews, Regional Economic Development Inc. executive director, April 24, 2019', 'https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU04000000?periods=Annual+Data&periods_option=specific_periods&years_option=all_years'), ('Email exchange with Rep.

Was Donald Trump the target of a coup? No
","With the bulk of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report now public, President Donald Trump has seized on its origins as evidence of his own victimhood. On several occasions, Trump used the word ""coup"" to describe efforts by law enforcement to investigate influence by Russia on the 2016 election. For example, he said this in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News on April 25, 2019: ""This was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government. ... I think it's far bigger than Watergate. I think it's possibly the biggest scandal in political history in this country. Maybe beyond political. … This was a coup. This wasn't stealing information from an office in the Watergate apartments. This was an attempted coup."" We wondered whether Trump is justified in saying that he had been targeted in a coup -- the shorthand for ""coup d’etat,"" a French term that means overthrow of the government. Experts told us that Trump’s use of the term is wrong, both practically and legally. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but the Washington Post’s Philip Bump described the origins of the talking point as being part of ""a classic Fox News feedback loop."" Trump appears to believe that enemies within law enforcement concocted reasons to go after him over his campaign’s Russia contacts. Names that come up often in this alleged plot include Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two officials involved in the FBI investigation of then-candidate Trump. The two were involved romantically, and they shared text messages that Trump has said were biased against him. (Trump regularly attacks Strzok and Page on Twitter; in the interview with Hannity, he called them ""two sick lovers."") For those outside the Fox News orbit, the connections ""might make no sense,"" Bump writes. ""But for a Hannity viewer, and for Trump and Hannity in particular, it all makes perfect sense. It's a summary of a case about bias and personal flaws and unfairness that Fox News and Hannity have been making for a year."" The evolution of this ""feedback loop"" can be seen in Trump’s tweets. In the weeks leading up to the Hannity appearance in which Trump referred to a coup, he retweeted or quoted in tweets several allies using the term. The first was pro-Trump commentator Dan Bongino, who said on Fox & Friends on Feb. 18 that ""this was an illegal coup attempt on the President of the United States."" Trump also tweeted or retweeted Tom Fitton of the conservative group Judicial Watch and Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network using the word ""coup"" before he appeared on Hannity. According to the Mueller report, the triggering event for the FBI opening a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government came as a result of an April 2016 meeting between campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and a source who said Russian government officials could offer ""dirt"" on Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails."" Mueller’s report corroborates previous reporting about the sequence of events that set the probe in motion. Papadopoulos told a high-ranking Australian diplomat at an upscale London bar in May 2016 that Moscow had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. In late July 2016 — days after WikiLeaks’ dumped thousands of internal Democratic National Committee documents that proved damaging to Clinton — U.S. law enforcement became aware of Papadopoulos’ claim. ""Within a week of the (WikiLeaks) release, a foreign government informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign,"" said Mueller’s report (p. 6, volume 1). ""On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign."" This investigation became Mueller’s special counsel investigation after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- standing in for then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from Russia matters -- tapped Mueller to run the independent investigation. It’s worth noting that Mueller found no conspiracy with Russia; if Mueller had been part of a coup, he could have thrown Justice Department guidelines to the wind and indicted Trump. The significant point in this recap is that the investigation was undertaken by law enforcement, and that it adhered to the relevant laws. By contrast, the defining element of a coup is that it is carried out beyond the bounds of legality. ""We define a coup d'état as the sudden and irregular (i.e., illegal or extra-legal) removal, or displacement, of the executive authority of an independent government,"" wrote the Coup D’etat Project at the University of Illinois’ Cline Center for Democracy in 2013. Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor, told PolitiFact that the Russia investigation ""is not a coup, because the FBI had very good reasons for commencing an investigation of Trump. It beggars belief that anyone in the FBI had the intention of subverting a duly elected president."" Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, agreed. ""By using the term ‘coup,’ the president is suggesting that Mueller, and by extension his own Justice Department, are acting outside the law,"" Arend said. Yet Mueller ""was appointed and supervised by Rod Rosenstein, the president's chosen deputy attorney general."" Of the 12 types of coups recognized by the Cline Center, nine do not seem to have anything to do with what Trump is talking about, including military coups, rebel coups, popular revolts, dissident actions, palace coups, foreign coups, internationally mediated transitions, forced resignations, and self-coups, in which the leader strong-arms other branches of government to entrench power. Two other types cited by the center are defined by how far they got -- attempted coups (which try and fail) and coup conspiracies (which never get to the stage of being carried out). Any supposed coup against Trump would have been a coup attempt, since he’s still in office. But that doesn’t mean there actually was a coup attempt. ""Inasmuch as the Russia investigation began before Trump was elected, and at a time when it was universally assumed that Hillary Clinton would be elected, it cannot have been an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government,"" said Richard Bulliet, a Columbia University historian. ""It was an attempt by duly established arms of the state to prevent seizure of the government by a witting or unwitting Russian agent."" The lead author of the Cline Center report, University of Illinois political scientist Peter F. Nardulli, agreed that Trump’s definition wouldn’t fit. ""The vast proportion of extralegal overthrows of the government involve violence,"" Nardulli said. ""What happened with Trump was simply the unfolding of a normal governmental procedure in accord with the rule of law. It was a totally different genre from a coup."" Of the Cline Center’s categories, Trump would presumably be referring to a ""counter coup,"" which is defined as involving ""the elimination of a usurper by members of the prior regime within a month of the initial coup."" But in Trump’s case, he didn’t take office through a coup (he was duly elected by the Electoral College) and the supposed counter-coup actually began before he actually won the presidency. So calling it a counter coup is problematic, too. ""I cannot see in any way shape or form how this would be a coup in any reasonable sense of the word,"" said Richard Nephew, adjunct professor and senior research scholar at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. ""We have a long, historical legacy of holding to account our senior officials and representatives for their conduct."" Trump said the Russia investigation ""was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government."" The Russia investigation stemmed from a by-the-rules law enforcement inquiry. That’s far different than a coup, for which the defining characteristic is that it occurs outside the legal system. It’s also worth noting that the original investigation began before Trump had even been sworn in, meaning he wasn’t even eligible to be deposed by a coup.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump repeats, falsely, that doctors, mothers decide to execute live babies after birth
","President Donald Trump often weaves his opposition to late-term abortion into his speeches at rallies around the country. His April 27 event in Green Bay, Wis., followed his pattern of twisting the actual practice and circumstances of a rare event. Trump said he was shocked that Wisconsin’s Democratic governor said he would veto a bill that would punish doctors who don’t try to preserve the life of an infant born alive after an attempted abortion. ""The baby is born,"" Trump said. ""The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby."" This is a distortion. Cases of late-term abortions, which are uncommon, involve either a pregnancy that poses an immediate threat to the life of the mother, or infants with abnormalities so severe that they are unlikely to live more than a few days. In the even rarer situations when the baby emerges alive, parents would decide whether to ask their doctors to make any and all efforts to keep breathing. Medical researchers describe this as a decision whether to resuscitate the baby. Trump cast this as a decision whether to execute it. By practice and law, living infants receive care. ""This is a clear-cut concept that we can all agree upon,"" Gretchen Ely, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo’s School of Social Work and a board member for Social Workers for Reproductive Justice told us in February. ""The notion that anyone supports executing infants after birth is preposterous."" Among other federal and state statutes that already establish the duty to provide care, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002 established that federal legal protections that applied to ""persons"" also covered children born at any stage of development, including after an abortion. Trump has been referring to execution — a word that refers to a legal death penalty — since his State of the Union address in early February. He said it again a few days later in El Paso, Texas. And in March in Grand Rapids, Mich., he attacked Democrats for ""allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth."" The typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Data on abortions that take place at the very end of that period are limited. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only reports late abortions after 21 weeks. Those represented 1.4% of all abortions. In Wisconsin, state health officials found that in 2017, 1% — a total of 53 —  abortions took place after the 20th week. But Trump was talking about situations much later than that. Less than 1% of abortions occur in the third trimester, or after 28 weeks, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Many of those abortions, the college wrote, involve problems that are ""incompatible with life,"" such as a baby without a brain or organs that form outside the body.   ""In these cases, where death is likely before or shortly after birth, patients may decide whether to continue the pregnancy and deliver a nonviable fetus or have an abortion,"" the college wrote. Typically, in the face of an infant with severe abnormalities, parents and doctors end up deciding whether to resuscitate the dying baby. This ""is a much more contentious issue,"" said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. ""Babies born post-abortion, spontaneous or induced, with horrible and potentially painful conditions incompatible with life, would not be routinely resuscitated or aggressively treated by most medical teams. In fact some would not even know how to try, or lack the technology to do so, especially in rural areas."" Caplan said he is unaware of examples of ""medically active killing,"" and that while ""allowing to die does happen,"" it occurs ""very rarely — say, a baby born with no lungs at 20 weeks."" Both sides agree that the active killing of a breathing newborn is — and should be — illegal. ""There is a broad consensus that a child that takes its first breath has crossed a bright line from fetus to child and should be protected by the law,"" said Teresa S. Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas and director of the university’s Prolife Center. These types of cases have been prosecuted: In 2013, Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was sentenced to three life terms for killing a series of late-term newborns in gruesome fashion. Trump’s speech in Green Bay drew on the words of another governor, Virginia’s Ralph Northam. Northam, a pediatric neurologist said in a January radio interview that when fetuses are nonviable, doctors deliver the baby, keep it comfortable, resuscitate it if the mother wishes, and then have a ""discussion"" with the mother. Trump said, with a late-term abortion, ""the mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby."" Trump grossly oversimplified of one of the hardest choices parents face.

No, Mitch McConnell was not cured of polio as a child because of government-funded care
","Did the United States government fund Mitch McConnell's care and rehabilitation after he was diagnosed with polio as a young child? The short answer is no.

His treatment was not paid for by the government, but through charitable donations. McConnell was diagnosed with polio in 1944 at the age of 2, nearly 10 years before the polio vaccine was developed. In his memoir, McConnell wrote that he received care in Warm Springs, Ga., at the polio treatment center founded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had suffered from the disease. David Oshinsky, historian and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""Polio: An American Story,"" told PolitiFact in an email that no government money was involved in the Warm Springs, Ga., treatment center. It was ""all voluntary private contributions."" The rumor surfaced on social media in June 2017 as Senate Republicans, led by McConnell, took steps to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The Occupy Democrats Facebook page posted the meme with an accompanying article that reported government-sponsored public funds saved McConnell’s life, several outlets reported at the time. That story, which appeared on the Occupy Democrats website, has since been deleted. We tracked down a snapshot of the article using the web archive tool Wayback Machine. Another story with similar reporting surfaced the same day on the online magazine Death and Taxes. Both falsely claim that McConnell’s care and rehabilitation was paid for by the public and, thus, was government-funded. But no federal dollars helped cure McConnell of the disease; it was a privately-funded facility. In 1937, Roosevelt re-established the Warm Springs Foundation as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and, in 1938, the foundation launched the first March of Dimes fundraiser. Comedian and radio personality Eddie Cantor coined the phrase and helped promote the nationwide March of Dimes campaign that was to line up with the president’s annual birthday ball on Jan. 30. Cantor and other organizers solicited donations on the radio the month leading up the ball, and by Jan. 29, 1938, the eve of the president’s birthday, ""over 80,000 letters with dimes and dollars flooded the White House mailroom."" The mailroom was ""literally buried in an avalanche of donations, a total of 2,680,000 dimes or $268,000,"" according to the March of Dimes website. Funds also went to research grants to find a cure for the disease. That materialized in the mid 1950s, when Jonas Salk successfully developed the polio vaccine. While Roosevelt’s political office promoted the fundraising for polio care and research, and the president used his name and popularity to help raise funds, the money came from the charity of the American people, as well as celebrities and corporations. The care McConnell received as a toddler was not taxpayer or government-funded, as the viral meme suggests. The facility operated as a nationwide nonprofit organization. We rate this meme False.","[('Facebook post, April 22, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=302358340689960&set=a.123618131897316&type=3&theater'), ('Washington Post, No, the government did not pay for Mitch McConnell’s polio care.

Does half the U.S. population have diabetes or prediabetes, as Tim Ryan claimed?
","If elected president, Democratic congressman Tim Ryan says he’d focus on a health care system that not only covers people when they are sick, but also keeps them healthy. Most of the health care costs are for chronic diseases that can be prevented, Ryan claimed in New Hampshire. ""Half the country today has either diabetes or prediabetes,"" Ryan, a U.S. representative from Ohio, said at an April 11 WMUR town hall in Manchester. ""A diabetic costs 2.3 times as much as every other patient. That is going to sink the health care system."" Research from the American Diabetes Association says that on average, people diagnosed with diabetes had medical costs about 2.3 times higher than people without diabetes and no other chronic disease. We wanted to focus on Ryan’s first claim: Does half of the U.S. population really have diabetes or prediabetes? Ryan’s claim is close to true for adults, but there is limited data for children. The American Diabetes Association told us it would be more accurate to say that nearly half of all adults in the United States have either diabetes or prediabetes. Ryan’s campaign directed us to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report, the latest national report available. It highlights estimates of people with diabetes and prediabetes in 2015, when the total U.S. population was about 321 million people. CDC said that most estimates of diabetes in the report did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes; but the data was likely to be more characteristic of type 2, since type 2 accounts for 90% to 95% of all diabetes cases. Prediabetes occurs when the blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The report says about 30.3 million people of all ages, or 9.4% of the population, had diabetes in 2015. The measure of people with prediabetes is a bit different: only measuring people 18 years old and older. The CDC said about 84.1 million people who are 18 years or older had prediabetes. That was almost 34 percent of the U.S. adult population in 2015. Those percentages amount to about 43 percent of the U.S. population in 2015, not including those under 18 with prediabetes, said Ryan’s campaign spokeswoman Julia Krieger. ""Congressman Ryan typically says ‘about’ half of the population when referencing this stat, particularly since there is less documentation/reliable numbers when it comes to cases of undiagnosed or childhood diabetes or prediabetes,"" Krieger said. CDC had specific data to estimate the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in adults. According to the CDC report, 12.2% of the adult population in 2015 had diabetes, diagnosed or undiagnosed. Adding that 12.2% to the percent of adults with prediabetes amounts to about 46% of the adult population with diabetes or prediabetes. The report did not have data on children with prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes. There isn’t much data for children, ""because diabetes has been traditionally a disease of older age,"" said Domenico Accili, a professor of medicine at Columbia University and director of the Columbia University Diabetes Research Center. Yet studies have found that the incidence of prediabetes in the pediatric population is considerably lower than in the adult population, Accili said. Youth screening for prediabetes is only recommended for those who are overweight or obese, said Stephen Benoit, a CDC medical officer. CDC’s findings are derived from national surveys, so there are limitations in applying estimates to the total 2015 population. The numbers could swing in either direction when using different assumptions. The CDC recommend that people with prediabetes eat healthy and be more active to prevent or delay diabetes. Ryan said, ""Half the country today has either diabetes or prediabetes."" There is a significant number of people with diabetes or prediabetes. Ryan’s claim might leave the impression that half the country — including children and adults — have either of these conditions. However, there is limited data on people under 18 years old with prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes. Ryan’s statement is more accurate if narrowed to the adult population — about 46% of adults have either diabetes or prediabetes. Overall, Ryan’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.","[(""WMUR.com, Watch 'Conversation with the Candidate' with Tim Ryan, updated April 11, 2019"", 'https://www.wmur.com/article/self-defense-classes-aim-to-teach-women-critical-moves-grow-self-confidence/27180960'), ('Email interview, Tim Ryan spokeswoman Julia Krieger, April 13, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, CDC press office, April 22-23, 2019', 'http://www.diabetes.org/assets/pdfs/basics/cdc-statistics-report-2017.pdf'), ('Email interview, American Diabetes Association press office, April 19, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Domenico Accili, a professor of medicine at Columbia University and director of the Columbia University Diabetes Research Center, April 18, 23, 2019', 'https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk'), ('Diabetes.org, National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017', 'No link'), ('Census Bureau, American FactFinder, 2015 population estimates', 'https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/library/socialmedia/diabetes-infographic.pdf'), ('CDC.gov, A Snapshot of Diabetes in the United States', 'No link'), ('American Diabetes Association, The Cost of Diabetes, Last Reviewed: April 24, 2018, Last Edited: January 30, 2019', 'http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy/news-events/cost-of-diabetes.html'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/apr/29/tim-ryan/does-half-population-have-diabetes-or-prediabetes-/

Congress hopeful's paycheck claim bounces
","Marie Newman, who says she wants a rematch with U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski, 3rd, in next year’s Democratic primary, said during a recent radio interview that the Southwest Side and Southwest suburban district needs a representative who understands how tough it is for voters to make ends meet. And to underscore the gravity of that financial pressure, Newman, who lost to Lipinski in 2018, cited an eye-popping statistic. ""We’re in a situation right now where 80% of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and that is not acceptable,"" she told WCPT, a talk radio station in Chicago. Democrats increasingly warn of a growing wealth gap between rich and poor. Still, 80% living paycheck to paycheck sounded shockingly high, so we decided to take a closer look. We asked Newman’s campaign where her number came from and a spokesman sent several news articles all linking back to an online survey conducted for the CareerBuilder employment website. A CareerBuilder press release describes the results of its survey, conducted among adults working full-time for private sector companies between 2016 and 2017 by the Harris Poll. The press release breaks down the numbers in a way Newman did not: 38% of employees said they sometimes live paycheck to paycheck, 17% said they usually do and 23% said they always do. But Kreg Steven Brown, an Urban Institute research associate who studies economic opportunity, said it was ""imprecise at best"" to include the nearly 40% of people who report only ""sometimes"" living paycheck to paycheck in the grand total. To be clear, that’s not on Newman alone. Both CareerBuilder and many of the articles that cite the survey also stressed that total over the specific breakdown. There are other problems with taking the 80% (78%, to be precise) total at face value. The CareerBuilder release, for instance, does not spell out the questions posed in its survey, leaving it unclear what participants were asked to consider when evaluating whether they were indeed ""living paycheck to paycheck."" Polling experts we spoke with said that sort of detail is critical to know when evaluating the quality of survey results. ""If you’re asking people to look at a percentage of any kind without providing a way for people to also get access to the underlying information about data collection, you’re really asking people to take something on faith,"" said Nora Cate Schaeffer, vice president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research. We contacted CareerBuilder asking for more information about their 2017 survey. A spokeswoman told us the site no longer keeps it. The 80% paycheck to paycheck claim seems even more questionable when laid up against the results of other public opinion surveys that have asked similar questions. Indeed, a 2014 poll from Harris, the same organization that conducted the later poll for CareerBuilder, found that 46% of unretired U.S. adults say they ""live paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford to put money in savings."" A recent Urban Institute report analyzed survey data from 2017 and found 32% of non-elderly U.S. adults had experienced some form of financial distress in the previous 12 months. A survey included in the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s 2017 report on financial well-being asked respondents whether they ""have difficulty making ends meet"" and found that 43% of U.S. adults said they had. And a survey conducted for a similar 2018 report from the Federal Reserve found that four in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected $400 expense, would not be able to cover it or would have to sell something or borrow in order to do so. That fact has been cited — with varying degrees of accuracy — in several other claims PolitiFact recently fact-checked. As described in the CareerBuilder release, its survey sampled a subset of U.S. adults who are not yet retired. Experts said that might help explain why the results seemed off from similar polls that queried a broader range of respondents. Newman said, ""we’re in a situation right now where 80% of the country is living paycheck to paycheck."" Her claim traces back to the results of a 2017 survey commissioned by a jobs site that provided scant details beyond the alarming topline numbers. The site also noted, however, that 38% of those respondents said they lived paycheck to paycheck ""sometimes"" rather than ""usually"" or ""always."" Surveys asking similar questions in recent years have yielded results about financial distress that may still seem troubling but were nowhere as severe as the numbers highlighted by CareerBuilder and echoed by Newman. Newman’s claim accurately reflects the single survey she is relying on, but it appears to be an outlier among similar polls. We rate Newman’s claim Half True.

Is the high cost of insulin keeping diabetics from taking their medicine?
","High prescription drug prices are fast becoming a leading political topic, with medications like insulin emerging as a poster child for the issue. Nearly doubling in price from 2012 to 2016, the diabetes medication has commanded bipartisan attention on Capitol Hill and even a shoutout in a recent Netflix comedy special. Voters say curbing such prices should be a top priority for lawmakers — and Democratic presidential candidates are paying attention. At an April 22 CNN town hall, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), among the field of Democrats vying for the 2020 nomination, responded to a health care question by spotlighting insulin’s spiraling price tag.  ""One out of 4 diabetes patients in our country cannot afford their insulin,"" she said. That would be a shockingly high number, researchers point out, and could become a talking point Democrats return to throughout the campaign season. The cost of insulin particularly resonates given diabetes’ incidence rates. According to the American Diabetes Association, about 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, which is less common than type 2, and cannot live without insulin. With that in mind, we decided to dig in to see if Harris’ statement checks out. Three different datasets back Harris’ claim When asked about this particular statement, Harris’ campaign first cited a peer-reviewed study published in December, which looked at people with diabetes being treated at the Yale Diabetes Center in New Haven, Conn. Of 199 participants, 51 people — just over 25% — reported they either reduced or stopped taking insulin because of the cost. The study is small and limited to one metropolitan area. But it likely paints a more-or-less accurate picture nationally, three health care academic researchers said. ""The characteristics of the people that were included look reasonably well-distributed across measures we’d be thinking about, like age, insurance type, race, ethnicity,"" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. ""They probably are pretty much on target."" The study also corresponds with other surveys, though they too have limitations. One, commissioned by the American Diabetes Association and made public last May, polled about 530 people online whose demographics corresponded to the national data of people with the illness. About 27% of respondents suggested the price of insulin had ""affected their past year purchase or use of insulin."" There is also an online opt-in survey administered by T1International, an advocacy group for people with diabetes. Its 2018 results and methodology are undergoing peer review and have not yet been published in full, said James Elliott, one of the organization’s trustees. He suggested it would likely ultimately support Harris’ ""1 out of 4"" talking point. There’s some extrapolation, but the point is 'more true than not' The caveat is that Harris’ comment is based on limited data, and only one of the papers has been peer-reviewed. Though insulin’s price has skyrocketed in recent years, no sizable national survey or study has tracked insulin affordability, said Dr. Jing Luo, an instructor at Harvard Medical School who was involved with the Yale study and has researched insulin pricing more generally. That perhaps limits any effort to make an argument about insulin access nationwide, or at the very least requires some extrapolation. That said, the 1-in-4 figure is ""more true than not,"" Luo said.  ""It’s as accurate as the data available allows,"" Luo said. ""It’s a reasonable estimate. Really, there’s no data to suggest otherwise."" We also asked about Harris’ specific word choice: ""cannot afford their insulin."" All the research examining this issue doesn’t ask that precise question, but rather, asks if the cost has resulted in a patient’s purchasing or using less medication. That, analysts said, is, in fact, a good proxy for whether people can’t afford insulin. And it may understate the problem, said Dr. Kasia Lipska, the endocrinologist who led the Yale study, since it doesn’t account for people who keep buying medication but skimp on groceries or other necessities as a result. Our ruling The lack of a national study is an issue, for sure, and to some extent limits the extent to which we can put stock in Harris’ 1-in-4 figure. It's also important to remember that it refers to a narrower group - only patients with Type 1 - rather than all people with diabetes. But experts broadly suggested that the findings in the three reports referenced — one peer-reviewed academic paper and two surveys — amply support her claim. And the broad meaning of the phrase ""cannot afford"" means the problem could be more significant than these datasets suggest, since they measure only people going without medication, not those for whom insulin prices maybe create other financial issues. This statement is accurate but needs some additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('Kamala Harris, comments on CNN, April 22, 2019', 'https://www.kff.org/slideshow/public-opinion-on-prescription-drugs-and-their-prices/'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Public Opinion on Prescription Drugs and Their Prices,"" March 1, 2019', 'No link'), ('Health Care Cost Institute, ""Spending on Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes and the Role of Rapidly Increasing Insulin Prices,"" Jan. 21, 2019', 'https://www.healthcostinstitute.org/research/publications/entry/spending-on-individuals-with-type-1-diabetes-and-the-role-of-rapidly-increasing-insulin-prices'), ('Kaiser Health News, ""The Blame Game: Everyone And No One Is Raising Insulin Prices,"" April 10, 2019', 'No link'), ('The Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj, ""Drug Pricing,"" Feb. 17, 2019', 'https://khn.org/news/the-blame-game-everyone-and-no-one-is-raising-insulin-prices/'), ('The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017""', 'No link'), ('JAMA Internal Medicine, ""Cost-Related Insulin Underuse Among Patients With Diabetes,"" January 2019', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7LgT4_jkLA'), ('American Diabetes Association, ""Insulin Affordability Survey, 2018""', 'No link'), ('T1 International, ""Access to Insulin and Supplies Survey""', 'https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national-diabetes-statistics-report.pdf'), ('Telephone interview with Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University, April 23', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with Dr. Jing Luo, an instructor at Harvard Medical School, April 23', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2717499'), ('Telephone interview with Dr. Kasia Lipska, an assistant professor of endocrinology at Yale School of Medicine, April 24', 'No link'), ('Email interview with James Elliott, T1 International trustee, April 23', 'http://main.diabetes.org/dorg/PDFs/2018-insulin-affordability-survey.pdf'), ('Email interview with Elizabeth Feister, T1 International executive director, April 24', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Michelle Kirkwood, American Diabetes Association vice president of scientific, medical and mission communications, April 23', 'https://www.t1international.com/insulin-and-supply-survey/')]",/factchecks/2019/apr/26/kamala-harris/high-cost-insulin-keeping-diabetics-taking-their-m/

Are all Missouri coal ash ponds really causing groundwater contamination?
","In a Feb. 24 article published by St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Maxine Lipeles, director of Washington University’s Interdisciplinary Environmental Clinic, made a jarring statement about the condition of Missouri’s groundwater as a result of coal ash contamination. ""All the ponds in Missouri for which we have data are causing groundwater contamination...This is a statewide issue,"" Lipeles said. Lipeles is specifically referencing coal ash ponds, engineered ponds used for the disposal of coal ash waste, in her statement. Lipeles was responding to an effort by the Missouri legislature to shift oversight of coal ash disposal from the federal level to the state level. According to the Energy Information Administration, coal fueled 81 percent of Missouri's electricity generation in 2017, and more coal is consumed for electricity generation in Missouri than in all but two other states. Coal ash is the resulting waste when coal is burned for electricity. Currently, there are 16 coal-fired power plants and 41 coal ash ponds in Missouri, according to a 2019 Washington University Law report. Lipeles’ statement may have you second-guessing yourself anytime you reach for your kitchen faucet. We checked Lipeles’ claim to see if it, in fact, holds water. We reached out to Lipeles to understand the data on which her statement was founded on. Lieples directed us to the utilities’ 2017 annual groundwater monitoring reports to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from January 2018. The utilities are required by the EPA to report groundwater monitoring data each year. The EPA first required the reports beginning in 2017. The 2018 reports were recently added, but Lipeles told us she has not reviewed the latest reports. The EPA also required that plants share their coal combustion residuals, as required by the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals Rule of 2015. The EPA’s list was last updated on May 15, 2018. Upon examination of the reports posted on EPA’s list, we found that every groundwater monitoring report posted for every utility company did appear to show the presence of at least one contaminant. The reports often emphasize corrective action plans and also try to prove that an extraneous source could be causing the groundwater contamination. We reached out to Patricia Schuba, president of the Labadie Environmental Organization and a trained biologist, for a second opinion on Lipeles’ claim. ""It's a truthful statement that every [plant] that has to report under the coal ash rule for Missouri shows contamination,"" Schuba said. ""I think there's only a few that there's one contaminant, but arsenic stands out as the primary contaminant that's showing up in Missouri testing as well as molybdenum."" Schuba also stressed the risk of groundwater contamination beyond drinking water. ""There's this big concern that we don't realize that this stuff is so dangerous and we're putting it in a water environment where it can become soluble and move into plants, animals, fish...it can bioaccumulate in the rivers,"" Schuba said. ""It is contaminating a huge economic resource for the state, and I think the risk of that is totally underappreciated."" Abel Russ, a senior attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, also agreed with Lipeles’ claim. Having formerly worked in the field of human health risk assessment as a research associate and toxicologist, Russ provided us with an 80-page report that included evaluations for groundwater contaminant present at every power plant in Missouri that provided groundwater monitoring data in March 2018 according to the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals Rule of 2015. ""We were trying to determine whether each location had unsafe levels of groundwater contamination that could be attributed to regulated coal ash ponds or landfills,"" Russ said via email. ""Specifically, we counted a pollutant as being present at unsafe levels if (a) it exceeded health-based standards, and (b) the levels in downgradient wells were equal to or greater than the levels in upgradient wells."" According to the report, the only plant in Missouri that didn’t clearly appear to be causing groundwater contamination was the Sikeston power plant. ""For Sikeston, however, I should note that there are elevated levels of coal ash indicator pollutants like boron and sulfate in wells downgradient of the ash pond,"" Russ said. ""This tells me that the Sikeston ash pond is leaking. We didn’t flag it in our report because the levels in groundwater, even though they are elevated above background, do not exceed health-based standards."" For final confirmation, we did an online search to find documents that could add support for Lipeles’ claim. After reviewing the 2019 Washington University Law report on coal ash ponds, the data clearly supports her claim that ""all the ponds in Missouri for which we have data are causing groundwater contamination."" Sixteen Missouri coal-fired power plants were included in the report, analyzing a total of 41 coal ash ponds. For every plant listed, their respective coal ash ponds showed groundwater samples that exceeded the federal drinking water standards for boron, arsenic and/or sulfate. The only coal ash ponds included in the report that did not show groundwater contamination were those operated by plants that did not have groundwater monitoring data listed on their CCR compliance website. Those plants include but aren’t limited to Columbia Municipal Power Plant, Missouri City Generating Station and Blue Valley Generating Station.

About 74% of Texans live in just 4% of the state's land
","A group of mayors from across Texas joined the Texas Municipal League in criticizing a handful of bills before the Legislature that they say are harmful to cities and would limit what actions they could take on local issues like property restrictions. Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal League, said local governments know their communities better than anyone and promote ""sensible regulation."" ""Seventy-four percent of the population lives in Texas’ cities,"" he said. ""The surface area of Texas cities is only 4%. So you’ve got 74% of the folks in Texas crammed into 4% of the land. Having reasonable restrictions on what you can do with your property is something that cities have done for thousands of years."" Is Sandlin correct? Do the vast majority of Texans live in cities, which make up a small percentage of the state’s total area? Sandlin did the math Sandlin said his organization calculated this claim using population data they maintain and U.S. Census Bureau numbers on population and land area. They calculated the percentage of people living in Texas cities by using their data to find people living in cities and the overall estimate of the state’s population. To find the area, they used census numbers to find the area of the state and the area within cities — while keeping an eye out for erroneous data. ""We’ve found over the years that the census is not always completely sensitive to what it means to be an incorporated Texas city, and they sometimes include non-city metropolitan regions or districts,"" Sandlin said in an email. The cities in his calculation include all incorporated areas in Texas, from Houston, with more than 2.3 million people, to Toco in North Texas, with an estimated 75 residents. Sandlin said he has not completed a new calculation since 2015, but it’s unlikely things have changed. ""There’s been a handful of new very small cities formed and maybe some annexation and dis-annexation, but I doubt it has changed the percentage in any appreciable way,"" he said. What do the numbers say? Lila Valencia, the senior demographer at the Texas Demographic Center, said Sandlin’s calculations are exactly right. Population estimates from the census for 2017 show that the state’s population was about 28.3 million. Of those, about 20.8 million people lived in incorporated areas — or 73.63% of Texans. Valencia also pulled numbers from the census related to geography of the state and incorporated places. Texas has a land area of more than 676.6 billion square meters. As of 2017, more than 28.7 billion square meters (or 4.25%) are in incorporated areas. Nationwide, a similar trend exists. A report produced by the Census Bureau in 2015 showed that a majority of the country’s population lives in incorporated places — 62.7 percent as of 2013. Incorporated lands made up just 3.5 percent of the country’s land area at that time. Our ruling Sandlin said, 74% of people in Texas are ""crammed into 4% of the land."" The latest census data supports Sandlin’s claim. About 20 million Texans, or 74% of the state’s population, live in incorporated areas, which make up about 4% of the state’s land. We rate this claim True.

Migrant infants have appeared as defendants in immigration court for years, despite viral claim
","The topic of unaccompanied toddlers appearing in immigration court drew widespread attention in 2018, after the Trump administration implemented its ""zero tolerance"" policy, leading to thousands of children being separated from their families. Accounts of small children being questioned by judges drew public outcry. It didn’t take long for disturbing reports to emerge: These children, some as young as one, were appearing as defendants in immigration court unaccompanied by their parents or even attorneys. Outraged, some people claimed the practice was new, ushered in by Donald Trump’s administration alone. That’s wrong. An image recently shared on Facebook is making that claim again, and features an image of a small child with the word ""ICE"" written across it, along with the seal for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Additional text above and below the photo says, ""For the first time in the 242 year history of the United States of America … a one-year-old child appears in court as a defendant."" The photo was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There has been an increase in unaccompanied children appearing in immigration courts within the last year, and that may be due to the Trump administration’s tough stance (as well as a record number of families attempting to cross the southern U.S. border) – but the practice itself is nothing new. Megan McKenna, senior director of communications and community engagement for Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), told PolitiFact that young children have been subjected to immigration proceedings for years. ""It’s always been the case with children. It’s been a different, evolving system but children of all ages have had to appear in immigration deportation proceedings,"" McKenna said. ""We have been referred kids as young as six months old prior to the Trump administration and also throughout it."" The Unaccompanied Alien Children program was created by law in 2002 when the Department of Homeland Security was established. It outlined the nation’s approach to caring for and treating minors who have illegally entered the U.S. alone or who were separated from an adult. On March 1, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibilities for the care and custody of these children from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under the umbrella of Department of Health and Human Services. Since then, the ORR has cared for over 340,000 migrant children, according to the program’s website.   Unaccompanied minors are placed in facilities for 60 days, on average while they await their hearings. They can also be released to a relative or sponsor earlier. These children are not guaranteed a right to an attorney, something that also predates the Trump administration. ORR does offer services, indirectly, by contracting with the nonprofit Vera Institute for Justice, an organization that ""works to preserve the rights of tens of thousands of migrant children,"" according to its website. The Vera Institute partners with a network of legal service providers across the U.S. who inform migrant children of their rights under U.S. law and defend them in their legal proceedings as part of its Unaccompanied Children Program. While these nonprofits or law firms that offer pro bono services certainly help the children, McKenna says that many unaccompanied migrant children do not receive sufficient representation because the demand for attorneys willing to take these cases is so outmatched by attorney availability. Founded in 2008, lawyers at KIND started providing legal counsel to unaccompanied immigrant children in January 2009. According to a January 2018 report, the organization found that 50 percent of the children have had no one to represent them in immigration court, making them five times more likely to be deported. That lines up with data from TRAC, a Syracuse University clearinghouse for immigration research, that shows that, indeed, on average since 2005, roughly 52 percent of all children undergoing immigration court proceedings have had no representation. In the years since Trump took office, the percentage of children who have had no one to represent them has steadily increased, just as the raw number of cases themselves have increased, according to TRAC. Unrepresented minors accounted for 32 percent of the children who faced deportation hearings in 2016, 50 percent in 2017, 60 percent in 2018 and 71 percent so far in 2019. Also according to that data, 60,695 unaccompanied children faced deportation hearings in 2017, compared to 54,037 in 2016 and 32,536 in 2015. There has also been a dramatic increase in infants and toddlers appearing in immigration proceedings under the Trump administration, data shows. In July 2018, Kaiser Health News reported that 70 babies younger than age one had appeared for their own deportation proceedings from Oct. 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. The number is up from the previous two years, which was 24 infants in all of fiscal year 2017 and 46 in fiscal year 2016. (Fiscal years run from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30) Kaiser’s report also said that, from the Justice Department data reviewed, a total of 1,500 unaccompanied children, from newborns to age 3, have been called in to immigration court since Oct. 1, 2015. A viral image on social media makes the claim that a ""one-year-old appears in court as a defendant"" for the first time in U.S. history. Recent data does show a significant increase in the amount of young unaccompanied children appearing in immigration proceedings over the last fiscal year, but the practice was not implemented by the Trump administration – it’s been in place for over a decade.

Donald Trump wrongly says Jeb Bush said he would 'moon everybody' and 'nobody reports that'
","Jeb Bush took Donald Trump to task over the language he has used on the campaign trail in a Republican debate in South Carolina. That included Trump’s comments about women and Sen. John McCain, as well as an accusation that he mocked a disabled reporter who has a physical impairment, which Trump denied. Trump fired back that Bush has been a potty mouth but has gotten away with it. ""Two days ago, he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody,"" Trump said Feb. 13. ""And that's fine -- nobody reports that. He gets up and says that. And then he tells me that, oh, my language was a little bit rough."" Did Bush really say such a thing, and did the press ignore it? Trump’s recounting of the facts is pretty selective. Bush’s comment about mooning Trump’s spokeswoman referred us to a a Feb. 6 article by Matt Viser in the Boston Globe a few days before the New Hampshire primary. The main point of the article was that Bush had to do well in New Hampshire -- or later this month in South Carolina -- or he would face pressure to end his campaign. ""Sitting on his campaign bus — laptop, turkey jerky, and coffee all nearby — Jeb Bush was befuddled over his campaign’s failure to capture more attention from the news media. ""I could drop my pants,"" he said in an interview. ""Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice."" So it was actually Bush who suggested -- in jest here -- to the Boston Globe reporter that he could even pull down his pants and moon people and he still would get no media attention. It’s fair to say that Bush was exaggerating here to make a point about the lack of media coverage he was getting. And Bush made that point to a reporter from a major publication. And that reporter led with it in an article three days before the primary. Trump’s comments made it sound like Bush was threatening to moon people, and that’s not the case. Bush’s quote at the time was repeated on various blogs on the Internet, and The Drudge Report posted it on Facebook.  Our ruling Trump said that Bush ""said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that."" Bush did talk about mooning people. The Boston Globe reported on Feb. 6 that Bush said, ""I could drop my pants. Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice."" Bush’s comment to the reporter was intended to show how he felt he was getting no campaign coverage. But Trump’s statement is misleading, because Bush wasn’t threatening to moon people, and his comment was indeed reported. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical context. So we rate it Mostly False.","[('Boston Globe, ""In New Hampshire, Jeb Bush is searching for a comeback,"" Feb. 6, 2016', 'https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/02/06/jeb-bush-fighting-for-survival-new-hampshire-symbol-gop-establishment-weakness/u0eRx0ydhhl29N3qrhmqnM/story.html'), ('Facebook, Matt Drudge post, Feb. 6, 2016', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Donald Trump says \'he didn\'t say\' the things about women that Megyn Kelly asked him about in debate,"" Aug. 10, 2015', 'https://www.facebook.com/mattdrudge/posts/10153827658411955'), ('PolitiFact, ""Trump: I called McCain a \'hero\' four times,"" July 19, 2015', 'No link'), ('The Hill, ""Trump denies mocking disabled reporter,"" Nov. 26, 2015', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-women-viciously-attacked-him-fir/'), ('Washington Post, ""CBS News Republican debate transcript annotated,"" Feb. 13, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-jeb-bush-said-he-would-moon-ever/

Rubio exaggerates in saying it's been 80 years since a 'lame duck' made a Supreme Court nomination
","The death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a key topic at the start of the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina Saturday night. Some of the candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio, called on President Barack Obama to hold back on his replacement and leave the decision to the next president. ""I do not believe the president should appoint someone,"" said Rubio, a Florida senator. ""And it's not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice."" Let’s see what history shows about lame-duck presidential picks to the Supreme Court. We emailed spokespersons for Rubio and did not hear back. Nominations Technically presidents don’t ""appoint"" a justice to the Supreme Court. They nominate someone who is then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There’s also the problem of whether Obama should be considered a lame duck or not. Some would say Obama isn’t a lame duck until after Election Day in November when his successor is chosen. Others might say all second-term presidents are lame ducks because they know they won’t serve again. ""The definition has evolved,"" said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Decades ago, the lame-duck label was applied to a president after an election, but the term has changed over time to include any officeholder in his or her last term. Either way, election-year Supreme Court nominations are rare. Rubio’s statement prompted several comments on Twitter from those who noted a specific exception to his claim: the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy. The Senate confirmed Kennedy 97-0 on Feb. 4, 1988. That was about 28 years ago -- not 80. Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis Powell, who retired, and was Reagan’s third nomination for the opening, after Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg. Powell announced his retirement in June 1987. Reagan, who was in his second term, nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Kennedy was confirmed in February 1988. In November 1988, Reagan’s vice president George H.W. Bush won the presidency. ""The nomination actually wasn't in the election year, although the confirmation vote was,"" said Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet. This came up minutes later in the debate, when U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, ""We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year."" Debate moderator John Dickerson of CBS News corrected Cruz by noting that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988. We’re not certain which nomination Rubio was referring to 80 years ago. One possibility is when President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Nathan Cardozo to fill a vacancy in February 1932, and Cardozo was confirmed that same month. Hoover then went on to lose re-election later that year. ""But Hoover was not a lame duck; he was eligible for re-election even though he lost,"" said Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center. As of 2010, the Senate has rejected 16 of 34 Supreme Court nominations because of opposition to the nominating president, according to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report. Seven of the rejected nominations were put forward by presidents in their final year in office after a new president had been elected but before the successor took over. But those were more than 80 years ago. ""Each of these ‘lame duck’ nominations transpired under 19th century presidents when the post-election period lasted from early November until early March,"" the report states. Our ruling Rubio said, ""It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice."" The most recent contradiction of this claim would be Reagan’s nomination of Kennedy. Kennedy was nominated in November 1987 and confirmed during Reagan’s final year of office in February 1988. Reagan’s timeline doesn’t exactly line up with what Obama faces; Reagan had more time between his nomination and the end of his presidency. But it’s hard for us to see how Obama can be considered a lame duck but not Reagan. Both were second-term presidents who knew they would not serve again but did not yet know who their successor would be.

Our friends over at Snopes looked into a similar quote and concluded that it’s ""highly unlikely that Stalin ever spoke these words."" It seems dubious that Stalin would say something like this, as the quote, in a sense, compliments America for its strengths, Snopes noted. We searched through an online Stalin Archive and an online library compiled by the University of Pennsylvania. Our searches came up empty. It’s unclear where this quote originated. The earliest use of the quote Snopes found was in a 1983 letter to the editor in a Kansas newspaper.

The numbers he gave translate to about 31 assaults per 100,000 Rhode Islanders and about 19 assaults per 100,000 Connecticut residents. Capezza noted the significantly higher per capita rate of assaults in Rhode Island and cited population figures for both states, about 3.5 million for Connecticut and 1 million for Rhode Island. Rep. Edith H. Ajello asked about Massachusetts and Capezza told her ""Massachusetts had … 141 assaults based on a 4,150,000 population."" ""Seems to me the per capita assault on police officers in Rhode Island is way out of line with Connecticut and Massachusetts,"" said Ajello. ""Much higher, which is certainly concerning."" We dug into the FBI’s annual report on the subject and found that just 235 of 323 Massachusetts departments filed their assault data. That works out to a compliance rate of 72 percent. The rate was 98 percent in Connecticut and Rhode Island, 97 percent in Maine, 95 percent in New Hampshire and 100 percent in Vermont. A Massachusetts state official who coordinates data for the FBI provided us with a list of communities that contributed statistics, including Boston and Fall River, but not Cambridge, Somerville, Everett, Quincy, Brockton, New Bedford, Springfield and Worcester. At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. We told Capezza about the absence of data from 88 police agencies; he stood by his earlier testimony. ""By this document, it’s clear Rhode Island has the second-highest amount of assaults,"" said the Rhode Island state director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers. The table in the FBI report referenced by Capezza groups the six New England states and lists the number of assaults reported by participating agencies in each of them. The number of assaults in Rhode Island is the second-highest number in the table. But the same table also provides information about ""the number of reporting agencies"" and the ""population covered"" -- indications that the individual assault statistics may not reflect all assault data compiled by all police agencies in each state. The population covered by the statistic that Capezza gave to Ajello was the 4.1 million listed in the table, but the FBI’s total population estimate for Massachusetts, found elsewhere in its Uniform Crime Reports, was about 6.5 million. Also, the report itself does not rank the New England states. Capezza did that on his own. The FBI deliberately avoids rankings like the one that Capezza presents. And the agency warns data users to avoid comparing data from states and other types of jurisdictions ""solely on the basis of their population coverage…"" and without considering a full range of other factors such as degree of urbanization, strength of law enforcement and poverty levels. ""Until data users examine all the variables that affect crime in a town, city, county, state, region, or other jurisdiction, they can make no meaningful comparisons,"" says the FBI’s warning. Our ruling Capezza said that: ""In New England, RI has the second highest number of police officers being assaulted."" He cited FBI Uniform Crime Reports as his source and the FBI data from Rhode Island and four other New England states supports his claim. The data from Massachusetts also supports the claim. The problem is that, pending an update, the Massachusetts data is only 72 percent complete. In other words, 28 percent of the data from New England’s most populous state is missing. That’s a substantial gap. Also, Capezza misused the FBI data when he ranked the New England states without addressing all of the variables that can affect such a crime statistic. Such rankings are explicitly discouraged by the agency’s cautionary guidelines. For those two reasons, the ruling is Mostly False.","[('RICapTVDiscoverVideo.com, ""House Committee On Judiciary,"" Jan. 26, 2016, accessed Feb. 4, 2016.', 'http://ricaptv.discovervideo.com/embedviews/vod?s=1&c=HOUSE%20COMMITTEE%20ON%20JUDICIARY&w=640&h=480#'), ('FBI.gov, ""2014 Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted: Region, Geographic Division, and State by Type of Weapon,"" accessed Feb. 4, 2016.', 'No link'), ('FBI.gov, ""2014 Crime in the United States: Full-time Law Enforcement Employees,"" accessed Feb. 9, 2016', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/leoka/2014/tables/table_77_leos_asltd_region_geographic_division_and_state_by_type_of_weapon_2014.xls'), ('LegiScan.com, Rhode Island House Bill 7092, ""An act relating to criminal offenses -- assault of police officers and other officials,"" accessed Feb. 9, 2016.', 'No link'), ('Tony Capezza, Rhode Island state director, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, \xa0interview, Feb. 9, 2016.', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-77'), ('FBI.gov, Press Release, ""FBI releases 2014 Crime Statistics,"" Sept. 28, 2015, accessed Feb. 10, 2016.', 'No link'), ('FBI.gov, ""Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics: Their Proper Use,"" accessed Feb. 10, 2016.', 'https://legiscan.com/RI/bill/H7092/2016'), ('UCRdatatool.gov, ""Caution Against Ranking,"" Jan. 14, 2009, accessed Feb. 10, 2016.', 'No link'), ('Cliff Goodband, Data Information Manager, Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety & Security, email, Feb. 10, 2016.', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2711255-2014-CIUS-Summary-Final.html'), ('Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety & Security, ""List of police agencies that supplied statistics for the FBI’s report, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted 2014,"" June 30, 2015.', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/14/tony-capezza/police-union-director-uses-incomplete-data-general/

Donald Trump was not 'loud and clear' in Iraq War opposition
","In one of the most heated and personal back-and-forths from a debate this cycle, Donald Trump eviscerated former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for supporting his brother’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Trump stood by his comment in 2008 that Democrats should have impeached President George W. Bush over the invasion when asked about it in the Feb. 13 CBS debate in South Carolina. Trump vigorously refuted Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio’s statements hailing the former president’s leadership, saying, ""The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe."" Again, Trump said he was against the war from the very beginning. ""I'm the only one on this stage that said, ‘Do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq,’ "" Trump said. ""Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician, fortunately. But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, ‘You'll destabilize the Middle East.’ "" Trump often repeats this line, and we’ve rated a similar Trump claim Mostly False, because he didn’t appear to take any public position on the war until after the March 2003 invasion. In this more recent version of the statement, he also said he stated his opposition to the war ""loud and clear."" But the public record of his positions is thin. Let’s revisit the facts. We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003, during the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began. Trump’s comments We only found one instance where Trump discussed the war before it started. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, ""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned."" Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim that Bush should not proceed because a war would  ""destabilize the Middle East."" A single, squishy comment about the looming war does not qualify as ""loud and clear"" opposition. The United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003. A week later Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket."" Trump’s harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire: ""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. ""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!"" He told CNN’s Larry King in November 2004, ""I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out."" Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war in the first place, or that he was especially vocal about it destabilizing the Middle East. Our ruling On the Iraq war, Trump said, ""I said it loud and clear, 'You'll destabilize the Middle East.' "" Maybe Trump felt this way privately, but he made no publicly reported comments in the lead-up to the Iraq War that reflect this sentiment. He certainly did not say it ""loud and clear."" We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq War before the invasion, and he seemed apprehensive but not vehemently opposed to the operation. He only started publicly denouncing the war after it started. Because he far overstated how loudly he declared his position on the Iraq War, we’re cranking the rating on this statement up to False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/32ee4b83-02ae-4423-b6dd-27703fb47c6c","[('Nexis archive search of transcripts and newspaper articles January 2002 through March 2003, conducted Feb. 6, 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/21/donald-trumps-baseless-claim-that-the-bush-white-house-tried-to-silence-his-iraq-war-opposition-in-2003/'), ('Washington Post, ""Donald Trump’s baseless claim that the Bush White House tried to ‘silence’ his Iraq War opposition in 2003,"" Oct. 21, 2015', 'No link'), ('Huffington Post, ""Donald Trump\'s Anti-Iraq War Position Wasn\'t As Prophetic As He Thinks,"" Sept. 14, 2015', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-iraq-war_us_55f32d97e4b077ca094f05db'), ('Buzzfeed, ""Despite Claims, There’s No Record Of Donald Trump Being Against The Iraq War Before It Started,"" Sept. 16, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-his-early-opposition-iraq-war-wa/

Facebook post incorrectly quotes Mark Cuban on millennials, Democrats and Republicans
","Fact-checking is driving millions of young people to vote Democratic, so says Shark Tank investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Or at least that’s what a Facebook post says. Readers shared with us this picture that features Mark Cuban, a self-described libertarian and Sharknado 3 president of the United States, saying, ""I worry that millions of millennials are voting Democrat this year because they fact-check everything and they know Republicans are completely out of touch and are running a campaign of hatred and lies."" We love shoutouts to fact-checking, but this post needs its own facts checked. We can’t find any evidence, anywhere, that Cuban said this or anything like it. We scoured the Internet, news archives, Cuban’s blog and social media accounts, but we didn’t find anything that matches the quote paired with this picture.  We were able to reach Cuban over Twitter, asking him if this is something he ever said. He replied, ""No."" We traced the image to a post on a Facebook page called ""Point Counter Point,"" which bills itself as ""responding to Republican lies."" We reached out to the page administrator via Facebook message to see how they came up with this quote but have yet to hear back. We did find a recent instance in which Cuban discussed why millennials seem to support Democrats, particularly Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the same post, he criticizes Republicans alongside Democrats. Millennials like Sanders because they believe in ""sociocapitalism"" rather than just capitalism, meaning they expect businesses to have some sort of charitable element and inclusive practices, Cuban wrote on his blog, ""Maverick Blog: Mark Cuban’s Weblog,"" on Feb. 8. He’s noticed this trend through his experience listening to business pitches from 20-somethings as an investor on ABC’s Shark Tank. ""So how can it be a surprise that millennials are excited about Bernie Sanders?"" he wrote. ""Millennials expect capitalism to reflect a socialist element."" He wrote that no candidate in either party has shown a single instance of leadership; rather, they are too focused on conforming to party principles. They’re all also ""technologically illiterate"" and unprepared to handle the country’s growing technological needs. But his post did not reference fact-checking, nor did he say Republicans are ""running a campaign of hatred and lies."" If we find a verified instance of him saying what the post alleges, we will revisit the fact-check.  Cuban remains an undecided voter, as far as we can tell. He has said, though, that he wants ""anybody but"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and he thinks fellow billionaire Donald Trump is shaking up politics in a good way because he speaks his mind and doesn’t just play to the base of the Republican Party. Cuban has said he shares Republicans’ desire for small government, but disagrees with many of their social positions. Cuban says he voted for President Barack Obama in 2008. Our ruling A Facebook post quotes Mark Cuban as saying, ""I worry that millions of millennials are voting Democrat this year because they fact-check everything.""   There’s no evidence Cuban ever said that. As far as we can tell, it’s a made-up quotation. Pants on Fire! Editor's note: Shortly after publishing this article, Cuban confirmed that he never said this quote.

Hillary Clinton ad says it takes a year for 300 working Americans to earn as much as a top CEO
","Income disparity is a big deal in Nevada. State unemployment remains higher than the national average at 6.4 percent, and new income growth goes almost entirely to the top 1 percent of Nevadans. So maybe it’s no surprise that Hillary Clinton is blanketing Nevada with numerous television ads ahead of the Feb. 20 primaries. One ad promises to tackle the ""wage gap"" and has aired more than 650 times in the state, according to the Political TV Ad Archive. ""On average it takes 300 Americans working for a solid year to make as much money as one top CEO,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""It’s called the ‘wage gap,’ and the Republicans will make it worse by lowering taxes for those at the top and letting corporations write their own rules."" The opening statement of the ad is similar to other statements we’ve fact-checked on the vast chasm in pay between the average worker and top executives. We thought it merited a fresh look. Reports from left-leaning think tanks reaffirm Clinton’s claim. A 2015 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that CEOs from 350 top firms make an average of $16.3 million a year, including stock options and other forms of compensation.  That averages out to about 303 times the pay of an ""average worker,"" which matches up with Clinton’s ad. Other pro-worker sources support this claim. Labor giant AFL-CIO issues an annual ""Executive Paywatch"" report, which highlights the disparity between low-income workers and well-compensated CEOs. Its 2014 report says the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 373 to 1. University of Nevada, Reno economics professor Elliott Parker agreed with the studies and said in an email that the number cited by Clinton was ""in the ballpark."" It’s worth noting that variances in the studies are due to the fact that different groups use different metrics and methods to crunch the numbers. PolitiFact Virginia previously addressed this issue and found that there’s no standard formula for determining salary and compensation for both average workers and CEOs. This makes it hard to accurately compare the data. Right-leaning groups have poked holes in the numbers. American Enterprise Institute economist Mark Perry takes issue with the methodology behind the AFL-CIO study and called it ""bogus/exaggerated/distorted"" in an email. He says the AFL-CIO analysis makes misleading comparisons and cherry-picks data in order to make the wage gap look as high as possible. Perry says limiting the data to the top 350 companies isn’t representative for the majority of workers, and that CEOs at those highly-valued companies should be duly compensated. ""The value of Apple stock ($521 billion) is more than the value of the entire stock market in Brazil,"" he wrote in an email. ""If Tim Cook makes 300 times more than a plumber in Kansas, so what?"" Part of the difficulty is that there’s no way to accurately gauge the average salary for workers at the companies headed by the 350 ""top CEOs.""  These variances in crunching the numbers may soon be resolved. Part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill requires public companies to disclose CEO and median worker compensation, and takes effect in 2017. Our ruling Clinton’s ad states that ""it takes 300 Americans working for a solid year to make as much money as one top CEO."" There’s no standard metric used to measure income disparity, but Clinton’s ad seems to land on the safe side of many recent studies. Clinton hedges by sticking to a smaller number, but there are still imperfections in the methodology. We rate her statement Mostly True.","[('Email interview, Mark Perry, University of Michigan, Flint, Feb. 10', 'http://www.aflcio.org/Corporate-Watch/Paywatch-2015'), ('Email interview, Elliott Parker, University of Nevada Economics Professor, Feb. 3', 'No link'), ('AFL-CIO website, ""Executive Paywatch: High-Paid CEOs and the Low-Wage Economy,"" Accessed Feb. 9', 'http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/'), ('Blog post, ""Top CEOs Make 300 Times More than Typical Workers,"" Lawrence Mishel and Alyssa Davis, Economic Policy Institute, June 21, 2015', 'No link'), ('Blog post, ""Lots of problems with AFL-CIO’s ‘CEO-to-worker pay’ analysis including small sample size and using part-time worker pay,"" Mark J.

Ad distorts John Kasich's budget proposal, saying it raised taxes by billions
","In this Republican primary, you’re nobody until you’re the subject of a dark-money-funded attack ad. Even before his success in New Hampshire, Ohio Gov. John Kasich had made the cut, judging by an ad labeling him an ""Obama Republican,"" paid for by the American Future Fund, an organization linked to the billionaire Koch brothers. The ad’s voiceover states, ""Common Core. Obama’s Medicaid expansion. Tax increases. Barack Obama? No. John Kasich. Kasich still supports Common Core. Kasich was one of the few Republican governors to cheerlead Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, and Kasich’s budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder. John Kasich. Not a conservative. Not even a moderate. An Obama Republican."" It’s the statement about raising taxes by ""billions"" that raised our fact-checking antennae. But first, the other claims. On Common Core, the school boards and administrators in most states have used the national initiative as a model on which to base their own standards. Kasich has been steadfast that curriculum decisions in Ohio schools are made at the local level. It’s true that his statements on Common Core are far from the condemnation coming from the rest of the Republican field. On the Affordable Care Act, Kasich opposed health care exchanges in Ohio, but did expand Medicaid, defending his decision by referencing the Bible’s commands to help the poor. On to the ad’s criticism of Kasich’s budget proposal. Ohio’s budget goes through two-year cycles. Kasich’s 2015 proposed budget would have: • Raised tobacco taxes by 35 cents, to $1.60 a pack; • Created a new electronic cigarette tax; • Raised state sales taxes by a half-cent; • Raised the tax on oil and gas producers; •  Created a 3 percent flat tax on businesses income above $250,000. These tax hikes were intended to offset the key element in Kasich’s plan: a sweeping income tax cut. And tax policy analysts from the left and the right both defined it as such. Economist Scott Drenkard, with the business-backed Tax Foundation, panned Kasich’s plan for shrinking Ohio’s tax base. A more left-leaning policy research institute, Policy Matters Ohio, also identified Kasich’s plan as a tax cut, and was critical of it for rewarding the wealthiest taxpayers the most. According to their February 2015 report, the richest top 1 percent of Ohioans would see $11,906 in tax savings, and the next 4 percent would see an average savings of $890. But the bottom 20 percent of earners could expect to pay an average $116 more. ""To say his budget raised taxes by billions is a wild overstatement, to me,"" says Zach Schiller, research director of Policy Matters Ohio. Kasich’s budget ""raised taxes by billions, before it cut them by even bigger billions."" The next element of the attack ad’s claim is that Kasich’s budget hurt Ohio businesses. But Schiller says that’s questionable as well. ""His proposal would have increased taxes that businesses themselves pay. You could possibly debate that,"" Schiller says. ""But it included a big cut in the income taxes for the owners of those businesses."" Schiller also takes issue with the statement from the ad about hitting middle-class Ohioans ""even harder."" ""What you find is, the people at the top, making the top 1 percent, are getting many thousands of dollars a year in tax cuts,"" Schiller adds. ""The people in the middle are either breaking even or seeing modest increases, and the people at the bottom are seeing modest increases."" Ohio’s Department of Taxation provided PolitiFact with a table showing net tax reductions by year through Kasich’s tenure as governor, from 2012 through 2017.  The net savings resulting from the 2015 budget comes to $1.88 billion. Our ruling An ad from the American Future Fund said, ""Kasich’s budget raised taxes by billions, hitting businesses hard and the middle class even harder."" His budget did raise taxes, but then it cut taxes by billions. The biggest increase in Kasich’s plan, a bump of $1.5 billion over two years, is the sales tax increase. That increase offsets Kasich’s income tax cuts, which total $1.88 billion over the same two-year period. The ad said these tax increases hit businesses hard. Some businesses -- the biggest ones -- would see a flat tax rate increase of 3 percent. But the income tax cuts reward the most affluent Ohioans -- many tied to big businesses -- with thousands of dollars in tax breaks. Were middle-class Ohioans hit the hardest? Most would break even or see a slight tax increase. It would have been more accurate to say that the poorest taxpayers would gain nothing from Kasich’s tax restructuring. But that wouldn’t make for much of an attack ad. We rate this statement False.

Jonathan Stickland makes Pants on Fire claim about Scott Fisher forcing Texans into Obamacare
","A TV ad from state Rep. Jonathan Stickland of Bedford says his challenger in the March 2016 Republican primary, Scott Fisher, voted in favor of pushing a million Texans ""into Obamacare."" That’s war talk for Republicans. And is it so? The narrator of the ad, which was brought to our attention by Fisher consultant Craig Murphy, says Fisher, a Bedford church pastor, is running a negative campaign backed by liberals. Also, the narrator says, Fisher ""tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare."" The image presented with that claim:  The Obamacare law, approved by Congress in 2010, requires most Americans to have health insurance and also permits states to widen access to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance, with Uncle Sam covering the costs for three years and picking up most costs after that. In Texas, we concluded in 2015, around 1 million adults could have qualified for coverage if the state expanded access. Nobody would have been forced in; beneficiaries would have to sign up. It’s an understatement to say expansion didn’t catch on in Texas. In 2012, Gov. Rick Perry rejected the option, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. The next year, the Republican-led Legislature ""shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid,"" a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story summed up. Stickland consultant cites board resolution We asked Stickland’s campaign consultant, Luke Macias, how Stickland concluded that Fisher voted to push a million Texans into Obamacare. By email and phone, Macias maintained that documents emailed to us by Murphy demonstrate that as a member of a board, Fisher in 2013 propelled approval of a ""pro-Obamacare"" resolution that mentioned the Texas effect of Medicaid expansion and urged lawmakers to consider all options to cover health care for indigent Texans which, Macias suggested, would have included Medicaid expansion. Macias said the resolution’s Medicaid element added up to Fisher trying to force Texans into Obamacare. Board action in 2013 The relevant documents concern the board of managers for the Tarrant County Hospital District, the county’s tax-supported health district. Fisher was a board member from May 2005 into January 2015, district spokeswoman J.R. Labbe told us by email. In April 2013, the board was scheduled to consider a resolution calling for Texas legislators to expand Medicaid. But during the board’s April 11, 2013, meeting, according to meeting minutes, Fisher offered an alternate proposal. That resolution opened by stating Medicaid could insure more than a million low-income adults. But it closed by urging the Texas Legislature to find ""sustainable"" ways to fund the care of individuals lacking health coverage -- without mention of Medicaid or the Obamacare law. The substitute resolution passed unanimously, according to the minutes, which don’t show a vote on the original resolution urging Medicaid expansion. Labbe put us in touch with the board chairman at the time, Fisher supporter Trent Petty, who said by phone he didn’t advocate the original resolution once it was offered for the agenda by district staff. Moreover, he said, ""our board never voted for the resolution to expand Medicaid."" Petty suggested we ask Robert Earley, the district’s president and CEO, how the resolution landed on the agenda. By phone, Earley said he couldn’t immediately recall; he speculated an association circulated the proposal to hospitals and other health care entities. Petty told us that at the critical 2013 meeting, board members adopted the call to support ""uncompensated care"" instead of the Medicaid expansion resolution after discussion and agreement among members not to support expansion. Petty said: ""Our board was not comfortable with Medicaid expansion. That substituted language was necessary because we didn’t want... to simply be silent about uncompensated care being addressed in some form or fashion by the state."" Labbe confirmed that board meetings weren’t recorded, leaving us no audio or video record to review. Hospital district resolutions Let’s peek at the resolutions. The original -- unadopted -- resolution notes the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled it optional for each state to expand Medicaid in accord with the Affordable Care Act, known as the Obamacare law, and also says expansion would qualify more than a million Texas adults in poverty for Medicaid. It closes: ""Now, therefore, be it resolved that: Tarrant County Hospital District Board of Managers respectfully calls on the Texas Legislature to seek all possible options for an efficient and effective Medicaid expansion."" The adopted resolution opens by mentioning the Texas effect of Medicaid expansion, stating: ""Whereas, the Affordable Care Act would add more than a million adult Texans living near or below the poverty line to Medicaid coverage."" It goes on to (inaccurately) attribute premium increases to increased costs of providing care to uninsured individuals and to say Texas has the highest rate of uninsured (which we confirmed in July 2015) and that the estimated number of uninsured served by the district was projected to increase, burdening taxpayers and ""health delivery systems."" Finally, the resolution asks state lawmakers to ""seek all possible options to adequately fund uncompensated and uninsured care for indigent Texans that is feasible and sustainable."" Fisher’s recap We sought Fisher’s recollections. By phone, he noted that at the time of the board moves, he was Perry’s appointed chairman of the Texas Juvenile Justice Department, which is responsible for housing and rehabilitating juvenile offenders. Significantly too, Fisher said, Perry had reiterated his opposition to expanding Medicaid 10 days before the board meeting. The governor said April 1, 2013: ""Texas will not be held hostage by the Obama administration's attempt to force us into the fool's errand of adding more than a million Texans to a broken system."" Fisher said he entered the meeting believing the board shouldn’t take a pro-expansion position, which would be ""going totally opposite the recent statement of our governor."" We asked Fisher why the adopted resolution opens by saying the Affordable Care Act would add more than a million impoverished adult Texans to Medicaid. He replied: ""Unsustainability. Those were statements that were made that showed the unsustainability, ‘the fool’s errand’ of expanding Medicaid coverage."" Murphy elaborated by email: ""The Whereas  statements"" in the resolution ""were meant, as in every resolution, as a statement of the current situation. The situation was bad."" ""We stripped out any call for Medicaid expansion,"" Fisher summed up. Macias, asked to elaborate on Stickland's claim, said by email: ""Fact: The resolution discusses the benefits of Obamacare and Medicaid expansion and then asks the Legislature to keep ‘ALL possible options.’ How is Medicaid expansion not included in ‘all possible options?’"" Our ruling Stickland says Fisher ""tried to expand Obamacare in Texas and even voted for an official resolution to force 1 million Texans into Obamacare."" At best, this claim misinterprets Fisher’s motion for the hospital district board to approve a resolution asking lawmakers to fund indigent health care. The adopted proposal urges consideration of all possible sustainable options. However, it doesn't call for forcing Texans into Obamacare. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

"['State Budget', 'Pennsylvania', 'Tom  Wolf']","
If lawmakers don’t address PA’s deficit, would 23,000 educators be ‘immediately’ laid off?
","Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf used his 2016-17 budget proposal address on Feb. 9  to castigate Republican legislative leaders and introduce doomsday scenarios about what he says will happen if lawmakers don’t address a rising structural deficit. During his address, Wolf chided the legislature as an eight-month long impasse from the 2015-16 budget continues, saying that ""if the General Assembly does not approve a responsible plan to solve this crisis,"" Pennsylvanians will begin to feel the consequences, teachers will be laid off and ""more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools."" We decided to put that statement to the test. If Pennsylvania doesn’t address its deficit in the 2016-17 budget, would 23,000 education professionals across the state really be ""immediately"" laid off? Wolf’s spokesman Jeff Sheridan said that figure is based on a projection by the Department of Education examining what would happen if $1 billion was cut from public education funding in Pennsylvania. The Wolf administration says that total mandated spending for 2016-17 -- including to pensions, corrections and human services -- is about $32.5 billion. Without raising personal income or sales taxes, advocated by many Republican legislators, total revenue for 2016-17 is estimated at $30.2 billion, leaving the state with a more-than-$2 billion structural deficit. Sheridan said this deficit would lead to a $1 billion cut to education. Department of Education spokeswoman Casey Smith said based on that funding cut, about 599 administrators, 8,749 classroom teachers and 12,988 support staff would be laid off. That adds up to 22,336 positions. These projections were derived from public school staffing changes that took place after federal stimulus dollars under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were not renewed by Congress. When Gov. Tom Corbett’s administration was crafting its 2011-12 budget, it opted not to replace the stimulus dollars with state funds. That left school districts dealing with about $1 billion in funding cuts statewide over the course of the next several years. Those districts addressed the cuts through a combination of staff reductions, cost-cutting measures and property tax increases. James Paul, a policy analyst with the Harrisburg-based Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank, disagreed with the Wolf administration’s assessment. Paul said the Wolf interpretation assumes the education system would bare the brunt of a projected shortfall if Wolf’s budget proposal isn’t adopted by the legislature. ""That is something that is inherently difficult to predict,"" Paul said, ""and it’s unwise to make sweeping claims about teacher layoffs. I think any type of projection like that is more of a political comment."" Mark Price, an analyst with the progressive Harrisburg-based Keystone Research Center, also said it’s difficult to precisely estimate layoffs or other staff losses that would occur after another round of funding cuts to public education. ""It seems highly likely that another round of cuts in state aid would be met with a combination of layoffs, property tax increases and program cuts,"" Price said in an email. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number employees in educational services in Pennsylvania did decrease by 23,000 under Corbett, but it wasn’t immediate and not all the job loss could be tied specifically to budget cuts. In January 2011, there were 313,300 employees statewide in educational services. By January 2013, that number dropped to 290,300. Though those 23,000 staff cuts made through both layoffs and attrition were made over two years, Sheridan said the administration believes future layoffs would happen ""immediately"" if large budget cuts occurred today ""because districts are still suffering from the 2010-11 cuts."" Our ruling During his fiery budget proposal address on Feb. 9, Wolf said Pennsylvania’s ongoing budget problem is based on math, saying that if the Republican-controlled legislature doesn’t address the state’s structural deficit, ""more than 23,000 education professionals will be immediately yanked out of Pennsylvania schools."" Experts and analysts from organizations leaning toward both sides of the aisle say it’s difficult to precisely estimate how local school districts would address funding cuts. His administration said that’s based on cuts made after funding was slashed under former Gov. Tom Corbett. While the amount of educational service jobs in Pennsylvania did decrease by 23,000 positions by January 2013, those cuts took two years to play out and were not immediate, as Wolf’s administration said would happen this time around if the same cuts were to occur. We rule the claim Mostly False.","[('PowerPoint presentation, ""Structural Deficit PowerPoint,"" Scribd, Published by Gov. Tom Wolf.

Reports' limitations plague Bernie Sanders' claim about high childhood poverty rates in the U.S.
","When asked during the Feb. 11 Democratic debate if there would be any limit on the size of government if he were elected president, Sen. Bernie Sanders quickly veered into a list of problems that, he believes, the United States faces. ""Of course there will be a limit,"" he said, ""but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living."" For this item we will focus on his childhood poverty claim. In July, Sanders earned a Mostly False for making a similar claim, but in that instance he was more definitive, saying, ""We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth."" In this instance, he changed it to ""almost any major country."" Clearly many poor countries have a higher childhood poverty rate than the United States, which is why Sanders refers to ""major"" countries. In July, his campaign made it clear that when he talks about major countries, he is referring to members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries. At the time, Sanders was referring to a 2012 UNICEF report on childhood poverty in which the United States ranked No. 34 out of 35 countries with a childhood poverty rate of 23.1 percent. Only Romania, a non-OECD member, scored worse. We found a more recent UNICEF report from 2014 where the U.S. rate of childhood poverty was only exceeded by Israel, Mexico, Spain, and Greece, as well as that of non-OECD Latvia. (Romania was not included.) We also found a report done by the OECD itself from 2014, which used data from 2010, where the United States is listed as having less childhood poverty than Chile, Mexico, Turkey, Israel — all of which are OECD members — and Romania. The Sanders campaign referred us to a July 16, 2015, update of the OECD report. In ranks 38 countries for childhood income poverty using 2012 data. Six countries -- Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Mexico, Israel and Turkey -- are listed as having more childhood poverty. Turkey ranks the worst. Unfortunately, these reports are not necessarily comparable. For example, the 2012 UNICEF report and the OECD report defines impoverished children as those living in households below 50 percent of the median national income. The 2014 UNICEF report moved the poverty bar to 60 percent. But a bigger problem may be the way poverty is defined in these reports. When you base it on households earning less than a certain percentage of the national income, countries with higher levels of income inequality are also statistically more likely to have higher rates of poverty. In countries where income inequality is less, childhood poverty levels may appear lower. As we noted in July, that's why some commentators have criticized such methodology because it may miss the point of a measurement of poverty. One can be less well-off, the argument goes, without being poor, since being poor is defined instead by a lack of access to certain key goods, not by where one’s income falls relative to everyone else’s. As the 2012 UNICEF report acknowledged, poverty is a relative concept, and using an ""absolute"" poverty line -- a fixed income adjusted over time to inflation -- becomes less useful as incomes rise over time. Our ruling Sanders said the United States has ""the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth."" Unlike his July statement, Sanders isn't saying we're at the bottom, just that we're close to it. The reports we've seen aren't perfect, but they do suggest that childhood poverty is embarrassingly high for a country so rich. Comparing U.S. rates to the childhood poverty rates of other countries is perilous, however, because countries have so many different standards of living. In addition, the income inequality in the United States may be exaggerating our position.   The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.","[('The Washington Post, ""Transcript: The Democratic debate in Milwaukee, annotated,"" Feb. 11, 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/debates/schedule/'), ('PolitiFact, ""Sanders: Child poverty is higher in America than any other major country,"" July 8, 2015', 'No link'), ('OECD.org, ""CO2.2: Child Poverty,"" July 16, 2015, accessed Feb. 11, 2016', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/08/bernie-s/sanders-child-poverty-higher-america-any-other-maj/'), ('UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre (2012), ""Measuring Child Poverty: New league tables of child poverty in the world’s rich countries,"" Innocenti Report Card 10', 'No link'), ('UNICEF Office of Research (2014).

Did Bernie Sanders call President Barack Obama 'weak' and 'a disappointment'?
","In one of the more heated exchanges of the Democratic presidential debate in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton accused Bernie Sanders of having shown too little loyalty to President Barack Obama. Clinton said, ""In the past, (Sanders) has called (Obama) weak. He’s called him a disappointment."" For emphasis, she later repeated the charge that Sanders had used the words ""weak"" and ""disappointment."" But did he? We found lots of examples of Sanders prodding Obama to take a more aggressively liberal approach to governing, and we have previously found some truth to the charge that Sanders had tried to find someone to challenge Obama in a primary when he was running for a second term in 2012. But the specific charge Clinton made -- that Sanders used the words ""weak"" and ""disappointment""  -- were at best exaggerated. We found two examples when Sanders used one or both of those words, both of which are murkier than Clinton lets on. One is an interview Sanders gave broadcaster Thom Hartmann on July 22, 2011. Sanders lamented that Obama, in his view, had moved too far to the right politically. But while Sanders used the words Clinton cited, he didn’t say that he himself felt that way. Specifically, Sanders said, ""I think there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president, who cannot believe how weak he has been — for whatever reason — in negotiating with Republicans. And there’s deep disappointment."" Note Sanders’ language: He says ""millions of Americans"" feel that way, not that he did so himself. It’s a small difference, but we think a significant one given the forcefulness of Clinton’s attack line. The other example we found came on Nov. 13, 2011, when Politico reported that Sanders would not say whether he would support Obama for re-election (though he ultimately did). The Politico article quoted Sanders saying that Obama should ""stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it’s a little bit early in the process."" Here, Sanders said Obama had reached weak agreements with his political adversaries, not that Obama himself was personally weak. Once again, this is more nuanced than Clinton’s assertion made it out to be. We should note that Sanders has used other words to distance himself from Obama’s policies and approach to governing. For instance, in July 2015, Sanders told Jim Tankersley, a writer for the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, ""In many respects, the president was not strong enough on many issues. For example, he’s wrong on the trade issue, dead wrong. Also, the president made a mistake, that after his brilliant campaign of 2008, he essentially said to his most motivated supporters, thanks very much for electing me, but I’ll go from here on my own. I’ll sit down and negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell, and I really don’t need you anymore. Terrible mistake. Because the only way forward, to bring forth a progressive agenda, is to have the American people mobilized."" This is certainly a critical assessment of Obama’s tenure, but it doesn’t include the words ""weak"" or ""disappointment."" Our ruling Clinton said Sanders has called Obama ""weak. He's called him a disappointment.""   Sanders has critiqued Obama and used those words to describe the feelings of Americans, or to describe Obama’s policies. But Sanders did not specifically call Obama ""weak"" and ""a disappointment.""

Sanders: African-Americans lost half their wealth because of Wall Street collapse
","Sen. Bernie Sanders says by addressing economic inequality, he would also correct racial injustices. Sanders railed against Wall Street in his response to a question about race relations in the Feb. 11 Democratic debate in Milwaukee, Wis. ""Turns out that the African-American community and Latino community were hit especially hard,"" Sanders said. ""As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse."" That claim stood out to us. Is it true that black wealth was slashed so dramatically as a result of the financial crisis? Sanders understood correctly. His campaign referred us to a 2013 report from the National Association of Real Estate Brokers. ""According to the report, African-Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling homeownership rates and loss of jobs,"" it reads. The report refers to Pew Research Center data from 2011 that shows the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from $12,124 in 2005 to $5,677 in 2009. Technically, this loss fits the timeline of the housing crisis in 2006. A 2014 Pew report more closely follows the financial crisis of 2007. According to that report, median net worth of the black household decreased from $19,200 in 2007 to $11,000 in 2013 (in 2013 dollars). That’s a loss of 43 percent. Of course, the two economic crises are intertwined, and both Pew reports note that the housing bubble and the recession that followed ""took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites."" Here’s a chart from the Pew Center that demonstrates this:  Census Bureau data corroborates, if not magnifies, this point: Black median net worth decreased 61 percent from 2005 to 2009. Whites, in contrast, lost 21 percent of their wealth. Our ruling Sanders said, ""The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse."" Estimates for how much wealth blacks lost from 2005 to 2009 — as a result of the housing bubble — range from 53 percent to 61 percent. African-American net worth plummeted 43 percent from 2007 to 2013 — as a result of the financial crisis. Because the two financial crises are inseparable, we won’t quibble with Sanders’ timeline.

Americans really haven't had a raise in 15 years, as Hillary Clinton says
","During her opening statement at the Democratic presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis., Hillary Clinton tried to channel the frustration that has led many voters to consider backing her opponent, Bernie Sanders. ""I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy, and for good cause,"" Clinton said. ""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years."" Many individual American households have seen their incomes rise since the turn of the century. But we’ll take a look at the most basic measure of how well Americans more generally are doing income-wise -- namely, median household income, adjusted for inflation. As shown in the following graph from the Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, inflation-adjusted median household income generally rose between 1984 and 1999, then began falling starting in 1999 and 2000.  Specifically, median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose from $48,664 in 1984 to $57,843 in 1999 -- a 19 percent increase over 15 years. Then, over the next 15 years it fell to $53,657, a decline of 7 percent. So by this measure, Clinton is correct. Other statistics are somewhat less clear-cut. Consider the median usual weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 and over. Here’s the St. Louis Fed’s graph for that statistic:  Using this measure, wages are up slightly since 2000. That’s a raise, but it’s a pretty modest one of 2 percent over the past 15 years. That compares to a 6 percent increase between 1984 and 2000. In one sense, wages are a reasonable yardstick to use in judging Clinton’s claim, since this statistic focuses on people who are employed full-time on a wage and salary basis -- the very kind of people who would be in line to ""get a raise"" if employers were so inclined. On the other hand, median household income is the broadest measure of income growth. Many households either see a share of their income in government transfer payments, such as Social Security, or from investments, rather than wages or salaries, and this income is not reflected in the the second statistic we looked at. Because median household income encompasses a wider range of income sources, it’s reasonable for Clinton to base her statement on that measurement. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years."" Using inflation-adjusted median household income, she’s right. There has actually been a decline of 7 percent over that period. However, earnings of wage and salary workers have risen over that period -- by about 2 percent. That’s a tepid increase. But, it is an increase. On balance, we rate Clinton’s statement Mostly True.","[('Hillary Clinton, remarks during the Democratic presidential debate in Milwaukee, Feb. 11, 2015', 'https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MEHOINUSA672N'), ('Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, ""Real Median Household Income in the United States,"" accessed Feb. 11, 2016', 'No link'), ('Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis, ""Employed full time: Median usual weekly real earnings: Wage and salary workers: 16 years and over,"" accessed Feb. 11, 2016', 'https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LEU0252881600A'), ('PolitiFact, ""Economy is \'too weak to raise income levels,\' says Nikki Haley in State of the Union response,"" Jan. 12, 2016', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/12/hillary-clinton/debate-hillary-clinton-says-americans-havent-had-r/

Bernie Sanders has the correct diagnosis: U.S. prescription drug prices typically highest in world
","One theme Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly touched on during his run for the Democratic nomination for president has been the high cost of prescription drugs. His comment during the Feb. 11 Democratic debate at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee was typical as he rattled off a list of problems with the U.S. health care system: ""In America, we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs."" We asked the Sanders campaign for the source of his claim. We didn't get a response. So we searched on our own. One organization that tracks such things is the International Federation of Health Plans, based in London. Their latest price report, from 2013, lists eight common drugs. Compared with England, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Canada, U.S. prices were far higher, sometimes dramatically so. Consider Nexium, the medicine widely used to treat acid reflux. A prescription that would cost $60 or less in other countries costs, on average, $215 in the United States. And that's just the average. Prices vary widely in this country: In 5 percent of the cases, the cost was $395. ""What Bernie says is true. There's nowhere that pays the same price as America,"" said Tom Sackville, the federation's CEO. In addition, ""there is this huge variation in price across America. Anything above the average is quite unjustified. When you get up to the 95th percentile, you're talking grand robbery."" The findings were similar in an April 2013 study published in the journal Health Affairs, which looked at the prices of brand name drugs in the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada and Australia. In each of the three years studied -- 2005, 2007 and 2010 -- U.S. prices were consistently higher. The one exception: Switzerland. In addition, researchers found that, between 2005 and 2010, ""the gap between the United States and other countries seemed to widen."" And it wasn't just new drugs being embraced first in the United States that was driving up costs. They concluded that ""prices for older products rose faster in the United States than in other countries."" But Joel Farley of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Eshelman School of Pharmacy cautioned that the rule doesn't always apply to generic drugs. A 2008 comparison of 19 generic drugs found that some U.S. prices were lower than Canadian prices. ""In some cases it has to do with availability,"" he said. In other cases, a country may set the drug price low and in that fixed-price market ""there's no incentive to go lower."" The Wall Street Journal published an analysis in December that concluded 98 percent of 40 top branded drugs were more expensive in the United States than in England. In Norway, 93 percent of the 40 top branded drugs cost less than in the United States. And in Ontario, a comparison of 30 drugs showed that U.S. prices were also higher for 93 percent of the products. Why are the brand name prices so much lower in other countries, and why is there so much variation in the United States? Big customers can negotiate big discounts. So the countries with socialized medicine have a lot of leverage at the negotiating table, the experts told us. In the United States, hospitals, wholesalers and insurance companies all do their own negotiations. The Veterans Administration can -- and does -- negotiate dramatically lower prices. Under Medicaid, the drug companies are required to provide their medicines at a price that's as low as it is for any of their regular customers. But Medicare has been prohibited by law from negotiating lower prices since 2006, and that's a huge chunk of the U.S. health care industry. (When Barack Obama was first running for president, he promised to repeal that Bush-era restriction, but then backed off in an attempt to get passage of the Affordable Care Act.) The pharmaceutical industry says it needs the extra income to pay for research to keep new, desperately needed drugs coming. But with everyone getting a bargain, Americans are financing that research for the rest of the world, experts told us. Yet there's another way to look at the issue, said Amitava Dasgupta, a clinical toxicologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The tablet that costs a dollar in the United States may only cost 20 cents in India, but that drug is far more expensive to the average person in India because their income is so much lower. ""The U.S. subsidizes research for the world,"" he said. ""But I would look at that as philanthropy."" Our ruling Sanders said, ""In America, we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs."" When it comes to brand-name drugs, which yield the highest profit for the pharmaceutical industry, studies support Sanders' claim -- although not always on a drug-by-drug basis. In addition, the differences in price can be dramatic because the U.S. health care system is so splintered, and Medicare is prohibited by law from using its market share to bargain for lower prices. We found one study comparing the United States and Canada that found exceptions for generic drugs, where the profit margin is much lower and which make up a much smaller share of prescription drug spending. But on balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.","[('The Washington Post, ""Transcript: The Democratic debate in Milwaukee, annotated,"" Feb. 11, 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/debates/schedule/'), ('International Federal of Health Plans, ""2013 Comparative Price Report,"" accessed Feb. 11, 2016', 'No link'), ('Interview, Tom Sackville, CEO, International Federal of Health Plans, Feb. 11, 2016', 'https://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/534fca02e4b05a88e5fbab7f/1397737986657/2013+iFHP+FINAL+4+14+14.pdf'), ('Health Affairs, ""Higher US Branded Drug Prices And Spending Compared To Other Countries May Stem Partly From Quick Uptake of New Drugs,"" April 2013, accessed Feb. 11, 2016', 'No link'), (""Interview, Joel F.

Donald Trump repeats Pants on Fire claim that unemployment rate could be 42 percent
","During his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump repeated a claim he’d made several times before. ""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,"" Trump said. ""The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent."" Actually, Trump’s the one who shouldn’t be believed. Numbers that high are not even close to accurate. To understand why, let’s start by discussing how the official unemployment rate is calculated. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don’t work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population. During the most recent month -- January 2016 -- the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent, its lowest level since February 2008. Not factored into this calculation, however, are people who are not currently looking for work. This is a longstanding concern for economists, because at least some of those people who aren’t looking for work right now might prefer to be looking for work but don’t feel they have a shot in the current job market. To ease such concerns, the bureau also produces a statistic with a more expansive definition of what it calls ""labor underutilization."" This statistic is known by the wonky shorthand ""U-6."" The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially ""unemployed"" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are ""marginally attached"" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force. Currently the U-6 rate is 9.9 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. But that’s also its lowest level since May 2008. It’s possible to argue that the U-6 rate offers a fairer way of encapsulating the unemployment picture; some mainstream economists are sympathetic to that argument. But where Trump goes off the rails is in suggesting that the ""real"" unemployment rate is somewhere between 28 percent and 42 percent. Why? He’s including a ton of Americans not expected to be working. Let’s explore this point further. The source of Trump’s 42 percent figure appears to be a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s budget director. Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a ""plausible measure of the potential workforce."" If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you run the numbers, ""the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent,"" Stockman wrote. Economists say Stockman’s way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws. Indeed, in his column, Stockman acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so. ""Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers,"" he wrote. ""We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else."" Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial. Stockman’s calculation ""treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ""A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker’s decision not to work or look for paid work at all."" In other words, Trump’s faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced. So is there a plausible calculation that can get us to 42 percent? The short answer is no. To see why, let’s start with the number of Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. That gives us 94 million ""non-working"" Americans. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. • People age 16 to 19 who are not in the labor force: Subtract 10.8 million • People age 65 and up who are not in the labor force: Subtract 38.4 million • Students, age 20-24: Subtract 8.7 million • Students, age 25-29: Subtract 2.9 million • Students, age 30-34: Subtract 1.4 million • Stay-at-home moms: Subtract 10.4 million • Stay at-home dads: Subtract 2 million • Those receiving disability checks: Subtract 8.9 million So what remains? By this calculation, there are 10.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working. If you were to use these numbers to create a new type of ""unemployment"" rate -- call it ""U-7"" if you like -- it would come out to 15.6 percent. That’s higher than the U-6 rate of 9.9 percent, but it’s only a fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed. This isn’t a perfect calculation. There’s probably some double-counting, and there could be good reasons why some of those 10.5 million Americans aren’t working, such as being a full-time student between the ages of 34 and 65, undergoing job training, or being affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early. Some might argue that students shouldn’t get off so easy because they should be able to handle a job along with their studies, or that we should set a higher retirement-age cutoff than 65. Quibble with the numbers if you like, but this is a solid enough back-of-the envelope calculation to show how wildly inaccurate Trump’s claim is. And remember, we are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent. There’s even a silver lining to the current state of affairs, Burtless said. Most of those suffering from being ""out of work"" by Trump's definition can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society. The fact that millions of adults are what Trump would term ""jobless,"" he said, ""is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent."" While economists say that there are other, more expansive calculations of unemployment or under-employment, none of the official ones are currently higher than 9.9 percent, and the highest credible number we could calculate was 15.6 percent. That’s far, far lower than 42 percent -- or even 28 percent. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.","[('Donald Trump, victory speech in New Hampshire, Feb. 9, 2016', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/09/the-anatomy-of-a-donald-trump-victory-speech/'), ('David Stockman, ""The Warren Buffett Economy——Why Its Days Are Numbered (Part 4),"" June 15, 2015', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey"" (main index page), accessed Sept. 29, 2015', 'http://davidstockmanscontracorner.com/the-warren-buffett-economy-why-its-days-are-numbered-part-4/'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex for the United States, States, Counties, and Puerto Rico Commonwealth and Municipios: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014,"" accessed Sept. 29, 2015', 'No link'), ('Social Security Administration, ""Selected Data from Social Security\'s Disability Program,"" accessed Sept. 29, 2015', 'http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ln'), ('National Center for Education Statistics, ""Table 103.20: Percentage of the population 3 to 34 years old enrolled in school, by age group: Selected years, 1940 through 2013,"" accessed Sept. 29, 2015', 'No link'), ('Washington Post\xa0Fact Checker, ""Trump’s absurd claim that the ‘real’ unemployment rate is 42 percent,"" Aug. 21, 2015', 'http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk'), ('Email interview with Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economist and chief economist for Indeed, Feb, 11, 2016', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Gary Burtless, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Sept. 29, 2015', 'https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/dibStat.html')]",/factchecks/2016/feb/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-pants-fire-claim-unemployment/

New gaming compact offers Florida biggest guaranteed share of any state, Seminoles say
","The Seminole Tribe of Florida is trying to convince the Legislature that approving a new gaming compact is a safe bet. As lawmakers consider a plan negotiated between the Seminoles and Gov. Rick Scott, the tribe has started running commercials with the message that the agreement helps the state. One of the ads ticks off several benefits of the deal Scott has touted to the Legislature, which has been reluctant to agree to the compact. ""The governor authorized a new and unprecedented Seminole compact: Nearly 20,000 new Florida jobs; $3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history; and for the first time, empowering the Legislature to limit expansion to keep Florida's entertainment options family friendly,"" the commercial said. That’s a lot to pack into one 30-second spot. PolitiFact Florida was especially curious about the $3 billion in payments the tribe promised the state. Is it really the most any state has received from Indian gaming in history? It looks like the odds are in the tribe’s favor. Reaching an agreement This is a very convoluted subject, but here’s a quick-start look at the issue: Since 1988, the U.S. government has allowed federally recognized Indian tribes to run gambling establishments on tribal land. But if a tribe wants to have certain Las Vegas-style games at its casino known as Class III games (blackjack, roulette, slot machines and so forth), it must reach a legal agreement with its state, called a compact. The Seminole tribe reached a deal with then-Gov. Charlie Crist in 2010 that allowed them to operate banked card games — games in which players bet against the house instead of each other — at five of its seven casinos across the state. The Seminoles agreed to pay Florida for exclusive rights to operate these games, plus slot machines at four casinos outside Miami-Dade and Broward counties. These revenues usually amounted to well over $200 million per year for the state. The compact expired in July 2015, with a renewal deadline of Oct. 31, 2015. There hasn’t been a new agreement, leading to lawsuits between Florida and the Seminoles over who can operate these games. The tribe continues to operate the Class III games of blackjack, chemin de fer and baccarat at those five casinos without a compact. In December 2015, Scott announced he had formed a new compact with the Seminoles. Among the details in the 20-year deal is a promise that the tribe could expand craps and roulette at their casinos and offer blackjack exclusively for seven years. The tribe would guarantee a minimum of $3 billion in payments to the state over those seven years. The Legislature is considering approving the compact during the 2016 session. On Feb. 9, the House Regulatory Affairs Committee okayed a bill to ratify the compact, but the Senate delayed its vote. Is that $3 billion in guaranteed revenue to Florida the most any state has ever gotten, as the Seminoles’ commercial says? It’s the ""guaranteed"" part that tips the tribe’s hand. Comparing compacts Dozens of Indian tribes have gaming compacts in 26 states, and the details differ not only among states, but among tribes in a given state. While tribes can reach agreements to share revenue with local governments and pay regulatory costs, we’re just looking at how much states get. Comparing these compacts is a tall order. Given the nature of the industry, casinos are always opening and closing, contract terms are being updated or changed, and the terms of the payments tribes give differ depending on the compact. That’s especially true when considering states like Connecticut, which receives a lot of money but bases compact payments on a percentage of casino earnings, or Washington, which negotiated compacts so money goes to local governments instead of the state. The Seminoles currently pay the state quite a bit for a single tribe, which we can illustrate with overall earnings and revenue-sharing figures. In California, for example, tribal casinos make about $7 billion per year, highest in the nation. Of that, they give about $241 million to the state in 2014. (The state had compacts with 73 tribes in 2014, but only 11 of those tribes paid into the general revenue fund.) Tribes in Oklahoma, which generated $3.8 billion in gaming revenues from 124 casinos, paid the state about $125 million in 2013. Florida is in third place for total gaming revenues, with more than $2.3 billion from eight casinos. The Seminoles operate seven of those to make the lion’s share of the revenue, and as we mentioned, more than $200 million of those revenues go to the state annually. (The Miccosukee tribe, which operates an eighth casino in the Miami area, does not need a compact based on the games it offers.) Robert Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, said the Seminoles can afford to give the state so much because they enjoy several distinct advantages tribes in other states do not. The Seminoles live on land close to population centers, like the Hard Rock casinos in Tampa and Hollywood. They also don’t have to fight with other tribes for customers. It doesn’t hurt that this is Florida, where tourists flock and bring gambling money with them. These factors affect how the Seminoles have negotiated with the state. The new Seminole compact offers the guaranteed $3 billion in rising increments, from $325 million the first year up to $550 million in the seventh year. There are other provisions and potential payments in the compact, but that $3 billion is money the tribe has promised to pay no matter what. Even though apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult, by that final year the Seminoles would be paying more than the total any other single state gets from all its tribes. The Seminoles are willing to pay out a lot more than other tribes, Jarvis said, because they want exclusivity in a market that the Legislature could open up to other casino developers. ""The real question here is not the money, which in a budget as big as Florida’s really amounts to a rounding error,"" he said. ""It’s about expanding gambling in Florida. And if you’re for that, the question becomes, who do you want to run the casinos, the Seminoles or someone else?"" Our ruling The Seminole Tribe of Florida said their new gambling compact offers ""$3 billion in guaranteed revenue, the largest share for any state in history."" The tribe's point about guaranteed compensation over seven years holds up when focused on total dollars. But there's no easy way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of the details between various states and their gaming compacts. Some states have compacts with many other tribes. Some deals call for tribes to split a portion of revenues only with local governments. The takeaway from the ad is Florida is getting the best financial deal of any state in the country, but the finer points aren't clear. We're going to hedge our bets and rate the statement Mostly True.","[('YouTube, ""Letter,"" Jan. 7, 2016', 'https://youtu.be/6trsrsDedQY'), ('Forbes, ""Native American Casino And Tax Rules That May Surprise You,"" Oct. 11, 2012', 'No link'), ('RubinBrown LLP, ""Commercial and Tribal Gaming Stats 2014,"" April 2014', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2012/10/11/native-american-casino-and-tax-rules-that-may-surprise-you/#2a33d28011fe'), ('South Florida Sun Sentinel, ""Gambling’s value to Florida debated,"" Dec. 9, 2014', 'No link'), ('The Oklahoman, ""Oklahoma Indian gaming revenues rise while fees to state drop,"" March 30, 2015', 'http://www.rubinbrown.com/RubinBrown_2014_Gaming_Stats.pdf'), ('Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research, ""Gaming: Revenue Overview,"" March 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('Las Vegas Review-Journal, ""Report: Indian gaming revenue hits record $28.3 billion in 2013,"" March 30, 2015', 'http://www.sun-sentinel.com/business/consumer/fl-american-gaming-florida-impact-20141209-story.html'), ('Casino City Press, ""Indian Gaming Industry Report 2015 (Executive Summary),"" March 2015', 'No link'), ('Native Times, ""Oklahoma Indian gaming revenues rise while state fees fall,"" April 1, 2015', 'http://newsok.com/article/5405979'), ('State of Washington, ""The Colville Indian Tribe Opens New Casino,"" July 30, 2015', 'No link'), ('Arizona Republic, ""How tribal gaming impacts Arizona’s economy: 15K jobs, $1.81 billion,"" Oct. 8, 2015', 'http://edr.state.fl.us/Content/presentations/gaming/GamingRevenueOveriew_3-26-15.pdf'), ('Sacramento Bee, ""California’s share of Indian gambling money dwindles,"" Sept. 6, 2015', 'No link'), ('Tampa Tribune, ""Seminole tribe sues Florida in midst of talks over gaming pact,"" Oct. 26, 2015', 'http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/report-indian-gaming-revenue-hits-record-283-billion-2013'), ('Tampa Bay Times Buzz blog, ""Despite deadline, Seminole Tribe keeps dealing black jack -- as state predicted in 2012,"" Oct. 31, 2015', 'No link'), ('Indian Country, ""California Indian Gaming Reaches $7 Billion Again,"" Oct. 31, 2015', 'http://www.casinocitypress.com/indiangaming/indiangamingreport/'), ('Tampa Bay Times Buzz blog, ""Seminole Tribe airing ads calling for new gaming compact,"" Nov. 5, 2015', 'No link'), ('Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research, ""Revenue Estimating Conference Indian Gaming Revenues Executive Summary,"" Dec. 2, 2015', 'http://www.nativetimes.com/index.php/business/gaming/11350-oklahoma-indian-gaming-revenues-rise-while-state-fees-fall'), ('Miami Herald, ""Deal: Florida Gov.
