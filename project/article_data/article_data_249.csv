Sen. George Barker says uncompensated care has fallen 30 percent in states that expanded Medicaid
","Virginia Democrats believe they have found evidence showing states that expand their Medicaid rolls are better off than those that reject expansion. Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, told those gathered for an expansion rally in Woodbridge that hospitals in Medicaid expansion states have fewer patients who can’t pay. ""Those states who have adopted Medicaid expansion, and half of the states have -- what they have seen just in the first few months of this calendar year, 2014 – is a reduction in uncompensated care,"" he said. ""That means people who show up at the hospital, show up at the emergency department, are uninsured and can’t pay anything – charity care that’s provided by the hospital – that’s gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months."" This seems to be an important point for their case, so we wondered about the origin of the figure. First, let’s remember how we got here. The Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next two years, that slowly declines to 90 percent with state’s picking up the remaining cost.Virginia has estimated that as many as 400,000 state residents could join Medicaid’s rolls. The Republican-controlled House of Delegates refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. That led to a months-long stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate on the state’s two-year budget.  Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, who earned a Promise Broken by signing a budget that did not include expansion, is exploring whether he can broaden the program without the consent of the legislature. Uncompensated care is a key reason Virginia hospitals have pleaded with legislators to expand Medicaid. Across the country, uncompensated care totaled $45.9 billion in 2012, the most recent year for which data was available, according to the American Hospital Association. It was 6.1 percent of hospitals’ expenses that year. When we asked Barker about his claim, he sent us a link to an article from Governing magazine. The article cites a study from the Colorado Hospital Association that looked at 30 states, 15 with Medicaid expansion and 15 without. In the states with expansion, hospitals had charity care decreases from an average of $2.8 million per hospital in the first quarter of 2013 to $1.9 million per hospital in the first quarter of 2014, a 32 percent drop. And out-of-pocket charges decreased from 4.7 percent of all charges to 3.1 percent of all charges -- a 34 percent drop. Meanwhile, Medicaid charges surged from 15.3 percent to 18.8 percent, a 19 percent jump. While the survey covered a short period of time, the difference between hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion and those without was stark. States that balked at Medicaid expansion saw little change in their uncompensated care levels, the study found. Governing also linked to Arkansas Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe’s May 31 column in which he stated 42 hospitals in the state reported an average of 30 percent decline in uncompensated care. For emergency room visits, the hospitals had an average of 24 percent drop in uncompensated care. Beebe said the survey ""was not comprehensive for every acute-care center in the state, but it’s a good snapshot of early progress."" Tenet Health, a publicly traded company with 80 hospitals in 14 states, reported that its hospitals in four states that expanded Medicaid saw a 33 percent decline in uninsured and charity admissions in the first quarter this year. In the second quarter, which ended in June, the numbers improved even more. With hospitals in five states that expanded Medicaid, the company had a decline in uninsured and charity admissions of 54 percent. Meanwhile, Medicaid admissions increased 23 percent. We also found an Arizona Daily Star article reporting on a survey of hospitals in the state done by the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association. In the first four months of 2014, the association’s hospitals reported a 31 percent drop in uncompensated care expenses compared to the same period in 2013.  So this seems to be a broader trend. This is how the law was intended to work, said Gayle Nelson, director of hospital community benefit program at The Hilltop Institute, part of University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ""This was all part and parcel of the same anticipation that this would happen,"" she said. ""The need for uncompensated care would reduce and the funds needed to address uncompensated care would also be reduced … This is good news. Of course, in those states where uncompensated care is reduced, that presumably leaves some resources freed up to be used in other ways."" The Governing article said the trend was positive, but hospitals are hoping it’s enough to offset cuts called for in the Affordable Care Act. The biggest piece of this will be $39 billion in cuts to the Disproportionate Share Hospital program, which helps hospitals that serve the poor. In Virginia, this primarily means the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University hospitals. Our ruling Barker said hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion have already benefited from a 30 percent drop in uncompensated care. The evidence is based on the first three months after Medicaid expansion took effect and from a few sources. It’s early, but he accurately reported the results. The statement is True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/10/george-barker/sen-george-barker-says-uncompensated-care-has-fall/

Duey Stroebel says compromise vote by opponents cost $788 million
","Republicans running for Congress in east-central Wisconsin are competing for the title of most uncompromising conservative. Take candidate Duey Stroebel’s attack on fellow state lawmakers Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham in the hotly contested Aug. 12. 2014 GOP primary. The online ad features Grothman explaining, during a candidate forum, a vote he cast in the state Senate that required utilities to sell more electricity generated from wind and other technologies. ""There was a bad mandate in the state of Wisconsin,"" Grothman says in the clip.  ""Sometimes when you’re  in Madison you’re stuck with taking a compromise vote."" A snarky-sounding narrator jumps in: ""Compromise? A compromise vote that cost $788 million? If career politicians Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham are willing to compromise on conservative principles in Madison, what would they compromise on in Washington?"" Did Grothman and Leibham, both state senators, support a change that cost consumers $788 million? In 2006, both voted for a bill requiring electric providers to increase the amount of renewable electricity they sell by two percentage points above their current level by 2010, and by six percentage points above their current level by 2015. The legislation established a statewide goal that 10 percent of all electricity sales in Wisconsin be from renewable resources by 2015. That goal was met in 2013, two years early, the state Public Service Commission announced. (Legislative records show that in 1998 Grothman voted for the original mandate, which set a 2.2 percent goal. Leibham was not yet in the Legislature. Stroebel, a state representative, was elected in 2011.) So, no doubt about their votes. Was the 2006 vote a compromise? The vote on the measure came at a time when Republicans controlled the Legislature, but Democrat Jim Doyle was in the governor’s chair. A Republican sponsor, state Sen. Robert Cowles of Green Bay, credited passage  to compromises made by utilities and manufacturers to customer and environmental groups. A combination of high energy prices, the improvement of wind- and solar-power technologies and political will helped, he said at the time, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories. Grothman says the vote prevented a mandate that would have been set at higher than 10 percent, but Renew Wisconsin policy director Michael Vickerman recalls that no higher number was on the table. The measure passed 32-1 in the state Senate (and unanimously in the Assembly). State Sen. Tom Reynolds, R- West Allis, cast the lone no vote, saying the legislation would drive up energy bills. Cowles countered it would lead to $2 billion in investments from energy companies that would drive down the cost of producing renewable energy. In 2012, Grothman appeared to sour on the mandate, saying he wanted to freeze it at 2012 levels because windmills had become controversial among residents in his district. What about the price tag? To back up the $788 million figure, the Stroebel ad cites a March 2013 study released by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative-oriented think tank. With some Democrats proposing a 25 percent requirement, WPRI said it was timely to study what it calls the ""often forgotten"" costs of using more renewable energy. To do the research, WPRI turned to The Beacon Hill Institute, a Boston-based research group interested in limited government. It tangled with environmental groups in Wisconsin in 2009 after criticizing the cost of efforts to fight climate change. The Beacon study did not tally the actual cost to that point to consumers of the renewable mandate. Instead, it used forecasting techniques and various assumptions to predict what the mandate would cost in the four years from 2013 to 2016. The conclusion: $788 million. Paul Bachman, Beacon Hill’s research director and co-author of the study, told PolitiFact Wisconsin the number could be smaller than $788 million because after the study was completed, the state announced that utilities had reached the 10 percent goal earlier than expected. The Beacon study had assumed renewable energy sales would continue to increase as the 2015 deadline approached. The state Public Service Commission in 2014 commented on the impact of that 10 percent goal being met early. ""A solid argument could be made that any additional renewable energy added to electric provider portfolios past 2013 will not be driven by (the state mandate),"" the agency said. The impact of the mandate should level off or perhaps even decrease at some point, the PSC said. So the $788 million, just a projection to begin with, may well turn out to be high. But that and other numbers in the study appear to be in the ballpark, at least, based on the state Public Service Commission’s studies of actual costs that have been incurred so far. Actual costs studied The PSC’s own studies look backward in time at the costs of the renewables mandate. The cost of the mandate was $532 million over the five years from 2008 through 2012, the agency has calculated, said Andrew Kell, an analyst in the PSC’s division of regional energy markets. In 2012 alone it was about $184 million. One last issue. The ad’s shorthand phrasing -- ""compromise vote that cost $788 million"" -- could suggest that the legislation already has cost $788 million. But even if we consider just the actual costs so far, the $788 million figure might be on target. Why? Because the mandate’s been in place since 1998 -- 15 years. Considering that the $532 million figure covers just 5 years, it’s reasonable to assume the 15-year total is higher. Our rating Stroebel’s ad says Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a ""compromise vote that cost $788 million"" in higher electricity costs. They cast that vote, and higher costs have followed. The claim needs some clarification, though, because of the many factors involved in determining the actual cost and whether the claim, as stated, referred to past or future costs. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/10/duey-stroebel/stroebel-says-compromise-vote-opponents-cost-788-m/

R.I. congressional candidate Cormick Lynch says education costs have risen 1,200 percent since 1978
","Cormick Lynch, a Republican running to replace Democrat U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, is concerned about the cost of education. During a debate with his GOP challenger, Stan Tran, on the WPRI Newsmakers program that aired Aug. 3, Lynch complained that college tuition and fees have gone through the roof over the past 36 years. ""College education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978,"" he said. ""This isn't your parents' college education. Students -- young students -- are issuing outrageous amounts of debt to go to college and get a degree, and the only thing the schools are guaranteeing them after that is a bill."" Lynch said the injection of federal money is one of the reasons the costs have gone up so much. ""Education costs should not increase more than the rate of inflation.""  Critics have long argued that escalating government loan problems have pushed college costs higher and higher. A 1,200 percent increase means the cost of education is 13 times higher than in 1978. That sounded high to us, so we thought we'd check his statistic. Lynch said he based the number on an April 23, 2013 article on the business website fastcoexist.com, where it says -- in a story and in a graphic -- that since 1979, public and private college costs have increased 1,120 percent. It's based on a report by Bloomberg and Business Week. Lynch then added 33 percent a year for 2013 and 2014 and rounded it up to 1,200 percent. We confirmed the trend -- and got more up-to-date numbers -- by going to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It shows a 1,172 percent increase from July 1978 to June 2014, which rounds up to the amount cited by Lynch. Lynch's problem: His statement doesn’t account for inflation, which increased the cost of things we buy -- from a dozen eggs to a college education -- by 265 percent from 1979 to 2012. We confirmed the numbers by turning to data from National Center for Education Statistics, which looks at costs a bit differently using dollar amounts from the schools as far back as the 1963-64 school year. The latest statistics cover the 2012-13 school year and look at costs with and without inflation. Without inflation, the typical price tag for tuition and fees for the 1977-78 school year was $984.  It was $10,683 for the 2012-13 school year -- a 985 percent increase. But when changes in the cost of living are taken into consideration, the typical $984 college bill for 1977-78 would now be about $3,636. Then the average bill for the 2012-13 school year ($10,683) would be 194 percent higher, not 1,200 percent. The inflation-adjusted increases were 147 percent for private or nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, 234 percent for public four-year institutions and 147 percent for public two-year colleges. Point of interest: At URI, tuition and fees for in-state students totaled $924 for the 1977-78 school year. The total for 2012-13 was $12,450, an increase of 277 percent if you adjust for inflation and 1,247 percent if you don't. Our ruling Cormick Lynch said the cost of ""college education has gone up 1,200 percent since 1978."" He should have made it clear that he wasn't adjusting for inflation. His statement is only close to true if the median household income had remained at $15,000 per year (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) and a loaf of bread was still 54 cents (as it was in 1978, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). If you adjust those tuition numbers for the rising cost of living, Lynch's percentage is six times too high. The statement is accurate in the sense that college cost have increased many times faster than the cost of other things we buy. But it fails to account for inflation -- an important omission -- that would put the comparison in context. We rate it Half True.

Wendy Davis claim about hiring of salesman-rapist lacks clarification
","In an ominous tone, the narrator of a TV commercial from Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis accuses Attorney General Greg Abbott, her Republican opponent, of siding with a vacuum cleaner manufacturer against a woman raped by a salesman in her home. In the 60-second ad, made public by Davis’ campaign on Aug. 7, 2014, the narrator says a door-to-door salesman offering a woman a vacuum cleaner demonstration in her Seguin home in March 1993 but then raped her as her children slept in the next room. ""The salesman was a sexual predator on probation,"" the narrator says, ""but the Kirby vacuum cleaner distributor had failed to perform a routine background check on him."" ""The woman and her husband went all the way to the Texas Supreme Court,"" the narrator says, ""fighting for their right to sue Kirby. Six judges -- Democrats and Republicans -- ruled in their favor and they won,"" he says. ""But Greg Abbott sided with the company against the victim. Saying the company had no responsibility."" The words ""Kirby owed no duty"" appear on the screen, attributed to Abbott, a justice on the court from 1995 until 2001. A Davis campaign press release announcing the ad cited rulings issued in 1998, including the state Supreme Court’s 6-3 majority opinion and a dissent from Abbott. Campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas also emailed us a web link to a Jan. 1, 1999, Associated Press news story stating the court at that time said the Kirby Company should have required its vacuum cleaner distributor to do a background check before hiring salesman Mickey Carter, which would have revealed previous complaints of sexual misconduct.         In the Dec. 31, 1998, majority opinion written by Justice Raul Gonzalez, the court agreed with the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals that a mandate by Kirby, the manufacturer, that its vacuum cleaners be sold only through home demonstrations gave the company a role to play in who got hired to do door-to-door sales even though a company agreement with its distributors said otherwise. ""We hold that the company does owe such a duty,"" the court said. Specifically, the court said that ""because Kirby required in-home demonstrations, the company exercised sufficient control over the sale of its products to end-users to justify imposing a duty of reasonable care in selecting the persons who performed the demonstrations."" Kirby had argued its arrangements with vacuum cleaner distributors explicitly said the company shall exercise no control over the selection of individual salespeople. Kirby’s contracts specified: ""The full cost and responsibility for recruiting, hiring, firing, terminating and compensating independent contractors and employees of distributor shall be borne by distributor."" Abbott’s dissent to the court’s ruling, joined by Justice Priscilla Owen, said Kirby retained control over where the sales work was to be performed -- but not over who was to do that work. ""Failure to require background checks of potential dealers relates to who is a dealer, not where the dealer works,"" Abbott wrote. ""As a result, the requisite relation between the control retained and the alleged injury is missing. Because the Court holds to the contrary, I dissent."" Abbott summed up: ""In essence, the Court rewrites Kirby’s Distributor Agreement and Independent Dealer Agreement to require Kirby to assume control over dealer selection. Because the injury is not related to the control retained by Kirby,"" Abbott closed, ""...Kirby owed no duty to"" the woman  ""under the circumstances of this case."" Our emails to the Abbott campaign did not yield responses, but Amelia Chasse of his campaign said in a statement sent to reporters including the Austin American-Statesman’s Jonathan Tilove that Abbott’s dissent still ""left intact the liability against the sex offender and his employer."" That is, the question in the Supreme Court case concerned only Kirby’s responsibility and did not affect the liability of anyone else in the case. A search of the Nexis database of news stories led us to a news story in the April 20, 2001, Dallas Morning News mentioning the dissent and generally quoting Abbott as saying: ""What I was doing as a judge was applying the law."" Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Abbott held that a company whose vacuum cleaners were sold door to door ""had no responsibility"" in the hiring of a salesman who raped a customer in her home. Then-Justice Abbott said the manufacturer had no duty, to be precise. But this claim fails to include the substantive detail that Abbott, unlike the court majority, considered most significant an existing agreement between the manufacturer and distributors explicitly giving full responsibility for such hirings to the distributors who, Abbott implied, had control over checking the background of applicants.

Does Rio Grande Valley have less crime than major Texas cities? Depends on the crime
","A South Texas state senator objected to Gov. Rick Perry’s plans to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border by suggesting crime in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley isn’t as bad as in other parts of the state. In a July 21, 2014, press release, Juan ""Chuy"" Hinojosa, D-McAllen, said the ""humanitarian crisis"" reflected in Central Americans crossing the Rio Grande ""needs to be resolved through immigration reform and working with Mexico and Central American countries to stop the flow  of immigrants coming across our border. To call up the National Guard is a very simplistic approach to a complex problem."" Besides, Hinojosa said, ""we have less crime in the Valley than we do in other major Texas cities. If we were to use crime as a basis to deploy the National Guard then we should be sending the National Guard to other metropolitan areas in our state."" Has there been less crime in the region closest to the state’s southern tip than its big cities hundreds of miles away? We’ve explored crime near the border before. In March 2010, we rated as Pants on Fire Perry’s claim that his border-security efforts led to a 60 percent decrease in border crime. His cited calculations didn’t consider crimes committed in cities and towns where most border residents live. It also compared two calendar quarters rather than weighing years of data. Later, we saw flaws in descriptions of El Paso as the nation’s safest city, partly because the FBI has counseled against using its crime research to reach comparative judgments. In this instance, we were curious about Hinojosa’s twist on the crime comparison. Asked how Hinojosa reached his conclusion, Luis Moreno, his Senate chief of staff, forwarded a July 24, 2014, email from the Texas Department of Public Safety including a chart tallying arrests in 2013 and ""to date"" in 2014 in counties including Hidalgo in the Rio Grande Valley. In 2013 and in 2014, the chart shows, Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Bexar counties each had more arrests than Hidalgo County. Nueces County, home to Corpus Christi, had the fewest arrests among the checked counties. Moreno said he did not ask DPS to convert the arrest counts to arrest rates. FBI crime figures As we launched our run at comparisons, we recognized with the help of Texas criminologists that the latest available data, as compiled by the FBI, enable comparisons only through the first half of 2013. That omits the 12 months through June 2014 — the period during which officials including Perry raised stepped-up concerns about border security in the wake of more unaccompanied children crossing the Rio Grande. That caveat in mind, we looked at different reported crimes by county and city, finding the senator’s statement held up for many -- but not all -- comparisons. We drew our figures from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, which tracks seven ""index"" crimes: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. A hedge: State officials have said these counts underreport the amount of drug-cartel-related violence by not folding in common cartel-tied offenses such as extortion and kidnapping, as the Austin American-Statesman noted in an October 2011 news story on crime in the border region. Strap in; our comparisons follow. Total reported offenses, January through June 2013 An FBI chart presents counts of reported offenses in the first half of 2013 for more than 20 Texas cities, rolling in several of the biggest cities (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin but not Fort Worth) and smaller cities including Brownsville and McAllen, key cities in the Rio Grande Valley, which consists of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr and Willacy counties. In the first half of 2013, each of the big cities had more total reported incidents of violent and property crime than the two valley cities. But that’s arguably not surprising given that Houston, Dallas and the other non-valley cities are much more populous than their valley counterparts. Adjusting for population differences To account for population differences, we focused on estimated rates of violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents. By this balancing metric, each of the sampled big cities had a higher rate of violent crime than Brownsville or McAllen in the first half of 2013. McAllen also had the lowest rate of property crime in this sampling. But the reported property-crime rate for Brownsville (2,156 per 100,000 residents) narrowly outpaced the rate for Dallas (2,137 per 100,000 residents). Crime rates, 2012 Seeking a full year’s comparison, we turned to population-adjusted rates for specific reported crimes in 2012 as broken out in an undated annual report by the DPS. Generally, the report showed, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin had more crimes per 100,000 residents than the valley cities of Brownsville and McAllen or the valley counties of Cameron, Hidalgo and Starr. But there were indications of places in the valley experiencing more crime. Rural Willacy County, population 8,355, bested all our sampled cities and counties with 108 rapes per 100,000 residents, based on its 2012 total of nine reported rapes. Based on 37 total reported assaults, the county also trailed only Houston in our sampling in its rate of aggravated assaults, and it landed third for its rate of reported burglaries. Also, Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen had higher rates of reported larceny than Houston or Dallas, according to the report. Another twist: Harlingen’s general rate of 5,279 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 3,543 total reported offenses) exceeded Dallas’ rate of 5,049 reported crimes per 100,000 residents (based on 62,680 reported offenses).

Could a minimum-wage earner in 1978 earn enough in a summer to pay a full year's tuition?
","Everything was better in the old days, apparently -- including the chore of paying for college, at least according to a social media meme sent to us recently by a reader. The meme -- created by OurTime.org, an advocacy group for young Americans -- said, ""In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice."" Really? We figured this was worth a look. First, the minimum wage. Starting on Jan. 1, 1978, the minimum wage was $2.65. Someone working at the minimum wage for 13 weeks, and 40 hours per week, in the summer of 1978 would have ended up with $1,378 for their labors. For the tuition they would have faced in the 1978-79 school year, we turned to figures from the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal government’s repository of education data. The cost of tuition and fees (in that year’s dollars, not adjusted for inflation) was $688 for in-state residents attending a four-year, public university. So the meme’s claim is correct except for a few caveats -- two minor and one more significant: • The cost of tuition and fees plus room and board was significantly higher that year -- $2,145 -- but the meme was careful to cite ""tuition"" only, so we’ll ignore the impact of room and board. • The tuition-and-fees figure we used is a national average, so some states may have had in-state tuition rates out of reach of minimum wage workers. • The meme’s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording -- specifically its use of the phrase ""of their choice."" The data we used refers to in-state tuition, meaning that the student would have access to this sweet tuition rate only at their home-state university. That’s not the same thing as ""of their choice."" Our ruling The meme said that ""in 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year's full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice."" If you use the national average the figure is correct. The only problem is the part about a university ""of their choice."" The data is correct for in-state tuition -- not for any university in the country, where out-of-state rates may well have kicked up the tuition amount beyond a summer’s minimum-wage haul. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. CORRECTION: After we published this article, a reader noticed that we had used the incorrect tuition figure from the National Center for Education Statistics chart. This version uses the correct figure. The rating remains at Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2014/aug/08/facebook-posts/1978-someone-minimum-wage-could-earn-enough-summer/

David Clarke says he's never had a budget deficit as sheriff
","With the critical Democratic primary approaching, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. is emphasizing his fiscal record over his past decade in office. Clarke will face Chris Moews, a Milwaukee Police lieutenant, for the second time in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary. In November, the winner will face independent challenger Angela Nicole Walker, who is running as a Socialist candidate. In a July 27, 2014 interview on Upfront with Mike Gousha, which airs on WISN-TV, Clarke declared: ""I’ve either balanced every budget or we’ve turned back a surplus."" A great talking point. But is Clarke right? To be sure, the county is required to balance the overall budget every year. So, to evaluate Clarke’s claim, we are looking at what happened specifically within the Office of the Sheriff's budget. And we’re looking at the final numbers for the year, which reflect actual spending. According to County Comptroller Scott Manske, it is expected that each department lives within the amount it is allocated. Most of the money comes from the property tax levy, though there are other sources of revenue, such as fees and grants. Clarke did not respond to our request for backup, so we turned to County Auditor Jerome Heer. He directed us to the county’s annual fiscal reports from 2003 to 2013. Clarke was appointed sheriff in 2002, but the first full year with his own budget was in 2003. All told, the sheriff's office will spend about $78 million this year, compared to $64 million in 2003. These are the budget surpluses and deficits the office has encountered under Clarke: 2003 -$2,393,755 2004 $1,510,200 2005 $1,363,322 2006 $442,806 2007 $1,296,949 2008 $52,338 2009 $1,380,056 2010 $1,420,322 2011 $237,127 2012 -$660,579 2013 -$217,000* So, the fiscal reports prepared by the Comptroller's office show Clarke's office actually had a deficit in three of the 11 years. The number for 2013 is an estimate, since the books have not been closed. Here is a look at the three exceptions: 2003: In Clarke’s first full-year budget, the office ran a $2,393,755 deficit, because revenue from fines, forfeitures, grants and reimbursements came in nearly $2.2 million less than expected. 2012:  The office was hit with another deficit, totaling $660,579. A $942,666 difference between budgeted and actual revenues contributed to the deficit for that year. 2013: The auditor’s office has yet to determine final surplus and deficit figures because year-end adjustments are still ""firming up,"" Heer said. In any case, Heer said he believes the office's final deficit will be between $162,000 and $217,000. Another factor to consider is Clarke’s temporary control over the House of Correction, inheriting a $5 million deficit on overtime pay when he took it over in January 2009. A court ruling unraveled his authority over the House of Correction in May 2013. Before Clarke took it over, the House of Correction was its own separate entity that oversaw a $45 million budget and includes about 500 employees. While Clarke cut the overtime spending by 70 percent in his first year, two budgets sustained deficits in 2012 and 2013. In an Aug. 1, 2014 appearance with host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM, Clarke rephrased his claim a bit: ""I have a 10-year record where I’ve balanced every budget or some of those years I’ve turned back budget surpluses. Ten consecutive years."" The numbers show it is actually eight consecutive years where the office didn’t have a deficit: Our rating Clarke said he’s balanced the budget or returned a surplus to Milwaukee County for every year since he became sheriff in 2002. But county numbers show he didn’t in 2003, 2012 and most likely won’t in 2013. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/08/david-clarke-jr/david-clarke-jr-says-hes-never-had-budget-deficit-/

Attack ad misfires on nonprofit
","Michelle Nunn’s U.S. Senate campaign recently had to own up to accidentally posting the details of its election strategy for all the world -- and the opposition -- to see. Within days, one of Nunn’s vocal critics, the conservative Ending Spending Action Fund, was on television with a 30-second ad playing off information from the leaked campaign memo. ""What does Michelle Nunn worry about most?"" the announcer asks. ""It’s not the economy, and it’s not you."" The ad tries to tag Nunn with labels that her campaign strategists said in the memo they were anticipating: Nunn’s  ""too liberal,"" a ""lightweight"" a ""rubber stamp for Democrats"" and ""not a real Georgian."" But the ad’s headline point is more ominous. ""Her foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists,"" the announcer states. ""If Nunn supporters are worried, shouldn’t we be, too?"" Video of what appears to be armed terrorists is background for part of the ad. PolitiFact decided to fact-check the statement about Nunn, who has spent her career in nonprofits. She became CEO of Points of Light Foundation, the service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush, in 2007. Nunn is on leave while campaigning. Ending Spending Action Fund, a political action committee founded by Joe Ricketts, former CEO of TD Ameritrade, has spent more than $1 million on Nunn attack ads since April. Ending Spending president Brian Baker told PolitiFact Georgia last month that the group opposed two candidates this year, Nunn and Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey. Both jumped in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, but Gingrey was knocked out in the crowded GOP primary that Perdue ultimately won. In July, PolitiFact Georgia rated as Mostly True an Ending Spending ad claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light after the non-profit had laid of 90 workers (due to a merger).   The contest between Nunn, daughter of retired U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, and Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, is one of the most closely watched of this year’s elections. The prospect of Democrats winning a Senate seat in Republican-controlled Georgia is energizing for Nunn and her party. They want to reclaim a Georgia Senate seat and keep control of the Senate chamber for the last two years of President Barack Obama’s term. Republicans need six seats to claim the Senate majority. For our fact-check of the newest ad from Ending Spending, we contacted Baker, asking for evidence to back up the ad’s claims. He sent us a document based largely on the Nunn campaign’s 144-page internal memo and a story in National Review, the conservative magazine that broke the story of the leaked memo. On July 28th, National Review Online reported that Points of Light had made grants totalling more than $33,000 to Islamic Relief USA, one of a global network of charities that’s under the umbrella of Islamic Relief Worldwide. In June, Israel’s defense minister labeled Islamic Relief Worldwide an ""unauthorised association"" and has prevented the group from operating in Israel and the West Bank, citing its links to the Palestinian and U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.. In a web posting, officials with Islamic Relief Worldwide said the organization ""is extremely surprised and concerned by this and categorically denies any links with Hamas."" Stefanie Weiss, Points of Light’s  communications director, told us the nonprofit ""has never had any dealings with or given any grants to Hamas or any known terrorist group."" From 2003 to 2011, MissionFish was a Points of Light business unit that allowed eBay sellers and buyers to direct all or part of the proceeds from a transaction to their favorite charity, Weiss said. EBay users could donate to any of 20,000 organizations, all of which were registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits or the overseas equivalent, she said. ""These nonprofits were vetted regularly to ensure tax-exempt status, good standing with the IRS, and exclusion from terrorist watch lists,"" Weiss said. Islamic Relief USA was one of them and ""remains an eBay Giving Works-approved charity,"" she said. (Points of Light sold MissionFish to eBay in 2011.) Points of Lights’ IRS 990s show Islamic Relief USA, which describes itself as an independent affiliate of Islamic Relief Worldwide, received about $13,500 in contributions from eBay buyers and sellers in 2006, 2007 and 2010. National Review has corrected its story to show that the $33,000 figure was in error. Nathan Click, spokesman for the Nunn campaign, called the ad a ""false and ridiculous attack against Points of Light -- an organization founded by President George H.W. Bush that mobilizes million of volunteers each year."" He said this kind of attack ""is exactly what Georgians are ready to change about our political process."" Our Ruling Just the mention of the word Islamic can ignite strong emotions in some people. And those working to block Nunn’s candidacy clearly know that and hope the ad will work in their favor. Our research showed the group that Points of Light dealt with -- Islamic Relief USA -- is an approved charity and not on the U.S.’s terrorist watch list. But the record of its umbrella organization, Islamic Relief Worldwide, is not clear. Leaders of IRW deny any connection to Hamas. But a top Israeli official in June banned Islamic Relief Worldwide from working in the country, saying terrorist connections exist. The ad says Nunn's foundation ""directed money."" But Points of Light  instead allowed eBay buyers and sellers to choose whether to take part in the program and then designate any one of 20,000 charities, including Islamic Relief USA, to get donated funds.  Donors  gave to an entity that is not on the U.S. government’s terrorist watch list. These type of donations started before Nunn arrived at Points of Light, and the nonprofit sold MissionFish, three years before the Israel government banned the umbrella group. Ending Spending Action makes a very specific claim based more on innuendo than evidence. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/08/ending-spending-action-fund/attack-ad-misfires-nonprofits-connection-terrorism/

Joy Reid compares deaths in Gaza to 9/11 deaths
","Whenever tragedy strikes abroad, pundits often make a point to translate death tolls into dead Americans. The Israeli-Palestinian war is no exception. On her Aug. 4 Reid Report, Joy Reid called out the United Nations for their inability to stop or temper Israel’s campaign in Gaza. The UN’s ""condemnations and expressions of outrage,"" Reid said, ""have done exactly nothing to protect civilians in Gaza."" ""So far the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s."" Americans don’t take the name of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in vain. So we wanted to dig into Reid’s claim: Does her math check out, and is she right to compare the impact of the Palestinian deaths to what Reid defined as the American ""population equivalent""? Reid’s math, and why 9/11s are not a unit To consider Reid's claim, you need to first know that Reid is essentially looking at the percentage of deaths per population. For one part of the comparison, she's using the population of Gaza, which is pretty straightforward. For the other part of the comparison, she's choosing to use the entire population of the United States. And as we'll show you, that makes all the difference. Reid's napkin math is relatively straightforward. Roughly 1,800 Palestinians have died out of 1.8 million in Gaza, which equals 0.1 percent of its population. Roughly 3,000 out of 300 million Americans died directly in the Sept. 11 attacks, which works out to 0.001 percent of America’s population. Compare the two and you get that .1 percent is 100 times 0.001 percent. That’s where ""100 9/11s"" comes from. If you use slightly more precise numbers, it doesn’t move the needle that much. The United Nations report issued on Aug. 4, when Reid made her claim, put the number of Palestinian deaths at 1,777 (not more than 1,800, as Reid said), and the CIA estimates Gaza’s population at 1,816,379. A 10-year memorandum on the Sept. 11 attacks from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism puts the number of deaths in the Sept. 11 attacks at 2,997, and the United States Census Bureau population clock puts the U.S. population on Sept. 11, 2011, at 285,558,980. Using those numbers, we get that Palestine’s death count is the ""population equivalent"" of 93.22 9/11s when using the entire population of the United States. That's not quite Reid’s 100, but it's not substantially different. But our fractional result does help demonstrate that 9/11s are not a particularly good unit of measurement. It’s unclear what 0.22 of a 9/11 -- or for that matter, 100 9/11s -- would look like. Impact on society In his book How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking, University of Wisconsin mathematician Jordan Ellenberg explains how, while occasionally useful, taking population equivalents quickly becomes ridiculous if you apply it to extreme cases. For example, Ellenberg writes, the 1,074 Israelis killed by Palestinians from 2000-05 works out to 50,000 Americans, but if you scale down instead of up, it loses its punch. The same Israeli death toll, he says, is proportional to only one or two deaths in Tuvalu, a Polynesian island with roughly 1,000 inhabitants. ""When commentators in Israel and Palestine were observing 9/11 when it happened, people weren’t saying, ‘Imagine if 20 Palestinians had been killed,’ "" Ellenberg told us. Similarly, the Palestinian death count from the last couple of weeks is the ""population equivalent"" of about 1.3 million Chinese, but only one Tuvaluan -- not quite as rhetorically overwhelming as ""100 9/11s."" The problem, Ellenburg wrote in a 2006 Slate article, is that our ""innate number sense simply doesn’t extend"" to extremely small numbers. He uses the example of a Hezbollah bombing of the Israeli city of Haifa, which killed one in every 787,500 Israelis. ""Imagine that it was actually one in 78,750. You just multiplied the scale of the crime tenfold, but can you say sincerely that the two numbers inspire a different reaction? The proportions are just too small to comprehend."" Beyond that, Ellenberg told us, ""there’s a huge amount of wiggle room in how you count what population you divide by."" If you use just the population of New York City instead of the entire United States, the Palestinian death count works out to about three 9/11s. And if you limit yourself only to the population of Manhattan, you get less than one 9/11. It’s not clear which figure is the best choice to put the Palestinian death count in context -- or if any of them are even useful. Population equivalent, but not morally equivalent The only ""sound ethical theory"" that does let you make what philosophers call ""inter-personal comparisons"" is utilitarianism, Herlitz said, which posits that ""all lives are of equal worth. One Palestinian equals one Israeli equals one American, and so on."" So there’s no ethical sense in which 1,800 Palestinian deaths are comparable to ""100 9/11s."" Our ruling Reid, decrying the UN’s failure to temper the rising death counts in Gaza, said, ""So far, the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s."" She used a couple of rough estimates, but Reid’s math basically works out for the parameters she set. The parameters, however, are the problem. Using 9/11s as a unit ignores qualitative differences between the Sept. 11 attack and the Israeli-Palestinian war. It’s also not clear what populations she’s referring to, and while looking at deaths as a proportion of population can be useful, the numbers here are too small for them to mean much. There are also at least equally valid and different ways to compare deaths as a proportion of population that would produce vastly different results. (Going from 100 9/11s to less than 1 9/11.) Reid’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/07/joy-reid/joy-reid-compares-deaths-gaza-911-deaths/

Charlie Crist says All Aboard Florida is 'receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars'
","Democrats have been attacking Republican Gov. Rick Scott for a controversial passenger rail line project with ties to his administration. While Scott has said All Aboard Florida won’t get state subsidies, Democratic front-runner former Gov. Charlie Crist says that’s inaccurate. ""All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars,"" Crist stated in a July 10 fundraising email. How much -- if any money -- is All Aboard Florida receiving from the state? Hop aboard and let’s see what we learned. Sources of money  All Aboard Florida is a $2.5 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2016, with hopes to extend to Orlando in 2017. Proposed by Florida East Coast Industries, LLC, All Aboard will use private financing for a large portion of its costs and has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. Scott has taken heat because of the role of Adam Hollingsworth, now Scott’s chief of staff. In 2010, Hollingsworth was a transportation adviser to Scott’s transition team. Then Hollingsworth went to work for All Aboard Florida’s parent company for part of 2011 and 2012 and lobbied Scott’s administration for the project, the Naples Daily News reported. In 2012, Hollingsworth became Scott’s chief of staff. While Scott has supported the All Aboard Florida project he killed high-speed rail slated to get $2.4 billion in federal funds in 2011. In this case, the controversy lies with various pots of state money. A Crist campaign spokesman pointed to a July article by the Scripps/Tribune Capital Bureau, which ran in the Naples Daily News headlined, ""All Aboard Florida private rail project has government financial support."" The article stated that ""the state already has set aside more than $220 million that will benefit the project."" Several other news outlets weighed in; a Tampa Bay Times editorial called for Scott to ""stop misleading voters about its public cost."" The Florida Department of Transportation, led by a Scott-appointee, pushed back. We read several news articles, transportation department press releases and interviewed officials connected to the project to figure out the project’s finances. Orlando International Airport: The airport is building a complex to include the airport’s people mover, parking and ground transportation. Connected to that project, the airport is also building an intermodal transportation facility -- and that’s the piece that will get about $214 million from a loan and grant from the state. The intermodal facility will accommodate rail -- including All Aboard Florida -- and potentially two other future rail projects, Phil Brown, airport director, told PolitiFact Florida. Having airport connections to rail has been in the airport’s plan for decades. However, Brown said the airport couldn’t seek state money until it had an entity committing to build it -- and that’s All Aboard Florida. ""What we had was an opportunity with All Aboard Florida to get some state funding to accommodate that,"" facility, Brown said. All Aboard Florida will pay the airport $2.8 million a year for a lease, which the airport will use to repay a portion of the state loan. In addition, All Aboard will pay the airport between $1 and $1.50 per passenger. (All Aboard Florida estimates that combined the total will add up to about $4.5 million a year.) ""Whatever they are using of that facility they are going to pay for,"" Brown said. The airport is required under federal regulations to charge fair market rate. ""All Aboard Florida is not getting a free station in Orlando,"" Brown wrote in an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel. ""In fact, the airport will be required to repay the state the portion of the terminal-construction cost to be used by All Aboard Florida."" All Aboard will pay off the cost to build their platform at the airport, Brown told PolitiFact Florida. Quiet zones: In 2014, the Legislature agreed to provide $10 million for ""quiet zones"" related to horns at railroad crossings. Local government agencies can apply for the money -- so All Aboard Florida can’t get the money. The bill language doesn’t name any particular type of rail or All Aboard Florida, but it was added to the state’s spending plan due to residents’  concerns about noise. Tri-Rail connection: The Naples Daily News wrote that an investor pitch by All Aboard Florida outlined its plan to connect with Tri-Rail, an existing public passenger rail service in South Florida. ""Project officials want the state to pay the estimated $44 million cost of the connection,"" the article stated. All Aboard’s bond documents stated: ""We are exploring a number of different financing alternatives for this construction, including a possible state-funded grant for some or all of the construction cost."" All Aboard and transportation officials talked about the idea of seeking $44 million in state money for a Tri-Rail connection but that never materialized. Before All Aboard Florida was announced, Tri-Rail Coastal Link already had plans for future stations in the downtowns of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. In 2013, All Aboard Florida and the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, which oversees Tri-Rail, began to coordinate on potential design plans. Susie Wiles, a consultant for All Aboard Florida who ran Scott’s 2010 campaign, said that it was Tri-Rail that wanted the connection, so All Aboard wasn’t going to pay for it. All Aboard officials provided transportation officials with a breakdown of the cost. But the news report about the $44 million prompted the Scott administration to push back. ""As we previously discussed with your company, the department will not invest state dollars in your project,"" stated a July 15 letter sent by the Florida Department of Transportation Secretary to All Aboard Florida. (Scott had said in June that there would be no state subsidies for All Aboard.) Our ruling Crist said on July 10, ""All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars."" All Aboard is not receiving millions directly from the state. Instead, it could get federal loans, and the state is spending millions on infrastructure that will end up benefiting the rail line, especially an intermodal center at Orlando International Airport. All Aboard will have to pay rent and passenger fees at the airport. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-all-aboard-florida-receiving-mi/

Rick Scott says All Aboard is '100% private venture' and 'no state money involved'
","Gov. Rick Scott has been on the defense for months about All Aboard Florida, a controversial passenger rail project that he supports. All Aboard Florida will run from Miami to West Palm Beach in 2016 and could extend to Orlando the following year. The project has faced opposition from some residents on the Treasure Coast, who fear noise and other impacts. And as he campaigns for re-election, Scott has faced heat for the role of his chief of staff, who previously worked for All Aboard’s parent company. A key point of contention has been about the role of public dollars in the project. In an interview with the West Palm Beach TV station WPEC June 30, Scott said: ""All Aboard is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved."" Scott made similar claims in June in a letter to the editor in the Tampa Bay Times and at a campaign event in Largo in July. His description of the ""100 percent private venture"" prompted an outcry from the Florida Democratic Party and opponents of the project. Media reports have also outlined the public funding -- and potential public funding -- associated with the project. Earl Barrett of Clearwater wrote a letter to the editor of the Tampa Bay Times in June seeking some clarity: ""A PolitiFact check seems in order."" Meanwhile, Scott’s likely nemesis on the November ballot, former Gov. Charlie Crist, made a claim that contradicted Scott’s assertion. ""All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars,"" Crist wrote in a July fundraising email. As the All Aboard controversy moved full steam ahead in August, we decided it was time for us to subject Scott’s and Crist’s statements to our Truth-O-Meter. What we found is that All Aboard Florida is a private enterprise, but it also takes advantage of infrastructure paid for by the government. So neither Crist nor Scott is telling the full story. Here, we’ll look in depth at Scott’s statement that All Aboard is ""100 percent private"" with ""no state money involved."" Scott has been asked why he rejected federal funds for high-speed rail in 2011 but now has shown support for All Aboard Florida. Republican Party of Florida Communications Director Susan Hepworth said in statements earlier this summer that the financing was vastly different: ""The proposed high-speed rail would have wasted millions of Florida taxpayer dollars by leaving the state on the hook for an unprofitable project. A private sector project — of any kind — not run on state funding obviously doesn’t have the same risks. Anyone saying these two issues are the same is being intentionally dishonest."" In 2011, PolitiFact Florida fact-checked Scott’s claim that high-speed rail would have cost Florida $1 billion. The state’s portion of the project was going to be $280 million -- Scott based his figure on a suspect study. We rated that claim False. All Aboard Florida All Aboard Florida is a $2.5 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2016, with hopes to extend to Orlando in 2017. Proposed by Florida East Coast Industries, LLC, All Aboard will use private financing for a large portion of its costs and has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. In the TV interview, Scott didn’t mention that federal loan, but his administration has acknowledged in press statements that federal dollars could be part of the project. So there’s definitely federal money involved, but is there state money? We found three points of contention here. Quiet zones: In response to residents’ concerns about noise from All Aboard trains, the Legislature this year approved $10 million in ""quiet zone"" money for horns at railroad crossings. Local government agencies can apply for the money for any rail crossing, not exclusively for those used by All Aboard. Local governments have until mid October to apply for the money so no money has been granted yet, Florida Department of Transportation spokesman Dick Kane told PolitiFact Florida. Tri-Rail: Tri-Rail is an existing government-run passenger rail service in South Florida overseen by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority. All Aboard mentioned in bond documents the possibility of using $44 million in state money to connect their trains to Tri-Rail, according to the Naples Daily News. While All Aboard and regional transportation officials talked about the idea of state funding, that never materialized and the Florida Department of Transportation officially shot down that idea amid all the publicity. So for now, there is no state money ""involved"" with connecting these two rail services. The Orlando International Airport: This is the most concrete connection between All Aboard and state funding. The airport is building a complex to include the airport’s people mover, parking and ground transportation. Connected to that project, the airport is also building an intermodal transportation facility -- and that’s the piece that will get about $214 million from a loan and grant from the state. The intermodal facility will accommodate rail -- including All Aboard Florida -- and potentially two other future rail projects, Phil Brown, airport director, told PolitiFact Florida. All Aboard Florida will pay the airport $2.8 million a year for a lease, which the airport will use to repay a portion of the state loan. In addition, All Aboard will pay the airport between $1 and $1.50 per passenger. (All Aboard Florida estimates that combined the total will add up to about $4.5 million a year.) ""Whatever they are using of that facility they are going to pay for,"" Brown said. The airport is required under federal regulations to charge fair market rate. ""The funding is for the Orlando International Airport, not All Aboard Florida,"" states a July 25 press release from FDOT. ""The airport will reimburse the state for the portion of funding related to the rail connection, whether it is All Aboard Florida or another private rail provider."" Our ruling Scott said in a TV interview that ""All Aboard Florida is a 100 percent private venture. There is no state money involved."" While All Aboard Florida is a private venture, it has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. Also, the state is kicking in money for infrastructure, particularly for a new intermodal center at the Orlando International Airport. The funding for that infrastructure doesn’t go directly to All Aboard, but All Aboard does derive some benefit from the spending.

Africa's 'Bono' claims that music is one of Africa's biggest exports
","All eyes are on Africa this week, as the Ebola crisis persists and dozens of its leaders converge in Washington for the first-ever U.S.-Africa business summit. And a recording artist nicknamed ""Africa’s Bono"" is chiming in. Nigerian popstar D’Banj, an ambassador for the ONE Campaign, discussed the summit on ABC’s This Week on Aug. 3. He promoted investing in African agriculture, through the power of music. According to D’Banj, Africa puts out more beats than anything else, except barrels. ""The theme of the summit is … investing in the next generation,"" he said. ""Ten years ago, we did not have any (music) industry, we did not have any support. We did not even have any record label. And because we believed in ourselves and we believed in what we had, we continued. And now the music industry is the biggest export from Africa after oil and gas."" A spokesperson for the ONE campaign told us that D’Banj was not referring to music as an economic export, but rather making the point that beyond its oil reserves, Nigeria is best known for its entertainment industry. Nonetheless, we were curious about how the recording industry stacked up economically.    Second fiddle? Neither the World Bank nor the International Federation for the Phonographic Industry had data on the African music recording industry. So we had World Bank economist Cesar Calderon walk us through how to estimate Africa’s export revenue in 2012. Using the World Trade Organization data, we calculated that Africa’s total export revenue -- combining merchandise exports and commercial services exports --  is around $720 billion. Fuel exports account for 49 percent of that total, or about $355 billion in 2012. Though the WTO has data from some African countries on exports generated by ""audiovisual services,"" the list is far from comprehensive. The best we can do is look at the ""personal, cultural, and recreational services"" category, which includes revenue from music, film, TV, museums, libraries, etc. This is a subcategory of commercial services, and brought in $480 million in exports.  Altogether, the entire entertainment sector makes up less than 0.1 percent of the total export revenue, a crumb of the export pie. So what are the biggest exports out of Africa? In terms of earnings, after oil, it’s minerals and agricultural products, according to Jennifer Cooke, the Africa director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Specifically, Economy Watch lists palm oil, gold and diamonds, cocoa, timber, and precious metals. Using WTO data, we found the share of total exports generated by agriculture (7.9 percent), mining products (6.9 percent), and manufactures (14.2 percent). These export sectors are at least 100 times larger than the entertainment industry. Can’t Afrobeat that Though the recording industry doesn’t bring as much cash, the books may not reflect the reality of sales. Industry experts and academics alike said it’s hard to gauge just how much the music industry is worth in Africa. For one, there’s no formalized reporting to keep track of content, and the distribution system is a network of street vendors who may reprint content after paying a one-time fee, said Aidbee Adiboye, a spokesperson for Chocolate City Group, one of Africa’s largest entertainment companies. And secondly, piracy is a problem. ""The protection of intellectual property throughout the region remains a concerning issue,"" said Jenny Mbaye, who studies African cultural production at the University of Cape Town. ""In this sense, the piracy challenge calls for actively confronting and redressing the persisting lack of information and poor documentation of the processes that animate the chain of production and labour dynamics in these economies."" Looking at homespun statistics from Nigerian entertainment executives, album sales clocked $30 million in 2008 (triple that of 2005’s), global live performances brought in an additional $105 million, and ringtones sold $150 million in 2011. Nollywood -- that’s Nigeria’s film industry, the second largest in the world after Bollywood, according to the UN -- cashes in $250 million in annual revenue, according to the Financial Times. Now, these numbers represent total revenue, not export revenue. Nonetheless, they provide a general sense of how the industry is faring. And it’s worth noting that the African music industry is burgeoning, especially in D’Banj’s home Nigeria and especially as it moves to digital platforms. Though the African diaspora is the primary consumer of African entertainment, Africans living abroad can act as ""introducers,"" according Michael Ugwu, the former CEO of iROKING, the largest digital distributor of Nigerian media. Ugwu, who is in the process of setting up Sony Music West Africa, said that as digital distribution becomes more popular, international platforms are increasingly looking at Africa as an untapped market and as a pool for local talent. ""Although very little data can assist in providing a systematic knowledge of the music economy on the continent, African music and cultural products in general, certainly present a comparative advantage on the globally competitive market of creativity,"" said Mbaye. Of course, the continent is home to global popstars Akon and K'naan, as well as the famous choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Just a few years ago, the world was afflicted with Ghanian dance fever with Azonto, in which moves are taken from humdrum activities like driving or washing clothes. And D’Banj himself has international appeal. His 2012 hit, ""Oliver Twist,"" inspired a West End musical and featured a cameo role by Kanye West, who then signed D’Banj to his label G.O.O.D. Music as its first international artist. Our ruling D’Banj said, ""The music industry is the biggest export from Africa after oil and gas."" Africa has a good story to tell about its music, but that doesn't mean it's a major export.  In fact, the entire entertainment sector comprised less than 0.1 percent of Africa’s export revenue, far behind other sectors like agriculture and mineral products. Experts said the reported revenue may be less than the actual numbers though, due to the lack of a reporting and distribution infrastructure in Africa. But it wouldn't be enough to make a significant different. We rate D’Banj's claim False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/07/dbanj/nigerias-bono-claims-music-one-africas-biggest-exp/

Will EPA regulations stop plants from burning coal, like Shelley Moore Capito says?
","Is President Barack Obama poised to stop any more coal from burning in the United States? That’s the message from U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia against Democrat Natalie Tennant. In a campaign ad released July 29, Capito, surrounded by blue-collar workers, warns against Obama’s coal regulations. ""The president's come out with rules that say 'no new coal-fired power plants,’"" Capito says. ""But what he's going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" We already fact-checked the claim that new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency say ""no new coal-fired power plants."" We said it was Mostly False. But what about existing power plants? We decided to take a look. What the EPA is doing In June 2014, the EPA, at Obama’s direction, proposed a plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent compared to 2005 base levels over the next 25 years. The plan is now in a 12-month review period before it is finalized. The proposal does not say that existing coal plants must be shut down or can’t burn coal. So in a literal sense, Capito’s claim falls flat. In fact, baked into the EPA’s own estimates is an assumption that 30 percent of the country’s energy will still come from coal in 2030. (In 2013, about 39 percent of U.S. power came from coal.) Here’s what the EPA is actually doing. Under the new rules, the EPA has given each state its own goal for reducing carbon emissions over the next 25 years. While the goal is a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases nationally, every state has a different threshold it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among other factors. How are these goals achieved? The EPA basically says it's up to states to decide. There are a variety of options, including proposals for states to create regional cap and trade networks, invest in renewable energy and build smart grid technology. And, yes, they could phase out existing coal plants. But experts we spoke with said that’s far from a certainty or the only option. First, the steps toward reaching these goals will be gradual. So to insinuate that within several months the EPA is going to stop plants from burning coal is just fear mongering. Second, it’s important to keep in mind that many of the coal plants already in existence are quite old — most have been in operation at least 30 years — and were on track to be retired in the next decade anyway. Perhaps these new rules accelerate that process, but it was coming. Another reason many coal plants were set to close is because of existing federal rules against mercury emissions. These rules are much more stringent than the new carbon rules, experts told us. But plants that weren’t scheduled for retirement that can meet the mercury standards have other options to stay open. For example, they can retrofit their facilities with technology that will result in cleaner emissions, such as scrubbers that remove some of the carbon. ""In no way does this program say coal can’t live,"" said Michael Webber, the deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. ""What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for"" technology upgrades. So how does the EPA proposal say ""you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants""? We asked Capito’s campaign for evidence. Spokeswoman Amy Graham told us that, ""Not a single West Virginia coal plant meets the average standard set for our state in the EPA rule. That doesn't mean that every plant has to close, but because 95 percent of our state's electricity production comes from coal, in order to reduce the state's emissions rate to the required average, coal capacity will have to close."" But that’s not remotely close to what Capito said. In fact, the idea that the EPA proposal ""doesn’t mean that every plant has to close"" seems to entirely contradict Capito’s claim in the ad. What’s next for coal? Some energy companies might find technological upgrades too costly, and will seek alternatives such as natural gas, which is much cheaper right now. But for other facilities, particularly larger ones, the initial upfront costs may be offset by savings from creating more efficient, modern plants, said Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, an energy think tank funded by government, nonprofits and energy companies. ""We’re going to see a shakeout of older and smaller coal plants, the least efficient ones anyway,"" Burtraw said. ""The ones that remain will have a high level of environmental controls and will run relatively efficiently with a high utilization rate."" States, too, will influence this process when they create their blueprint for decreasing emissions, said Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis. ""It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal,"" Jaffe said. ""States have been given targets based on their existing profiles and will come back to the EPA with state plans for how to meet a target of reduction. Some states that are using coal will continue to burn coal and find other ways to cut emissions."" We asked Paul Meier, an associate scientist and director of the University of Wisconsin Energy Institute, to review what impact the rules might have on West Virginia in particular. Coal plants in West Virginia on average emit 2,056 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. The EPA’s proposed guidelines would require West Virginia coal plants to average 1,748 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour by 2020 and 1,620 pounds per megawatt hour by 2030, a 21 percent decrease that Meier said ""requires only a slight reduction in coal reliance."" ""This can be accomplished by improving the efficiency of the coal plants, or by displacing some of the coal generation with natural gas, nuclear, renewable electricity,"" Meier said. ""States may propose their own plan to accomplish this, and may also receive credit for increasing conservation and efficiency efforts."" Our ruling Capito said ""What (Obama is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."" The proposal Capito is referring to is an EPA plan to cut carbon emissions in existing power plants. Those rules do not prohibit current facilities from burning coal, and even Capito’s spokeswoman said the rule ""doesn't mean that every plant has to close."" Some facilities will close down within the next decade, but many of those plants were scheduled to be retired anyway due to age and other factors. States and power companies have options to continue to utilize coal for energy, and experts said they expect coal to remain part of the national portfolio for years to come.

Who pays the highest property taxes in New York?
","New York state has some of the highest property taxes in the country. But where in the state are property taxes highest? Assemblyman Ray Walter, R-Amherst, says Western New York ranks high. ""Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state,"" Walter said in a recent press release about Republican efforts to replace Obamacare. He supports a part of a congressional bill designed to reduce property taxes in New York state by shifting Medicaid costs from counties to the state. Walter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value in Western New York. He defines the region as the eight counties west of the Finger Lakes: Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Orleans, Wyoming and Genesee counties. ""It’s off the charts as a percentage of home value,"" Walter told PolitiFact New York. ""In real dollars it’s not as high just because our home values are not as high as other places in the state."" Is Walter right that Western New York has some of the highest property taxes in the state? Percent of home value U.S. Census Bureau data shows how property taxes compared with home values in each county in 2015, the latest figures. It’s a better apples-to-apples comparison because some counties have higher home values but similar property tax bills. The home value in Brooklyn is more than triple that of Sullivan County, for example, but the property tax bills are within a few hundred dollars of each other. All eight counties in Western New York rank among the 18 highest counties in the state for property taxes as a percent of home value. • Orleans County ranks first out of the state’s 62 counties. Its median property tax of $3,055 is 3.35 percent of its $91,300 median home value.  • Allegany County ranks second. The $2,320 median property tax bill is 3.3 percent of the $70,300 median home value.  • Erie County ranks lowest in the region, but 18th highest in the state. Its median property tax bill is $3,499, which is 2.69 percent of its median home value of $130,000. The data is only reported for owner-occupied housing units. It does not include property taxes on businesses or rented units. Property taxes in dollars The ten counties with the highest median property tax in dollar amounts are in New York City, the lower Hudson Valley and on Long Island. Western New York counties are lower in this category. Four of them rank in the bottom half. • Erie County has the highest property tax in the region. The county ranks 21st in the state. • Niagara County, where the median property tax bill is $3,255, is second highest in the region but 26th in the state. • Allegany County has the lowest median property tax in dollars in Western New York. Only five other counties in the state are lower. Three counties tie for highest property taxes in the state — and the country. Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties each have median property tax bills that exceed $10,000. That’s the highest amount in the country as well. The Census Bureau does not report exact dollar amounts when the median tax exceeds $10,000. Percent of income Property taxes can also be measured as a share of median household income. The eight counties in Western New York rank in the middle in this category. • Wyoming County, where the tax bill is $2,871, is lowest in the region. Residents spend 5.29 percent of the median income of $52,564 on property taxes. Fifteen counties have lower property tax bills as a percent of median resident income. • Erie County is again highest in the region. Residents there pay 6.83 percent of the median income of $51,247 toward property taxes. Twenty-one counties are higher. Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties tie for first in this category. At least ten percent of the median income in each is spent on property taxes. Our ruling Walter said ""Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state."" His statement might come as a surprise to homeowners on Long Island and other counties near New York City, where median property tax bills exceed $10,000. To them, Erie County's median property tax bill of $3,499 doesn't look too high.  So, no, Western New Yorkers do not pay some of the highest property taxes in the state. But Western New Yorkers shoulder a heavier burden paying the property tax. Walter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value. And in that sense, he’s right about the tax. Two Western New York counties lead the state in this category and all eight counties in the region are among the top third.

Are sanctions against Cuba tougher than they are on North Korea?
","North Korea’s recent test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska has left policymakers wondering about the next step for countering Kim Jong Un’s nuclear ambitions. During a panel discussion on MSNBC on July 6, 2017, Hagar Chemali, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who now runs a consulting firm called Greenwich Media Strategies, argued that there’s still room to tighten sanctions against North Korea. When MSNBC’s Chris Jansing countered that many experts disagree with that argument, Chemali responded, ""They say that because I don't think they realize how much room there is left to isolate North Korea. Cuba is far more sanctioned than North Korea."" Does Cuba really face heavier sanctions than North Korea, a nuclear-armed rogue state? A variety of experts said Chemali has a point about U.S. sanctions against Cuba, but her comparison misses the bigger picture of international actions against North Korea. Chemali has a plausible argument that U.S. sanctions against Cuba are tougher than those against North Korea, experts said. ""Cuba is subject to draconian U.S. sanctions -- a full trade embargo, restrictions on the rights of American citizens to travel or spend money in the country and draconian licensing requirements on financial dealings,"" said Joseph DeThomas, who worked on North Korea issues at the State Department from 2010 to 2013 and is now a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs. ""You need a license to do anything in Cuba as an American citizen."" Despite some loosening under President Barack Obama’s outreach to Cuba, the sanctions on Americans’ travel remain stiff. ""Currently, there are no restrictions imposed on U.S. citizens who wish to travel to (North Korea). However, they must fall under 12 circumscribed categories in order to travel to Cuba, such as journalistic, sports or religious purposes,"" said Andrew Otazo, executive director of the Cuba Study Group, which generally favors more open relations between the United States and Cuba. Financial sanctions against Cuba are also severe. ""All financial transactions with Cuban entities or individuals are prohibited, other than those allowed under specific exemptions incident to licensed travel or for allowed categories like agricultural trade, telecommunications, health and medicine, humanitarian assistance, or remittances,"" said Ted Piccone, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. ""This has caused most banks to stay far away from any dealings with Cuba."" Chemali told PolitiFact that a key difference between the Cuba and North Korea sanctions is that there is no broad embargo on North Korea. The sanctions are ""mostly comprised of targeted financial measures, focusing on elements, institutions and officials of the North Korean regime."" Another factor is that many of the U.S. restrictions on Cuba are enshrined in law, rather than in executive orders or regulations that could be more easily rolled back. Where Chemali’s argument suffers is that the situations in Cuba and North Korea aren’t exactly comparable. For starters, the United States’ unilateral sanctions against North Korea are just a piece of the puzzle. The bigger economic weapon against Kim Jong Un’s regime comes from a network of sanctions that involve countries other than the United States. ""North Korean sanctions have a broad, vital multilateral component empowered by a series of increasingly strong United Nations resolutions,"" DeThomas said. ""The key to successful sanctions there is to get the multilateral sanctions tightened."" By contrast, the rest of the world essentially ignores the United States’ sanctions against Cuba. To the extent the U.S. sanctions against Cuba work, it’s because the two countries are natural trading partners due to their geographic proximity. Applying the Cuba model for sanctions against North Korea wouldn’t achieve the same result, DeThomas said, because China, Japan, and South Korea are North Korea's natural economic partners. It’s worth noting that, even though U.S. sanctions against Cuba are stiff, they are porous enough to have allowed for almost $246 million in trade between the two countries in 2016, mainly exempted items such as food and medicine. Indeed, Obama’s liberalization, though only partial, opened the door to new types of interactions. ""Under Obama, U.S. citizens could do business with the Cuban military, money could be sent, U.S. airlines and ships could visit Cuba, and many Cuban products could be brought back to the U.S.,"" said Jim Cason, a former chief of mission with the U.S. interests section in Havana. By contrast, U.S. trade with North Korea -- a country that has no diplomatic relations with the United States -- totaled just $100,000 in 2016. So despite facing what, on paper, was a stricter sanctions regime, Cuba actually traded far more extensively with the United States than North Korea did. It’s also worth noting some important differences between the economies of Cuba and North Korea. For North Korea, 83 percent of its exports go to China, and 85 percent of its imports come from China. By contrast, no single country trading with Cuba accounts for more than 30 percent of either imports or exports. That means that Cuba has a more diversified trade portfolio and cannot be brought down by new sanctions imposed by an existing trading partner. North Korea, by contrast, could be crippled if China were to impose significant sanctions -- something that hasn’t happened yet. One category of commodities that gives North Korea leverage with China are ""rare earth"" metals, which are often extracted in North Korean ""economic zones"" in partnership with Chinese companies. ""Chances are, if you are reading on a smart device with an LED screen, there are components in it from North Korea,"" said Nick Anguelov, an assistant public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Such consumer electronics products ""can only be manufactured with the elements dysprosium, erbium, and yttrium, and if those components say 'Made in China,' it is highly likely they come from North Korean-mined inputs."" Chemali said, ""Cuba is far more sanctioned than North Korea."" Chemali has a point that U.S. sanctions against Cuba are sweeping and deeply embedded in law. However, U.S. sanctions against Cuba don’t make an especially relevant comparison to sanctions against North Korea. The important sanctions against North Korea are multilateral rather than bilateral, and Cuba and North Korea have significantly different types of economies. And while the sanctions against Cuba are stiffer on paper, U.S. trade with Cuba is actually much more extensive than U.S. trade with North Korea.

Gwen Moore spoke with the Real News Network, a nonprofit group that says it reports with ""ordinary people’s interests in mind."" The topic was poverty. Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat and former welfare recipient, blasted Republicans. Then she made a claim about poor people and drug use that we want to check. In the video interview, which went online June 19, 2017, she said: The Republicans have done a very good job of driving poor people into the underground, making people feel ashamed and guilty and feeling that they have some character flaws, based on their poverty. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, is from my state -- as chairman of the Budget Committee; every year he was the chairman of the Budget Committee, I served on that committee. And so when he would roll out his pathways out of poverty initiatives -- this last time, he did it in front of a drug house. What is the equivalent between being poor and being a drug addict? None. There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means. I mean, they don't have money. They can’t afford it. Moore’s office did not respond to our call and emails asking for information to back her statement that poor people are less likely to use drugs. But the latest federal survey on the subject indicates the opposite of what she said. The research We posed Moore’s claim to the federal government’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, which cited the government’s latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health, done in 2015. Individuals age 12 and older were asked in in-person interviews in their homes if they had used illicit drugs in the past month. A spokeswoman for the institute told us that staff members used data obtained from the survey and found that a higher proportion of persons living in poverty used illicit drugs compared to persons with incomes at higher levels.   Living in poverty Income up to 2 times the federal poverty threshold Income more than 3 times the federal poverty threshold Used any illicit drug in the past month 12.96% 11.4% 8.94% Among adults aged 18 or older, the rate of illicit drug use in the past month was higher among the unemployed (18.2 percent) than for those who were employed full time (9.1 percent) or part time (13.7 percent). That’s according to the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The same federal survey found that illicit drug use was higher among people who had not graduated from high school (11.8 percent) than high school graduates with no further education (9.9 percent), those with some college education (10.8 percent) and college graduates (6.7 percent). A footnote: Harold Pollack, a social service administration professor at the University of Chicago whose research specialties include poverty, told us about Moore’s claim: ""I think that's a nuanced question,"" he said. ""The data are much stronger that rich people are less likely to be punished for whatever drug use they engage in than that rich people use drugs more."" Our rating Moore said: ""There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means."" The latest federal survey found that a higher percentage of people in poverty had used illicit drugs in the past month than people at higher income levels.

Is Donald Trump right that gas prices are now lowest in over 10 years?
","All presidents like to tout their policy accomplishments, and Donald Trump is no exception. On July 4 -- one of the major travel weekends of the year -- Trump tweeted, ""Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years! I would like to see them go even lower."" Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years! I would like to see them go even lower. We are fairly certain we know what Trump meant to say. But that's not what he said. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) On the one hand, the American Automobile Association told PolitiFact that gasoline prices on Independence Day weekend were the lowest they have been in 12 years -- since 2005. ""Gas prices have been declining since the beginning of June,"" said Jeanette Casselano, a spokesperson for AAA. ""At $2.23, today’s national gas price average is the cheapest price we’ve seen since January. ""The combination of tepid demand and increasing gasoline and crude output continues to put downward pressure on gas prices, and motorists are benefitting."" There’s value in comparing gas prices using a narrow window of time like the July 4 weekend, because comparing, for example, summer prices to winter prices is like comparing apples and oranges. However, the way Trump phrased his tweet was more expansive. Rather than limiting the comparison to the July 4 weekend, the tweet suggests that at no point over the last decade-plus have gas prices been lower. And that would not be correct, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal office. There were 85 weeks in which gas cost less than $2.26 per gallon, the price it was at the time of Trump’s tweet. That means that for about one-sixth of the time over the last decade, gas cost less than it does now. (The EIA data does mirror AAA’s assessment for Fourth of July weekend prices.) The Energy Information Administration’s data set uses nominal dollars rather than inflation-adjusted dollars, so just to be certain, we ran the data through the federal inflation calculator to see how adjusting for inflation affected that number. The answer: 58 weeks. That’s still about one-ninth of the last decade. Then there’s the question of whether Trump deserves bragging rights. In general, presidents have rarely had a direct impact on the price of gasoline, said Philip Verleger, an economist and head of the energy consulting firm PKVerleger LLC. ""The only one who had an impact was Jimmy Carter, who instituted price controls that managed to ball up the distribution of gasoline, leading to lines at gas stations,"" he said. Overall, presidents are ""not a big factor"" on gasoline prices, he said. Indeed, gas cost less during much of President Barack Obama’s last year in office than it does now. Trump tweeted, ""Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!"" Trump likely meant to say that gas prices on the July 4 weekend are lower now than at any point since 2005.

No, the Australian government is not installing microchips in citizens
","A fake item circulating online gives the false impression the Australian government is implanting microchips in its citizens. ""Australia becomes first country to begin microchipping its public,"" blares one such false headline appearing on the site Native American Stuff. We decided to take a closer look after Facebook users flagged it as suspicious. Microchips implanted in human bodies can transform how people tackle everyday tasks. They emit frequencies that do everything from unlocking doors to logging onto computers, removing the need to turn a key or flip a switch. While it’s true some people have voluntarily been implanted, there’s not a shred of evidence to support the absurd notion that the procedure is mandatory in Australia, as this story claims. The fake item appears to be a gross distortion of a puff piece from an actual Australian media outlet about an entrepreneur from Sydney who runs a business implanting microchips in customers’ skin. But there’s no evidence that the tech entrepreneur or her chip-implanting business are acting on behalf of the government of Australia, or that customers sought her service because a government policy requires them to do so. This bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking, clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to support an ultimately untenable central premise.

Pete Olson said Bill Clinton basically told Loretta Lynch 'we killed Vince Foster'
","A Texas congressman said President Bill Clinton intimidated the government’s lead lawyer into not seeking an indictment of Hillary Clinton by telling her, ""We killed Vince Foster."" Did Clinton, desperate to help his wife, declare as much about killing Foster, the White House deputy counsel at the start of Clinton’s two terms? That's what Rep. Pete Olson said in a June 9, 2017, interview on the Houston-based Sam Malone Show. Conspiracy theories have abounded since Foster’s body was found in 1993--all of a part with unsubstantiated tales alleging the Clintons share a sordid history of sidelining people. Over the years, debunkists at Snopes.com and for The Washington Post’s Fact Checker each found no basis to claims about fishiness in Foster's death. Olson, R-Sugar Land, initially said in his radio interview that it was ""awfully strange"" for Bill Clinton to bump into then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an Arizona airport tarmac at a time in 2016 when Hillary Clinton’s handling of email was under Justice Department review. ""I guarantee you,"" Olson said, ""they had the conversation where he basically said, ‘Mrs. Lynch, call your attack dog off. We’ve killed people. We killed Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you.’ And then what happens to things?,"" Olson said. ""All of a sudden--well, she did it, yeah, it was all terrible, don’t know who got the information, very classified. But no indictment."" Olson was correct about about a few points. Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016, met privately with Lynch in a plane on the tarmac of Phoenix’s airport. Also, Hillary Clinton was not indicted for how she handled confidential emails. By authoritative accounts, too, Foster, an Arkansas lawyer close to the Clintons, suffered from depression affected by what he felt to be his own personal failings in handling White House events including the Travelgate and Whitewater matters before he was found dead with a gun in his hand in a Washington-area park. But we identified no evidence for Olson’s claim that Bill Clinton told Lynch the Clintons killed Foster. Lynch insisted at the time that the airplane conversation centered on topics such as Clinton’s grandchildren. Our search of the Nexis news database turned up no Bill Clinton accounts of what was discussed. A delayed backpedal Olson himself backed off after his account was brought to light by Right Wing Watch, a project of a liberal group, People for the American Way, 11 days after the radio interview. In a written statement made available the same day, Olson said in part that ""in my discussion about Loretta Lynch and Vince Foster, I took the accusations a step too far. I regret my choice of words."" On June 23, 2017, we asked Olson after he spoke at a Capitol Hill conference on civility in public life if he’d intended his radio comment about Bill Clinton to be factual. Olson replied: ""That was a little out of bounds. It was over the top. I regret it and I apologized for it."" Investigations A series of investigations of Foster’s death include the July 1994 finding of a special counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., that Foster’s death in the area’s Fort Marcy Park in July 1993 was a suicide influenced by Foster’s depression associated with episodes involving his legal work for the Clinton White House. Fiske concluded that ""Foster's death was a personal collapse, not a White House scandal,"" The Washington Post said in a news story at the time. ""The Fiske investigation involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses; also DNA tests, microscopes and lasers,"" the newspaper reported. In October 1997, an investigation by the office of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr reaffirmed that Foster committed suicide, the Post then reported. ""The report concludes that Foster was severely depressed about his work at the White House, took a revolver from a closet in his home, placed it in an oven mitt, and on the afternoon of July 20, 1993, drove to a Virginia park and shot himself,"" the story said. ""And it contains new forensic details that refute the conspiracy theories that have long surrounded his death – that Foster was a victim of foul play, or that his body was moved to Fort Marcy Park after his death at another location, perhaps the White House,"" the story said. The report itself states in its closing summary: ""The available evidence points clearly to suicide as the manner of death."" The summary also quoted Dr. Alan L. Berman, an expert suicidologist, saying: ""No plausible evidence has been presented to support any other conclusion."" Previously, the story said, Fiske and two bipartisan congressional panels similarly concluded that Foster took his own life. By email, we connected with Berman, who said of Olson’s claim: ""There is not a scintilla of fact in this statement – it is a blatant falsehood, unsupported and unsupportable. There were four investigations into Foster’s death, all arriving at the same conclusion."" Our ruling Olson said Bill Clinton said ""we killed"" Foster. There’s no evidence of Clinton saying as much nor a factual basis for anyone to say the Clintons killed Foster. This claim, which Olson backed off after it became widely known, adds up to a baseless accusation. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Story about Ryan announcing Trump’s resignation comes from infamous fake news writer
","A fake news story that claimed House Speaker Paul Ryan announced President Donald Trump’s resignation is actually the brainchild of one of the Internet’s most prolific hoax authors. The headline on a June 29, 2017, article on StGeorgeGazette.com read, ""Paul Ryan: ‘Donald Trump plans to resign from office within the next 30 days’."" Facebook users flagged the story as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. ""Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,"" the post quoted Ryan. ""Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best."" Now, it’s obvious that Ryan hasn’t announced Trump is resigning. But other clues also show that the story is bogus. There is no media outlet called the St. George Gazette. The website implies it is based in St. George, Utah, but the newspaper there is called the Spectrum. The story also quoted one Paul Horner, which is the name of a big-time writer of fabricated news stories. One of his trademarks is always putting his own name into his stories. Horner, formerly a writer at fake news site NationalReport.net, is credited with writing stories ranging from Bill Murray running for president to President Barack Obama opening a Muslim museum to Banksy getting arrested. You can read a roundup of some his work at NewsExaminer.net, which also is a fake news site. Among his often-used calling cards in online stories are the use of the byline Jimmy Rustling, numerous references to ""Fappy the Anti-Masturbation Dolphin"" and a plea to donate socks to the homeless. The footer note posted on the bottom of the website lists a ""complaint department"" phone number that is actually the number for the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan. It’s another Horner staple to use that number: The Ryan article cites the same number as a hotline set up by the White House for people to comment on Trump’s resignation. There’s otherwise no contact information for the website. We reached out to Horner, who responded to us with a cheeky reply on Facebook, but did not address this particular story.

Has Donald Trump never 'promoted or encouraged violence,' as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said?
","Has President Donald Trump promoted violence? At a White House briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders answered with a definitive no. During a June 29, 2017, press briefing, CBS News’ Major Garrett asked Huckabee Sanders about some of Trump’s recent tweets, including a pair directed at ""low I.Q. Crazy Mika"" and ""Psycho Joe"" -- the hosts of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Trump mocked Mika Brzezinski by tweeting that she had been ""bleeding badly from a face-lift"" during a visit to Mar-a-Lago. Garrett said that ""some have suggested"" that Trump’s tweets have ""misconstrued one of the messages that should have been gathered"" after the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and several others at a congressional baseball practice. ""Do you have any reaction to that sentiment, that conversations like this create an atmosphere that is either dangerous or one we need to avoid?"" Garrett asked. Huckabee Sanders responded, ""The president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary. And he was simply pushing back and defending himself."" We’re not considering Trump’s tweet of a GIF showing him body-slamming a figure labeled CNN at a professional wrestling match, which Trump sent several days after Huckabee Sanders’ comment. However, the record shows at least one clear case and possibly several others in which Trump has said things that we believe an ordinary listener would understand as encouraging violence. (The White House declined to comment on the record.) In February 2016, during his campaign for president, Trump told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, ""So I got a little notice. We have wonderful security guys. It said, ‘Mr. Trump, there may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience.’ So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Just knock the hell .... I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise."" As a review of the video shows, Trump is not smiling or chuckling as if this was intended as a joke. On several other occasions, Trump invoked violence without necessarily inciting it. (Hat tips to the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake and Mashable for collecting a number of these in one place.) • August 2015. At a press conference in Michigan, Trump contrasted his interactions with the public with those of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who had recently faced opposition from Black Lives Matter protesters. ""That will never happen with me,"" said Trump, according to a dispatch by the Washington Post’s David Weigel. ""I don't know if I'll do the fighting myself, or if other people will. It was a disgrace. I felt badly for him, but it showed that he was weak. You know what? He's getting the biggest crowds, and we're getting the biggest crowds. We're the ones getting the crowds. But that's never going to happen to Trump."" • November 2015. At a rally in Alabama, Trump said about a protester, ""Get him the hell out of here, will you, please? Get him out of here. Throw him out!"" The following day, calling into Fox News, Trump responded to a question about allegations that the protester had been ""roughed up."" The protester, Trump said, had been ""so obnoxious and so loud ... maybe he should have been roughed up. Maybe he should have been roughed up. Because it was totally disgusting what he was doing."" • February 2016. At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump again responded to a protester: ""See, he’s smiling. See, he’s having a good time. Oh, I love the old days, you know? You know what I hate? There's a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches. We're not allowed to punch back anymore. I love the old days, you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They'd be carried out in a stretcher, folks. Oh, it's true. … The guards are very gentle with him. He’s walking out with big high-fives, smiling, laughing. I’d like to punch him in the face, I’ll tell you,"" • March 2016. At one point at a rally in Michigan, Trump reiterated his pledge to pay legal fees for people who remove protesters. ""Get him out,"" Trump said. ""Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court, don't worry about it."" (Trump later said he had never made the pledge to pay legal fees.) • March 2016. At an event in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump referred to a past incident with protesters. ""We have had a couple that were really violent, and the particular one when I said I'd like to bang him, that was a very  —  he was a guy who was swinging, very loud and then started swinging at the audience and the audience swung back, and I thought it was very, very appropriate. He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back, and that’s what we need a little bit more of."" • March 2016. At a rally in North Carolina, Trump said, ""In the good old days this doesn't happen because they used to treat them very, very rough. And when they protested once, they would not do it again so easily. But today they walk in and they put their hand up and they put the wrong finger in the air at everybody. And they get away with murder, because we’ve become weak."" • March 2016. At a rally in St. Louis, Trump once again addressed protesters who were being removed from the facility. ""Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long (to remove the protesters) is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore, right? And they're being politically correct the way they take them out. So it takes a little bit longer. And honestly, protesters they realize it -- they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore."" • March 2016. At a rally in Kansas City, talking about someone who had rushed the stage, Trump said, ""I don't know if I would have done well, but I would have been out there fighting, folks. I don't know if I'd have done well, but I would've been — boom, boom, boom. I'll beat the crap out of you."" Trump’s words have, on occasion, drawn lawsuits. However, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union has written skeptically about whether Trump’s words would qualify legally as incitement to violence. ""There is no question that Trump’s decision to use his bully pulpit to actually bully protesters and to rile up his crowds against them is morally despicable,"" wrote Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney with the free-speech group wrote concerning a lawsuit stemming from a Trump rally in Louisville. ""But legally, deciding whether what happened in that crowded theater rises to the level of incitement is a trickier task."" Rowland wrote that ""incitement charges have been used to jail anti-war protestors, labor picketers, Communists, and civil rights activists. Over time, the Supreme Court learned from these mistakes and adopted a very speech-protective test to determine when incitement has taken place. In Brandenburg vs. Ohio, the court ruled that the First Amendment permits liability for incitement only when speech is intended and likely to cause imminent and serious lawlessness. It’s a high bar for a reason, and Trump’s conduct at the rally didn’t meet it."" Huckabee Sanders said, ""The president in no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence."" We found one example -- when Trump said, ""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?"" -- that clearly fits the criteria of promoting or encouraging violence. This was not an isolated incident; we found at least seven other examples in which Trump offered public musings that showed a tolerance for, and sometimes even a favorable disposition toward, physical violence. Trump’s words may not meet a legal threshold for incitement to violence, but Huckabee Sanders’ portrayal seriously distorts the record of Trump’s past statements.

CBO counted 7 million people who 'don't exist,' says White House legislative director
","The White House says the Congressional Budget Office shouldn’t be trusted to predict the impact of efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Want evidence? White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short said recently that the CBO is counting millions of nonexistent people in its estimate of the number of Americans who stand to lose insurance coverage under the Senate’s proposed health care bill. The CBO, in its June 26 report, estimated that health insurance coverage would go down by 22 million by 2026 if the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 becomes law. Short, in an appearance on Fox News Sunday July 2, attacked the CBO’s credibility, saying that of that 22 million, 7 million actually ""don’t exist."" ""When the press reports that 22 million people are going to lose coverage, it's a ridiculous number,"" Short said. ""Seven million of those people are people that don't exist,"" he added soon after. ""They’re people that is based upon a baseline that CBO put out in 2014, even though the actual number is way down here."" Short’s claim is a variation on a recent Republican talking point: The CBO report did not use its most recent baseline estimates when scoring the Senate health care bill. (The ""baseline"" is what CBO predicts will happen if current law remains unchanged.) So the 22-million drop in coverage is based on out-of-date data, Republicans say. Is Short right? We found that he has a point. By picking one baseline over another, the CBO may have altered an estimate of the people who would no longer be covered by health insurance. But Short’s specific figure and his description are imperfect. The CBO report about the Senate bill used baseline figures about health care coverage calculated in March 2016, even though it updated those figures in January 2017. (Short wrongly said the report was based on a 2014 baseline.) What difference do those 10 months between March 2016 and January 2017 make? The CBO’s March 2016 baseline had significantly higher estimates for how many people will have insurance purchased through the Obamacare marketplaces than its 2017 calculation. Short was specifically highlighting a 7 million difference in the projections for 2018. In its March 2016 baseline, CBO projected that under current law, 18 million people would have Obamacare marketplace insurance coverage in 2018. Under the updated January 2017 baseline, however, that figure for the same year dropped to 11 million. It’s reasonable to say the differences between the 2016 and 2017 baseline estimates are significant enough that had the CBO used the newer baseline, its score of the Senate health care bill might have been different. And — this is Short’s larger point — it’s plausible that had CBO used the newer baseline, it would have a lower estimate than 22 million for the total drop in coverage by 2026 because fewer people may have had insurance to start with, meaning the people who could potentially lose coverage would be smaller. But it wouldn’t necessarily be 7 million fewer, as Short’s statement implied. It’s a mistake to equate projections for marketplace coverage under current law with the potential impact of the Senate health care bill on that enrollment, experts told us. ""Short is correct that the numbers might look more favorable for the bill if the CBO had used the most recent baseline available, but it isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison,"" said Timothy Callaghan, a health policy professor at Texas A&M University. Experts also told us that Short’s claim is misleading because even if CBO used the newer baseline to score the Senate health bill, insurance coverage would still drop by many millions. It also ignores the fact that the majority of coverage loss under the Senate bill would be due to changes in Medicaid, the government health insurance program for poor Americans that Obamacare expanded. CBO predicted that Medicaid coverage would go down by 15 million, while Obamacare marketplace coverage would go down by 7 million. (Table 4) ""(CBO) did significantly overestimate how many people would sign up for the exchanges,"" said Benjamin Sommers, a health policy professor at Harvard University. ""But that’s only one part of CBO's broader set of ACA projections. They were much more accurate about Medicaid enrollment and the total effect on the uninsured population."" We should note that the CBO report said the analysts decided to use the March 2016 baseline instead of the 2017 based on its consultations with the congressional budget committees. ""If Congressional Republicans really wanted CBO to use the January 2017 baseline, they could absolutely direct CBO to do that,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist on President Barack Obama’s Council on Economic Advisers. Short said that 7 million people the Congressional Budget Office says won't have health insurance coverage under the Senate health care bill ""don't exist."" It is plausible that CBO overestimated the drop in health care coverage under the Senate replacement for Obamacare because it based its estimates on data from 2016 rather than 2017. But the thought process that led Short to say the projection was off by 7 million is an oversimplification. Until CBO redoes its analysis with the more recent data, we may not know how exactly its projections change.

Madison mayor understates Wisconsin job growth, overstates Madison-area job growth
","While being interviewed about whether he will run against Gov. Scott Walker in 2018, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin seized on an issue that Walker has tried to own: jobs. Soglin, who served as Madison’s mayor twice before, dating back to the 1970s, began his third stint at City Hall in April 2011. Walker had taken office as governor in January of that year. On the June 18, 2017 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a talk show on WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Soglin contrasted himself with Walker on how best to create jobs. And he suggested Madison is responsible for most new jobs in the state, saying: I happen to believe that the public works in partnership and that means public investment. That’s what’s happened in Madison. We have invested in education, we have invested in infrastructure. That creates jobs. But more importantly, it creates private investment.  And if you look at the Madison tax rolls, if you look at the population growth, if you look at the fact that when Governor Walker and I both took office in 2011, within three months of one another, 60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area. Clearly, we’re doing something right. And that’s not the state government or the university growing, because the governor’s cut those back. So, Soglin is referring to private-sector jobs. We wondered whether the 60,000 figure was accurate and whether Madison and the surrounding area created two-thirds of the new jobs in Wisconsin over the past seven years. Jobs, not labor force Soglin told us he based his claim on figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the civilian labor force. But that’s not a count of jobs. The labor force is the number of people who are employed plus the number who are unemployed and looking for work. Other BLS figures show a much larger increase in jobs than Soglin claimed and that the Madison area does not account for two-thirds of them. The seasonally adjusted figures show there were 2,330,000 nonfarm private-sector jobs in Wisconsin in April 2011 and 2,539,900 jobs in May 2017, the latest figures available. That’s an increase of 209,900 jobs. For the Madison area, the seasonally adjusted figures are available only for total non-farm jobs -- meaning public and private sector jobs added together. There were 361,100 jobs in April 2011 and 401,900 in May 2017. That’s an increase of 40,800. But, again, that’s counting public sector and private sector jobs, when Soglin was citing only private sector jobs. So, the Madison area produced far less than two-thirds of the new private-sector jobs. As for the labor force, the measure Soglin cited, there were 3,062,326 people either employed or unemployed and looking for work in Wisconsin in April 2011. In May 2017, the figure was 3,136,701. (These figures are not seasonally adjusted.) That’s an increase of 74,375. The figures for the Madison area (April 2017 is the latest available) were 359,132 and 389,259, an increase of 30,127. That means the Madison area accounted for about 40 percent, not two-thirds, of the increase in the labor force. Our rating Soglin says that since he and Walker took office in 2011, ""60,000 new jobs have been created in this state -- 40,000 of them were created in Madison and the Madison area."" But Soglin was citing figures for the number of people in the labor force -- that is, people who are employed plus people who are unemployed but looking for jobs. That’s not a count of jobs. The actual net increase in jobs in Wisconsin, comparing April 2011 versus May 2017, is much higher: 209,900. And the Madison area accounted for less than half of the increase.

Trump’s Pants on Fire claim that CNN ratings are ‘way down’
","Days before President Donald Trump tweeted a video of him assaulting a CNN logo, Trump took aim at another place he said CNN was hurting: its ratings. ""Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories,"" Trump tweeted June 27, before adding: ""Ratings way down!"" The reality TV star-turned-president has a well-documented fixation on television ratings that predates his time in office, and we've been checking Trump on statements about TV ratings as long ago as 2011. Since the stakes of television viewership appear to loom large in the mind of the president, we decided to look more closely at CNN’s trendline. Trump’s claim that CNN’s ratings are down raises the question: compared to what? Because his tweet made no mention of other cable news networks, we assume Trump is comparing CNN’s current ratings to past ratings. Television experts we spoke to about how to gauge CNN’s trajectory suggested we compare CNN’s numbers from one year to the next, based on data from the second quarter (in 2017, second quarter ratings went from March 27 through June 25). To get a comprehensive view, we were told to look at ratings across several benchmark metrics, broken down by audience demographics and viewing times. Bottom line: CNN is at a five-year high in each of the categories we looked at, according to data provided by the Nielsen Company. CNN Ratings Primetime, Total Viewers Primetime, 25-54 Total Day, Total Viewers Total Day, 25-54 2017 Q2 1,055,000 371,000 788,000 263,000 2016 Q2 959,000 312,000 627,000 188,000 2015 Q2 560,000 195,000 430,000 138,000 2014 Q2 459,000 156,000 341,000 105,000 2013 Q2 666,000 228,000 475,000 161,000 So when it comes to comparing CNN’s current ratings to past ratings, the verdict is clear: They’ve moved up in several major categories compared to recent years. For its part, CNN called its second-quarter figures a ""ratings milestone,"" with the cable news network tallying a record number of total viewers, and its best second quarter since 2003 in terms of total day viewership among 25-54-year olds. ""CNN just posted its most-watched second quarter in history,"" a CNN public relations account tweeted in response to Trump. ""Those are the facts.""

No, Minnesota did not pass an Islamic anti-blasphemy law. That’s fake news
","You can still find parts of the world where blaspheming Islam is punishable by fines or even death. Minnesota, however, is not among these places. Nevertheless, fake news sites like Political Mayhem claim Minnesota recently passed an Islamic anti-blasphemy law dressed up to look like a municipal hate crime hotline. ""It is not the way we roll in America, until now,"" reads one noxious fake news item. ""Minnesota has just established"" an anti-blasphemy law. We decided to hose off this dumpster fire. A hate crime hotline is not an anti-blasphemy law  Defining blasphemy is easy enough: in legal terms it’s ""any oral or written reproach maliciously cast upon God, His name, attributes, or religion."" But it strains credulity beyond the breaking point to believe a hate crime hotline set up June 19 by the city of Minneapolis is actually an Islamic anti-blasphemy law. First, opening a hotline is not how you make law. Second, this hotline is not meant for suspected crimes against Muslims only.

Travis Allen’s Mostly False claim about crime in California
","""California Must Get Tough On Crime."" That’s the message Travis Allen has proclaimed early in his campaign for governor, both on his website and in a video announcing his run. The Republican state assemblyman from Orange County announced his campaign for the high office on June 22, 2017. His website says ""California must re-establish our tough on crime policies that allow law enforcement to do their jobs and protect the victims of crimes, not the criminals."" With Allen’s focus on crime, we decided to probe a related statement he made in the  video launching his campaign. ""California needs a new vision. California needs new leadership … I have seen crime increase in every major metropolitan area,"" Allen said, adding a moment later: ""Crime is on the rise in every major market.""  Allen makes his claim at about the 0:15 minute mark of the video above.  Was Allen right? Has crime really increased in all California metros? And is it ""on the rise"" in every major market as he claimed? We set out on a fact check. Our research We asked Allen’s campaign spokeswoman for evidence to support his claim. She pointed us to several news articles that describe increases in crime from 2014 to 2015, both statewide and in large cities. They cite FBI data. Allen’s claim in the video doesn’t cite a specific timeframe for when he’s ""seen crime increase."" He does, however, attribute the uptick to criminal justice reforms passed since 2011, giving the impression that this has been a recent increase. Crime data is widely available for cities, counties and states but less so for metropolitan areas. As a result, we focused on crime in large cities and counties. The nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California has examined recent crime trends. It and other research groups have noted that 2014 was a historic low for crime in California. A PPIC analysis comparing the first half of 2014 to the same period in 2015 found widespread increases in crime rates in California cities with a population greater than 100,000. Of the 66 California cities that size, 49 saw an increase in violent crime and 48 experienced increases in property crime. Many saw double digit percent increases. ""A majority of cities saw increases in crime, but not every city,"" said Brandon Martin, who researches crime trends for PPIC, who co-authored the report. In a later report comparing the full year 2014 to 2015, the PPIC found 13 of the state’s 15 largest counties saw increases in both property and violent crime rates. Cherry-picked data? Taken alone, the crime increases in 2015 mostly support Allen’s claims. But researchers, including Martin, emphasized that California has seen dramatic long-term crime reductions since the 1990s. Allen’s statement omits this key context. SOURCE: Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, ""Urban Crime Trends Remain Stable Through California’s Policy Reform Era (2010-2016),"" February 2017. Mike Males is a senior researcher at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a policy research group that makes recommendations on alternatives to incarceration. He said citing the increases in 2015 amounts to ""cherry picking."" In a February 2017 report, Males examined more recent figures that show total crime -- or the raw number of property and violent crimes -- decreased in 41 of California’s largest 69 cities from the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015. That contradicts the portion of Allen’s statement that says ""Crime is on the rise in every major market."" Males described Allen’s overall statement as ""completely wrong,"" adding, ""certainly crime is not up in every major market."" Overall, Males’ report found total urban crime fell 3 percent in the first half of 2016, driven largely by the decrease in property crimes. His report shows more mixed results, however, when separating the rate of violent and property crimes. A majority of the major cities saw increased violent crime rates during the more recent period, while a majority saw declines in property crime rates. Related fact check In March 2017, PolitiFact California rated Half True a related statement by State Sen. Jeff Stone. The Riverside County Republican claimed violent crime in California had been on the rise since 2011, when the state started passing major criminal justice reforms. He added that violent crime had spiked 12 percent statewide in 2015. We found the violent crime rate had ticked up about 3 percent between 2011 and 2015. But that increase wasn’t consistent year-to-year. It went up slightly in 2012, dropped the next two years and then went up again in 2015. Our ruling Republican candidate for California governor Travis Allen recently claimed he’s ""seen crime increase in every major metropolitan area"" and that ""Crime is on the rise in every major market."" Allen’s claim is partially correct looking at 2015 alone. A majority of the state’s largest cities and counties saw crime ratchet up that year -- though not all of them. But Allen’s overall assertion ignores the fact that California’s crime rate was at a historic low the year prior, the result of a decades-long decline. Additionally, the second portion of his statement, that ""crime is on the rise in every major market"" is contradicted by a 2017 analysis that shows total urban crime fell 3 percent in the first half of 2016 compared with the first half of 2015. In the end, we found Allen’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate his claim Mostly False.

A hairy situation: Testing Pocan claim about Scott Walker and origins of the governor's bald spot
","Just when you thought it was safe to move on from the 2016 presidential campaign, a topic that grabbed a brief turn in the spotlight has again come to, well, a head: Gov. Scott Walker’s explanation for his bald spot. How did it resurface? Credit -- or blame -- U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, who began by ripping into Walker’s plan to make Wisconsin the first state in the nation to require needy but able-bodied adults to work and submit to drug tests to get Medicaid coverage. On June 6, 2017, Walker’s administration asked the federal government for permission to require the tests, which would apply to people seeking coverage through the state’s BadgerCare program. ""Unemployment is low, and the percentage of people working in Wisconsin is among the best in the nation,"" Walker said in a statement at the time. ""This application is a step in the right direction, and we’re continuing to build on Wisconsin’s legacy as a leader in welfare reform."" A few days later, on June 8, 2017, Pocan slammed the proposal as unoriginal during a radio  interview on ""The Thom Hartmann Program."" He was responding to a caller -- Dave from Hoffman Estates, Ill. ""This is one we’ve seen in other states,"" Pocan said. ""It just costs money. It hasn’t been proven to find people who are using drugs who are getting the money. It’s one of these demonizing tools of the poor again."" Then his policy rip, turned into this riff: ""Trust me, Scott Walker has not had an original thought in his head for a long, long time,"" Pocan said. ""The most original thing he said recently is that he got his bald spot from hitting his head on a cabinet, and it’s not a joke. He actually said his bald spot came because he hit his head on a cabinet."" To be sure, Pocan has less hair than Walker. But is Pocan right? When asked for backup, Pocan spokesman David Kolovson cited a statement from a Oct. 18, 2014, Wisconsin State Journal article:   ""The bald spot, (Walker) said, was the result of a repair incident in the kitchen when he banged his head on an open kitchen cabinet door while making repairs requested by his wife, Tonette."" Kolovson also cited a June 15, 2015, Washington Post article  that quoted Walker: ""And I wish I could grow a little bit more hair on my scar up there,"" he said, mentioning his bald spot, which he says is the result of having bumped his head while fixing a sink years ago and not natural aging. A similar statement showed up in a Sept. 4, 2015, article on BBCNews.com.   Carolyn Jacob, a board certified dermatologist, said Walker’s explanation is not outside the realm of the possible. ""It really depends on if he actually cut his scalp on the cabinet,"" said Jacob, a medical doctor and director of Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. ""A scar would form and would not grow hair."" ""However,"" Jacob continued, ""if he suddenly developed a circular spot in the same area, it may be unrelated but coincidental. We often see alopecia areata (circle/patches of hair loss) on patients, and no one knows why anyone gets it."" Another expert, Ronda Farah, a medical doctor and assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Minnesota, also spoke in general terms and not directly about Walker. She said an injury or trauma to the head could cause a bald spot. ""If you have trauma to the head that leaves a scar, you could definitely get a bald spot."" Farah said. ""In general, I have seen hair loss at areas of trauma and scarring on the body and scalp."" A spokesman for Walker’s office did not respond to a request  for comment. Our rating Pocan claimed Walker recently said ""he got his bald spot from hitting his head on a cabinet, and it's not a joke, he actually said that his bald spot came because he hit his head on a cabinet."" Walker did make that claim, but it surfaced two years ago, during the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign. So it was not as recent as Pocan indicated. Nor was it as farfetched as he suggested, at least according to two experts on hair loss. We rate Pocan’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jul/03/mark-pocan/hairy-situation-testing-mark-pocan-claim-about-sco/

Marco Rubio wrong to conclude that Senate bill won't lead to Medicaid decline in Florida
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says reports that Floridians will be kicked off of Medicaid under the Senate health care bill are misleading. ""As long as Florida keeps the same amount of funding or gets an increase, which is what we are working on, per patient being rewarded for having done the right thing -- there is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid. None,"" he said in a Facebook Live on June 28. ""In fact, I asked the governor that point-blank, I asked the legislative leaders that point-blank. They have no plans, even if this bill passes, to kick anybody out of current services."" Really -- no reason? We can’t know for certain what changes Florida will make to its Medicaid program down the road if the Senate bill becomes law. However, Rubio is making too strong of a vow here that there is no reason for anyone to lose Medicaid benefits. Here’s what we know: the Senate bill slows the rate of Medicaid dollars that the federal government gives to the states. This will force states to make tough choices, one potential being cutting enrollment. Some of the changes won’t happen for many years, delaying those choices for states. We contacted Rubio’s office but did not get a reply. (Rubio, who has long criticized Obamacare, hasn’t clearly stated if he will vote for the Senate health care bill. It was unclear as of June 30 when any potential new version would appear and when it would be brought up for a vote.) CBO and experts predict Medicaid enrollment declines Medicaid is the health care program for the poor funded by the federal government and the states. Under the Affordable Care Act, about 31 states agreed to financial incentives to expand eligibility for Medicaid. Florida rejected expansion. Currently about 4.4 million Floridians are on Medicaid or CHIP, a program for children. The Senate bill also provides additional money that might come to Florida. For states that didn't expand Medicaid, nationwide there would be up to $2 billion a year, and potentially other new funds aimed at hospitals with a high percentage of poor patients. But the Senate bill takes several steps to restrain future Medicaid spending. While the impact is greater on states that expanded Medicaid by making federal payments less generous, non-expansion states will also take a hit. The bill ends the open-ended promise for the federal government to cover a certain percentage of a state’s costs. Instead, the bill converts federal Medicaid funding to a per-person cap and limits growth in federal spending beginning in 2020. In 2025, it shifts to a different consumer price index, which has a lower inflation factor than is used today. That will without a doubt be a lower rate than underlying cost growth, and the gap will grow each year, said Matthew Buettgens, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. Medicaid spending goes up whether the current Affordable Care Act remains in place or if the House or Senate versions become law. However, the Republican health care bills slow the rate of spending. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that total Medicaid spending from the Senate bill would be about $770 billion less than under current law over the next decade, leading to an enrollment decline of 15 million. The Urban Institute estimated the decline in federal dollars and enrollment for the states. It found for Florida, that federal funding for Medicaid under ACA would be $16.8 billion in 2022. Under the Senate legislation, it would fall to about $14.6 billion, or a cut of about 13 percent (see table 6). The Urban Institute projects 353,000 fewer people on Medicaid or CHIP in Florida. The gap in funding is largely driven by enrollment numbers. Under the ACA, the federal government takes steps to actively recruit people to sign up for Medicaid, even in states that didn’t expand the program. The Republican Senate bill doesn’t have that same goal to spread the word about Medicaid eligibility. In fact, it aims to curtail sign ups. Here are a few ways it sets out to do that: Mandatory six-month eligibility checks that could reduce enrollment Takes away the right of hospitals to make presumptive-eligibility determinations Limits the effective date for retroactive coverage of Medicaid benefits to the month in which the applicant applied (currently it is a three-month window) There is no doubt that the Senate bill leads to cuts that will affect Florida, said experts on Medicaid spending, including Buettgens; Joan Alker, an expert at Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy; and Elizabeth Carpenter, senior vice president at Avalere Health, a consulting group. Alker said the cap will result in all states making substantial cuts to their Medicaid program. Those would likely be even bigger in the second years after the CBO window. The cuts will force states to fill the gap in some way that could include any combination of these options: cutting enrollment or benefits, reducing provider payments, cutting other areas of the budget or raising taxes. ""While it is impossible to say exactly what states will do, they will only have bad choices — especially those like Florida that are starting with low per capita spending very much below the national average,"" Alker said. Florida would likely reduce monthly payments to health plans leading providers to reduce the number of Medicaid patients they serve or stop serving them all together, said Jeffrey Harman, a professor in the Department of Behavioral Sciences & Social Medicine at Florida State University. ""Recent cuts in Medicaid payments to specialists in Texas has left many Texans that rely on Medicaid without access to specialty care, which can have life and death consequences,"" Harman said. ""I believe similar effects would be seen in Florida."" Rubio said that Scott and legislative leaders told him they won’t cut services, but those decisions will lie with a future governor and legislators years from now. Other experts pointed us to the Urban Institute’s analysis but we’ll note that a separate group, the liberal Center for American Progress, cited an even higher number by using a different methodology that factored in potential expansion. Rubio challenged the center’s prediction that 1 million Floridians will lose Medicaid by 2026. Our ruling Rubio said, ""There is no reason for anybody to be losing any of their current benefits under Medicaid."" Rubio is wrong to state that benefit cuts are off the table. There are reasons that Medicaid recipients could lose benefits if the Senate bill becomes law. The bill curbs the rate of spending by the federal government over the next decade and caps dollar amounts and ultimately reduces the inflation factor. Those changes will put pressure on states to make difficult choices including the possibility of cutting services.
