Rick Scott says Charlie Crist favors violent felons immediately getting their right to vote restored
","As part of his appeal to black voters, Charlie Crist has defended his record on making it easier for nonviolent felons to regain the right to vote. Crist and Gov. Rick Scott argued about restoration of civil rights during the Oct. 21 debate on CNN. ""When I was governor, I brought restoration of rights back for nonviolent felons so they can have a chance to get a job,"" Crist said. ""Sadly, under Rick Scott it's gone, and it's gone for at least five years, you can't even apply."" That set off a testy back-and-forth exchange: Scott: ""Here's Charlie's plan. You commit a heinous crime, as soon as you get out of jail, you get to vote. Stalk, you get to vote as soon as you walk out. You have intentional permanent disfigurement of a child, you walk out of jail, you immediately get to vote. That's wrong, Charlie."" Crist: ""That is fundamentally unfair. I said nonviolent criminals. You are lying again."" Scott: ""No, that's not true. Go to FactsforFlorida.com, Charlie. You want to look yourself, you can look it up. That's exactly what you did. And I completely disagree with that."" Crist: ""It's very unfair. Go to his site if you want to, but I would recommend that you go to FairShotFlorida.com instead, and you'll find out the truth. What he just said is absolutely false."" Well, we recommend that if you want facts, go to politifact.com/florida. (We're glad you're here!) Does Crist want violent offenders to immediately regain their right to vote?  In a word, no. Restoration of rights under Crist Since 1968, the Cabinet has held the power to restore rights to felons with various governors making changes to make it harder or easier. Those changes did not always fall on party lines: Democrat Lawton Chiles tightened the rules, while Republican Jeb Bush simplified the process, though advocates pushed for additional reforms. In April 2007 under Crist’s direction, Crist and the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. (Crist was a Republican at the time; he is now running as a Democrat to get his old job back.) Crist defended the move in a 2007 op-ed: ""Some who favor the current system argue that restoring civil rights is somehow 'weak on crime,’ as if restoring the right to vote, to serve on a jury or to work lessens the punishment or encourages a person to commit new crimes. In fact, the opposite should be true. Giving a person a meaningful way to re-enter society, make a living and participate in our democracy will encourage good behavior."" Under the 2007 changes, there were specific rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back. All of them had to first finish the terms of their sentence, including probation and restitution. About 80 percent of felons were potentially eligible to quickly regain their civil rights without hearings, the Tampa Bay Times reported when the new rules were approved. The offenders convicted of more serious crimes, such as murders, had to take additional steps to apply to get their rights restored, including attending a formal hearing. • Level 1: Offenders convicted of less serious felonies such as burglary, DUI or selling drugs had cases reviewed for eligibility and the Clemency Board could sign off on restoring rights without holding a hearing. This was nearly automatic. • Level 2: Offenders included those convicted of aggravated battery, felony stalking, or trafficking in cocaine. An investigation was required to determine eligibility, and the board had 30 days to review the results, but the state did not hold a hearing. • Level 3: Offenders included murderers and sexual predators. Those cases required a more thorough investigation, and they had to appear at a hearing. There was another path for offenders -- at any level -- to get their rights restored. If they had completed all the terms of their sentence, including probation and paying restitution, and were crime-free and arrest-free for 15 years, they could apply to have their rights restored. We asked the state how many of the 156,000 restorations that occurred under the Crist rules fell into each category and were not able to obtain that information. Most of the offender records are confidential. Those felons who had their rights restored ""could indeed be described as largely nonviolent,"" said Mark Schlakman, senior program director for The Florida State University Center for the Advancement of Human Rights. (Schlakman is a supporter of restoring felons’ civil rights.) But it’s likely that some committed a violent offense at some point, said a leading researcher of felon disenfranchisement. ""I haven’t examined the Florida restorations enough to know if anybody with any violent arrest ever had their civil rights restored, but I suspect that’s the case,"" said University of Minnesota sociologist Christopher Uggen. In 2011, at the urging of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Scott and the Cabinet reversed the policy under Crist and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period for nonviolent felons. During Scott’s tenure through mid September, restorations have been granted to 1,589 people. We asked a spokesman for Crist’s campaign, Kevin Cate, if Crist wants to bring back the three tiers. ""He will work with the Cabinet to bring back a fair and just process for nonviolent, reformed felons to regain their civil rights,"" Cate said. Scott says Crist’s policy included violent offenders Scott told the debate audience that felons who committed these ""heinous"" crimes could walk out of jail and immediately get to vote. But no one got their rights restored automatically as they walked out of jail. All offenders had to complete their sentences, including probation and paying restitution, before they were eligible. For even the lowest level of offenders, the state still had to review their cases for eligibility and the Clemency Board had to sign off on them. The state policy under Crist included a list of certain serious violent offenses, such as murder, that excluded felons from going through the faster process to get their rights restored without a formal hearing. But Scott spokesman Greg Blair noted that several violent offenses were not on that list -- leaving open the possibility that violent felons could access the faster process to get their rights restored. That includes battery or abuse of an elderly person, possessing or discharging a firearm on school property, threatening a witness, injuring or killing a police dog, resisting arrest with violence or animal torture. ""You can ask a legal expert which of those are technically classified as ‘violent,’ though I can say with some certainty that nursing home abuse and battery on the elderly count. And resisting arrest with violence, that one’s in the name. So yes, violent criminals could receive restoration of rights under Charlie Crist,"" Blair argued. Our ruling Scott said that Crist wants felons who commit ""a heinous crime"" such as ""intentional permanent disfigurement of a child"" to walk out of jail and immediately get the right to vote. The Cabinet under Crist made it easier for felons to get their rights restored, but they didn’t regain those rights immediately after leaving jail. The offenders had to complete the terms of their sentence, including probation, to qualify. And then the Clemency Board had to sign off on the restorations. The most serious violent offenders had to undergo an investigation and hearing. The only kernel of truth here is that it is possible that some felons who had committed violent crimes got their rights restored, but it wasn’t immediately upon leaving jail. So we rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-charlie-crist-favors-violent-felon/

Blog: Rand Paul wanted 'big cut in the CDC' in 2011
","We don’t know yet if the Ebola scare will help either party or be an afterthought in the midterm elections, but liberal blogger Doug Muder argued that confronting Ebola shows that it makes sense to vote Democratic. For Muder, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul is the poster child for a distinct partisan contrast. ""Ebola points out why we need a fully funded government,"" Muder wrote. ""When there’s no immediate threat of disease, government agencies like the CDC look like bureaucratic waste. When Rand Paul put out a ‘Tea Party budget’ in 2011, it included a big cut in the CDC, and virtually no explanation as to how this would affect its mission."" In this fact-check, we look at whether Paul proposed a ""big cut"" in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Muder had blogged about Paul’s budget in 2011. Back then, Muder asked how the CDC would be able to fulfill its mission if, as Paul wanted, its budget was cut by $1.165 billion. We went back to Paul’s original budget documents. One posted January 2011 called for the $1.165 billion reduction that Muder mentioned. Paul then assembled a more complete budget plan in May 2011.  It would cut the CDC budget by 20 percent from its Fiscal Year 2008 levels. Depending on whether you include special funds to evaluate federal health programs, Congress appropriated between $6.049 billion and $6.375 billion for the CDC in FY 2008. So Rand’s 20 percent reduction amounts to either $1.209 billion or $1.275 billion in cuts. That’s slightly more than Muder described. Paul wrote in his plan, ""The center is often mentioned in media reports highlighting their lavish accommodations. For example, in 2005, the CDC built a conference center for $106 million, complete with large-screen plasma TVs. They also spent tens of millions of dollars on state-of-the-art anti-gravity seating for employees, as well as luxury furniture. Taxpayers can no longer afford the luxury working atmosphere of the CDC."" That budget plan remains posted on the website randpaul2016.com, Paul's Senate re-election website. Brian Darling, a Paul spokesman, agreed that the senator has proposed these cuts in the past, but said that funding and the ability to fight Ebola don’t inevitably go hand-in-hand. ""If you look closely at the CDC budget, there are funds that have been wasted on projects that have nothing to do with disease prevention,"" Darling said. Darling then noted that Congress has been at least as supportive of the CDC as the Obama administration. Darling said that in an omnibus spending bill, Congress appropriated $6.9 billion for the CDC, about $240 million more than the administration requested. Darling highlighted another $88 million for Ebola in a continuing resolution bill approved in September. However, neither action undercuts Muder’s point, and Paul voted against both measures. It’s important to remember that those bills doled out money across many government agencies, not specifically for the CDC alone. Sometimes reasonable people can quibble over whether a cut is ""big"" or not. In this case, Paul himself called his cuts ""serious"" in a 2011 op-ed he penned for the Wall Street Journal. ""My proposal, not surprisingly, has been greeted skeptically in Washington, where serious spending cuts are a rarity,"" Paul wrote. ""But it is a modest proposal when measured against the size of our mounting debt."" Our ruling Muder said that in 2011 Sen. Paul proposed cutting the CDC budget by $1.165 billion. Budget documents confirm that. In fact, Paul’s most detailed budget that year would have trimmed CDC spending by slightly more, about $1.2 billion. While the Senate approved two broad spending measures to fund the CDC in 2014, Paul voted against both.

Is the Ebola virus 'incredibly contagious' and 'easy to catch,' like Rand Paul says?
","Count Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., among Republicans who don’t think the White House has taken the Ebola threat seriously enough. While campaigning for Republicans in New Hampshire on Oct. 16, Paul told Concord News Radio that President Barack Obama ""has so tried to downplay the transmissibility of"" the Ebola virus that it’s putting people at risk. ""This is an incredibly contagious disease,"" Paul said. ""People in full gloves and gowns are getting it. So really they need to be honest — this is a very transmissible disease."" Paul added: ""They’re still learning about this. We’re all still learning about this. But this is not something that is hard to catch, this is something that appears to be very easy to catch."" Is the Ebola virus ""incredibly contagious,"" ""very transmissible"" and ""easy to catch""? We decided to check it out. Paul’s office said his comments implied that he was talking about how easy it is to get the virus from contact with an infected individual. In a lengthy response to PolitiFact, spokesman Brian Darling said that ""exposure to even a small amount of virus can cause infection."" The 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa is the largest in history, according to the World Health Organization. It’s also the first time the virus has made its way to the United States; health officials confirmed the fourth U.S. case Thursday in a doctor returning to New York from treating Ebola patients in West Africa. So far, though, only two individuals — both Texas health care workers that treated an African man who later died from the disease — have contracted the virus on U.S. soil. This despite the fact that infected individuals have come into contact with dozens, if not hundreds, of people while they purportedly had the disease, including close family members. That seems to dispel, at least anecdotally, the idea that the disease is ""incredibly contagious"" and ""easy to catch,"" even from an infected person. But let’s get into the nitty gritty. How does Ebola spread? Ebola is not an airborne infection. For example, it is rare — if it’s even possible at all — that the disease would spread through coughing or sneezing (which are not even symptoms of Ebola, as our colleagues at PunditFact recently noted). According to the World Health Organization, Ebola spreads through ""human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people."" This means that the most common way Ebola is spread is direct contact with vomit, blood or fecal matter of an infected patient. Individuals who have such contact are at high risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says ""being within approximately 3 feet of an (Ebola) patient or within the patient’s room or care area for a prolonged period of time,"" is also potential cause for concern. But the organization noted the risk is low. There is also potential risk of transmission through contaminated surfaces and objects, however the World Health Organization notes the danger is, again, low, and most studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that ""all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients."" Finally, experts note that individuals are not infectious — meaning they cannot spread the virus — until they are showing symptoms, which takes between 2 and 21 days. Symptoms start with a fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. So to be at a high risk of contracting Ebola, you need to come into contact with the blood, feces or vomit of someone who is showing symptoms. The number of people who find themselves in this situation are relatively small. There is potential for it to spread other ways — such as being in close range with someone who has the disease or touching an object contaminated by an infected person — but the risk is low, because ""as an enveloped virus, it has a low tendency to stay viable outside the body,"" said Thomas Fekete, a professor of infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. ""And because it is not aerosolized it isn't especially easy to catch through the respiratory tract."" How contagious is it? The CDC defines contagious as ""a very communicable disease capable of spreading rapidly from one person to another by contact or close proximity."" In Africa, the disease has claimed so many victims because of poor health systems that lack supplies and safeguards and because of burial practices where people directly handle bodies without necessary protections. This is what caused such a large outbreak there. Burials are especially problematic because the near dead or recently dead have very high levels of the virus and are ""very infectious as a result,"" said Christopher Whalen, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Georgia College of Public Health. But even in the worst outbreak Africa has experienced, health care officials have noted that the disease does not spread from one host to many others. The basic reproduction number, or R0, of a disease is calculated as the average number of secondary cases resulting from an infected individual entering an uninfected population. The higher the R0 is above 1, the greater the chances it has of spreading. The R0 of the Ebola virus in Africa during the recent outbreak has ranged from 1.20 to 2.02, depending on the country. That’s in line with historical data on the disease. How does that compare to other viruses? Well, HIV, which is only transmitted by sexual intercourse and blood transfers, has a R0 of 4. The measles has a R0 of 18. Meaning, while the disease has the potential to spread, ""minimum requirements for the containment of Ebola are far less severe than for the containment of more contagious diseases, such as measles,"" according to the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team. Rachael Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago School of Public Health, told PolitiFact: ""The epidemiological evidence suggests that Ebola is less infectious than many other viruses that commonly affect people, such as influenza.""   What if you come in contact with someone who has Ebola? Ebola is ""easy to catch"" in the sense that you don't need prolonged contact with infected fluids to pick it up, Fekete said. However, not many people come in contact with these infected fluids. And, the evidence shows some people who do spend time around an infected patient don’t get the virus, either. ""It seems as though even a brief exposure to the virus can lead to a transmission event, as some patients describe one contact event with an ill patient,"" Whalen said. ""But, on the other side, think of all of the family members of Ebola patients who were exposed in the household of a case, but didn’t develop the disease. We tend not to hear about them, yet they constitute an important part of our understanding the attack rate."" But Paul’s spokesman, Darling, argued, ""The reason why doctors and nurses who come into contact with an infected individual wear 100 percent protection then have to go through a thorough disinfection process, is because it is ‘easy to catch’ from somebody who is showing symptoms."" That’s not necessarily the case, according to health experts we spoke with. For one, health care workers are in close contact with infected individuals at their most infectious state and are handling bodily fluids known to carry higher concentrations of the virus. That puts them at greater risk than someone sitting next to a person who is infected, even if that person is showing symptoms. Further, unlike much more contagious diseases, Ebola causes death in 50 percent of patients. That sparks extra precaution. ""These recommendations arise from the seriousness of the infection, not from the infectivity of the pathogen,"" Jones said. Given the high mortality rate from the disease, if it was ""incredibly contagious"" and ""easy to catch,"" the United States would likely have more deaths already. ""The joke that more Americans have been married to Kim Kardashian than have died of Ebola would not be true if it were so easy to catch,"" Fekete said. Our ruling Paul called Ebola ""incredibly contagious,"" ""very transmissible"" and ""easy to catch."" A person who comes into contact with bodily fluids from an Ebola patient for a short period can contract the virus. In that limited sense, Ebola is ""easy to catch."" Health care workers and individuals handling patients at or near death are also at greater risk, because that appears to be when the disease is at its most infectious, experts said. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that Ebola is less contagious and transmissible than many other diseases. By the numbers, Ebola patients go on to infect relatively few people. This is because a patient only spreads the disease while showing symptoms; the virus cannot be spread through the air; and people don’t often come into contact with the bodily fluids of other individuals. Contracting the disease through other methods, like touching surfaces or standing close to infected patients, while possible, are rare and present a low risk. Ebola is a serious and deadly disease that is absolutely capable of spreading if necessary precautions aren’t taken. But in using words like ""incredibly,"" ""very"" and ""easy,"" Paul vastly inflates the virus’ ability to move from person to person. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/27/rand-paul/ebola-virus-incredibly-contagious-and-easy-catch-r/

Rand Paul says NIH spent $2.4 million on 'origami' condoms
","During a recent visit to Virginia, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul took exception to claims that budget cuts have hurt the National Institute of Health’s efforts to find a cure for Ebola. The Kentucky Republican was the headliner at an Oct. 15 rally in Ashland for Dave Brat, the GOP nominee for the 7th District congressional seat. Paul, a Tea Party favorite, said NIH has money to waste. ""Do you know what the NIH spends money on?"" he asked the crowd. Paul listed a series of NIH projects he viewed as profligate. ""$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on ‘origami’ condoms,""  he said. ""This is a family crowd, so I’m not getting into what that means."" But we will. We wondered if his claim is correct. Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper to form animals, flowers and other designs, according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. We struggled to imagine how this centuries-old craft might improve the condom. Paul’s office backed the senator’s statement by sending us several articles about NIH’s funding of condom research, the earliest one published by the Washington Free Beacon this March. Turns out, there’s a California company, named ORIGAMI, that’s vowing to reinvent the condom, a contraceptive that many men don’t like. The company believes the popularity of condoms  -- which must be unrolled and are typically made of latex -- would greatly improve if they were more pleasing, less cumbersome and safer to use. ORIGAMI is developing condom with accordion-like pleats. They’re made of silicone and, because they’re loose-fitting and don’t have to be unrolled, can be put on faster than traditional condoms. The company is seeking FDA approval and hopes sell its product next year. A number of global health organizations are encouraging condom research and development, convinced that greater use of devices will lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDs. Since 2006, NIH has awarded seven grants totaling almost $2.5 million to help develop male and female ORIGAMI condoms. The money was provided to Strata Various, a product design firm headed by Danny Resnic, ORIGAMI’s founder. Resnic is listed on the grant documents as the project leader of the research. ORIGAMI’s work has been praised by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which last year handed out $1.1 million in grants other entrepreneurs seeking to improve condoms. The Foundation said ORIGAMI ""provides an excellent example of a private enterprise focused on new condom design to promote consistent use by emphasizing the sexual experience."" Now, let’s return to Paul’s speech. The senator, in lamenting the use of public funds to develop  ""origami’ condoms,"" never defined the difference between the folded paper art and the name of a company. We asked Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, whether his boss was referring to Origami with a capital ""O,"" meaning the company, or a small ""o,"" meaning the art form. ""The senator’s words speak for themselves,"" Darling replied in an email. ""I don’t understand the confusion."" The day before he appeared in Ashland, Paul spelled origami with a small ""o"" in Facebook post and a tweet assailing NIH’s spending. ""NIH blames tightening federal budget for its inability to produce #Ebolavaccine, but somehow found $2.4 million to develop 'origami' condoms designed with Japanese folding paper in mind,"" Paul wrote on his Facebook page. He tweeted, ""@NIH cant afford #Ebola vaccine bc of 'budget cuts' but can spend $2.4 mill to develop 'origami' condoms #Priorities http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-"" So what does the company have to say about all this? Mark Bardwell, an ORIGAMI spokesman, defended the grants, saying they are given out ""based on scientific merit."" ""Condoms are considered a medical device. As such, it must pass FDA safety testing standards through clinical trials that are very expensive,"" Bardwell said. ""An innovation condom could take 3-4 years and several million dollars for R&D and human testing."" Our ruling In trying to document waste at NIH, Paul said the health agency spent $2.4 million on ""origami"" condoms. Paul didn’t provide any more information in his speech, leaving the crowd to wonder whether tax dollars are going to the development of paper condoms folded into fancy shapes. What he didn’t say is that ORIGAMI is the name of a company that has received the NIH grants to develop an improved condom that is made of silicone and has fold-out pleats. NIH has long encouraged  condom use to reduce unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. We don’t find much fault with Paul, however. The company, by its very name, suggests the principles of origami drive its design. So we rate Paul’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/oct/27/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-nih-spent-24-million-origami-condom/

Scott Walker says Mary Burke supported 18 percent tuition increase
","Reaching out to students and their check-writing parents, Gov. Scott Walker is promising another tuition freeze at UW System schools. And now in the final weeks of his re-election showdown with Democrat Mary Burke, the first-term Republican is blaming her for past tuition hikes. ""With two sons in college, I know how hard it is to pay for school,"" Walker says in a TV ad released Oct. 20, 2014. ""That’s why we froze tuition at UW campuses. I want to freeze it again in my next term. My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent."" In the campaign, Burke has said she’d like to freeze tuition -- but only if more aid can go to the University of Wisconsin System at the same time. She’s emphasized larger income tax deductions for tuition and refinancing student loans. But, looking back, is the governor right about Burke’s support of policies that led to an 18 percent increase? Let’s hit the books. Walker’s evidence The ad itself lists no footnote as evidence for the 18 percent figure and does not cite any specific policies backed by Burke, who served as head of the state Commerce Department under Gov. Jim Doyle from 2005 to 2007. A Walker campaign news release about the ad simply offers the history of UW tuition increases approved in state budgets back to 1967, and Burke’s statement to a reporter in April 2005 that she supports Doyle’s positions ""entirely."" A campaign spokesperson pointed us to Burke’s general praise of two of Doyle’s budgets in place during her state government career.  None of that makes any direct link between Burke and tuition hikes. That’s not surprising, given that Burke’s job was to grant and track state aid to businesses, not run    the UW System, which sets tuition rates in conjunction with lawmakers and the governor. We did a search of news stories from the time and found no statements by Burke about raising tuition. She did, in 2007, praise a Doyle budget investment in more financial aid to help families better afford college. More broadly, Burke promoted Doyle’s overall 2007-’09 budget as a ""smart, responsible budget for Wisconsin businesses"" that is ""fiscally responsible, identifies our priorities for success, and invests in those priorities"" while including ""more than a dozen separate tax cuts, saving the taxpayers and businesses of Wisconsin $1.7 billion."" Tuition history There’s no doubt UW tuition rose rapidly in the Doyle era, which ran from 2003 through 2010. Tuition rates jumped 18 percent his first year, and 15 percent the second. But that was in the 2003-’04 and 2004-’05 school years -- before Burke arrived. After that, increases ranged from 0 percent to 9.3 percent, depending on the year and whether it was a four-year or two-year school, UW-Madison or UW-Milwaukee. Increases were capped at about 5 percent for several years. When Doyle took office, tuition at the system’s flagship UW-Madison campus was $3,854. When he left in 2010 it was $7,933. If you look specifically at Burke’s time in state government, tuition rose 19 percent in those three years, with some variations for different UW campuses. Under Walker, tuition went up 11 percent over his first two years, then was frozen for 2013-’14 and 2014-’15. The difference -- and it’s a big one -- is that Walker directly controlled those changes while Burke had little or nothing to do with them. We’ve been here before. In March 2014, we rated False a Republican Party of Wisconsin claim it was Burke’s budget in 2007-’09 that contained a series of tax hikes. We concluded it is off base to put responsibility for the state budget and its thousands of provisions on an appointed cabinet secretary. Likewise, it is wrong to blame a secretary for spending changes in another department. Our rating Walker said, ""My opponent supported policies that increased tuition by 18 percent."" Burke was in state government when that happened, but Walker offers no evidence that she backed tuition hikes other than Burke lauding her boss as she went to work for Doyle. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/27/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mary-burke-supported-18-percent-/

Deal overstates Georgia as tops in black elected officials
","Both incumbent Republican Nathan Deal and Democrat Jason Carter have tried to woo black voters in their tense race to be Georgia’s next governor. Those voters now make up almost one-third of the state’s active voters – and their turnout could decide the close race in next week’s election. Democrats are trying to boost turnout in the voting block that traditionally supports them in part with a mailer that urges African-Americans to vote ""if you want to prevent another Ferguson."" Deal called the flier ""despicable"" and a failed attempt to compare Georgia to the Missouri town roiled by protests following the shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. ""Georgia has elected more African-American leaders -- mayors, county commissioners, et cetera -- than any other state in the country,"" Deal said in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story. ""We have a long history of good race relations, and I cannot understand why the Democrat Party of Georgia would try to destroy it."" Does the Peach State lead the nation in the number of black elected officials? That’s a claim that cried out for testing on the Truth-O-Meter. We began, as we always do, by asking the Deal campaign for its source. Spokeswoman Jen Talaber wrote in an email that ""Georgia has historically been a leader in African American officeholders,"" citing a 1987 publication that ranked it among the top five states for that distinction. She also pointed to a 2013 story in which the head of the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials counted 1,000-plus members, ""outnumbering the top three states listed in the aforementioned survey."" But GABEO’s website says that the group is open to members of all races, as well as candidates and previous officeholders. Membership does not reflect a current tally of black elected officials. And PolitiFact, in trying to back up the governor’s statement, found similar metrics that put Georgia high but not at the top. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a liberal Washington think tank that focuses on issues of race, prepared annual reports on the number of black officials in every possible office between 1970 and 2002. Those reports consistently showed more blacks served in elected offices in Southern states than anywhere else in the nation. But in specific states, the numbers varied. In 2000, when Democrats still dominated state and local politics, Georgia had 582 black elected officeholders on every level, said Dianne Pinderhughes, a professor of Africana studies and political science at the University of Notre Dame. By 2002, the last year available, that number had grown to 611. But both years Georgia lagged behind neighboring Alabama, with 731 black officials in 2000 and 756 in 2002. And consistently, nearby Mississippi led the nation, with 897 in 2000 and 892 black elected officials in 2002. ""Georgia certainly isn’t No. 1 and never has been,"" said David A. Bositis, the senior political analyst at the center who wrote the yearly reports. The same is true when examining more recent figures that tally only state and local data, not all elected positions. Georgia had 452 black leaders in all state and local offices, according to the Gender and Multi-Cultural Leadership Project, which examines demographics in politics. The figures are based on data from 2006 for all offices except governor and lieutenant governor, which are from 2007. Based on those figures, Louisiana had 467 black elected officials at the time, and Alabama had 498. Mississippi was again the national leader, with 530 black state and local elected officials. Bositis, who now works as an independent researcher on the issues of race in politics, said more recent data are not available largely because research funding dried up. But he cautioned that the figures alone are not necessarily something states should boast about. The reports show that Mississippi largely leads because it has the highest black population in the country and therefore has several small jurisdictions with all-black elected leadership, he said. By comparison, Colorado is just 4 percent black but has had two black lieutenant governors and a black speaker of the House in its history. ""I don’t think there are any states in the South that can boast about race relations,"" Bositis said. Yet that is exactly what both parties are doing in the tight battle for governor. Membership in a black political group does not translate into data to support Deal’s claim about the number of black elected officials in Georgia. Both Deal and PolitiFact Georgia found research, though, that consistently contradicts his claim. Georgia consistently ranks among states with the most such elected leaders, but it has not been at the top. The only thing that keeps this from being outright wrong is the lack of more recent data.

Claim: Rand Paul's budget would cut military in half
","Midterm elections are less than two weeks away, but the Sunday political shows were already peeking ahead to the 2016 presidential field. On ABC’s This Week, host Martha Raddatz asked a panel of pundits and politicians what impact Monica Lewinsky’s recent foray back into the national scene would have on Hillary Clinton’s chances. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who said he was a teenager when the Lewinsky scandal broke, didn’t bite and instead weighed in on the GOP hopefuls. ""I think on 2016, by the way, I'd love to see Jeb (Bush). I'd love to see Chris Christie. I think Paul Ryan would be a great candidate,"" Kinzinger said. ""The one person I don't want to see is somebody like a Rand Paul who has put out budgets to cut the military in half. I think that would be devastating for our party right now."" That’s a tough critique of Paul by Kinzinger, an Iraq war veteran, but is it accurate? Rand Paul budget: Version 1.0 In his first year in the Senate in 2011, Paul introduced a proposal that was intended to drastically cut spending to balance the budget by 2016. To do so, Paul took measures to cut entire departments like the Department of Education, turn Medicaid and food stamps into block-grant programs and, yes, include a ""draw-down and restructuring of the Department of Defense."" ""The resources and funding we provide to our national defense are unprecedented, however,"" Paul wrote. ""Military funding has often far outpaced not only our most likely enemies, but has often outpaced the entire world’s military spending combined."" He went on to say that the ""structure of the U.S. military continues to reflect the build up during the Cold War,"" and proposed scaling back military personnel by not filling vacancies created by turnover, reducing overseas presence, and transition control of Iraq and Afghanistan to local governments. The end result? Defense outlays would drop from $712 billion in 2011 to $641 billion in 2012 and continue to fall to $548 billion in 2016. Paul accomplishes this largely by cutting overseas operational costs and war spending from $159 billion to nothing by 2016. The rest of the defense budget drops a bit but actually remains relatively flat. Overall, Paul’s budget represents a reduction in defense spending of about 23 percent compared to 2011 levels. That’s significant, but far from the 50 percent cut Kinzinger claimed. However, that’s not the only way to look at spending reductions. Department costs typically trend up annually automatically due to inflation, increases in the costs of production, raises, etc. The Congressional Budget Office, the top fiscal scorekeeper used by lawmakers, projected that defense spending would jump from $712 billion in 2011 to $773 billion by 2016. That’s about $225 billion more than Paul would have spent in 2016. In that sense, Paul reduces annual defense spending by about 30 percent. Still not close to ""half."" Paul’s budget went nowhere in the Senate. Only seven Senators voted for it with 90 rejecting it. Kinzinger’s office told PolitiFact that ""a roughly 25 percent cut would reduce capabilities by roughly twice the overall number."" Why? Because so much of the defense budget is fixed and can’t be reduced. The part that can be reduced, discretionary defense spending, is therefore taking twice the hit. Rand Paul budget: Version 2.0 A new budget proposal emerged from Paul in 2013: ""A Clear Vision to Revitalize America."" It emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into place. Those sequester cuts dramatically reduce non-war defense spending significantly during the next decade. The updated version of Paul’s budget again sought to balance the budget over the next five years. However, defense spending was somewhat spared, at least compared to the first incarnation and compared to the new budget projections post-sequestration. Under Paul’s budget, defense appropriations would go from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. So Paul’s final budget actually shows an increase in spending over the CBO’s 2014 projections, though, it’s about $100 billion less than what they project for 2023. Paul’s office noted, though, that this is because war spending is, again, reduced to zero (on the assumption, at the time, the United States was winding down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- so why include $100 billion annually for war spending?). The CBO projects that without war spending, the U.S. will spend $497 billion in 2014 and $589 billion in 2021. Paul’s baseline numbers for the defense department are higher than those figures. Our ruling Kinzinger claimed that Paul ""has put out budgets to cut the military in half."" In 2011, Paul released a budget proposal that reduced annual defense spending quite significantly, but not anywhere near 50 percent. There are different ways to measure the reductions, but they’re in the range of 25 to 30 percent. Paul later unveiled another budget that actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth. Both Paul budgets also eliminated funding in the defense budget for war spending and overseas operations based on the assumption that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were winding down. Lawmakers can argue whether that was prudent, however, it’s important context.

Did Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan enter the United States with an elevated temperature?
","How much airport Ebola screening is too much? That was the big question on the Sunday talk shows Oct. 26. Over the weekend, New York, New Jersey and Illinois upped their Ebola screening guidelines, quarantining anyone passing through John F. Kennedy, Newark and Chicago-O'Hare international airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they’re not showing symptoms. The guidelines surpass federal regulations and have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, arguing that they are unnecessary. JFK, Newark and O'Hare already have screening processes, along with three other American airports, (more on that later) and people who aren’t showing symptoms aren’t contagious, experts say. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said New York and New Jersey’s quarantine might be unnecessary. But that doesn’t change the fact that the country’s Ebola screening hasn’t been adequate so far -- it missed Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed in the United States, who died Oct. 8. ""We had Mr. Duncan come in (to the United States) with an elevated temperature. We weren’t checking it, and now we’re playing catch-up,"" Issa said. The New York and New Jersey guidelines were put in place after a doctor in New York City tested positive for the disease Oct. 23. He arrived in New York Oct. 17 from Guinea, where he had been treating Ebola patients, and had been checking his temperature twice a day. It doesn’t appear that this patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, was showing symptoms when he first arrived in the United States. But what about Duncan -- is Issa right in saying that he came to the United States with a fever (Issa's office did not respond to our request for comment.) Duncan’s fever On Sept. 20, when Duncan arrived at Dulles International Airport in Washington from Liberia (via Belgium), American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola. But Duncan went through screening Sept. 19 in Monrovia, Liberia, where he presented a temperature of 97.3 degrees -- so he didn’t have a fever when he boarded the plane -- according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials who reviewed Duncan’s airport screening record. (According to the National Institutes of Health, the normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and a fever starts at a body temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.) We (and Issa) can’t know with certainty if Duncan had acquired a fever by the time he arrived at Dulles. But he did not report falling ill until several days later, when he went to the hospital Sept. 25 with a 100.1 degree fever. It was during this first visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that Duncan wasn’t examined appropriately. The nurse documented that Duncan had a temperature of 100.1 degrees. It was only after a physician examined him that she included in his record that he had recently arrived from Africa. He was discharged early the next morning. He returned to the hospital Sept. 28 and died there about 10 days later. We should note that Liberian authorities said Duncan lied on the airport Ebola screening questionnaire by answering ""no"" to questions about whether he had contact with an Ebola patient or cared for one or touched the body of someone who had died of Ebola. It was found out later that Duncan helped carry 19-year-old Marthalene Williams into a taxi to go to the hospital. She was seven months pregnant and was turned away at the hospital due to lack of space in the Ebola ward. She died several hours later. It is unclear whether Duncan knew of her diagnosis. Airport screenings Airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been going on since at least August. According to the CDC, exit screening might look different in each country but the basic elements are the same. All travelers must have their temperature taken, answer a questionnaire about their health and exposure history and are visually assessed for signs of potential illness. Travelers who show symptoms or signs of exposure are separated and assessed further which ultimately determines whether they are allowed to travel.    Screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada and now the United States. The first week of October -- the week Duncan died -- the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines to supplement the screening already taking place in West Africa airports. Travelers from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports now have to go through an Ebola screening process. After passport review, they will have their temperature taken and answer questions about possible exposure. If they show possible signs of Ebola or exposure, they will be passed on to a public health authority. If not, the traveler will receive information about self-monitoring for symptoms. The five international airports -- John F. Kennedy, Newark, O’Hare, Dulles and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson -- already handled 94 percent of arrivals from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. On Oct. 21, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that all travelers coming to America from those three countries would have to go through the five designated American airports. Our ruling Issa said Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States ""with an elevated temperature."" According to the CDC, Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia. At the time, American airports were not screening travelers, so there’s no way for us (or Issa) to know definitively if he had a fever when he got to the United States. But he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving, when he went to the hospital with a fever. It’s possible that even if current screening measures had been in place, Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms.

John Carlevale says four R.I. legislators were victims of voter impersonation in 2010 election
","In the race for Rhode Island Secretary of State, Republican John Carlevale and Democrat Nellie Gorbea are sharply divided on the state’s voter ID statute, which was passed into law three years ago. Gorbea doesn’t see the need for the statute and questions whether it may be disenfranchising legitimate voters. Carlevale calls it a well-crafted law that is helping to stamp out voter fraud in the Ocean State. During an Oct. 19, 2014 debate on ""10 News Conference,"" Carlevale responded to criticism from Gorbea by trying to illustrate the scope of the problem with fraudulent voting before the legislature, in 2011, passed the controversial law, which requires voters to show photo identification. ""Let’s talk about the four members of the General Assembly who went to vote in 2010 and were told they already voted,"" Carlevale said (at the 5:40 mark in the video). ""They were disenfranchised."" That caught our attention. If four state legislators were victims of voter impersonation in a single election, that would indicate voter fraud would have been pretty widespread. We called Carlevale who told us that the legislators testified about their first-hand experience with voter impersonation when the ID bill was being debated at the State House. But he said he could remember the name of only one of the legislators: Rep. Anastasia P. Williams, a Providence Democrat. He said she would probably recall the other names and recommended we call her. We tried to contact her repeatedly by phone and by email but couldn’t reach her. We checked news reports on the 2011 legislative session and found references in several Journal stories to an allegation made by Williams that she was a victim of voter fraud in 2006. No details were included in those initial stories. In a subsequent PolitiFact Rhode Island item on voter fraud, Williams provided more details, saying that ""she and her daughter went to their polling place in 2006, only to discover that two other people had used their names."" She spoke about her claim again in interviews in 2012 with reporters for The New Republic and The Providence Phoenix. According to The New Republic story, Williams said that ""in 2006 her vote was stolen by an illegal alien who was promised a passport by a state official."" A more detailed account was included in the Phoenix story. (Additionally, according to the New Republic story, ""during the 2010 elections, [Williams] says she saw a Hispanic man vote twice at the same polling place, wearing a different outfit each time. ""What caught my eye was [he] was a hottie,"" she told the reporter.) Williams never filed a complaint with the Board of Elections about any alleged instance of fraud. The only other legislator named in news reports who spoke of specific cases of voter fraud was Sen. Harold Metts, who sponsored the ID bill in the Senate. According to those stories, Metts said that over the course of 20 years, constituents had told him about fraudulent voting practices at the polls, including one occasion when a man identified himself but couldn’t spell his own name correctly. Metts, however, never said that he had been a victim himself. When we called him, he confirmed that was the case. He also could not recall any members of the General Assembly apart from Williams who said they had been impersonated at the polls. (The Phoenix story on voter fraud also included anecdotes from Sen. William Walaska and Rep. J. Patrick O’Neill in which they alleged voting irregularities, but not impersonation.) We checked recordings of the debates on the House and Senate floor before the ID bill was passed. In the House session, Williams said that she and her daughter had been victims of voter fraud without offering further details. She also made reference to seeing two men each vote twice in one election. Then-Rep. Leo Medina implied that people voted illegally in an election he lost in 2004, but nobody else talked of being impersonated at the polls.     In the Senate session, Metts recounted anecdotes of fraud from constituents and repeated the claim Williams made about being impersonated, but no senators said that they had been victims of fraud. We called Robert Kando, executive director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, who said that in the nine years that he has been at the board there has never been a confirmed case in which one voter has tried to impersonate another. Robert Rapoza, the board’s elections director, said that he has not come across a confirmed case in his 17 years at the board. Kando said that Anastasia Williams was the only legislator he could recall who alleged being a victim of voter fraud during the 2011 debate about the ID bill. He confirmed that she never filed a complaint. A database compiled by students at Arizona State University of voter fraud cases across the nation between 2002 and 2012 found only five complaints in Rhode Island. None involved voter impersonation. In addition, Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola University Law School who tracks voter impersonation cases, has found only 44 credible cases around the country since 2000. None were in Rhode Island. When we shared what we found with Carlevale, he said: ""There was a report that I read somewhere, that there were two or three additional members of the General Assembly who had a similar experience to Anastasia [Williams.]"" But he said he couldn’t immediately locate it. Our ruling John Carlevale said that four members of the Rhode Island General Assembly ""went to vote in 2010 and were told they had already voted."" Carlevale’s statement, which he’s made in at least one other debate, is dramatic and specific. He’s saying that on multiple occasions in one election people impersonated legislators at the polls. The claim hints at a wider problem. Legislators are presumably well-known and recognizable in their districts. If their votes were stolen, then many others must have been too. But we could find only one legislator who made a public claim along those lines: Rep. Anastasia Williams, who says she was impersonated at the polls -- in 2006. She never filed a complaint. We rule Carlevale’s statement False.

In debate, Scott Brown says Jeanne Shaheen 'voted to pave the way' for a carbon tax
","In an Oct. 21, 2014, debate in Concord, N.H., Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, tangled over energy policy. At one point, Brown said Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" We thought we’d take a closer look. This claim echoed, but did not precisely match, one made in a June press release by Brown’s campaign manager, Colin Reed -- that ""one year ago, Sen. Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax."" This referred to the debate surrounding a ""carbon tax"" -- another term for taxes on oil, gas and coal usage. The logic behind the tax is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources that have a smaller environmental impact. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Brown campaign staffer Elizabeth Guyton pointed us to Shaheen’s vote on an amendment to a 2013 budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. The amendment stipulated that revenue generated by any future carbon tax must be given back to the public in some form. Shaheen voted in favor of the amendment. However, nothing in that amendment would have actually enacted a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were ever enacted, would be put to use. ""I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are,"" Whitehouse told reporters in 2013. ""So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds."" Although Shaheen was one of 41 ""yea"" votes (all of them coming from Democrats or Democratic-caucusing Independents), the vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax. It would have been accurate to say Shaheen voted to ""pave the way"" for a carbon tax if she had cast a vote to -- for instance -- begin Senate debate on an actual carbon tax. But no carbon tax was waiting for a vote. The amendment she voted for wouldn’t have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition. (And don’t forget that the measure didn’t even pass, so it’s not as if it paved the way for a tax that’s now in place.) A second piece of evidence offered by Brown’s campaign concerns an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Blunt has emerged as a persistent carbon tax opponent in the Senate. In 2013, Blunt proposed an amendment that would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within a budget resolution to 60 votes. Shaheen voted against this amendment, even as some of her Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, it’s an exaggeration to say that Shaheen ""paved the way"" for a carbon tax when no proposal was going anywhere in the Senate. Shripal Shah, a spokesman from Shaheen’s Senate office, told us in June that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax. Shah said Shaheen supports ""market-driven solutions"" to address pollution, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This statement seems to fall in line with the position Shaheen took when she first campaigned for the Senate in 2008. During a roundtable discussion at Seacoast Energy Alternatives in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Shaheen said she would prefer a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax because it’s ""easier to sell to the population"" and ""puts the onus"" on the polluters. When it comes to the legislative record, Shaheen’s efforts to influence energy policy since taking office have been focused largely on boosting energy efficiency. Shaheen partnered with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to craft an energy efficiency bill that would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation and establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives. The bill has twice died in the Senate. The most recent effort failed on May 12, 2014, when supporters failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to close debate on the bill and proceed to a final vote. Our ruling Brown said Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" That’s misleading. The two votes she took did mirror those of some lawmakers who favor a carbon tax, but that’s not the same thing as saying she voted to ""pave the way for a new national energy tax."" These weren’t procedural votes to commence a debate on, or tee up a final vote on, an actual carbon-tax bill. We don't see how either vote would have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition.

NRCC ad says Carol Shea-Porter is a partisan Democrat, Frank Guinta is ""independent""
","In New Hampshire’s highly competitive 1st Congressional District race, a Republican group is using a new ad to draw a stark contrast between Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and her GOP challenger, former Rep. Frank Guinta. Here’s the narration of the ad, which was paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans’ election arm: ""Carol Shea-Porter votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time. More spending, higher taxes. We need a change. As mayor, Frank Guinta brought a tax cap to Manchester and balanced four straight budgets. Frank will take on both parties. Cut spending, fight for a balanced budget, and restore Medicare to protect our seniors. Independent New Hampshire values, that’s Frank Guinta."" But is the comparison in partisan voting patterns really that stark? The answer is no. Their records are easy to compare, because Shea-Porter and Guinta have traded off ownership of the seat over the past several election cycles. Shea-Porter was elected to the House in 2006 and 2008, lost to Guinta in 2010, then beat him in a rematch in 2012. The ad footnotes Shea-Porter’s 95 percent partisan voting record to a Washington Post vote study. That shows that Shea-Porter did indeed vote with her party 95 percent of the time in the current Congress. A similar study by Congressional Quarterly shows Shea-Porter’s partisan unity score ranging between 95 percent and 98 percent each year during her congressional career. So the ad has a point that Shea-Porter has loyally voted the party line in the House. The problem with the ad is in suggesting that Guinta has done the opposite. He hasn’t. The same Post tally shows that in Guinta’s term in Congress -- covering 2011 and 2012 -- he voted with his party 96 percent of the time. That’s barely distinguishable from how Shea Porter voted with her party. The CQ tally shows much the same: Guinta had a 97 percent partisan unity score in 2011 and 95 percent in 2012. NRCC spokesman Ian Prior countered with two arguments. First, he said that if Guinta had served as Manchester mayor with a ""my-party-is-100-percent-right attitude, he wouldn’t have been able to implement a tax cap (or) balance four straight city budgets."" Second, he said that Shea-Porter’s votes that make up that 95 percent ""are out of touch with her district and show that she puts her own liberal agenda ahead of her district."" Both points have merit but are far from bulletproof. On Prior’s first point, city-level policymaking tends to be more technocratic and shaped less by the national political partisanship that drives Congress. In the exact comparison between the two candidates -- how they have voted in Congress -- they have both voted in virtual partisan lockstep. On his second point, that Shea-Porter’s votes are out of step with the district, we’ll just note that the district voted for Obama for president not once but twice. It’s possible that voters have grown disgusted with his agenda since his 2012 reelection. We’ll soon find out: That’s what elections are for. Our ruling The NRCC ad says that Shea-Porter ""votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time,"" but Guinta ""will take on both parties"" and has ""independent New Hampshire values."" That’s a pretty stark comparison -- yet by the most apples-to-apples measurement of how both candidates have voted in Congress, Guinta scored a 96 percent partisan unity with Republicans during his term in Congress, which is hardly evidence of a big contrast.

Stephanie Cutter: Ebola vaccine research was cut in half, and more cuts are coming
","If you’re tracking news of the Ebola virus, you’ve probably heard accusations that budget cuts are responsible for the lack of a vaccine. National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins told Huffington Post that ""we probably would have had a vaccine in time"" for the Ebola outbreak were it not for a 10-year drop in federal research dollars. (PolitiFact explored that idea.) His colleague, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, contradicted Collins on the Oct. 19 edition of Meet the Press. When host Chuck Todd asked if Collins’ comments about budget cuts driving the absence of a working vaccine was ""hyperbole,"" Fauci said he did not agree with Collins. ""You can't say that. I think you can't say we would or would not have this or that. Everything is slowed down. But I wouldn't make that statement,"" Fauci said. Later in the Ebola-centric episode, Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter picked up on Fauci’s statement that research slowed with funding. ""In fact, money towards the Ebola vaccine is basically cut in half to what it was,"" she said. ""More cuts are coming under the congressional sequester."" We wanted to know if funding for an Ebola vaccine had been cut in half from ""what it was"" and if more cuts were coming under the sequester. Cutter did not respond to our query. How much we spend on Ebola vaccine research The National Institutes of Health, which houses Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is the biggest source of medical research dollars in the world. In-house scientists work on some projects, while other grants are doled out to scientists at research institutions and universities. These research agencies have had cutbacks just like the rest of the federal bureaucracy, including in biomedical research. The government put a big emphasis on these illnesses in 2001, as officials grew more worried about bioterrorism threats like anthrax and smallpox. The NIH’s specific research into Ebola virus prevention and treatment is also lower than it once was, though whether it was ""half as much"" depends on a subjective, selective timetable. A spokeswoman for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided a breakdown of the agency’s Ebola research since 2003, including vaccine-specific expenses. (These numbers exclude stimulus dollars and are not adjusted for inflation.) The chart below shows the trend in the agency’s spending on research into an Ebola vaccine, therapeutics (or treatments), as well as total Ebola research spending, which folds in those categories and also includes basic research into how the disease works and diagnostics (complete chart data here).  Since Cutter specified Ebola vaccine research, let’s focus on that (it’s the blue line). It’s hard to say what normal spending in this area is, as dollars have fluctuated between a low of $11.6 million to a high of $37.2 million depending on the year. But if you compare 2010 spending to 2014 spending, spending indeed dropped by more than half, falling from about $37.2 million to $17.7 million. The 2009-10 fiscal year was one of higher-than-usual spending. The year before, spending was $20.8 million. The story for total Ebola research spending by NIH is similar, reaching a high of $59 million in 2006 before falling, peaking again in 2010 and then trailing off amid recession fallout. No doubt, research money has not kept up with rising research costs, especially in the recent austere budget climate. The sequester and cuts to come Let’s compare spending before and after the sequester that Cutter mentioned. Remember that funny word, sequestration? It hasn’t been in the news much, but it’s not going away, and it has a big influence on whether the NIH keeps funding things like Ebola research at substantial levels. (See PolitiFact’s guide here.) The sequester is the result of a 2011 disagreement between the White House and Congress over how to solve the debt ceiling problem. Because a congressional ""super-committee"" failed to come up with $1.2 trillion in targeted cuts, across-the-board spending cuts of 5 percent went into effect in 2013. An agreement reached by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in December 2013 offered slight relief from the sequester, setting budget caps for 2014 and 2015 discretionary (non-military) spending that exceed the amount required by the sequester. In the 2011-12 fiscal year, before the sequester, spending on Ebola vaccine research was $22.5 million. In 2013, after the sequester, this spending fell to $17.2 million. It picked up slightly to an estimated $17.7 million in 2014. Clearly, budget cuts are leading to reduced dollars for finding an Ebola vaccine. But it is not half of its pre-sequester amount, so Cutter’s statement is an overstatement by this measure. What does this mean for future medical research? Spending will surely remain tight and will still be outpaced by the cost of research. But exactly what continued austerity means for Ebola research also remains to be seen. Of the many diseases affecting or feared to affect Americans, Ebola was not one, so it was not given a super-high priority in past National Institutes of Health budgeting. Congress provides the funding for NIH, but agency leaders make the call on which research gets what level of funding. The NIH has generally tried to make its budget cuts even across its more than two dozen sub-institutes that focus on specific disease research, said Benjamin Corb, American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology director of public affairs. If this trend holds, Ebola research will likely take another cut, though spending priorities could change in the face of the dangerous outbreak in West Africa. Already, the agency has pushed ahead with some close-to-finished treatments in effort to respond to the disease, such as the ZMapp drug that was used to treat two American missionaries who contracted Ebola but has not yet been produced in large supply. The spending cap for the 2014-15 fiscal year is essentially flat, so spending will still be tight for all research, said David Reich, a former House Appropriations Committee staffer and consultant to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. If inflation is factored in, it’s certainly a cut, he said. ""We don’t know where they’re going to be until the process is finished,"" he said. An NIH spokeswoman said the agency did not yet know how sequestration would affect Ebola research. Experts caution that more money for Ebola research would not necessarily mean more results, though they agree that more money would have probably led to more developed testing of products. Our ruling Cutter said, ""Money towards the Ebola vaccine is basically cut in half to what it was,"" and ""more cuts are coming under the congressional sequester."" Whether money for the vaccine was cut in half depends on the metric you use. It’s true if you compare 2010 to the 2014 estimate, when vaccine research spending fell from $37 million to $17.2 million, but not if you use other parameters. The financial picture for the NIH is not expected to substantially brighten any time soon amid constraints from budget-control measures, though given the emergence of the threat in the United States and the massive attention to the issue, Congress and the president could choose to increase funding for Ebola going forward.

Scott signed bill preventing state from regulating property insurance, Crist says
","Candidates in this year’s gubernatorial race have launched so many attacks against each other, it’s hard to keep them all straight. Even the candidates themselves seem to be having problems. During the Oct. 21, 2014, CNN debate in Jacksonville, Democrat Charlie Crist seemed to mix his talking points when it came to insurance rates. ""We haven't had a hurricane in eight years and your property insurance rates have gone through the roof. Now why is that? I'll tell you why,"" he said. ""It is because Rick Scott is not letting the department of insurance regulate insurance. He actually signed a bill last year that said that the Department of Insurance Regulation cannot regulate insurance."" Because we have a fairly long memory here at PolitiFact Florida, that didn’t sound right to us. Crist’s campaign told us they didn’t want to expound on this any more, so we looked into it ourselves. We found that Crist is actually using two unrelated attacks at once here, so stick with us and we’ll sort this out. Property insurance The first part of this claim notes that property insurance has gone up. This attack has been a linchpin in the Crist campaign, and we’ve rated it Mostly True in the past. The reason has nothing to do with the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation, though (we’ll get to that in a minute). It’s because Scott signed SB 408, a 2011 law that allowed a reduction in overall coverage limits, shortened the window for filing sinkhole and storm-related damage claims, and limited claims for damage caused by sinkholes to primary structures, among other things. But instead of limiting the Office of Insurance Regulation’s power, the law made carriers file requests with the office for rate increases for higher reinsurance costs -- effectively insurance bought by insurance companies -- and capping those requests at 15 percent per year. The law also allowed insurers to pay back some claims at actual cash value -- the cost of the insured dwelling minus depreciation -- instead of replacement value, depending on the policy. Scott’s plan indeed was to reduce the number of policies run by state-run insurer Citizens, and the legislation worked to that end. It reversed a Crist-era trend of more property owners depending on the agency. The law did reduce coverage and it did raise rates, because its intent was for Citizens to become ""actuarially sound."" This was accomplished through ""taking out"" policies that were assumed by private companies and charging more in order to balance costs. Now that the reinsurance market has stabilized after spiking following busy hurricane years in 2004 and 2005, Citizens and other companies this year have asked the state if it’s all right to reduce their rates, but many people in Florida are still stuck with high insurance bills and are unable to afford the coverage they need. Health insurance Now, to Crist’s point about the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation being unable to regulate insurance. This goes back to May 2013, when Scott signed SB 1842. That indeed was a bill that suspended Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty’s power to regulate insurance for two years. But it was health insurance, not property insurance. We’ve looked at this one a couple of different ways, too. It was a response to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which said state law had to follow minimum federal guidelines for insurance plans. The federal health law said insurance providers also had to justify unreasonable rate increases, defined as more than 10 percent per year. The GOP-controlled Legislature was so opposed to the law that it said the federal government could regulate health insurance rates instead of the state. The law said insurers still file rate proposals to OIR, but they didn’t need the agency’s approval. The problem is, the federal law doesn’t give Washington the power to regulate rate increases. Instead, it says the federal government will defer to state agencies. It even provided grant money to help state’s get up to snuff -- Scott gave back $1 million the state received for this purpose. The only time D.C. gets involved is if a state’s system doesn’t meet federal standards to review rates, as is the case in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Florida’s system is just fine, the Department of Health and Human Services said. That makes Florida the only state that doesn’t regulate rates despite having a qualified review system. For 2015, 14 insurance companies filed plans for rate increases averaging 13.2 percent. Those numbers will likely go down before final rates are set, but the 2013 law prevents McCarty’s agency from doing anything until next year. Our ruling Crist said property insurance rates are up because Scott signed a bill preventing state from regulating insurance. There are actually two bills involved here: One in 2011 concerning property insurance that effectively let rates go up while reducing coverage, and another in 2013 that prevents the state’s regulatory agency from having a say in health insurance rates for two years. Scott signed both those bills, but they are not interchangeable. Crist mixed his talking points here, but the result confuses the issues. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2014/oct/24/charlie-crist/scott-signed-bill-preventing-state-regulating-prop/

Bernie Sanders repeats false claim about gun sales without background checks
","Like many other politicians before him, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., repeated a false claim that 40 percent of guns are sold without a background checks. ""We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole,"" Sanders said Feb. 18 on NBC’s Meet the Press. ""Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" Three years after we first debunked this statistic, it’s still not true. The statistic comes from a 20-year-old study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, and a Florida gun control advocate earned a False in 2017 after the finding was diminished by new research. The latest research suggests the percentage is almost half of what Sanders cited. The sample size of the 1997 study was very small, with just 251 participants. Furthermore, the statistic stems from survey data that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sales. This is an important point. When the authors of the NIJ study — Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University — adjusted the results to include only the guns sold (not given), the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. That statistic more closely resembles the new findings in a relatively new 2017 study. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That’s about half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, ""At last, a good estimate of the magnitude of the private-sale loophole for firearms."" In it, he wrote, ""Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks."" ""It appears the number he cited may be outdated,"" Sanders spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. ""But whether it’s 40 percent or 22 percent of guns being acquired without a background check, millions of Americans still obtain guns without background checks. That's absurd. No one should be allowed to purchase a gun without a vigorous background check."" Sanders said, ""Forty percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks."" That statistic is outdated. It stems from  a 20-year-old survey that has been overtaken by another study that shows that 22 percent of gun buyers obtained their weapons without background checks. That’s just over half the percentage in the zombie claim Sanders cited. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2018/feb/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-repeats-false-claim-about-backgroun/

Which is higher: The number of people, or the number of guns, in America?
","Days after the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Republican Kevin Nicholson was asked about the shooting and whether anything should be done. Nicholson, who touts his support of the Second Amendment, is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. He appeared on the Feb. 18, 2018 edition of ""UpFront with Mike Gousha,"" a Milwaukee-based public affairs TV show. Nicholson responded to the question, in part, with a statistical claim, saying: The reality is, we're a nation of 300-plus-million people. There are more guns in this country than there are people. If somebody wants to obtain a firearm to commit a crime -- a heinous crime, a disgusting crime like this that puts children in harm's way and ends up taking innocent life -- they're going to do it."" Are there more guns than people in the United States? The estimates We found in our first fact check related to the shooting at the high school in Parkland, Fla., that bad numbers related to guns can spread fast. We rated as Mostly False a claim that there had already been 18 U.S. school shootings in 2018, but only 18 in the rest of the world over past 20 years. Hard numbers on the number of guns in the United States are also elusive. In the past few years, headlines in the Washington Post and on Vox have declared there are more guns than people in the United States. Both noted a surge of gun sales following the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. But the headlines suggest the figures are certain when they’re not, given that there is no record keeping that would produce an actual count of guns in the United States. As the Pew Research Center has observed: ""Gun ownership is one of the hardest things for researchers to pin down."" At the same time, there have been studies to produce estimates on the number of civilian guns in the nation. Both the Post and Vox noted an estimate on the high end -- 310 million guns -- that was cited in a 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report said the estimate was based on U.S. Department of Justice data and was the ""total number of firearms available to civilians"" as of 2009. That 310 million count is higher than the U.S. population in 2009 of about 305 million. But one gun-statistics expert, Philip Cook at Duke University, told the Post that the actual figure then was probably closer to 245 million guns, not 310 million, to take into account circumstances such as guns that break down or are lost or destroyed. And Cook and two other experts -- Tom Smith at the University of Chicago and Daniel Webster at the Johns Hopkins at the Center for Gun Policy and Research -- told us the best, most recent estimate is in a study published in October 2017 by researchers from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. A total of 3,949 adults, representative of the U.S. population, were surveyed online. The lead author of that study, Deborah Azrael, told us the respondents were asked if they owned guns and how many, and were instructed not to count BB guns, replicas or other guns that were not functioning. ""There are clearly guns we miss,"" Azrael said, noting that some people might lie about owning guns. ""My guess is we probably miss more than we undercount."" The estimate: 265 million civilian guns in the United States, as of when the survey was taken, in January 2015. Meanwhile, the U.S. population at that time, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was about 320 million. Other highlights of the Harvard study: Of the estimated 265 million total civilian guns, 113 million were handguns. The typical gun owner (the median, in the survey) owned two guns. 39 percent of the estimated 265 million guns were owned by 8 percent of the gun owners -- that 8 percent of all owners owned 10 or more guns. Prior fact check The claim made by Nicholson was also made in 2013 by Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives representing the District of Columbia. PolitiFact National, noting the lack of firm numbers, gave her a rating of Half True. That fits here. Our rating Nicholson says: ""There are more guns in this country than there are people."" There is no official count of the number of firearms in the United States. In one estimate, for 2009, the number of guns exceeded the population. But the most recent estimate cited by gun-statistics experts puts the figure at 265 million guns as of January 2015, when the population was 320 million.

Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance says most of venture capital money goes to three states
","J.D. Vance, the author of the 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, said that many Americans in the middle part of the country will become ""political frustrated"" if President Donald Trump doesn’t deliver on promises to grow their paychecks and improve the economy. While there are pockets of entrepreneurship across the country, there are few high-growth startup companies outside of California, New York and Boston, Vance said in a Dec. 31 interview on CBS’ Face the Nation. ""So the statistic I throw out is 50 percent of venture capital goes to California,"" Vance said. ""Most of the rest of it goes to New York and Massachusetts. That means there's 47 states fighting over a very small amount of the type of investment that creates really high quality, long term, durable jobs."" Vance said that if more investment can be made in some of these other states it would create more high-quality job growth. Vance is a partner in the Revolution investment firm, which launched a bus tour to shine a spotlight on startups and invest in companies not located in Silicon Valley. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell courted Vance to run against U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, but Vance declined. We wondered about Vance’s statement about how venture capital is divvied up nationwide. We found those three states are the leading homes for venture capital, but Vance's point requires a bit more explanation. A spokeswoman for Revolution said that Vance was referring to data by the National Venture Capital Association, a trade association comprised of venture capital firms and corporate venture groups. The association’s annual yearbook compiles data on companies, closed deals and invested capital. In 2016, California had 55 percent of venture capital money, followed by New York at 10.6 percent and Massachusetts at 8.9 percent. In total, the three states accounted for about 75 percent of the capital invested. (Texas came in at fourth place, followed by Florida.) The share of venture capital claimed by these three states was corroborated by another source of data, the PricewaterhouseCoopers/CB Insights MoneyTree Report. Since 2012, the collective share of the top three states has increased from 68.5 percent to a peak of 76.8 percent. in 2015. The outlook is more promising for other states in terms of the number of deals. The same three states claimed about 52 percent of closed deals in 2016, according to the association’s yearbook. That’s still a majority of deals, but it’s ""a positive sign for burgeoning entrepreneurial ecosystems in the rest of the country,"" the yearbook said. The yearbook’s list of the top 10 venture capital deals in terms of the amount of money included Magic Leap, a reality technology company in South Florida, and Domo, a Utah-based company that provides data to businesses. Some states that were not on the venture capital radar a decade or so ago have received more dollars in recent years, experts told us. Some of these states look more impressive, for example, when broken down by invested capital per capita, such as Utah. It’s also possible that as more states invest in innovation ecosystems, they will increase how much venture capital they attract. But California, New York and Massachusetts will continue to build on their success. ""Success begets success, leading to more startups in these places, more capital and more opportunities for investment,"" said Elisabeth B. Reynolds, executive director of the MIT Industrial Performance Center. The hard part for states playing catch-up is attracting money. But there are now hubs of start-ups in Florida, including Gainesville, Orlando and Miami, said University of Florida business professor James Parrino. Vance said that ""50 percent of venture capital goes to California. Most of the rest of it goes to New York and Massachusetts."" Vance is largely correct but doesn't describe the situation with precision. Data from a trade association showed that California received 55 percent of venture capital money followed by New York at 10.6 percent and Massachusetts at 8.9 percent.  If we looked at the number of deals closed that year, the three states’ share added up to 52 percent. That left almost half of the deals for the rest of the country. We rate Vance’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/feb/20/jd-vance/hillbilly-elegy-author-jd-vance-says-most-venture-/

No proof that Nikolas Cruz, Parkland shooter, was motivated by Islamic or left-wing hate
","A conservative website portrayed Nikolas Cruz, who admitted to fatally gunning down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, as sharing views of certain Muslims and leftists. ""The mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate,"" stated a story on the Geller Report website on Feb. 14, the day of the shooting at the Parkland, Fla., school. The author of the website, Pamela Geller, is an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative, a far-right group. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Cruz was immersed in Islamic or left-wing hate. Most of Geller’s story has nothing to do with political views held by Cruz. It largely repeats an initial story by Fox News the day of the shooting and showed some of Cruz’s alleged Instagram posts, identified by other teenagers as his, which included images of guns and knives as well as an image of a bullseye target with bullet holes that included the phrase ""Group Therapy."" Geller included an image from what was believed to be Cruz’s Instagram account showing a Google search for the Arabic phrase ""Allahu Akbar."" The phrase, which means ""God is greater,"" is used by Muslims on many occasions and in prayers but has also at times been uttered by people commiting attacks. Cruz’s Instagram account has since been shut down; however, multiple media reports stated that Cruz appeared to make fun of Islam when he wrote that ""at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says ‘allahu Akbar.'"" We sent Geller a summary of our findings and asked if she had evidence to support her claim. ""He mocked the phrase, but then he turned to violence himself. This indicates that underneath his mockery, he had an affinity with those who scream this phrase while murdering people,"" she told PunditFact in an email. Geller said that Cruz’s interest in the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"" ""doesn't mean he was an Islamic jihadi, but his mockery of it may have been an attempt to deflect attention from his aspirations, or maybe even to try to convince himself not to take the path he ultimately chose. Ultimately, we cannot know for sure what was in his mind, or what was left of it."" Law enforcement are investigating motives and his social media posts. The portrait that has emerged of Cruz so far is not of a person motivated by political views, but one of a young man who was drawn to firearms and had a troubled past. Cruz had regularly gotten in trouble at school at least since middle school and had transferred out of Stoneman Douglas in 2017 and had since attended alternative schools. He had a history of mental illness, and police had been called to his home. Cruz’s mother died in November; his father died when he was a young child. Ocean Parodie, 17, told The Daily Beast that Cruz wore patriotic shirts that ""seemed really extreme, like hating on"" Islam and would also deride Muslims as ""terrorists and bombers."" In general teenagers who knew Cruz used words such as ""off,"" ""weird"" and ""crazy"" to describe him to journalists. Some initial news reports stated that Cruz was affiliated with a white nationalist group in Florida, but law enforcement said they didn’t have information to support that connection. A white nationalist appeared to have spread misinformation to media outlets. We emailed spokespersons for Instagram, the FBI and the Broward Sheriff’s Office to ask some questions about Cruz’s Instagram account but not did get a reply. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel did not offer any involvement in Islamic or hate groups to explain why Cruz walked into the school with an assault weapon in a Feb. 18 interview with Local 10 ABC’s Michael Putney. When asked why Cruz shot up the school Israel said: ""Because he is an evil killer."" The Geller Report described Cruz as being ""immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate."" Law enforcement are investigating motives, but so far Cruz appeared to be a person who had mental illness and a fascination with guns.

Donald Trump falsely says he never denied Russian meddling
","The indictments of 13 Russians detailing how they used Facebook and Twitter to undercut Hillary Clinton and promote President Donald Trump spurred a flurry of tweets from Trump over the weekend. ""I never said Russia did not meddle in the election,"" Trump wrote Feb. 18. ""I said ‘it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.’ The Russian ‘hoax’ was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!"" I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did! Trump might want to focus on collusion, but his blanket denial that he ever questioned Russian meddling runs up against his own words. Early on, Trump treated any mention of Russian interference as an attack on the legitimacy of his victory. In a May 2017 interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, Trump said ""this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story."" Trump continued in that interview to say, ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."" That statement earned him PolitiFact’s 2017 Lie of the Year. In September 2017, when reports of Russian-backed Facebook ads came out, Trump tweeted, ""The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?"" The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary? When the Washington Post reported in December 2016 that the CIA had concluded that the Russians wanted to boost Trump’s chances, Trump rejected it. ""We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,"" he said on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, 2016. ""I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She’s down to a very low number. No, I don’t believe that at all."" In a December 2016 interview with Time, Trump said two things: He didn’t think Russia meddled, and that it might have. ""I don’t believe they interfered,"" Trump said. ""That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say ‘oh, Russia interfered.’"" But a moment later he said, ""I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals."" During an overseas trip to Asia in November 2017, Trump spoke of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A reporter asked how Trump brought up the issue of Russian meddling in the U.S. election. ""Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn't do that,’ "" Trump said. ""And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it."" Asked again if he believed Putin, Trump called several top U.S. intelligence officials ""political hacks,"" and argued that other matters were more important. ""You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that,"" Trump said. ""Now, you’re not going to get into an argument. You’re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine."" So there are any number of occasions when Trump has denied Russian meddling across the board. But at other moments, he has acknowledged that it is possible. In the same interview with NBC’s Holt where he called the Russian thing ""a made-up story,"" Trump also suggested that Russia might try to shape U.S. elections. ""If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it’s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it,"" Trump said. ""And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen."" At a January 2017 news conference, he said he thought Russia did hack into the DNC, but he blurred the picture. ""As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,"" he said. ""But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people."" Pressed on his apparent acceptance of the intelligence agencies’ findings, Trump backpedaled. ""All right, but you know what, it could have been others also,"" Trump said. Trump said that he ""never said that Russia did not meddle in the election."" In reality, he called the matter a ""made-up story,"" and a ""hoax."" He has said that he believes Russian President Putin’s denial of any Russian involvement. He told Time, ""I don’t believe they (Russia) interfered."" Even when he has acknowledged the possibility that the Russians interfered, he has added that it could have been other countries or even individuals.

Fact-checking sad statistic on women murdered by intimate partners in U.S.
","The resignation of two White House aides accused of physically abusing their wives has shone a brighter spotlight on the scourge of domestic violence.   President Trump, who initially praised the work of one of the aides and wished him well, said one week after that he is ""totally opposed to domestic violence."" Meanwhile, California Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco area, weighed in through Twitter with an alarming statement: ""3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend.""   Domestic violence plagues all corners of the United States, no matter a community’s political leanings, economic status or demographic make-up. Still, we wanted to know whether the congresswoman’s provocative claim was accurate and what source of information she relied on. We set out to fact check Speier’s sad statistic. Our research Rep. Speier, a survivor of gun violence, has been a strong voice for gun control and for stopping sexual assaults. Her spokeswoman pointed us to an NBC news article which says ""nearly three women are murdered every day in the U.S. by current or former romantic partners."" That’s slightly different from the congresswoman’s tweet, which did not specify former partners. But it’s fairly close. The NBC article cited data from a 2017 Violence Policy Center report called When Men Murder Women. Representatives at the policy center could not be reached for comment. After examining the report, we found it somewhat supports Speier’s statement, with a few caveats. It analyzed 2015 homicide data collected by the FBI. It found 928 female homicide victims were ""wives or intimate acquaintances of their killers."" That works out to 2.54 female victims killed by an intimate partner on average per day in the United States. While Speier stated ""women,"" ages were not specified in the report. The report, which is the most complete and current we could find, indicates the assailants were not just husbands or boyfriends, but also ex-spouses and former boyfriends. Common claim Several domestic violence prevention groups have cited the same ""three women murdered"" figure on their websites. At least two of these, the National Organization for Women and the American Psychological Association, cited data that’s a decade or more older from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an office at the U.S. Department of Justice. The National Organization for Women, for example, cited federal statistics from 2005 that show, on average, about 3.2 women were killed per day by an intimate partner in the United States. Shari Miles-Cohen, senior director of the Women’s Programs Office at the American Psychological Association, said the statistic dates to a 2003 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, but also matches with more recent homicide findings, including from 2013. Missing data We found a note of caution in a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report on female homicides by intimate partners. It warned that the relationship between the killer and homicide victim was unknown for anywhere from a quarter to a third of the homicides in any given year. That’s because an offender was not identified or apprehended, according to the report, which examined the years 1993 through 2010. Given that missing data, one could speculate the actual number of women and girls killed through the years by intimate partners would be marginally higher. No matter which report is examined, Gretchen Shaw, associate director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said domestic abuse is all too prevalent and deadly in the United States. ""It’s much more common than people ever realize,"" Shaw said. Our ruling Speier said in a tweet that ""3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend."" Several domestic violence prevention groups make the same claim on their websites, though they cite data that in some cases is a decade old. We examined an analysis of 2015 homicide data by the Violence Prevention Center, and found that about 2.5 females were killed, on average, by an intimate partner each day in the United States. Speier’s statement could have clarified that assailants include former intimate partners, as well as current ones. Also, her tweet references women, though the victims likely include some teenages.

Fake news claims Melania Trump hired an exorcist to cleanse the White House
","Story that Melania Trump hired an exorcist to remove Obama’s demons from the White House is a hoax A hoax circulating on Facebook claims that first lady Melania Trump hired a professional exorcist to cleanse the White House of past demons from the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton years. ""Melania Trump hired exorcist to ‘cleanse White House of Obama demons,"" read the headline on February 8 from Your News Wire. The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat fake news. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, says any reports claiming the first lady had a ceremony to rid the White House of demons before moving in is false and ""not true in any way."" Your News Wire report originally appeared on Right Wing Watch, a blog dedicated to exposing the activities and rhetoric of extreme right-wing voices. A series of other websites reported variations of Trump’s supposed efforts to rid the White House of demons. The story opens by quoting Pastor Paul Begley of West Lafayette, Ind., saying Trump told him that she would not go into the White House unless it had been completely exorcised. However, there’s no record that the two ever personally corresponded, and in the podcast where Begley is speaking about this, he claims that is what Trump had told her husband, President Donald Trump. The White House is now ""free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography"" according to the article. Begley is quoted as saying that President Donald Trump allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House seven times, anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him. But, the only known occurrence of Trump inviting evangelical leaders to the White House happened last July with invitations to about 30 leaders. While some evangelicals did lay their hands on Trump out of a religious respect that can be shown as a sign of responsibility, there is no reports that he was anointed with oil. Also, this occasion was only publicly reported to have occurred once, not seven times. Begley also claims that apparently during Obama’s presidency and possibly presidents before him, ""there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic."" There is no record proving that any previous presidents engaged in demonology or paganism. The story also says that former President Bill Clinton confessed in his memoir My Life that he and his wife Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where a ""spirit arrived"" possessing participants to walk on hot coals and burn their flesh with fire and one person to bite the head off a living chicken. Clinton did write about attending a voodoo practice in a Haitian village, but they were not the hosts. The Clintons and their now-deceased friend and former Citibank executive David Edwards, who bought the trip as a wedding gift to the Clintons, were given a ""brief course in voodoo theology.""   Clinton wrote: ""After several minutes of rhythmic dancing to pounding drums, the spirits arrived, seizing a woman and a man. The man proceeded to rub a burning torch all over his body and walk on hot coals without being burned. The woman, in a frenzy, screamed repeatedly, then grabbed a live chicken and bit its head off. Then the spirits left and those who had been possessed fell to the ground."" The passage about the ceremony in My Life make it clear that the Clintons’ attendance of the voodoo session was observational. A website claimed Melania Trump hired an exorcist to rid the White House of past demons brought by previous politicians.

No, Trump did not declare George Soros a security threat
","A hoax circulating on the Internet claims that President Donald Trump had enough with billionaire liberal George Soros and contacted Russia for a file on him. ""Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order,"" stated a Jan. 30 headline on the Conservative Daily Post. There is no evidence that Trump took any such action against Soros. The same story has been picked up by multiple websites. The Hungarian-born Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Soros has been a major critic of Trump. After Trump won, Soros called him ""a con artist and would-be dictator."" At a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Soros said, ""I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world."" Soros has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that his foundations were banned from Austria and false smears, for example that he instigated racial protests in Charlottesville. Soros, who is Jewish, has also been falsely accused of being a Nazi collaborator. In this case, the story said Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about files related to Soros. The story said Trump used a 2014 executive order by Obama to take such action. That executive order was real, stating that Obama declared a national emergency to deal with the threat of people undermining democracy in Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Trump used that order to label Soros a threat to national security. Soros has been involved in Ukraine for decades and said he established a foundation there before it declared independence from the Russia. His International Renaissance Foundation has invested tens of millions in ""Ukrainian NGOs, sponsored conferences, scholarships, human-rights confabs and investigative journalists,"" the National Post reported in 2015. In 2015, Soros called on the west to inject $50 billion in Ukraine. Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, said in general Soros is viewed as a positive figure in Ukraine. ""He is not overtly in step with a particular political party and political movement,"" he said. ""His foundation is pretty sober-minded, reasonably well regarded in Ukraine."" We emailed the Conservative Daily Post and did not get a reply. The Las Vegas-based website states that it ""thrives on independent journalism and truth;"" however, the story about Soros is not based in evidence.

Scott Milder: State share of education spending was 68 percent in 1980s--now it's down to 38 percent
","A statewide candidate says state government has whoppingly slashed its share of spending on public schools since the 1980s. Scott Milder, a former Rockwall City Council member challenging Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in the Republican primary, poses and answers questions on his campaign website including: ""Does Texas spend enough on public education?"" Milder’s posted response: ""Local homeowners pay too much. The state does not pay enough. Texas has the revenue to adequately fund education without a tax increase, but improper spending priorities at the state level have resulted in a system that places a disproportionate share of the burden on local taxpayers through property taxes."" ""In the 1980s,"" Milder wrote, ""the state funded 68% of school expenses, and now the state’s share is 38%. Local property taxes have had to make up for this difference, and that is not the proper way to fund schools."" We were curious: Was Milder right about a 50 percent plummet in the state’s share of education spending? By phone, Milder told us he drew his percentages from Texas Monthly’s August 2017 obituary for Mark White, the one-term Democratic governor from Houston who signed into law House Bill 72, a landmark measure that led to higher teacher salaries, class-size limits in early grades and the expectation that students pass classes to participate in extracurricular activities, among other changes. The obituary says: ""At the end of White’s term,"" which ran through 1986, ""the state paid 67 percent of all education costs in Texas. Today, the state’s share is down to 38 percent."" Both percentages have factual roots, we found, but bring along asterisks. Let’s cover current state education aid, then travel back in time. Stand by too for a breakdown of such comparisons from a former legislator versed in school finance. Current state aid to public schools Journalist R.G. Ratcliffe, who wrote the White obituary, told us by email that his declaration that the state currently covers 38 percent of education spending reflects state-posted projections he initially noted in a February 2017 Texas Monthly story, ""Are Your Property Taxes Too High? Thank a Legislator."" That story says: ""If the Legislature does nothing for the next two years other than finance enrollment growth, the state share"" of school spending ""will go down to 38 percent by 2019. During that time period, local school districts will have increased their share of spending by about $10 billion, while the state’s share will have gone up $1 billion."" That story took note of a January 2017 Texas Education Agency presentation on school spending issues including a chart showing the state’s share of the  Foundation School Program, the state’s primary way of funding schools, sliding from 46 percent in 2012 to 44 percent in 2016 and an estimated 41 percent in 2017--with the share expected to sink to 38 percent in 2019:  SOURCE: Document, ""Texas Education Agency Summary of Recommendations,"" to the Texas Senate, 2017 regular legislative session, Jan. 23, 2017 (noted in an email from R.G. Ratcliffe, politics editor, Texas Monthly, Feb. 7, 2018) That chart was topped with a note stating: ""The state share of the total FSP entitlement has decreased in recent years, primarily due to strong property value growth."" Our translation: Lawmakers don’t have to budget as much state aid when school districts are expected to reap more revenue locally thanks to escalating property values. We also queried the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on fiscal matters, about the state share of school funding. A staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, replied by emailing us a chart specifying state and local spending figures and the state share of FSP funding from 1985 through 2016. In 2016, the chart says the state’s share of education spending was 43.7 percent; the chart projects that to decrease to 38 percent in 2019. Not counting federal aid Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Lauren Callahan pointed us to a December 2017 TEA analysis indicating that state tax revenue in 2015 and 2016 accounted for 41 percent of public school spending in the state though she noted that if you set aside federal aid, the state share of state-local spending rises to nearly 46 percent. Put another way, the full analysis shows federal aid covering 10 percent of school spending each of the years with local spending accounting for 49 percent of all such spending. DeSilva indicated that LBB staff didn’t consider federal funding in its calculations of state shares of school spending. Federal aid isn’t part of the Foundation School Program, he wrote. State education aid in the 1980s According to the LBB chart, the state’s share of such spending hasn’t exceeded 50 percent since 1985--which made us wonder about the basis of Milder’s reference to the state picking up 68 percent of education costs in the 1980s.  SOURCE: Chart, ""Foundation School Program State and Local Share - History, 1985-2016 with 2017-19 Estimated,"" Legislative Budget Board, undated (received by email from R.J. DeSilva, communications officer, LBB, Feb. 6, 2018) Landmark legislation in 1984 Ratcliffe told us he drew his figure for state education spending in the 1980s from a 1985 report on the effects of the White-signed HB 72 by students at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. The report includes a passage stating that under the 1984 law, each district’s local share of education costs is calculated ""so that the state funds 70 percent of the statewide costs"" with that share ""falling to 67.7 percent in 1985-86 and thereafter."" We spotted similar language in HB 72’s fiscal note, posted online by the Legislative Reference Library. Specific predicted spending in the note broke out to the state’s share of public school aid, hovering around 68 percent from September 1984 through August 1989. Callahan addressed this part of Milder’s claim by providing part of a 1986 TEA presentation to legislators about school spending the year before. According to the excerpt, state spending on the schools, some $4.7 billion, represented 61 percent of nearly $7.7 billion in combined state and local education spending. Adding in $622 million in federal education aid in 1985, Callahan noted, shrinks the state share of school spending to 57 percent. The LBB-provided chart contains a considerably lower estimate of the state’s 1980s share of expenditures. In 1985, the chart says, the state covered what would prove to be a 32-year high of 52.2 percent of the Foundation School Program. DeSilva, asked to discuss why the LBB-determined percentages for the state’s shares of school spending in the 1980s trail the percentages suggested by HB 72’s fiscal note, said by email that the LBB’s percentages consider all state and local revenue spent on maintenance and operations plus debts while the HB 72 fiscal note, in contrast, didn’t count some spending that the LBB’s analyses consider. We noticed that HB 72’s fiscal note says the law’s provision for local district revenue to cover 30 percent of the Foundation School Program excludes ""enrichment equalization, experienced teacher and equalization transition allotments."" Also, DeSilva pointed out, HB 72 permitted districts to spend revenue raised locally in excess of whatever total comprised 30 percent of the Foundation School Program. For more perspective, we queried Houston consultant Paul Colbert, a former six-term Texas House member steeped in school funding issues. By phone, Colbert concurred that the 1984 law didn’t regulate considerable school revenue raised from local property taxes--a weakness later addressed by lawmakers in response to a Texas Supreme Court directive. Colbert summed up: ""Now the Foundation School Program describes pretty much what we spend on education. Back then, nowhere near. We used to pretend that a whole of lot of money districts had to spend wasn’t there."" Generally too, Colbert suggested, the LBB-presented percentages don’t appear to consistently consider all the same kinds of school spending--a critique that reminded us of the complexities of school finance and one that DeSilva rebuffed (see their compiled responses here). Colbert noted, for instance, that state-supported charter school districts didn’t exist in the 1980s while such state spending was expected to exceed $2.5 billion in 2017-18. Set that spending aside, Colbert wrote, and the state share of spending on traditional districts shrinks to 34 percent of combined state-local aid. ""So, while Milder’s claim that the state was paying 2/3 of the FSP in 1985 is true but doesn’t tell the whole story,"" Colbert elaborated, ""the LBB’s counter-explanation is also true but doesn’t tell the whole story."" DeSilva, when we followed up, stood by the LBB’s percentages. The chart, he wrote, ""shows funding reflective of statutory parameters in place at the time."" Unsaid: Those parameters can change at the discretion of lawmakers. Our ruling Milder said: ""In the 1980s, the state funded 68% of school expenses, and now the state’s share is 38%."" The state’s share of state-local education spending has slid, we confirmed, though not as much as Milder declared. In the 1980s, lawmakers voted for the state to cover 70 percent of the Foundation School Program yet state aid actually covered a little more than half of state-local costs. State aid covered 44 percent of such costs in 2016; it’s expected to cover 38 percent of such costs in 2019. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

George P. Bush falsely describes himself as 'retired' Navy officer
","George P. Bush, seeking a second term as state land commissioner, touts his time in the Navy in a voter mailer brought to our attention by his predecessor. ""Did you know there are 1.7 million veterans in Texas alone?"" Bush’s mailer opens. His message continues: ""Retired U.S. Navy officer George P. Bush is committed to protecting our veterans who have served this great nation."" Hold on. Did Bush, who turns 42 in April 2018, retire from the Navy? Jerry Patterson, the former land commissioner challenging Bush in this year’s Republican primary, questioned that after telling us he’d received Bush’s mailer at his home after hearing about it from other veterans. Patterson asserted by phone: ""It takes 20 years to retire from the armed forces."" He himself, Patterson said, retired from the Marines as a lieutenant colonel after more than 20 years of service. ""If this mailing goes out to military veterans, essentially he’s saying I know what you went through, I served for 20 years--and that’s not true,"" Patterson said. We decided to check the facts. For starters, Bush was a Navy Reserve officer. By email, Navy spokeswoman Katie Suich gave us a document confirming that George Prescott Bush was commissioned as a Navy Reserve officer on May 21, 2007, and left the Navy Reserve as a lieutenant on May 9, 2017. Bush's biographical entry on his campaign website says Bush served in ""Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan as an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve."" In a 2011 article for USA Today, Bush wrote: ""Earlier this year, I returned to Texas from Afghanistan, where I was deployed as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve."" Bush noted then that he’d been inspired to enlist in his thirties after a ceremony honoring his grandfather, President George H.W. Bush, who served during World War II. Bush campaign spokesman, Lee Spieckerman, told us that Bush was honorably discharged from the Navy in 2017, ""having achieved the rank of Lieutenant."" Spieckerman also passed along documents and photos including a May 15, 2007, letter congratulating Bush on his selection as an intelligence officer and a certificate showing Bush was honorably discharged as a lieutenant on May 9, 2017. Another provided document, dated Feb. 4, 2011, discharges Bush from active duty. The form says Bush served one year, four months and 15 days on active duty from June 8, 2010, through Feb. 4, 2011, following on 26 days of active duty before that. (Spieckerman showed in another document that Bush was assigned to Afghanistan from August 2010 to January 2011.) The discharge form credits Bush with previously racking up two years, 11 months and five days of inactive duty. Navy confirmation of service dates, retirement requirements We also reached out to the Navy which says on a web page: ""If you decide to pursue your Navy career for at least 20 years, you’ll qualify for generous retirement pay – and even more if you serve longer."" Another Navy web page says that by serving in the Navy Reserve, a person earns ""points toward retirement benefits every time you drill."" Suich also pointed out a Defense Finance and Accounting Service web page listing types of military retirement, most of them requiring 15 or 20 years of service. According to the page, reservists can retire at age 60 with 20 years of active service. For our part, we spotted a Defense Department website devoted to military compensation including this statement: ""Service members who remain on active duty or serve in the Reserves or Guard for a sufficient period of time (usually a minimum of 20 years) may retire and receive retired pay. Members who become disabled while on duty may be medically retired and receive a disability retirement."" Spieckerman says 'retired' used in colloquial sense We asked Bush’s campaign if he’s indeed a retired officer given the general requirement that a retiree serve 20 years and be age 60. By email, Spieckerman replied that Bush ""was honorably discharged but is not technically ‘retired’ under Department of Defense regulations. I think that the campaign used the term ‘retired’ in campaign materials in the civilian, colloquial sense,"" meaning, Spieckerman wrote, that Bush ""is no longer active in the military. There was no intent to imply that he was receiving retirement pay and benefits, etc."" Our ruling In a voter mailer, Bush says he’s a ""retired U.S. Navy officer."" Bush served nearly a decade as an officer in the Navy Reserve. But that doesn’t make him a retired officer, we find. At minimum, Bush would need to have served longer to call himself that.

Did Gillibrand 'defend and harbor' Bill Clinton during impeachment, as Kellyanne Conway said?
","Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has emerged as one of the most outspoken members of Congress against sexual assault. But White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway assailed Gillibrand after the senator criticized President Donald Trump on Twitter for hiring Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who resigned amid allegations of domestic abuse. ""I don’t need a lecture from Kirsten Gillibrand or anybody else who protected and defended and harbored a sitting president who had sexual relations in the Oval Office and was impeached for lying,"" Conway said on ABC’s This Week. Gillibrand has spent years trying to pass legislation to curb sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. Her work coined her the title of the ‘#MeToo Senator’ on CBS’ 60 Minutes recently. Gillibrand also made headlines last year when she said former President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with a former White House intern became public in 1998. Conway accuses the senator of defending Clinton when he was a sitting president. Is there any truth to her claim? Clinton’s impeachment Monica Lewinsky had an affair with Clinton as a White House intern. When the affair was first made public through media reports in January 1998, Clinton denied the affair for several months until he admitted to it on national television in August that year. The House approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton in December 1998. The Senate acquitted Clinton of those charges in 1999. All 45 Democrats in the Senate voted against the impeachment charges at the time. Only seven of the Democrats remain in the Senate today. Gillibrand’s career Gillibrand worked as a lawyer at a Manhattan law firm during Clinton’s impeachment, then accepted a position as special counsel at the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development in 2000. She worked there for the rest of Clinton’s term for Andrew M. Cuomo, who was secretary of the agency at the time. She also volunteered for Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaign that year. Gillibrand announced a run for Congress in 2005 and she was elected in 2006, nearly nine years after Clinton's affair became public. Gillibrand succeeded Hillary Clinton as a U.S. senator representing New York in 2009. We could find no evidence suggesting Gillibrand publicly defended President Clinton while he was in office. Gillibrand and the Clintons But she has been a political ally to the Clintons for almost two decades. Bill Clinton campaigned for Gillibrand during her first run for an upstate Congressional seat in 2006. Three years later, he headlined a fundraiser for Gillibrand after she was appointed to Hillary Clinton's Senate seat. Gillibrand accepted his endorsement for her re-election the following year. Gillibrand donated to Hillary Clinton's campaigns for Senate and helped campaign for her in 2016.  Gillibrand appeared publicly with Bill Clinton several times since her first election. She did not publicly condemn the former president’s actions until last year. The White House did not respond to our inquiry about Conway’s claim. Our ruling We could find no evidence that Gillibrand ""protected and defended and harbored a sitting president who had sexual relations in the Oval Office and was impeached for lying."" Gillibrand was not elected to Congress until 2006. She worked for the Clinton administration briefly in 2000 after the president was impeached.

New York state leads the country in government debt per resident

John DeFrancisco, a GOP candidate for governor, claimed that one-third of New York state’s population is on Medicaid. That’s True.

NC Democrat says Trump is cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent
","In his first year as president, Donald Trump made it clear that he wants to cut some government programs. He signed an executive order instructing budget writers to root out waste in the federal government. And his proposed budget included cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as education programs. Trump’s moves have sparked outcry among Democrats, who have argued that the cuts will make government less effective and endanger the environment. In North Carolina, state Rep. Bobbie Richardson recently took to Twitter to raise alarm about Trump’s latest budget proposal and how it affects the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Richardson, a three-term representative from Louisburg, is the Democratic whip in the state House. ""The president is cutting the CDC budget by 80%. Is this recklessness or deliberate action against preventive healthcare?"" Richardson tweeted on Feb. 3. She has about 1,000 followers. PolitiFact found this tweet questionable. The CDC is the nation’s primary source for developing and applying disease prevention methods and health education activities. Cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent would have a drastic impact on its ability to study America’s ability to help prevent illness across the country. What the CDC said Finding the truth seemed as simple as asking CDC officials about their budget. So we reached out to them. Bernadette Burden, a senior press officer for the CDC, responded Wednesday. She said the CDC’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019, which starts in July, is $5.66 billion. That’s a decrease of approximately $1.4 billion – or 20 percent – compared to the spending level, Burden said in an email. A breakdown of spending in the current fiscal year is available on the CDC website. The CDC provided a fact sheet of Trump’s budget, which outlines where he aims to cut. Among other changes, Trump’s budget would cut $138 million from the program dedicated to chronic disease prevention and health promotion, cut $59.9 million from programs studying ""emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases,"" and $46 million from a program called ""Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health."" A zoonotic disease is a disease that can be transmitted from animals to people. Burden noted that the CDC adapted its budget request to includes program reductions and eliminations that Trump proposed last year. Misreading headlines? PolitiFact couldn’t find any news articles that verified Richardson’s claim. It’s possible that Richardson misquoted the headline from this Washington Post story: ""CDC to cut by 80 percent efforts to prevent global disease outbreak."" The story says the CDC is downsizing one of its specific efforts – its epidemic prevention activities – because money is running out. The epidemic prevention programs ""train front-line workers in outbreak detection and work to strengthen laboratory and emergency response systems in countries where disease risks are greatest,"" the Post reported. The CDC is cutting its efforts in 39 out of 49 countries. It’s unclear if Richardson misread the Washington Post headline. Nonetheless, PolitiFact believes this opportunity is as good as any to remind folks to read stories before making judgements about news based on headlines. As for Richardson, her assistant, Anna Meadows, confirmed that neither she nor Richardson could find the original source for the tweet. ""She deleted the post after your inquiry, since she couldn’t find the source,"" Meadows said in an email. Our ruling Richardson tweeted that President Trump is ""cutting the CDC budget by 80 percent."" The proposal is a 20 percent cut – which is not remotely close to Richardson’s claim.

Bruce Rauner followed that up with a televised campaign ad that portrays the re-election seeking incumbent as ""leading the charge"" to cut taxes for working people in Illinois. The Rauner ad takes aim at Democratic House Speaker Mike Madigan, the governor’s frequent nemesis, who gets blamed for imposing a $5 billion tax increase last summer over Rauner’s objection. At 14 seconds, the spot says: ""Bruce Rauner vetoed the Madigan income tax increase, and now Rauner’s leading the charge to reverse it. The Rauner plan: More take-home pay for working families, lower taxes for job creators and $1 billion in tax relief for Illinois."" Rauner didn’t actually include that tax cut in his spending plan, which ironically relies on the revenue bump from the very tax increase he assails. But he did argue in his speech to lawmakers that an overhaul to state pensions could be used to fund a ""nearly $1 billion tax cut."" Though Rauner rounded up, the value of the proposed tax cut is noted in the governor’s budget book as $917 million. At the same time, however, the Rauner budget did anticipate separate cost saving initiatives which, if realized, would over several years shift responsibility for more than $1 billion in expenses for teacher pensions off the state books and on to local property taxpayers. Given all that, can Rauner really lay claim as he does in his ad to having a plan for $1 billion in tax relief? We decided to take a look. Rauner’s previous budgets have been laden with fiscal gimmicks, leading PolitiFact to twice award the governor its lowest Pants-on-Fire! credibility rating for claiming they were balanced. His latest offering appears constructed with more care. Not present, for example, was the major asterisk he slipped into his 2017 budget which attributed more than $4 billion in savings to a legislative compromise that had not been hammered out and never was. That said, the latest budget offering and tax-cut plan from Rauner has its share of difficult-to-achieve contingencies and faces challenges both in the Legislature and likely the courts as well. First, Rauner would need the Legislature to pass a pension-reform bill that upends the current formula for calculating future benefits. The governor didn’t put forward a specific proposal but he said the idea is based on a model that makes employees choose between annual salary increases and cost of living increases to pension benefits. What’s more, just months after Rauner took office in 2015 the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously struck down a sweeping pension reform plan approved two years earlier. The court found that the state Constitution says retirement benefits, once offered to public workers, can not be ""diminished or impaired."" At the same time, however, the court hinted that it might be possible to change the structure of pension benefits as long as employees got something of equal value in return. The concept has never been legally tested. So even if lawmakers and the governor agreed on a pension-reform fix, it almost certainly would face a court challenge with an uncertain outcome. The idea that the very difficult pension reform would be ironed out in the coming months leaves critics skeptical of Rauner’s plan. On top of that, the governor would have to convince the Democratic-controlled Legislature to then partly reverse the income tax increase it passed, with some Republican votes, last year. ""It needs legislative approval on the front end and back end and a Constitutional review in the middle — other than that it’s golden,"" said Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a Chicago-based think tank partly funded by labor unions. Rauner’s campaign staff did not respond to questions from the BGA about the governor’s tax cut claim. Also left hanging were questions about the pension spending shift which over time could force local schools to seek significant property tax hikes. Separately, the governor’s office did issue this statement: ""We don’t need pension reform to balance the budget, but if we can take that extra step we can put nearly $1 billion back in taxpayers’ pockets and begin to roll back the tax hike with a 1.4 percent tax rate cut. We look forward to working together with legislators on both sides of the aisle to pass these vital reforms and get Illinois moving in the right direction."" Rauner says he has a plan for ""$1 billion in tax relief for Illinois"" tied to a pension overhaul. But that statement is suspect on multiple levels — even for a campaign commercial. There is no actual plan to examine. The ""plan"" consists of brief mentions in a more than 550-page budget proposal and a few lines in a speech, but no details were provided to explain how the savings would be implemented or calculated. However, the tax cut was then featured prominently in a re-election campaign ad the day after Rauner unveiled his budget. What’s more, Rauner’s budget does include separate provisions to shift teacher pension costs off the state books and on to local school districts where property taxpayers would likely have to collectively pick up a tab costing more than $1 billion. Rauner’s ad highlights a vague $1 billion tax cut plan, but makes no mention of the added expense to local taxpayers that would be the practical effect of his pension cost shift. His tax cut claim should not be considered in a vacuum, which is why we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/feb/16/bruce-rauner/does-gov-rauner-truly-have-1-billion-tax-relief-pl/

Supreme Court candidate Rebecca Dallet's claim that she has presided over more than 10,000 cases
","Rebecca Dallet argues she is the most experienced candidate running in the Feb. 20, 2018, primary for Wisconsin Supreme Court. The liberal-leaning Milwaukee County circuit judge faces Madison attorney Tim Burns, a declared Democrat, and conservative Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock. The two with the most votes will square off April 3 to replace conservative Justice Michael Gableman, who is not seeking re-election. Dallet, in answering questions from the Wisconsin Justice Initiative about her qualifications, said that as a judge she has ""presided over more than 10,000 cases."" Her response, published online Jan. 19, 2018, essentially repeats a claim she has made a number of times, including in news releases and in interviews. ""Presided over"" suggests significant involvement in a case and 10,000 is a big number. Let’s take a look. Dallet’s caseload Dallet was elected judge in 2008. As one of 47 Milwaukee County judges, she currently serves in the civil division, which handles cases such as lawsuits, small claims and restraining orders. She previously was assigned homicide, felony drug, felony sexual assault and felony gun cases; general misdemeanor and domestic violence cases, and other matters. We contacted the Milwaukee County circuit clerk’s office, which provided a spreadsheet of cases in which Dallet is listed as the ""responsible court official."" The spreadsheet shows 11,808 cases assigned to Dallet. The major categories break down this way: Type of case Number of cases Percentage of cases Traffic 2,939 24.9% Misdemeanor 2,591 21.9% Civil 2,576 21.8% Felony 2,292 19.4% But there are some points worth noting. Amy Wochos, a senior administrator with the court clerk’s office, told us the list probably both overcounts and undercounts Dallet’s cases. For example, the list does not include cases where Dallet conducted some hearings, but then the case was transferred to another judge to conduct the remaining hearings. And the list includes cases in which another judge conducted all the hearings in a case, but then the case was technically transferred to Dallet before it was officially closed in the court system. An example of the latter: In the first case on Dallet’s list, a West Allis man was charged in 2008 with drug possession. The court record shows he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The man’s initial court appearance and some other matters were handled by Circuit Court commissioners; an indigency hearing and a status conference were held by one Circuit Court judge and the sentencing was handled by another judge. For all practical purposes, the case was complete, but it was transferred to Dallet prior to a formal judgment of conviction being entered into the record. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved through a plea bargain, not by a trial. But trials can lead to lengthy proceedings. An example: In December 2008, a Milwaukee man was charged with second offense possession of marijuana, a felony, and misdemeanor bail jumping. Court commissioners handled the initial steps, including a hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to put the man on trial. Starting in January 2009, Dallet handled the case the rest of the way, for a total of about six months. In-court proceedings included a motion hearing, a scheduling conference, a pretrial conference and several other hearings leading up to a two-day jury trial. The man was found guilty and was sentenced by Dallet on March 30, 2009. The case came before Dallet again three months later, when she had to rule on a request from the man regarding his sentencing. Before we wrap up, one more example: The first civil case on Dallet’s list was a foreclosure filed in March 2010. It remained on the court docket for more than seven years, until November 2017, though it was before Dallet only briefly. The case was transferred to her in March 2016 and she later issued two orders in the case. In sum, some cases handled by a judge can involve numerous actions and proceedings over a period of months, while others require less activity. And it’s important to note that in-court proceedings don’t take into account any research or other preparation a judge has to do outside of court. Like criminal cases, Dallet may have spent relatively little time on some civil cases and much more time on others. Our rating Dallet says that as a judge, she has ""presided over more than 10,000 cases."" The best-available count shows Dallet has handled some 11,800 cases, including criminal and civil matters. For a statement that is accurate, without any significant information missing, our rating is True.
  Screnock says Tim Burns and Rebecca Dallet ""have openly criticized laws signed by Governor Walker that they disagree with and are campaigning as activists who will implement their policies from the bench."" Our rating: Half True. Burns says he is ""one of America's leading consumer lawyers."" Our rating: False.",/factchecks/2018/feb/16/rebecca-dallet/supreme-court-candidate-rebecca-dallets-claim-she-/

Mostly False: 18 U.S. school shootings so far in 2018 and 18 in rest of the world over past 20 years
","Amid the early news reports about a Florida school shooting that left 17 dead on Feb. 14, 2018, longtime network TV journalist and author Jeff Greenfield declared in a tweet: In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1.
  It’s a provocative claim that drew more the 130,000 likes on Twitter. Greenfield, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, may be on the right track generally in contrasting how much gun violence there is in America compared to the rest of the world. But as for his specific claim, he leaves a misleading impression with the U.S. part and lacks evidence for the part about the rest of the world. U.S. school shootings On the U.S. part of his claim, Greenfield told us his 18 school shootings in 2018 comes from the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, as reported by ABC News. We found that in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Politico, TIME, CNBC and other national media also reported on Everytown’s 18 figure. In addition, the New York Daily News claimed 18 school shootings, listing the same incidents as Everytown, and HuffPost reported 18, too. But there are some major caveats to that figure. Indeed, when we asked Greenfield for information to back up his claim, he noted to us in his email that the Everytown group’s count ""conflates very different incidents, from the harmless to the deadly."" As PolitiFact National has reported, Everytown, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence, uses a broad definition of school shooting -- that is, any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building, or on a school campus or grounds. Its database includes incidents when no one was injured; attempted or completed suicide, with no intent to injure others; and cases when a gun was fired unintentionally, resulting in injury or death. The list also includes incidents on college campuses. As we’ll see, Everytown counts shooting incidents that are dramatically different than what happened in Florida: 2018 U.S. school shootings as counted by Everytown Date Place Details Jan. 3 East Olive Elementary, St. Johns, Mich. Man committed suicide in parking lot. No other injuries. (We found the building was not being used as a school, as East Olive had been shut down more than six months earlier.) Jan. 4 New Start High, Seattle Unidentified shooter fired shots into building. No injuries. Jan. 10 Grayson College, Denison, Texas Student unintentionally fired a bullet from gun legally possessed by an instructor that struck a wall. No injuries. Jan. 10 Coronado Elementary, Sierra Vista, Ariz. Student committed suicide in bathroom. No other injuries. Jan. 10 California State University, San Bernardino Gunshots, most likely fired from off campus, hit a campus building window. No injuries. Jan. 15 Wiley College, Marshall, Texas Shots fired from car in parking lot, with one shot hitting window of residence hall. No injuries. Jan. 20 Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, N.C. One student wounds another student during argument at sorority party. Jan. 22 Italy High, Italy, Texas Student opens fire in cafeteria, wounding one student before firing at another student and missing. Jan. 22 NET Charter High, Gentilly, La. Unknown person fired shots at students standing in parking lot. No injuries from gunshots. Jan. 23 Marshall County High, Benton, Ky. 2 students left dead in mass shooting by student. More than a dozen students injured. Jan. 25 Murphy High, Mobile, Ala. Student fired into the air outside school after argument in school. No injuries. Jan. 26 Dearborn High, Dearborn, Mich. Individual ejected from game for fighting was shot at in parking lot. No injuries. Jan. 31 Lincoln High, Philadelphia Man fatally wounded in fight in parking lot. Feb. 1 Salvador B. Castro Middle, Los Angeles Student unintentionally fires gun in classroom, wounds two students. Feb. 5 Oxon Hill High, Oxon Hill, Md. Student wounded in parking lot during apparent robbery. Feb. 5 Harmony Learning K-12, Maplewood, Minn. Student pressed trigger on school liaison officer’s gun. No injuries. Feb. 8 Metropolitan High, New York, N.Y. Student fired gun into floor in classroom. No injuries. Feb. 14 Stoneman Douglas High, Parkland, Fla. Ex-student allegedly commits mass shooting; 17 deaths. So, there are 18 incidents in which a gun was fired inside a school or on school property. Three -- Italy, Texas, Kentucky and Florida -- were mass shootings. But of the other shootings: Nine involved no deaths and no gunshot injuries. Two were suicides, with no other injuries (including the one at the closed school). Three were unintentional (although one caused injuries). Rest of the world As PolitiFact National has noted, mass shootings do happen in other countries. But they do not happen with the same frequency as in the United States. Two researchers -- Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University -- analyzed mass shootings in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000-14. Aside from the United States, they looked at Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. The United States had more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, according to their research. While part of this is because the United States has a much bigger population than all but China, the difference can’t be explained by skewed population numbers alone. But as for the other part of Greenfield’s claim -- that there have been only 18 school shootings in the rest of the world over the past 20 years -- Greenfield told us he couldn’t recall the source of that information, adding, ""yes, I cop to insufficient research."" Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive (which the New York Times uses to track school shooting data), told us the 18-shootings figure could be correct in terms of how many mass shootings occur in schools outside of the United States that get widespread news coverage. But Bryant said there is no way to know -- based on the definition of school shootings that Greenfield relies on -- how many such shootings occur around the globe. About 24 hours after posting the tweet, Greenfield took it down. Our rating In the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Greenfield said: ""In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1."" By one count widely cited in the news media, there have been 18 incidents in which shots were fired inside or outside of a school or university building in the United States so far in 2018. But only three involved a mass shooting. And the count includes two suicides, three accidental shootings and nine incidents in which there were no fatalities or injuries. As for the rest of the world, Greenfield had no evidence to back up that part of his claim. And an expert relied on by the New York Times for gun violence statistics told us there is no way to know how many school shootings -- using the definition Greenfield relies on -- have occurred outside of the United States over the past 20 years. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/feb/15/jeff-greenfield/mostly-false-18-us-school-shootings-so-far-2018-an/
