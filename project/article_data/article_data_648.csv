 Rick Santorum says church attendance in the single digits in Europe because of government support
","
Rick Santorum often says on the campaign trail that liberty -- economic and spiritual -- has made America great. But Europe isn't so fortunate.

""Look at every other country from which we came and almost every one, if not every one, are dead from a faith perspective,"" the former U.S. senator, R-Penn., said at a Henniker, N.H., house party on July 18, 2011. ""You go to Europe, church attendance rates in the single digits -- secular society. Why? Because the government co-opted faith, because faith and the government are intertwined. (People in Europe) pay taxes -- you don’t tithe to your church -- you pay taxes to support your church, and they’ve been co-opted to the point where the two are unrecognizable as far as of difference, and so people have lost faith.""

There's a lot to unpack here. But let’s start with his claim about church attendance rates:  Do Europeans attend church, on a percentage basis, in the single digits?

When we asked Santorum’s campaign for its source on this, we were pointed to news articles dating back to 2005 and a European Social Survey conducted in 2008 and 2009. All detail declining church attendance, but none indicate single-digit rates continent-wide.
 
In fact, Santorum’s back-up material largely reaffirms the view of the experts on European worship patterns we consulted, who say Santorum is exaggerating.

""Europe as a whole, compared to the United States is much less religious, but there are great differences between European countries,"" says Peter Berger, Director of the Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs at Boston University.

Ronald Inglehart, a political scientist at the University of Michigan and chairman of the Stockholm-based World Values Survey, which collects public input in religious practices in more than 100 countries, said Santorum is correct to a point. England, France, and the Scandinavian countries, do indeed have attendance rates in the single digits.

""But Italy has about 39 percent church attendance; Ireland has about 65 percent; Portugal 30; Spain 20; Germany 15. So, single digits are actually fairly rare.""

And what about about Santorum’s other main contention: that European countries that collect a so-called ""church tax"" or earmark public money for churches, are less religious?

Let’s recall the candidate’s exact words:

People in Europe ""pay taxes to support your church, and they’ve been co-opted to the point where the two are unrecognizable in terms of difference and so people have lost faith.""

As sources, the Santorum campaign cited an unusual pair: French historian Alexis deTocqueville, who died in 1859, and Santorum’s 2012 GOP-rival Mitt Romney. Both men have argued  -- 178 years apart -- that America is better off for not having a state religion.

But neither prove Santorum’s claim that directing tax dollars to churches drives down attendance levels in 2011.

""I think he’s not terribly well-informed,"" said Inglehart of the World Values Survey, ""He is stretching.""

Indeed, some churches get tax support and still have high attendance rates, according to World Values Survey:

Italy directs tax dollars to churches and attendance levels there stand at 39 percent, roughly on par with the U.S.

Germany and Austria levy ""church taxes"" and have rates of church attendance around 15 percent.

Finland and Iceland also collect taxes for religious use, and their churchgoing rates stand at around 4 percent.

Berger examined this question in his book Religious America, Secular Europe?  He says that in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, Europe saw instances when political tensions led to dissatisfaction with a state church. But Berger says Santorum misses the mark when he suggests that government-church relations are driving contemporary worship trends.

""He is distorting things. To talk about Europe today as if it were Europe 200 years ago is not very accurate.""

Our Ruling:

While Santorum is right that some European countries have church attendance rates that are below 10 percent, we found others that have rates of worship well above the single digits.

Santorum’s other claim, that European governments collect taxes and send the money to churches, is also a mixed bag. Santorum is correct when he says some countries assess so-called church taxes. But more importantly to his main point, scholars say they don't see a connection between the taxes and church attendance. Indeed, the rate in Italy is about 39 percent. So we rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/27/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-church-attendance-single-digits/

Obama says the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year he took office
","
In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama laid out his version of how the deficit situation got to where it is. And Obama placed much of the blame at the feet of his predecessor, George W. Bush.

""For the last decade, we’ve spent more money than we take in,"" Obama said. ""In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus. But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nation’s credit card.

""As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.""

We've dealt with the ""what-Obama-inherited"" question before. Obama's suggestion that the deficit woes the country now faces are the result of Bush's tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program -- rather than the recession -- is certainly debatable. But since many Republicans are blaming the problem on reckless spending by Obama, we decided to check his claim that ""the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.""

In January, 2009, just prior to Obama being sworn in as president, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an estimate of the projected deficit for the 2009 fiscal year (which straddled both Bush's and Obama's terms).

According to the CBO report, ""The ongoing turmoil in the housing and financial markets has taken a major toll on the federal budget. CBO currently projects that the deficit this year will total $1.2 trillion, or 8.3 percent of GDP.""

The CBO cited a number of factors for why the federal fiscal situation would be ""dramatically worse"" in 2009 than 2008.

According to the CBO, ""A drop in tax revenues and increased federal spending (much of it related to the government’s actions to address the crisis in the housing and financial markets) both contribute to the robust growth in this year’s deficit. Compared with receipts last year, collections from corporate income taxes are anticipated to decline by 27 percent and individual income taxes by 8 percent; in normal economic conditions, they would both grow by several percentage points. In addition, the estimated deficit includes outlays of more than $180 billion to reflect the cost of transactions of the TARP.""

In addition, the CBO noted, as a result of the recession, the federal government boosted spending on programs such as those providing unemployment compensation and nutrition assistance.

Again, this was the deficit projection for 2009 before Obama took office. The CBO acknowledged it might get worse.

""That total ($1.2 trillion deficit), however, does not include the effects of any future legislation,"" the CBO noted. ""Enactment of an economic stimulus package, for example, would add to the 2009 deficit.""

As we know, of course, the Democrat-controlled Congress did pass a massive economic stimulus package. And, in fact, due in large part to the stimulus, the actual deficit for 2009 ended up about $200 billion more than the CBO projected in January 2009. 

An April study from the Pew Charitable Trust  found that a combination of factors -- increased government spending, tax cuts and the economic downturn -- were mostly to blame for the large budget deficits.

But Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the center for Economic Policy Research, argued in a piece published on the Huffington Post on July 27, 2011, that it's really the recession, and not any policy decisions from the Bush presidency, that are to blame for the unsustainable deficit projections. If the unemployment rate returned to the 4.7 percent rate of 2007, he wrote, the bulk of the deficit would disappear.

To lay the budget crisis on Bush tax cuts is misleading, Baker wrote. 
""In its budget projections from January 2008, the last set before the impact of the collapse of the housing bubble was clear, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected a deficit of just $198 billion for 2009,"" Baker wrote. ""This is less than one-fifth of the 'on track to top $1 trillion' figure that President Obama gave in his speech. This is a serious error.

Rather, Baker wrote, ""It was the recession, and the response to it, that pushed the deficit in 2009 from the $198 billion projected by CBO to the over $1 trillion noted by President Obama in his speech.""

""No one can justify wasting money on wars that should not have been fought, giving away tax breaks to people who don't need them, or deliberately designing a prescription drug benefit so that it needlessly hands hundreds of billions of dollars to drug companies and insurers,"" Baker wrote. ""But even with all of this waste, the deficit was still not out of control.""

We're not going to wade into the debate over how much of the deficit to assign to Bush or Obama's policies. Obama may be laying too much blame for the deficit crisis on Bush policies, and not enough on the recession. But the economic downturn was in full bloom when Obama took office and he is correct that before he enacted any policies as president, the CBO projected a 2009 deficit of $1.2 trillion (as well as significant projected deficits in years to come as well). We rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/27/barack-obama/obama-says-deficit-was-track-top-1-trillion-year-h/
"['Ohio', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says most debt-ceiling increases have been short-term solutions
","
Just cut spending. No, raise taxes on the rich, too. What if we reform the whole tax code? Fine, but don’t spook the financial markets, and don’t make us perform this dance again next year.

So many options, so little agreement.

Welcome to July 2011, when ordinary Americans are following the shots and fouls of the federal debt as if this were Sweet 16 college basketball brackets.

The debt is a problem, but failure to raise the amount the government can legally borrow could be worse, many say. What can be done about it?

President Barack Obama, House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders are trying to hash this out while the government can still pay all its bills. One of their disagreements is how high to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, and how much spending should be cut to correspond with that hike.

Some Republicans want a debt hike that is a short-term solution for now, matched with spending cuts, while working on more sweeping spending reforms over the next year. The White House hoped for something grander, saying it doesn’t want to just punt the problem into an election year. Others want to pair spending compromises with tax reform, but that would require a short-term solution to get past the looming crisis now and a return to the table later with long-sought tax reform. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman is among those advocates.

Right now, ""we simply don’t have time to deal with these bigger issues like tax reform,"" Portman said to MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on July 25, 2011.

""And by the way, if you look back, historically, you know usually the debt limit is for less than a year,"" he added. ""Thirty-four of the last 44 (debt hikes) have been for less than a year. So, this notion that short-term is somehow the exception, it's actually the rule.""

Portman, a Republican who was director of the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, intrigued PolitiFact Ohio with his answer, because he was suggesting that this nation has done an awful lot of punting on the debt ceiling. So we asked his office where he got his information.

Spokeswoman Christine Mangi referred us to a July 24 blog post by Keith Hennessey, who maintains a website called ""Your Guide to American Economic Policy."" Hennessey is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative think tank at Stanford University, and a lecturer at Stanford’s graduate business and law schools. Hennessey also has extensive policy experience as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush and on Capitol Hill.

We turned to Hennessey’s blog and to his backup data. We won’t bore you with details, but we spotted an error in the data presentation as it related to a certain time period. We contacted Hennessey by phone and e-mail and he graciously acknowledged the error and corrected his website. He noted in a return e-mail that it didn’t change his broader point.

He was right. We know because he shared his data with us and told us of the original source, namely, historical tables on the federal debt since 1940. These are maintained by the White House Office of Management and Budget -- Portman’s old outfit -- and we keep sets of these budget documents in our office because you never know when you’ll need them. We took them off the shelf and confirmed Hennessey’s trend line.

That is, of the 44 most recent times that the debt limit has been raised, going back to 1980, Congress and the president have had to come back within a year on 34 occasions and raise it again. Wars, recessions, excessive spending, inadequate revenues, unbalanced budgets -- stuff has happened.

Hennessey picked the number 44 because it represents the last 30 years of debt hikes.

""You could argue things are different now – it’s more difficult for Congress to act, and the spending and deficit problems we face combine with legislative uncertainty around the debt limit deadline to create undesirable financial market pressures,"" Hennessey wrote in his blog. But he added, ""A debt limit extension of three, six, or nine months would be routine based on historic practice.""

That’s what Portman said, too -- that 34 of the last 44 have lasted for less than a year.

Portman’s statement was accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter it rates True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/27/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-most-debt-ceiling-increases-h/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Sheila Harsdorf']","
State Senator Sheila Harsdorf says recall election opponent Shelly Moore opposes any limit on taxes
","
Don’t confuse Shelly with Sheila in the recall election that could be key in deciding which party controls the Wisconsin state Senate.

That’s the commercial message brought to you by state Sen. Sheila Harsdorf, the River Falls Republican fighting to keep her job in August 2011 -- along with seven other senators.

In one of several radio ads, Harsdorf paints herself as a courageous fighter against special interests and a backer of smaller government who ""understands that government should serve taxpayers, not the other way around.""

""That’s what sets Sheila apart from her opponent, union activist Shelly Moore,"" the ""Serving Taxpayers"" ad continues. ""Moore opposes any limit on taxes. This summer let’s tell Shelly Moore we can’t afford more taxes.""

Harsdorf voted for Gov. Scott Walker’s budget, which included a municipal property-tax freeze and tight limits on the ability of school districts to raise property taxes. She has been labeling Shelly Moore -- who has campaigned against the GOP-backed budget -- a tax-and-spend liberal.

But Harsdorf’s claim that Moore -- her opponent in the Aug. 9 recall election -- stands against all tax limits is a broader line of attack.

So we decided to take a look.

When we asked Harsdorf to back her claim, her campaign made it clear it is using Moore’s union leader background as a basis for the attack.

A high-school English and drama teacher, Moore was president or vice-president of her local union in Ellsworth from 1999 to 2004. She was also deeply involved in statewide politics as early as 2001 with the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the powerful state teachers union. Moore says she served from 2001-2003 on the WEAC committee that recommends lobbying positions for the organization. From 2003 until May 2011 she was on WEAC’s state board.

Harsdorf points to Moore’s activism in WEAC and to WEAC’s opposition to three major efforts to rein in taxes since 2003: 
Harsdorf says that as a union leader, voting board member and member of WEAC’s legislative committee, Moore supported the union’s positions.

Harsdorf also released an email from Moore -- written as a constituent to her senator -- that sheds some light on what Moore has said in her own words on revenue limits and TABOR.

Let’s examine the evidence:

The records show Harsdorf’s office received anti-TABOR contacts both from Moore personally and from Moore on behalf of WEAC.

Moore also wrote to Harsdorf regarding the longstanding revenue caps on schools. In January 2005, Moore told Harsdorf those caps on schools ""DO NOT WORK."" Schools took budget cuts, she wrote, and are ""desperate"" and ""dying.""

Moore has not disputed the authenticity of the documents.

But Moore told us she shouldn’t be held to every WEAC position just because she was on the board. She described herself as moderate, a characterization Harsdorf disputes.

But in an interview, Moore didn’t cite any area of disagreement with the union on tax limits -- and that’s the subject of the radio ad.

Asked about the three big anti-tax proposals cited by Harsdorf, Moore was critical of the longstanding revenue caps on schools. She said they disproportionately affected fiscally responsible districts.

She questioned the effectiveness of property-tax freezes, saying governments will find other ways to identify needed revenue, such as using fees.

As for TABOR, she said legislators were eyeing the Colorado model, which she described as ineffective and detrimental to critical services.

So just what is Moore’s position on taxes and limits to them?

Moore pointed to her opposition to two particular tax increases in Walker’s budget, citing it as evidence that she does support a limit on some taxes.

Moore was talking about Walker’s actions on tax credits that limit or eliminate the income-tax liability of low-income homeowners, renters and working families. The budget reduced those tax credits (earned income credit and the Homestead credit) by about $69.8 million over two years.

Moore says she wants Wisconsin to get away from tax shifting, but has ""no interest"" in raising taxes on anyone. She said she is concerned tax burdens are tilted toward the average person and away from corporations. She opposed the corporate tax breaks Walker put in the budget.

Moore also claims the budget cut $1.6 billion in funding from local schools. We fact-checked that number, used by Rep. Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, and gave it a Barely True because it was based on a Democratic plan in 2009 to ease up on limits that dictate how much schools can raise in property taxes in 2011-13.

Let’s review.

In a radio ad, Harsdorf contrasts her vote for a budget with a property-tax freeze with the record of her opponent, saying ""Moore opposes any limit on taxes."" This is one of those cases where a candidate has some facts on her side but overplays the hand.

Moore has objected to several high-profile tax restraint efforts over the years, either personally and/or in her role as a union leader. But Harsdorf does not limit her statement to those measures -- she makes a leap with language that states Moore opposes any tax limits, period. During the campaign, Moore has publicly supported limiting the income-tax liability of working families, the elderly and others.

In the past, we’d have called the statement Barely True, but the Truth-O-Meter becomes a little easier to read today as the PolitiFact network has a new title for the old definition: Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/27/sheila-harsdorf/state-senator-sheila-harsdorf-says-recall-election/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Chip Rogers']","
Rogers gets it right on Georgia's eduction woes
","
Chip Rogers, one of the most powerful politicians in the Georgia Legislature, offered some ideas at a recent town hall meeting to improve education in the state.

Rogers suggested allowing students to take more online classes to improve learning, The Athens Banner-Herald reported. The Cherokee County Republican caught our attention with some specific claims about how Georgia’s students are doing.

""The state of Georgia is near the bottom among states for SAT scores and graduation rates,"" said Rogers, the state Senate’s majority leader.

Wow! Is it that bad here?

We searched for answers.

First, let’s look at SAT scores.

The College Board, which administers the SAT, warns people against using the exam to make competitive comparisons because the results do not account for factors such as demographics and other variables that can affect test scores. The warnings are usually ignored by curious reporters, some educators and, apparently, elected officials.

We looked at Georgia’s SAT mean scores in 2010, the most recent year available. The combined mean score in math, reading and writing was 1,453. The only states that ranked lower were South Carolina (1,447) and Maine (1,389). Students in Washington, D.C., also were below Georgia, with a mean score of 1,404. For the curious, Iowa students had the highest mean score of 1,798.

To be fair to Georgia students, a larger percentage of them are taking the SAT than their peers in most other states, which likely brought down the mean score. Only six states had more students who took the SAT.

So what about graduation rates?

PolitiFact Georgia tackled this topic in November when we checked then-Gov. Sonny Perdue’s claim that this state’s graduation rate topped 80 percent in 2010. We differed with Perdue on the claim, concluding he may have used flawed data. In April, for example, the U.S. Department of Education rebuked the state Department of Education and Clayton County, one of the state’s largest school districts, and determined the county's 2006-2007 dropout rate was undercounted.

An Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation discovered problems with graduation rate data for another large school district, the city of Atlanta. The newspaper found many students were marked as transfers even though there was no evidence they re-enrolled elsewhere, which may explain Atlanta’s rising graduation rates in recent years.

We ruled there is no clear way to know what the true graduation rate is in Georgia and rated Perdue’s claim as Half True.

Even with what may be flawed numbers, Georgia does not fare well nationally, according to data on the U.S. Department of Education’s website. A review of its most recent data (the 2007-08 school year) showed about 65 percent of students who were freshmen four years earlier graduated that year. Georgia ranked ahead of only Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Washington, D.C.

Rogers is correct to say Georgia SAT scores are ""near the bottom"" nationally. The graduation rates are trickier, but even with potentially flawed data, Georgia was ahead of just three states. We rate his claim as True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/27/chip-rogers/rogers-gets-it-right-georgias-eduction-woes/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Michele Bachmann']","
Did Tim Pawlenty say, ""The era of small government is over""?
","
What happened to Minnesota nice?

Michele Bachmann blasted her fellow Minnesotan Tim Pawlenty after he questioned her experience. The two are competing for the Republican nomination for president.

""These are serious times that require serious solutions -- not more of the same. Being right on the issues is critical -- it is what the American people demand. Executive experience is not an asset if it simply means bigger and more intrusive government,"" Bachmann said in a prepared statement on July 24, 2011.

""Governor Pawlenty said in 2006, 'The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive.' That's the same philosophy that, under President Obama, has brought us record deficits, massive unemployment and an unconstitutional health care plan.""

We wanted to see if Bachmann was correct about what Pawlenty said about small government, as it seems like a sentiment unlikely to be popular in a Republican primary. We contacted both campaigns for comment but didn't hear back from either one.

We were able to easily find the comment; it originated with an August 2006 report in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. (We found it in the Nexis newspaper database.) ""Pawlenty sees his role as reformer,"" says the headline. ""The GOP governor has targeted what he calls excessive corporate power. Critics call his election-year 'populism' cosmetic.""

The story says that starting in 2006, Pawlenty ""repeatedly made himself a nuisance to major industries that frequently back Republicans,"" particularly calling on Congress to put new regulations on prescription drug companies and auto makers. The story said he called for a two-year ban on advertising prescription drugs, urged regulators to speed the release of generic insulin products and proposed new regulations to support the use of ethanol. 

""Those kinds of proposals for government intervention in the free market on the surface might seem unusual coming from a conservative GOP politician. But they are illustrations of the way that Pawlenty, a fiscal and social conservative, also styles himself a kind of latter-day trust buster, a reformer who is unafraid to challenge big business and wield government power to correct imbalances in the marketplace,"" the story said. 

And here's the key section:

""The era of small government is over,"" Pawlenty said in an interview with the Star Tribune. ""I'm a market person, but there are certain circumstances where you've got to have government put up the guardrails or bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful ... Government has to be more proactive, more aggressive."" ...

Pawlenty insists his own populist streak is no election-year attempt to steer toward the middle. Peel back the conservative, he said, and you find the boy who grew up near South St. Paul's stockyards and learned what happened when power became too concentrated.

When companies gain too much power, he said, they can suppress wages. Drug companies can command high prices for brand-name products long after they could have gone generic. Oil companies can use their muscle to keep out renewable fuels. HMOs can shift costs from their members to the public at large.

While he may not fit the DFL [Democratic-Farm-Labor Party] definition of a populist, Pawlenty said, ""it's a matter of where you draw the line. ... I know that concentrated power unchecked leads to bad things,"" he said.

We're not sure what Pawlenty's own reaction to the story was, but his press secretary didn't like it. The next day, the Star Tribune ran a ""clarification,"" that said the story ""quoted Gov. Tim Pawlenty saying 'The era of small government is over,' a comment he made in reference to a point made in a 2004 column by New York Times columnist David Brooks. Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said Monday that Pawlenty's record shows he is not a supporter of 'big government' and that he was 'simply talking about the need for government to be more effective and active.'""

The Star Tribune story doesn't mention David Brooks, but we went searching for the relevant story, and it seems likely it was a story Brooks wrote for the New York Times Magazine that took the measure of the conservative movement in 2004, headlined ""How to re-invent the G.O.P.""

In the story, Brooks noted that historical forces like Islamic extremism and the end of socialism were changing the nature of conservatism, pushing it away from a minimalist vision for government. 

The new conservatism ""understands the paradox that if you don't have a positive vision of government, you won't be able to limit the growth of government. If you can't offer people a vision of what government should do, you won't be able to persuade them about the things it shouldn't do. If the Republican Party is going to evolve into a principled majority party, members of this group are going to have to build a governing philosophy based on this insight,"" Brooks wrote.

Brooks said George W. Bush typified this new approach. ""By the time he began his campaign for president in 1999, Bush understood that the simple government-is-the-problem philosophy of the older Republicans was obsolete. During that campaign, Bush criticized what he called the 'destructive mind-set: the idea that if government would only get out of our way, all our problems would be solved. An approach with no higher goal, no nobler purpose, than ""Leave us alone.''' Instead, Bush argued, 'government must be carefully limited but strong and active.'""

Pawlenty maintains that he was incorrectly quoted in the Star Tribune story. In May 2011, he went on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, and Limbaugh asked him if he had indeed said, ""The era of small government is over."" 

""The other side has pushed that falsely for a number of years,"" Pawleny said, according to the show's transcript. ""What happened is in the Minnesota Star Tribune -- not exactly a conservative publication -- I made reference to an article that David Brooks wrote which was entitled, 'The Era of Small Government is Over.' I didn't say those words myself; I was referencing his article. 

""The very next day, the Star Tribune, after a big battle, printed a clarification or a correction in their correction page,"" he continued. ""Of course, the main article was on page one and the correction was buried in some footnote in page three, but that incorrect quote has haunted me -- and I'm glad I had a chance in this big national forum on your great show to clarify, because if you go to the next day's newspaper you'll see the clarification in the Star Tribune.""

We should note that the headline of the Brooks' article we found was not ""The Era of Small Government is Over,"" but we won't quibble about that. Pawlenty could have seen the article or another one like it somewhere with a modified headline, and the phrase certainly captures the article's sentiment.

We also contacted the Star Tribune to see if it still stood by the story. The story's author, Patricia Lopez, is now the newspaper's political editor. Here's what she said: ""The governor was quoted correctly, which is why we printed only a clarification. He was quoting a David Brooks column, but as you can see, it was in support of other statements he made about the role of government. He never asked to have any other statement in the article corrected.""

But even if Pawlenty was quoting Brooks when he said the phrase ""the era of small government is over"" during the interview, he seemed to be doing so approvingly. The rest of the article portrays Pawlenty as someone who was willing to use government to intervene in the markets and gives examples to support that.

Here's a little more from the story.

""Oil companies have played a role in suppressing the development of alternative fuels,"" Pawlenty said, with heavy-handed contracts that prevent gasoline stations from providing pumps for renewable fuels such as ethanol. With the nation's economic security at stake, ""that is disproportionate power,"" he said. ""Government has to step in.""

Similarly, when he testified before Congress for reimportation of drugs from Canada, where prices are government-regulated, Pawlenty said he got a taste of the pharmaceutical industry's might. ""I've seen it firsthand,"" he said. ""They've got a power that would frighten most citizens.""

Pawlenty has changed positions on energy policy; he once supported a cap and trade system but no longer does. We looked for any recent statements he's made about reimporting drugs from Canada, but couldn't find any. 

We also asked two political watchers in Minnesota if the Star Tribune story was generally reflective of Pawlenty's political views in 2006. They said it was.

""In terms of his views on government, I think he can best be described as actively wanting to use the government to achieve certain ends, only with less taxes,"" said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University who studies Minnesota politics. Schultz said Pawlenty's rhetoric became more conservative starting around 2008, when his name was mentioned as a potential running mate for John McCain.

""In fairness, Pawlenty did restrain spending by the Democratic Legislature. But he was more moderate on several other issues than he now appears, and the (Star Tribune story) is an example of that,"" said Steve Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College.

So where does this leave us? Back in 2006, Pawlenty was portraying himself as a conservative who was willing to intervene in markets, and he said that government has to ""bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful."" It appears he's been backing off those positions in 2011, but that doesn't change what his views were years ago. If he was quoting David Brooks when he said ""the era of small government is over,"" he seemed to be doing so approvingly, though a spokesman said he did not mean to imply that he supported ""big government.""

Georgia Republican Tom Price says paying debtholders first will stave off default

While some predict dire consequences if the federal government doesn’t end its stalemate over the debt ceiling, U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., argues that the risk to the nation isn’t that great.

The nation won’t default on its debts, the Roswell Republican told Candy Crowley on CNN’s State of the Union on July 24, 2011 -- not even if Capitol Hill lawmakers fail to reach a deal to raise the limit before the Aug. 2 deadline.

The federal government still has plenty of money to pay bondholders, Price told Crowley.

""Well, the U.S. won't default, because default means that you don't pay your creditors,"" Price replied. ""And it takes about 10 percent of the money that's coming in right now...""

If that's right, we wondered, then why all the hand-wringing?

First, some background. President Barack Obama and Congress have been engaged for months in intense negotiations discussions about raising the debt ceiling, which is the legal limit on how much money the government may borrow.

After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts to buy time for further negotiations. Officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. The negotiators have so far failed to come to agreement, with each party offering its own plan to end the crisis.

If the debt ceiling isn't raised by Aug. 2, the nation won’t have the money to cover all of its debts, the Obama administration has warned. But Price argues that a failure to pay the government’s bills does not in itself mean the government is in default.

What really matters, he argues, is that the U.S. pays the interest it owes on bonds. (There’s some disagreement about whether the government can prioritize its payments, but many experts think that if push came to shove, the U.S. government could choose which of its bills to pay first.)

And the nation has more than enough money -- even without a debt limit increase -- to pay this portion of its debt, Price says.

We’ve heard this argument before. U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota, a leading Republican presidential contender, said during a July 13, 2011 press conference that ""it is simply not true"" that ""if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, that somehow the United States will go into default, and we will lose the full faith and credit of the United States.""

Price appears to be correct that cash inflows could cover bondholder obligations, at least for a while. The Bipartisan Policy Center -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a board that includes former politicians from both parties -- conducted an analysis of what the government's fiscal situation would be if a deal on the debt ceiling is not reached.

When the center analyzed the government's inflows and outflows for the rest of August 2011, it found $172.4 billion in cash coming in, to offset required payments of $306.7 billion. That works out to a deficit of $134.3 billion.

With that amount of income to work with, the government -- if it could prioritize payments -- could pay the monthly costs of Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Pentagon vendors ($31.7 billion), interest on the debt ($29 billion) and unemployment benefits ($12.8 billion). Those categories total $172.7 billion.

But doing so would mean delaying other payments -- for instance, Pell grants and other educational programs ($20.2 billion), salaries and benefits for federal employees ($14.2 billion), welfare and food programs ($9.3 billion), health and human services grants ($8.1 billion), housing assistance ($6.7 billion) and many other programs, including military active duty pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs program ($2.9 billion), Department of Justice funding that includes the FBI and federal courts ($1.4 billion) and IRS refunds ($3.9 billion).

The assumption by Price and Bachmann is that the financial markets would be satisfied as long as the interest on bonds was paid, even if doing so meant delaying payments to any number of other creditors to the federal government, from Social Security beneficiaries to federal workers to Pentagon contractors.

However, as we noted in a previous article, independent experts don’t agree with his definition of ""default,"" and they’re skeptical that investors or ratings agencies will just ignore a federal decision to pay certain creditors and not others and that U.S. creditworthiness would remain as sterling as it was before.

Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, said that ""if the federal government delays payment to anyone, then certainly in a common-sense sense, the government has defaulted on its obligations.""

Neil H. Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in economics, agreed.
   
""If the government fails to pay any obligation on schedule, that is a default in both the common-sense meaning and in the legal sense,"" Buchanan said. ""The person to whom money is owed has not been repaid. That's a default.""
   
The same experts were also skeptical that simply paying bondholders would convince investors and ratings agencies to overlook late payments or non-payments to other federal creditors.

""I believe that the financial markets would not be copacetic"" if bondholders were repaid but other creditors weren’t, White said. ""They would realize that the government was stiffing one set of claimants who are creditors, and the markets would worry that they might be next.""

Buchanan of GWU agreed with White’s point and added another.
   
""Foreign holders of (Treasury notes) will understand that it is politically untenable to pay foreigners but not Americans,"" he said. ""Can you imagine the firestorm if Americans were told that we cannot afford to pay Social Security recipients, because we have to pay foreign banks and governments first? The argument that we must do so to protect our credit rating will sound an awful lot like ‘too big to fail’ -- the same argument that said that banks in 2008-09 had to be bailed out, while homeowners and unemployed workers were thrown to the wolves. No matter how strong the argument that doing so is necessary to protect our credit rating, the bottom line is that the government would be favoring foreigners over Americans. Any foreign investor would know that this is not politically sustainable. They would have every reason to dump our bonds, or at least to require much higher rates of return.""

In a June 3, 2011, report, the Congressional Research Service -- a nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- agreed with many of these points.

""The full faith and credit of the U.S. government would be threatened,"" the CRS wrote. ""Domestic money markets, in which government securities play a major role, could be affected substantially. ... If the government fails to make timely payments to individuals, service providers, and other organizations, these persons and entities would … be affected. Even if the government continued paying interest, it is not clear whether creditors would retain or lose faith in the government’s willingness to pay its obligations. If creditors lost this confidence, the federal government’s interest costs would likely increase substantially and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets.""

And on July 13 and 14, two major ratings agencies -- Moody’s and Standard & Poors -- publicly announced that they were watching carefully. The agencies said they were reassessing whether U.S. Treasury Bonds merited the top credit rating. These ratings, issued by agencies that are independent of the government, provide guidance to investors about how secure bond investments are. 
""It is very difficult to make lots of individual decisions about whom to pay,"" said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. ""I think (Price's) statement is false in the sense of implying it is not a significant problem,"" though he added that the Obama administration ""is also creating a false sense of disaster when it implies that everything will stop on Aug 2. Financial markets are still having trouble believing that America has sunk to such a point of government dysfunction, and there is yet to be much of a reaction. Thus, the effects are likely to build more gradually.""

So where does this leave us? We’ll concede that we’re in relatively uncharted territory. However, independent experts suggest that simply paying debt holders while letting other federal creditors go unpaid won’t keep the U.S. from ""default"" -- either the technical or the common-sense variety. In addition, both academic experts and the Congressional Research Service agree that only paying debt holders won’t be enough to keep U.S. creditworthiness unblemished. Price downplays the real risks of default and creditworthiness in a prioritization strategy that pays debt holders at the expense of other federal credit holders. So we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jul/26/tom-price/georgia-republican-tom-price-says-paying-debtholde/

Cliff Stearns, in pushing for research funding, says military men twice as likely to get prostate cancer
","
War, needless to say, is fraught with danger — bullets flying, bombs exploding. But one Florida congressman recently targeted a silent killer that attacks soldiers from within.

Rep. Cliff Stearns recently sought — and received — House approval to shift $16 million in Pentagon funding to beef up research for prostate cancer for military members.

The Ocala Republican pointed out in a press release that prostate cancer was the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among American men.

No argument there. After all, according to the American Cancer Society, only skin cancer is more common than prostate cancer among American men. And only lung cancer kills more of those sufferers.

What caught our attention, though, was Stearns’ follow-up assertion: ""In addition,"" he said, ""active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts.""

Twice as likely? Really?

We asked Stearns’ office about the congressman’s sources, and spokesman Paul Flusche provided a trio of publications.

One looked at how Agent Orange might have caused a spike in prostate cancer rates among Vietnam War vets. Another focused on prostate cancer rates strictly among Air Force personnel.

The third, which Flusche labeled as the ""most important"" in supporting Stearns’ claim, was conducted by a team of scientists who compared the rates at which a variety of cancers, including prostate cancer, strike soldiers relative to civilians.

That study, conducted by the U.S. Military Cancer Institute, or USMCI, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, was led by Dr. Kangmin Zhu.

Zhu’s team actually reviewed six types of cancer — breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, testicular and cervical — for soldiers ages 20 to 59. The data they studied covered from 1990 to 2004. For prostate cancer, the study population included 910 soldiers and 42,751 civilians.

In some instances, such as with testicular cancer, there were no differences in the rate of occurrence between the military and civilian populations, the report said.

But Zhu and his colleagues, based on their analysis of the numbers, concluded: ""Prostate cancer rates in the military were twice those in the general population.""

So Stearns is citing a verifiable statistic contained in a reputable story.

The natural question, of course, is why would military members be more prone to prostate cancer?

The Zhu study could only speculate.

For instance, researchers found discrepancies between military and civilian healthcare providers in how cancer incidents are reported, which could explain at least part of the difference.

Zhu also hypothesized that better and more frequent health screening for soldiers might explain why prostate cancer is more prevalent among U.S. troops. Exposure to depleted uranium also might account for the results.

But Zhu ultimately said that he could not determine a reason and suggested further study.

We ran the findings by Dr. Jonathan Simons, president and CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, a Santa Monica, Calif.-based philanthropic organization that has raised roughly $450 million and helped fund 1,500 researchers at 200 institutions in 12 countries. (The foundation was not connected to Zhu’s work.)

Simons observed that Zhu’s mission was not to find why military members seemed more likely to get prostate cancer, but to simply crunch the numbers.

In that context, Simons said Stearns was ""absolutely correct"" and justified in stating that military personnel were twice as likely as civilian men to contract prostate cancer.

For one thing, Simons noted, ""This is not the junior varsity that did the work. These are really top people.""

Still, Simons cautioned that the potential for drawing a ""false correlation"" existed -- namely that military members are more likely to get prostate cancer than non-military members.

If military service meant a greater risk of developing cancer, then one would expect soldiers to exhibit higher rates of the disease across the board, Simons said. That was not the case here.

Yet he reiterated that much more research into prostate cancer occurrences among soldiers was necessary to determine whether the findings were a ""fluke"" or if there was a definite connection — and if so, what might cause it. And that, Simons observed, was Stearns’ goal in pushing for more funding.

""I actually compliment Representative Stearns for elevating it,"" Simons said. ""Congressman Stearns did a really important bit of public health policy here.""

Back to Stearns’ comment. In pushing for $16 million in Pentagon funding to beef up research for prostate cancer for military members, he said that ""active duty males in the military are twice as likely to develop prostate cancer than their civilian counterparts."" Stearns is correct that research shows that military members are diagnosed with prostate cancer at twice the rate as non-military members.

However, that same research doesn’t conclude that military members are twice as likely to ""develop"" prostate cancer as Stearns said. The study hypothesizes that one reason for the different diagnosis rate may be because military members are subject to more frequent health screenings. Getting to the bottom of the discrepancy is actually why Stearns requested the money. That’s a needed clarification when considering Stearns’ comment. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/26/cliff-stearns/cliff-stearns-pushing-research-funding-says-milita/

Bipartisan support for ""cut, cap and balance"", John Boehner says
","
During back-to-back primetime addresses on July 25, 2011, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner each made his case on how to proceed on raising the debt ceiling. Each tried to portray himself as the voice of reason in the debate.

Boehner, who leads the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, said that he was only trying to carry out the will of the people.

""What we told the president in January was this: The American people will not accept an increase in the debt limit without significant spending cuts and reforms,"" Boehner said. ""And over the last six months, we’ve done our best to convince the president to partner with us to do something dramatic to change the fiscal trajectory of our country ... something that will boost confidence in our economy, renew a measure of faith in our government, and help small businesses get back on track.

""Last week, the House passed such a plan, and with bipartisan support. It’s called the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' Act. It cuts and caps government spending and paves the way for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which we believe is the best way to stop Washington from spending money it doesn’t have. Before we even passed the bill in the House, the president said he would veto it.""

Boehner's description of ""Cut, Cap and Balance"" passing with ""bipartisan support"" got the attention of a lot of our readers, who tweeted and e-mailed us to urge us to fact-check the statement.

Reader reaction was enhanced by an interview a few hours earlier between Sen. Mike Lee, a tea party supporter and Republican from Utah, and Chris Matthews of MSNBC. When Lee said the bill passed the House in bipartisan fashion, Mathhews forcefully objected.

Here's the slightly edited transcript. (Watch the exchange online.)

Matthews: ""What's this bipartisan thing you're talking about? I didn't see that there. It was overwhelmingly a party-line vote.""

Lee: ""Overwhelmingly, but we had five Democrats who voted with us.""

Matthews: ""It was a party-line vote. Let's call it what it is. It was a party-line vote, sir. Let's not start with nonsense here. It was a party-line vote in the House. Fair enough. Your party controls the House. You passed it. It wasn't a bipartisan vote.""

Lee: ""We have five Democratic votes. Last time I checked, when you have Democrats voting with Republicans, that's bipartisan.""

Matthews: ""You're talking to the American people on my show, and are trying to tell me this horse and rabbit stew of 234, five of whom are Democrats, is a bipartisan vote? Anybody watching now knows that's malarkey.""

Lee: ""Well, look, we can argue about the meaning of bipartisan...""

Matthews: ""I'm not arguing -- just speak English here. Do you believe it was a bipartisan vote in the House? ...""

Lee: ""Chris, what I said was, it had bipartisan support. It had the support of five Democrats. We can argue about the significance of that. But my point is, this is the only piece of legislation anyone has proposed that's made it anywhere in Congress to raise the debt limit. What I'm saying is, we are trying to do this. We cannot be accused, we as Republicans, of simply wanting for the debt limit deadline to arrive without us raising the debt limit.""

So was the vote in the House ""bipartisan""? Let's take a closer look at the vote.

The measure passed 234 to 190, largely along party lines, with Republicans in support and Democrats opposed. But five Democrats sided with Republicans to back the bill, and nine Republicans joined the Democrats in opposition to the bill.

We should note that two prominent Republicans running for president -- Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, -- opposed ""cut, cap and balance"" because they said it didn't go far enough.

What Boehner said was nothing new. Members of both parties have been using the ""bipartisan"" line about bills with minimal cross-party support for years.

Consider this 2003 account in National Journal, in which a Republican lobbyist bemoaned the possibility that Rep. Ralph Hall -- a very conservative Texas Democrat -- could lose his seat due to redistricting. The lobbyist noted that Hall's willingness to co-sponsor Republican bills, often as the only Democrat to do so, provided lawmakers and lobbyists ""with an elusive and highly useful talking point: that their bill is ""bipartisan.'"" The GOP lobbyist told the magazine that ""labeling something 'bipartisan' absolutely helps, no matter who the Democrat is."" (Hall survived redistricting, became a Republican and remains in Congress.)

Democrats have used exactly the same trick. Back in 2009, Obama said that a Senate committee had approved an early version of health care reform with ""both Democratic and Republican support."" Because the measure got one Republican vote out of 23 on the committee, we rated that Barely True.

When we contacted longtime observers of Congress, they agreed that there's a venerable tradition of attaching the ""bipartisan"" badge to legislation with only the thinnest support from the opposite party.

""To paraphrase Bill Clinton, it all depends on the meaning of 'bipartisan,'"" said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""My definition would be healthy numbers, not necessarily majorities, and not necessarily equally drawn, from both parties. To call 'bipartisan' a measure that gets five Democrats -- less than 3 percent of the party in the House -- is a huge stretch, though part of a longstanding tradition.""

U.S. Senate historian Donald Ritchie said the contemporary usage of the term ""bipartisan"" reflects long-term transformations in the two parties.

""Back in the 1970s, both parties had liberal and conservative wings,"" he said. ""There were as many Eisenhower Republicans as there were Goldwater Republicans. The Democrats had a small but powerful conservative wing, consisting of Southern Democrats who chaired the major committees. No one expected either caucus to vote together. Instead the conservatives in both parties voted together against the moderates and liberals in both parties, so almost all votes were bipartisan, usually with substantial numbers in both camps.""

This began to change in the 1980s, Ritchie said, with Republicans replacing Democrats in the southern states and Democrats replacing moderate Republicans in northern states. Today, he said, ""party-line votes have become common rather than exceptional. As a result, whenever one or more members cross the line either way, it gets called ""bipartisan.'""

So where does this leave us? Boehner was technically correct that some Democrats voted for the ""Cut, Cap and Balance"" bill, and, following longstanding Congressional tradition, that enabled him to dub the bill ""bipartisan."" But in speaking to a wider audience -- a national television address -- we think many viewers would be led to believe that the bill in fact had a significant degree of Democratic support, when in fact it did not. This strikes us as just as misleading as Obama's earlier claim about the health care vote in committee. So we're giving it the same rating: Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/26/john-boehner/bipartisan-support-cut-cap-and-balance-john-boehne/

Obama says Reagan raised debt ceiling 18 times; George W. Bush seven times
","
In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama made his pitch for a ""balanced"" approach to reducing the deficit -- one that includes spending cuts as well as revenue increases from tax increases for wealthier Americans.

With the debt ceiling issue caught in a political deadlock over how to reduce the deficit, Obama noted that raising the debt ceiling has been a relatively routine exercise for decades.

""Understand –- raising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money,"" Obama said. ""It simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up. In the past, raising the debt ceiling was routine.  Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed it. President Reagan did it 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times. And we have to do it by next Tuesday, August 2nd, or else we won’t be able to pay all of our bills.""

Our colleagues at PolitiFact New Jersey last week looked at a similar claim, that every president has raised the debt ceiling. They found that was Mostly True. Only President Harry S. Truman did not.

Here, we are looking at Obama's claim that, ""President Reagan did it 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times.""

We'll go straight to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which keeps tabs on when the debt ceiling has been raised.

Among its historical tables is one labeled ""Statutory Limits on Federal debt 1940 - Current"" (Table 7.3) The table lists 106 increases to the federal debt limit since 1940.

More specifically, it lists 18 increases to the debt ceiling between February 1981 and September 1987. In other words, there were 18 under President Ronald Reagan, as Obama said. And there were seven increases between January 2001 and January 2009 -- during George W. Bush's presidency. We should also note that it has been raised three times already under President Obama, on Feb. 17, 2009, Dec. 28, 2009 and Feb. 12, 2010.

We would be remiss if we failed to note that Obama opposed one of those increases to the debt ceiling under George W. Bush and criticized Bush for a lack of leadership.

""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills,"" Obama said before a March 16, 2006, vote on raising the debt limit. The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed.

In an April 15, 2011, interview, Obama said he regrets his position in 2006.

""I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president,"" Obama said. ""When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit -- for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it.""

We rated that position a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter.

Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support.

Nonetheless, Obama is correct that raising the debt ceiling has been an issue repeatedly tackled by Republicans and Democrats alike. President Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times and George W. Bush did it seven times. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2011/jul/26/barack-obama/obama-says-reagan-raised-debt-ceiling-18-times-geo/
"['Income', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Jessica King']","
In Wisconsin Senate recall race, Democrat Jessica King says GOP Sen. Randy Hopper 'didn’t pay taxes'
","
In one of the recall elections that could determine whether Democrats take control of the Wisconsin Senate, the two candidates have accused each of other personally enriching themselves while other taxpayers pay more.

State Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, contends in a TV ad that Democratic challenger Jessica King voted herself a 63 percent pay raise when she served on the Oshkosh Common Council. King voted against the raise, and the percentage was wrong to boot. We rated Hopper’s statement Pants on Fire.

King, with a TV ad released July 12, 2011, claims middle-class folks pay their taxes but Hopper didn’t.

The ad begins with what the King campaign identifies as a soldier, a nurse and a teacher. They say ""politicians like Randy Hopper have been fighting for wealthy people like himself, raising middle-class taxes to give tax breaks to big corporations, but then not paying taxes. Randy Hopper, we work hard, we pay our taxes; we can’t say the same about you.""

As the accusation is made, the words ""Senator Hopper didn’t pay taxes"" appear on the screen above a footnote citing a Fond du Lac Reporter newspaper article.

(The headline in the newspaper was ""Hopper fends off tax questions."")

The ad not only accuses Hopper of not paying taxes, while average citizens did, but suggests he did something improper or took advantage of the system.

Let’s see what the record shows.

When we asked King campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris for evidence to back up the ad, she provided the October 2008 newspaper article cited in the ad.

The article ran less than two weeks before Hopper defeated King, by a recount-confirmed 163 votes, to win what was then an open Senate seat in the Fox Valley area of east-central Wisconsin. Their rematch on Aug. 9, 2011, is one of nine recall elections that could determine whether Democrats take control of the Senate from Republicans, who now hold a five-seat advantage.

According the 2008 article, the liberal One Wisconsin Now group obtained state Department of Revenue income tax data for Hopper and his five businesses. Since an open records request could take a week or more, and the elections are upon us, we asked One Wisconsin Now for the data they received, which was contained in a letter from the revenue department.

The letter says that from 1998 through 2007, Hopper’s five businesses had no state income tax liability; and that from 1997 through 2007, Hopper personally had a liability in just one year, 2006, of $22,752.

(Since then, One Wisconsin Now requested more recent state income tax data for Hopper and received a Department of Revenue letter saying Hopper had no tax liability in 2008 and 2010, and a tax liability of $27,995 in 2009. But those tax years are not part of our evaluation for this article.)

Hopper, who didn’t dispute the facts in the 2008 newspaper article, was quoted as saying that in the years when he had no income tax obligation, it was because of business debt and reinvesting in some of the businesses. He also said two of the businesses run by his wife had no revenue.

Hopper also said in the article he incurred the one personal income tax obligation, and paid it, because of capital gains he earned from selling one of his radio stations.

It’s not unprecedented for a state lawmaker to pay no state income taxes. The same holds for other members of the public, based on what the tax laws are and allow, particularly for business owners.

In September 2008, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found that six lawmakers -- four Republicans and two Democrats -- were among a number of state officials who didn’t have a state income tax liability in either 2006 or 2007; one of the lawmakers, state Rep. Mary Williams, R-Medford, hadn’t had a state tax bill since before 2000. Tax experts interviewed for the article said those public officials were treated the same as everyone else, noting that most small-business owners show their business earnings or losses on their individual income tax returns.

We also contacted Hopper’s campaign spokesman, Sean Stephenson, to see if Hopper had any additional response about his taxes.

Stephenson said Hopper’s radio stations paid nearly $1 million in workers’ compensation, Social Security, property and other taxes -- but not state income taxes -- from 1998 through 2010.

He also pointed out that Hopper’s name does not appear on the state’s list of delinquent taxpayers. (We checked, and his businesses aren’t on the list, either.)

Stephenson didn’t provide any official documents to back up his claims about taxes Hopper and his business paid. But since King made the allegation that Hopper didn’t pay taxes, the burden is on her to prove it.

So, let’s review the case she made.

King claims broadly in a TV ad that Hopper, unlike typical taxpayers, ""didn’t pay taxes."" The records indicate that over a decade, Hopper’s businesses had no state income tax liability and he owed taxes personally in only one year. But the claim leaves an impression, without providing any evidence, that Hopper did something improper in order not to have a state income tax liability in most of the years in question. After all, this is the language included in the ad: ""We work hard, we pay our taxes; we can’t say the same about you."" Moreover, there is no indication that Hopper did not pay the one state income tax liability he did have.

"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'Sam Olens']","
Olens accuses Mexico of having harsher immigration laws than Georgia
","
After the Mexican government spoke out against Georgia’s tough new immigration law, state Attorney General Sam Olens accused it of hypocrisy.

Mexico joined with Guatemala and other Latin American countries to argue in federal court that Georgia’s law interferes with international relations. What’s worse, they said, it puts their citizens at risk of harassment by U.S. law enforcement.

Not so fast, Olens said in a radio story aired June 28.  Mexico has little right to complain in light of its own immigration laws.

""If you're from Guatemala and you are found illegally in Mexico, you are automatically jailed,"" Olens told AM 750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB. ""But here we have both Guatemala and Mexico complaining that we have laws to discourage illegal immigrants in our country.""

Illegal Guatemalans are ""automatically jailed"" if they’re discovered in Mexico? Sounds harsh for a nation that’s complaining about Georgia’s law. We decided to check this out.

Georgia’s House Bill 87 aims to crack down on illegal immigration in this state.

One of its more controversial provisions would give police the authority to investigate the immigration status of people who they believe have committed crimes and who cannot produce identification. Another would punish people who, while committing another offense, knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants or encourage them to come here.

Last month, a U.S. district judge temporarily stopped these provisions from going into effect.

We contacted Olens spokeswoman Lauren Kane, who said that Olens’ claim was incorrect and he will not repeat it in the future. She said in an email that he was unaware Mexico had changed its immigration law a few years ago.

Then, violating Mexico immigration law was a criminal offense. Now it isn’t.  

Mexico has tried to improve conditions for migrants, although human rights advocates say these efforts aren’t enough. In 2008, reforms decriminalized immigration violations, said Andrew Selee, who directs the Mexico Institute, a research and policy center at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C.

Merely being present in Mexico without papers is a civil violation, not a criminal one, experts told us.

Violators are not arrested or put in jail, which is designated for criminals or those suspected of crimes. They are sent to detention facilities and undergo a separate administrative process.

Illegal migrants may, if they choose, be deported within 48 hours and avoid a criminal record. If they contest their deportation, their stay in detention is much longer.

Legislation signed in May by Mexican President Felipe Calderon aims to improve conditions further, said Amnesty International researcher Rupert Knox, who is an expert on Mexico.  

The new legislation reaffirms that people who cross the border into Mexico without papers are guilty of a civil offense, not a criminal one, according to Knox and news reports. It emphasizes they have a right to health care and education.

It also draws tighter restrictions on who can detain illegal migrants. Before the May legislation, Mexican police could detain an illegal migrant and hand him over to national immigration authorities for deportation. Now, only those detected by national immigration authorities can be sent for deportation.

Mexican police are not allowed to stop people on the suspicion that they are in the country illegally, Knox said.

In sum, Guatemalans found illegally in Mexico are not ""automatically jailed,"" as Olens said.

Since immigration violations are not criminal offenses, irregular migrants who are discovered are sent to a noncriminal detention facility, not jail. Their cases are not handled by the criminal courts, but by a separate administrative system.

Also, if a Mexican police officer detects an illegal migrant, he cannot detain him for deportation. Only immigration authorities can do that.

As Olens’ spokeswoman acknowledged, he’s wrong.

Sen. Shirley Turner claims unemployment in Trenton is double the rest of the state, leading to a rise in crime
","
When the unemployment rate goes up, crime will follow.

That’s what Sen. Shirley Turner (D-Mercer) has said is happening in Trenton, where municipal officials are preparing to lay off about 110 patrol officers and demote more than half of its police supervisors.

The senator made that argument during a July 12 debate on the Senate floor about overriding a veto from Gov. Chris Christie and restoring $50 million in municipal public safety aid. That measure ultimately failed in a 24-13 vote.

""You cannot do anything else if you don’t feel safe. And we know that in our urban areas today, particularly right here in the city of Trenton, which is not unlike most cities in the state, we have experienced an exceedingly high unemployment, twice as much as what we see in every other area of the state, and we all know that when you have high unemployment, crime follows,"" Turner told her colleagues.

Turner continued, ""We have seen an increase in crime -- gang activity, child abuse, spousal abuse, gun violence. All of this goes hand-in-hand with a very deep recession.""

PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check three points in Turner’s statement: is Trenton’s unemployment rate double every other part of the state; has crime in the capitol city increased; and does higher unemployment lead to more crime?

We found that Turner was right about the increase in crime, but she overstated Trenton’s unemployment rate and research shows unemployment has a mixed impact on crime. Even the city’s police director said unemployment is not the sole reason for criminal activity.

First, let’s talk about the city’s unemployment rate.

In May, Trenton had an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent, which was slightly below the city’s 2010 average unemployment rate of 12.8 percent, according to data from the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development and available at the time of Turner’s statement.

Compared to 97 other municipalities with populations of at least 25,000, Trenton’s unemployment rate was below that of 14 towns and higher than the rates in 83 towns.

But Trenton’s rate was roughly double or more than double the rates in only 13 of those municipalities, not ""every other area of the state,"" as Turner had said. Those 13 municipalities had unemployment rates of 6.7 percent or less.

Turner acknowledged the mistake in a phone interview. ""I shouldn’t have said ‘every other,’"" she said.

Now, let’s turn to the city’s crime statistics.

Based on data provided by Acting Police Director Joseph Juniak, crime in Trenton increased slightly in the first six months of this year, compared with the first six months of 2010.

The ""crime index"" -- which includes seven major types of offenses -- went up by 63 offenses, or nearly 4 percent, for the first half of 2011. Given the number of guns involved in 2011 incidents and the number of guns recovered this year, violent crime with weapons could rise even further this year, according to Juniak.

So, Turner was wrong about how Trenton’s unemployment rate compares with the rest of New Jersey, but she was right about increasing crime in the city.

But does higher unemployment lead to more crime?

PolitiFact New Jersey looked at four studies and reached out to various experts. We discovered a similar conclusion each time: unemployment rates affect property crime, such as burglaries and motor vehicle thefts, but they have a smaller impact or no effect at all on violent crime, such as murders and robberies.

Looking at data from all 50 states between 1971 and 1997, a study published in 2001 estimated that a drop of 1 percentage point in the unemployment rate results in a decline in the property crime rate of between 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent, but only a half percent decline in the violent crime rate. That study was done by a professor of public policy in California and an economics professor in Austria.

Using data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C. from 1978 to 2004, another study published in November 2010 determined that a 1 percentage point increase in a state unemployment rate translates into 3,762 additional property crimes per year. However, violent crime does not respond to changes in state unemployment, according to that study.

Naci Moran, an economics professor at Louisiana State University and one of the authors of that study, told us in an email that a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate increases property crime by slightly more than 2 percent. But the impact of unemployment on violent crime is weaker, Moran wrote.

""The upshot is that the claim made by that senator is supported by scientific research and that unemployment has an impact on crime,"" Moran wrote.

Jay Hamilton, chair of the Economics Department at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, added in an email: ""If there is a general consensus it would probably be that when we find a relationship between the two it is weaker than most people would suspect.""

Back to Turner’s statement:

During a debate on the Senate floor, Turner said the unemployment rate in Trenton is ""twice as much as what we see in every other area of the state."" Due to the high unemployment, there’s been an increase in crime in the capitol city, she said.

Recent crime statistics back up the senator’s claim about increased crime, but on the other two points, Turner’s statement is flawed. The city’s unemployment rate is not as high as she claimed. Also, studies have shown that unemployment can affect property crime, but it has a reduced impact on violent crime.

We rate her statement Barely True.

Trump misses mark on claim that Wisconsin Republicans refuse to investigate 2020 election
","President Joe Biden won Wisconsin nearly eight months ago, but the 2020 election in the state -- or at least the questioning of it -- seems to be never ending.  Shortly after Biden won the state by more than 20,000 votes, thanks largely to Dane and Milwaukee counties, which both had large numbers of absentee ballots, President Donald Trump’ campaign pursued a recount in those two counties. But that effort only shifted the margin by 87 votes toward Biden.  Additionally seven lawsuits challenging aspects of the election have all failed, including at the conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court and no evidence of widespread fraud has surfaced.   Trump, of course, continues to claim he won the state. On the eve of the state GOP convention, Trump lashed out against three Republican state lawmakers -- Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, state Sen. Chris Kapenga and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu -- alleging that the trio was ""are working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin."" The June 25, 2021 statement from Trump’s Save America PAC went on to say: ""They are actively trying to prevent a Forensic Audit of the election results, especially those which took place in Milwaukee, one of the most corrupt election locales in the country. Don’t fall for their lies! These REPUBLICAN ‘leaders’ need to step up and support the people who elected them by providing them a full forensic investigation.""  So is Trump right? Are Vos, Kapenga and LeMahieu trying to prevent further audits and examinations, and to ""cover up election corruption""?  In a word: No. Quite the opposite, actually. Republicans have called for several investigations into election results. Despite the failed recount, the many lawsuits, agreement that the Wisconsin election was free and fair and no evidence of enough fraud to overturn the result, Republicans are -- contrary to Trump’s claim -- continuing to investigate. Vos, of Rochester, hired retired police officers to look into aspects of the election, according to a May 26, 2021 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article.  As a part of the effort, Vos said the former officers will review all tips received about election fraud and look into the credible ones, and will be paid with taxpayer funds. The team will also spend time looking into claims of double voting, as well as review how some clerks, following State Election Commission guidance, filled out some missing elements of absentee ballot applications.  Also underway is an audit of the election by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau, which began in February, according to a Feb. 11, 2021 report from the Journal Sentinel.  Requested by Republican lawmakers, the audit will look at issues that have faced scrutiny from courts and election observers, such as how the state maintains its voter rolls and when it allows voters to get absentee ballots without showing an ID.  Meanwhile, in June, a group of Republican lawmakers, including state Rep. Janel Brandtjen of Menomonee Falls, head of the Assembly’s elections committee, visited Arizona to tour the coliseum where a months-long review of Maricopa County’s ballots is underway by order of Republicans in the Arizona Senate, according to a June 18, 2021 Journal Sentinel article. 
  The Republican leaders targeted by Trump have dismissed the former president’s claim as ""misinformed,"" according to a June 26, 2021 Journal Sentinel report.  ""When I saw the president’s statement, it surprised me because many on the left have been going after us harder than I have ever seen, because in Wisconsin, we have hired investigators, we have passed legislation and we are doing a forensic audit already,"" Vos said. ""So I think this is one of those cases where the president was just misinformed by his staff or he didn’t see the media reports."" At the convention, Vos also announced that former conservative Supreme Court Justice Mike Gableman would oversee the former officers during their investigation. Gabelman will be paid at taxpayer expense.  But what of Trump’s assertion that Wisconsin legislators are refusing a ""forensic"" audit?  Communications staff for Trump did not respond to a request for more information on what he meant by a forensic audit, but a June 1, 2021  report by AZ Central said such an audit is one that investigates to find instances of fraud. That is, findings from the investigation can then be used as evidence in court later on.  It wouldn’t be off base to think the GOP-backed effort in Wisconsin -- involving retired police officers and a former Supreme Court justice -- would take such an approach. That said, the investigation method here may look different from what is happening as a part of Arizona’s ""forensic"" audit, where ballots and machines are being looked at.  Trump claimed that Wisconsin Republican leaders ""are working hard to cover up election corruption in Wisconsin."" That’s wrong. If anything, Republican leaders have taken great criticism for the continued efforts to dig into the results of an election that has already seen a recount and numerous legal challenges. Republicans have gone so far as to say they will use taxpayer money to pay a former state Supreme Court justice to oversee an effort led by retired police officers, also to be paid by taxpayers. Critics may say that effort is a ridiculous exercise. But our focus here is on Trump, and his claim Republican leaders have failed him and are doing nothing to examine the election results. That’s plainly ridiculous. Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2021/jul/05/donald-trump/trump-misses-mark-claim-wisconsin-republicans-refu/
"['Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Illinois', 'Lori Lightfoot']","
No, Cook County criminal courts haven’t been ‘shut down’ for 15 months
","Under pressure to address Chicago’s ongoing surge in gun violence, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the county’s criminal court system is failing to do its part holding dangerous offenders accountable. ""I’m calling upon our county partners, and particularly those in the criminal courts: Open up the courts,"" Lightfoot said at a June 28 news conference following a particularly bloody weekend in which more than 70 were shot, at least six fatally. ""People need their day in court. Justice delayed is justice denied and you’re hurting not only those who are charged but also those in the community."" ""Our criminal courts have been shut down for 15 months,"" Lightfoot continued, echoing similar claims she has made about the Cook County Circuit Court in recent months while defending the city’s efforts to combat the wave of murders and shootings. Lightfoot’s claim that the courts are somehow responsible for the uptick in crime has been a frequent talking point. In April she said the county had gone 13 months without criminal trials, and again in June she said the courts had been ""relatively inactive and closed for criminal trials since March 2020."" Big city crime waves have been in the national spotlight since the pandemic began, and a group of aldermen convened a special council meeting Friday to address the Lightfoot administration’s response ahead of the July Fourth weekend. City officials contend the increase in violence is slowing, pointing out how the number of murders and shootings declined this June from the same month last year. However, Chicago has seen slightly more murders this year than it had by this time in 2020, which was one of the city’s most violent since the mid-1990s. Shootings are also up from last year, according to Chicago Police Department data, and have risen nearly 60% compared with 2019. Last year, Cook County did suspend jury trials amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to what Lightfoot claimed, however, the county’s criminal courts have continued their other operations over the past 15 months, and even jury trials started up again this March. We contacted Lightfoot’s office asking for evidence to back up her claim, but did not receive a response. When the pandemic hit, Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans responded by temporarily suspending all but the most urgent cases. By July, the courts had begun to resume many of their other operations — such as plea hearings, sentencings and bench trials — largely via videoconference. Both criminal and civil jury trials remained paused, however, thanks to an Illinois Supreme Court decision suspending the state’s speedy trial law, which the court recently announced will be reinstated Oct. 1, 2021. Postponing all jury trials and scaling back other operations in response to the pandemic has led to a massive backlog of felony cases in Cook County, according to an Injustice Watch investigation, leaving hundreds of people in jail for more than a year. Lightfoot didn’t claim the courts were backlogged, however. She claimed they were shut down. On March 22, 2021, Evans allowed potential jurors to once again file into the Leighton Criminal Courthouse in Chicago after the year-long hiatus. So even if Lightfoot had contended — as she has in the past — that Cook County is not conducting criminal trials, she would be wrong. Although plans are still in the works to ramp up the reopening of criminal in-person proceedings, it’s clear they have resumed. There have been 27 criminal jury trials since March 22, according to Evans’ office. What’s more, jury trials make up a small fraction of a court’s work. A recent study by the National Center for State Courts found 92% of the felony cases it reviewed were resolved through guilty pleas or dismissals. In Cook County, only 10% of all cases that did go to trial in 2019 went to a jury rather than a bench trial, according to an April press release from Evans. ""While in-person proceedings have been limited, the courts never really closed, and the administration of justice — including hearings, bench trials, guilty pleas, findings of innocence and dismissal of cases — have continued throughout the past 15 months,"" a June 14 press release from Evans’ office read. ""It is disingenuous for anyone to say that the courts have been closed."" Between the beginning of April 2020 and the end of May 2021, Evans’ office reported, approximately 128,000 criminal cases were adjudicated, including nearly 13,000 guilty pleas, 1,000 bench trials and 114,000 other dispositions, such as cases being dismissed. Lightfoot said Cook County’s criminal courts ""have been shut down for 15 months."" Her office did not respond with evidence to back that up. In the past, Lightfoot has more narrowly claimed criminal trials were not being held in Cook County. Even if that was what she intended to say here, it would still be inaccurate because jury trials resumed this year in late March and bench trials were held on a limited basis during the pandemic. What’s more, research shows most criminal cases never make it to trial. Instead, they are resolved by other means, such as guilty pleas or dismissals — all of which have continued in Cook County during the pandemic. We rate Lightfoot’s claim False.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'New York', 'Adriano Espaillat']","
Espaillat’s claim has some truth to it, though average benefits likely lower
","Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and upper Manhattan, weighed in on why businesses are struggling to fill job openings. He blamed low wages.  He tweeted: ""So, let me get this straight: 40% of jobs in this country pay less than the average unemployment check of $750/week. There’s no labor shortage, there’s a living-wage shortage."" Is Espaillat right?  His deputy chief of staff, Candace Person, sent us two sources to support claim.  The first, a news story from CNBC from June 2020, said around 40 percent of all workers could theoretically receive more in unemployment benefits than by returning to work. The story cited an analysis by Noah Williams, director of the Center for Research on the Wisconsin Economy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As for the amount of the average unemployment check, Person directed us to a public radio story. That story quoted Daniel Alpert, a senior fellow in macroeconomics and finance at Cornell Law school and an investment banker, who said state and federal benefits average about $750 per week across the country.  We looked into both parts of Espaillat’s claim.  We asked Williams, author of the study cited by Espaillat, about the number of jobs paying less than the average unemployment check of $750 per week.  The study took into account the Cares Act, which added a $600 federal unemployment benefit to what each state provides, which varies.   The share of unemployed workers who receive more on unemployment than when they worked is about 40%, he said. But the share of all workers who earn less than the typical unemployment check is lower, around 20%, he said. That’s because people who are unemployed are disproportionately lower-wage workers. Federal unemployment benefits have dropped since Williams’s study, and he said his study’s findings do not directly apply to current conditions.  But later research looked at unemployed workers now receiving the $300 federal supplement, in place through September, and 42% of them receive more in unemployment benefits than by working, he said.  The average weekly unemployment benefit is lower than what Espaillat said, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Williams, from the University of Wisconsin, said that data through the end of April 2021 showed the average weekly benefit from state programs is $317 per week, or $617 with the $300 federal benefit added.  Another analysis, using weighted averages based on the state’s average unemployment benefit amount and the number of beneficiaries in the state, found that the average weekly benefit is $348.35, or $648.35 when the federal benefit is added. That analysis is from Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 25 percent of full-time workers earned $657 or less in the first quarter of 2021, while 50 percent earned $989 or less. Data for how much money 40 percent of workers earned is not available. Wayne Vroman, an economist with the Urban Institute, said benefits vary greatly by state. He said the claim that the average unemployment check is $750 could make people think the program is more generous than it really is.  We checked with Alpert, an investment banker and senior fellow at Cornell Law School, about his claim that the typical unemployment benefit is $750 per week. He said it will take months to figure out the precise amount, as more data comes in. He based his estimate on survey data, and he acknowledged other analyses could produce a lower estimate. Alpert said he analyzed pay for the 5.7 million low-wage jobs listed among the 8.3 million total job openings in March 2021, as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor. Whether the average unemployment benefit is $617 or $750, it’s still higher than the average weekly wages of the vast majority of the unfilled jobs, he said.
(Not all of the jobs in Alpert’s analysis offered full-time work, which is reflected in their low weekly incomes).  Espaillat claimed that 40% of ""jobs in this country"" pay less than the average unemployment benefit of $750 per week.  Espaillat based his tweet on findings from credible sources, but one source was from spring 2020, when federal unemployment benefits were higher. A strict analysis of the available data show that the average benefit across states is around $618, or $648, if a weighted average is used.  Some data showed less than 25% of all jobs pay wages lower than the average unemployment benefit. Another study showed that 42% of people who are unemployed would receive more in unemployment benefits than what they would be paid to work.  There is some truth to Espaillat’s claim, when the pool of unemployed workers is considered, not the entire American workforce.  We rate this claim Half True.   ",/factchecks/2021/jul/03/adriano-espaillat/espaillats-claim-has-some-truth-it-though-average-/

Can Californians charge electric cars during summer heat?
","As Californians grapple with the increasing impacts of climate change, few things have come to be dreaded more than summer heat waves. This year, the scorching temperatures arrived early, prompting the first power conservation advisory of the summer on June 17 and setting off speculation on social media about how the heat could impact electric car owners. ""California literally just told everyone to not charge their electric cars due to power shortage,"" read a June 18 post on Facebook, which was shared more than 46,000 times.  ""So California just asked everyone to stop charging electric cars due to power outages … can’t make this crap up,"" read another, posted on June 21. There’s good news for electric car owners — the rumors are missing a lot of context and aren’t entirely true. But the posts spread quickly online and migrated from Facebook to other platforms, including Twitter. They also sparked discussion about whether California has the resources to continue to move toward electric vehicles in pursuit of a greener future. ""California can't provide enough electricity for the homes and businesses they have yet they're mandating everyone drive more electric cars,"" read one post on Facebook. ""I'm continually amazed at how stupid leftists can be."" Facebook flagged the posts as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, so we decided to investigate. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.)  The Alert The California Independent System Operator, or CAISO, is the nonprofit tasked with operating and managing most of California’s power grid. It regularly issues power conservation advisories when the grid is facing challenging conditions, such as intense heat or wildfires.  The advisories, known as Flex Alerts, encourage Californians to shift their energy usage to certain times of the day when the power grid is less stressed. ""A flex alert is not a power outage,"" said Gil Tal, director of the Plug-in Hybrid & Electric Vehicle Research Center of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis. ""It's a way to prevent outages. We don't like that we are being told not to use electricity, but it's a much better situation than sitting in the dark if the grid is collapsing."" Usually, the alerts ask that residents conserve power during evening hours, when people are still awake and using electricity but some energy sources, such as solar power, are not available. ""On a good day, solar in California can make up half of the generation,"" said Severin Borenstein, a professor of business administration and public policy at UC Berkeley and the director of the Energy Institute at the university's Haas School of Business. ""And so when we start to lose it, we need to have other things. One of the problems that comes up on super hot days when the demand is very high is we may not have enough of the other resources to keep the balance in the system."" In announcing the June 17 Flex Alert, CAISO encouraged people to voluntarily cut back their power usage from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. The announcement included tips on how Californians could conserve energy and advised residents to complete tasks involving high amounts of energy, such as using large appliances and charging electric vehicles, before the alert to ""be as comfortable as possible"" during the evening hours. The advisory never explicitly told Californians to not charge electric vehicles – just to shift their charging schedules, if possible, to accommodate limited resources in the evening. ""This is completely voluntary,"" Borenstein said. ""There typically aren't even financial incentives. It's just a plea and that applies to electric vehicles as well."" How electric cars get charged Today, there are just under 630,000 electric cars on the road in the Golden State, according to the California Energy Commission. Although they come in many shapes, sizes and models, all of them work similarly — drive, park and plug in as needed. How long and how often electric cars need to charge depends on a variety of factors, including how far the car has traveled, what the car’s top range is and what type of outlet it is hooked up to. Borenstein said charging a vehicle fully can take hours. ""If you're plugging into a regular old household 110-[volt] outlet, it can take all night just to replenish a battery that's been driven 100 miles during the day,"" he said. ""Most houses that have charging have at least a 220-[volt] outlet and charge about twice as fast."" But most daily commutes won’t completely drain an electric car’s battery. Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration shows that residents of the San Francisco Bay Area traveled an average of about 20.7 miles per day in 2019. In Los Angeles, that number was 22.5 miles each day and in Sacramento, it was 22.3 miles.  So most modern electric cars don’t need to be charged on a daily basis, Tal said.  Many get plugged in every couple of days and are equipped with timers so that owners can schedule their charges. While electric car drivers might initially balk at power outages and conservation advisories, Tal said these events usually pose ""no problem."" ""A Flex Alert is a couple of hours and there are very, very few electric car drivers that have to charge their cars in these specific few hours,"" Tal said. ""Most of the drivers today and in the future will be able to delay it by a couple of hours or a couple of days if needed."" Does California Have The Power To Go Green? As of 2019, renewable sources produced just over 30% of California’s power. In 2015, the state pledged to increase that number to 50% by 2030 and Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order last year that requires all new cars sold in California to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. ""California is really on the cutting edge of integrating wind and solar into generation,"" Borenstein said. ""California also has much larger penetration of electric vehicles than any other state, and so we are on the cutting edge there, too. That gives us the opportunity to be a leader in coordinating the electric vehicles with the intermittent renewables."" If everyone drove an electric vehicle, Tal said Californians would ""double"" their electric use in their homes. But change is unlikely to come quickly, and the current grid is able to support short-term increases in electric cars. ""We can have millions of electric cars on today's grid with no problem,"" Tal said. ""We have less than a million today and we can go to three, four, five million without doing any serious upgrades."" In the long run, California’s power grid will need to produce and store more electricity to reliably make the shift to an entirely electrified fleet. But Tal said the process should be smooth if the changes happen ""together.""  Borenstein said it’s not the first time the power grid has needed to adjust to emerging technology, comparing the shift toward electric cars to when air conditioning became popular in the 1950s. Over the years, the grid successfully scaled up capacity to accommodate energy demands. Air conditioning units tend to kick in at roughly the same times because outside temperatures increase during the day and decrease overnight, which posed an additional challenge for the electric grid of the 1950s. Borenstein said electric cars will likely have an easier adjustment. ""We are going to have to build up capacity here as well,"" Borenstein said. ""But we probably aren't going to have to build up capacity nearly as much because everybody doesn't have to charge at the same time."" As California transitions to electric vehicles and renewable power sources, Borenstein said market forces will likely promote charging during times when energy is more plentiful. ""I think that's where we're going,"" he said. ""We're not going to make it illegal to charge your car at any particular time, but it's going to be cheaper to charge it when the grid actually is more plentiful with electricity and more expensive when the grid is tight."" Our ruling Posts on social media claimed that California told electric car owners to ""not charge"" their vehicles because of a power shortage. The posts appear to refer to a Flex Alert that was issued by the California Independent System Operator on June 17. The alert encouraged Californians to voluntarily conserve energy and charge their electric vehicles before 5 p.m. to minimize possible stress on the power grid during the first major heat wave of the summer.  CAISO officials never said people could not charge their vehicles. Rather, they asked that electric vehicle owners shift their charging schedule to accommodate limited energy sources in the evening. Furthermore, experts say that most electric vehicles only need a few hours of charging each night and are equipped with timers so that owners can schedule charging periods, making it simple for Californians to voluntarily comply with the Flex Alert. The posts also kicked off debate about whether California’s grid will be able to accommodate efforts to move toward electric vehicles in the coming years. But experts said the transition should be smooth as long as the shift to electric cars is coordinated with efforts to push for renewable energy sources and improve grid capacity. The posts entirely misinterpreted the Flex Alert and stoked largely unfounded fears about California’s move toward green energy. Therefore, we rate these claims False.

No, the Make-A-Wish Foundation isn’t granting wishes only to vaccinated children
","Since its founding in 1980, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has granted over 315,000 wishes for children with critical illnesses.  Amid lockdown orders and travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of those wishes had to be delayed. Now, as vaccine access continues to expand, the nonprofit announced a vaccination policy for resuming certain wishes that involve longer travel and more people. The policy was misrepresented on social media. ""Make-A-Wish Foundation will only grant wishes to fully vaccinated children,"" reads a screenshot of a headline that was shared in a June 26 Instagram post. ""The Make-A-Wish Foundations’ CEO Richard Davis in a recent video announced that wishes will only be granted to terminally ill children who have received the COVID-19 vaccine,"" the subhead under the headline says.  This isn’t accurate. The policy says children and their families need to be fully vaccinated if the wish involves air travel or large gatherings. It does not apply to every child and every wish, and it also does not apply to any child who has received an end-of-life prognosis, the organization said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The distortion appears to stem from the Davis video reference in the claim. Some interpreted Davis as saying that the foundation was refusing to grant wishes for unvaccinated children altogether.  ""This is literally a new low for humanity. Terminally ill children will not be granted a wish.. from the make a wish foundation… unless.. you guessed it.. they’re fully vaccinated,"" one Twitter post said. In the video, Davis says the vaccination policy applies only to wishes involving air travel and large gatherings, which are set to resume in mid-September for the first time since a March 2020 pause. The decision was made with the help of pediatricians and other medical professionals to protect the health of the children, whose conditions often make them more vulnerable to the virus. The organization issued a statement on its website on June 28 saying, ""Make-A-Wish has not, does not and will not deny wishes to children who are not vaccinated."" The organization said it offers other options that do not involve flying or big crowds for families with children who aren’t yet eligible for the vaccines, or who are choosing not to get the shot. These include shopping sprees, staycations, wishes for pets, room redecorations and spending time with celebrities. An Instagram post claims that the Make-A-Wish Foundation will grant wishes only to fully vaccinated children. This is wrong. The nonprofit organization recently announced a policy that requires families and children to be fully vaccinated only for wishes that involve air travel and large gatherings.  The new policy is based on the guidance of medical experts to protect the health of the children, whose conditions often make them more vulnerable to viruses. It doesn’t apply to any child who has received an end-of-life prognosis. We rate this False.",/factchecks/2021/jul/02/instagram-posts/no-make-wish-foundation-isnt-granting-wishes-only-/

No, American flag house wasn’t painted by flag-waving Marine in spat with neighbors
","In the leadup to July 4, an image circulating on Facebook is celebrating a Marine who Facebook users say painted his house red, white and blue to stick it to his neighbors. ""Nice paint job!"" one such post says below a photo of the house. ""This Marine was told by his neighbors that he could not fly the American flag in his yard all year long. This is his response."" Various posts from June and July were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The house painted like the American flag is real, as is the photo highlighted in the Facebook posts, which shows several ladders set up on the deck and against the house. But the story told by the Facebook posts about the origins of the house’s design is not accurate.  A screenshot of a Facebook post about the house painted like an American flag. The one-of-a-kind property is located in Cambridge, Md., a city on the Chesapeake Bay. It has been featured on a travel website, and it can be seen via Google Maps. It is still painted like a flag, said Pat Escher, the division manager for Cambridge’s planning and zoning division. Using TinEye, a reverse image search engine, PolitiFact found versions of the same photo of the house from as early as 2013. Snopes fact-checked a claim about the same photo in 2014.  Branden Spear, a contractor and the owner of the property, told PolitiFact that he painted the exterior of the house red, white and blue in 2012 following a dispute with Cambridge’s Historic Preservation Commission. He was frustrated with the commission at the time because local building inspectors had objected to the windows he was using to restore a nearby property he had purchased across the street. ""The problem started with the neighboring property,"" Spear said. ""After buying the property, I started to replace the existing vinyl windows, and I saw a commission came to me and said they had to go back to original wood windows. This would increase the cost to around $30k!""  ""The flag house was done up for fun against the commission,"" Spear continued. ""The house has 45 stars, just like the year it was built (in the) early 1900s."" Spear said that he is not a Marine, and that he has never had any trouble with neighbors over the American flag, as the Facebook post claims. He also discussed the inspiration behind the house during a local news segment in 2019. Escher said she knew of no provision in the city about flying the American flag.

Did the national debt become bigger than the U.S. economy? Yes, before Biden took office
","Four years after passing a major tax cut that slashed federal revenues, Republicans are raising alarms about the national debt again.  President Joe Biden has already signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus and economic relief package known as the American Rescue Plan, and he’s pushing to enact perhaps trillions more in federal spending for infrastructure and other priorities. One Republican argument against these measures has been their impact on the national debt, although Biden has also proposed tax increases to fund some of his plans. Former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, took a shot at Biden’s fiscal policy in a June 28 Facebook post.  ""The national debt is now bigger than our economy,"" she wrote. ""That hasn’t happened since World War Two — and we’re in peacetime. Joe Biden is digging a hole America can never fill. But he doesn’t care. When the bill comes due, he’ll be long gone."" She is correct about the debt ratio — the nation’s publicly held debt did exceed its gross domestic product at the end of 2020, for the first time since World War II. But Haley’s post focused narrowly on one measure of government debt. And it goes too far in associating Biden’s policies with the nation’s debt burden.  The two parts of the debt-to-GDP ratio are intertwined: Governments may take on more debt to finance programs that promote economic growth. And as a country’s economy grows, so does its borrowing capacity. But at a certain level, high government debt can also inhibit economic growth by raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.  The debt reaching 100% of GDP sounds scary, but economists say it’s not necessarily an ominous sign for a country like the U.S. that has strong credit, big reserve assets and expansive borrowing capacity. Such countries can more easily manage their debt loads, and keep their governments functioning over the long term, without resorting to tax increases, said Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, in a 2019 speech. So the ""hole"" Haley refers to doesn’t affect the U.S. the way it would a weaker economy. Still, it’s a development that attracts notice from commentators and politicians, such as Haley, who is a potential 2024 presidential candidate. There are two widely used metrics for federal debt, and both are considered valid. Haley’s historical claim about the ratio is right if you use one measure and wrong if you use the other. The smaller of the two figures is known as publicly held debt. This includes the debt held by the general public through Treasury bills, bonds and notes. Some is held by U.S. nationals, and some by foreigners.  The larger figure is called gross federal debt. It takes the publicly held debt and adds to it the debt that the government owes itself. This typically happens when trust funds, such as those that pay for Social Security and Medicare, accept federal IOUs. Haley is correct that the publicly held debt recently crossed the threshold of 100% of the nation’s GDP for the first time since World War II. But it’s worth noting that this milestone occurred at the end of 2020 — the last full year of Donald Trump’s presidency.  In just that one year, the ratio soared from 79% to 100%, as the government spent heavily to fight the coronavirus and the resulting economic slowdown. Meanwhile, the gross federal debt has been at or above 100% of GDP at every year’s end since 2012. So the year-end level was already there during most of Barack Obama’s administration and through all of Trump’s.    A representative for Haley told PolitiFact that her statement was simply stating a fact about the level of debt, and arguing that Biden’s policies would worsen that percentage going forward. But Haley’s use of the word ""now"" in conjunction with the critique of Biden’s policies gives the impression that she holds Biden responsible for a debt milestone that was crossed before he took office. On Biden’s watch, the ratio of publicly held debt to GDP has actually dipped slightly below 100%. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, it stood at 99.75% of GDP. It could fluctuate in the coming months as the post-pandemic economic recovery gains steam. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the federal debt will dip below 100% of GDP between 2023 and 2025 before rising again to 106% in 2031, due in part to delayed spending provisions of the American Rescue Plan. That analysis assumes that all other tax and spending laws stay the same, so it doesn’t account for Biden’s plans to raise taxes to pay for some of his spending proposals and otherwise increase tax collections. In general, it’s overly simplistic to blame, or credit, any president for changes in the federal debt. Much of our current level of debt has been driven by mandatory spending on Social Security and Medicare, which have been increasing due to the aging of the Baby Boom generation. These expenditures have essentially been on autopilot. For other types of spending, it takes both the president and Congress to enact legislation, and control of the White House and Congress has shifted between the parties in recent years.  The Trump tax cuts of 2017 widened the government’s annual deficits substantially, but didn’t move the debt-to-GDP ratio much, because the economy was growing in tandem with government borrowing.  Biden has proposed some substantial increases in spending to spur the economy. The American Rescue Plan Act cost $1.9 trillion and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would increase deficits by $1.8 trillion between 2021 and 2031. Other elements of Biden’s agenda would be offset by tax increases, largely on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. It’s not at all clear that any of Biden’s pending legislative proposals will ever be enacted, much less at the levels he initially proposed for them. His infrastructure proposal, for instance, has already been cut down in size during bipartisan negotiations. ""Obviously, trillions of dollars have been enacted under Biden,"" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""But so, too, under Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush. Anytime someone tries to pin responsibility for the national debt on one political figure, they’ve got to take a few shortcuts with the truth."" Haley said, ""The national debt is now bigger than our economy. That hasn’t happened since World War Two — and we’re in peacetime. Joe Biden is digging a hole America can never fill."" In 2020, at the end of the Trump administration, the publicly held debt did exceed 100% of GDP for the first time since World War II. It’s down since then. A broader measure, the gross federal debt, which includes funds lent from one part of the government to another, has been above 100% of GDP since 2012, well before Biden became president. Changes in federal debt levels are largely driven by mandatory spending beyond the direct control of any president, and much of the rest has been initiated by lawmakers and presidents from both parties. The debt-to-GDP ratio surged in 2020 because of the federal response to the pandemic and the economic contraction.

Are migrants causing 'carnage' at the Texas border?
","BRACKETTVILLE — In April, the local elected officials of Kinney County felt that they were under siege. Their expanse of rocky borderland located 100 miles west of San Antonio had become a perilous crossing ground for migrants who had made their way across the Rio Grande.   So Kinney County Judge Tully Shahan took an unprecedented measure. He issued a local state of disaster, a statutory procedure typically invoked by communities experiencing hurricanes, floods or wildfires.  ""On April 21, 1836, Texas won her independence during the battle at San Jacinto, the final and decisive battle of the Texas Revolution,"" Shahan, a Republican, wrote in the disaster declaration. ""Today, 185 years later, Texas is once again under siege, as thousands upon thousands of illegal aliens invade our State through our border with Mexico.""  The move caught momentum. Over the next month, similar declarations were issued by another 14 counties — some located along the border, others more than 200 miles away.  By May 31, the issue culminated in Gov. Greg Abbott issuing his own disaster proclamation, citing a ""humanitarian crisis in many Texas communities along the border."" Then he took his border response one step further when, on June 16, he announced that Texas would undertake border wall construction using a combination of state dollars and crowdfunding to stave off what he and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called an invasion. ""What has changed is the carnage that is being caused by the people coming across the border,"" Abbott said in a press conference announcing his border wall plans. ""Fences of ranchers along the border are being completely decimated causing border ranchers to lose their livestock or border farmers to lose their crops. Homes are being invaded. Neighborhoods are dangerous, and people are being threatened on a daily basis with guns.""  Later, Patrick added that ""this is a fight for our survival.""  The crush of migrants crossing into Texas has spiked by 360% so far this year compared with the first half of 2020, according to federal data. The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has recorded nearly 400,000 migrant encounters in Texas this year, although a large portion of this total, up to 38% in some months, is due to migrants re-entering the country after at least one prior expulsion.  The surge is a product of drastic changes in immigration policy between the previous and current presidential administrations combined with a worsening set of economic circumstances in migrants’ origin countries — primarily Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.  When asked by a reporter if Abbott has any intention to address the humanitarian needs of those entering the U.S. seeking a better life, he instead emphasized the humanitarian needs of Texans.   ""I'm focused on the humanitarian crisis that Texans are suffering through,"" Abbott said. ""Texans on the border are suffering through a humanitarian crisis by having their lives disrupted with guns and gangs and being riddled with crime.""  So what does the invasion of Texas borderlands look like in places like Kinney County? And to what extent are these migrants causing ""carnage,"" a word that by all definitions denotes violent killings?  Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe’s small department oversees 1,360 square miles of hardpan terrain and 16 linear miles of the Rio Grande. And in Coe’s 35 years of law enforcement in the region, never has he seen the current level of activity.    ""We're going non-stop,"" he said. ""There's no end in sight.""   The types of calls his deputies repeatedly respond to relate to the migrants trespassing through private ranches. The fences they cut aggravate ranchers for allowing livestock to escape. The water lines they slash for hydration can drain ranchers’ reservoirs.   Then there are the cases of migrants breaking and entering into empty ranch houses or deer blinds, often leaving places disheveled and pantries ransacked. Occasionally, firearms will turn up missing.   ""They always take water and they take food, but one (rancher) reported they took various other things lying around the house — binoculars, knives, things like that,"" Coe said.   But there hasn’t been an increase in violent crimes in Kinney County, Coe said. And the same appears to be true for many counties within the state’s border region. Among all rural border counties that have submitted violent crime data to the state’s Unified Crime Reporting program, violent crimes are occurring at a similar, if not slower, pace this year compared to 2020.   The same is generally true for the border’s urban areas, according to the Unified Crime Reporting data, which was obtained through an open records request. Among the border’s largest cities, El Paso, Brownsville, and Edinburg are all on pace to match last year’s violent crime numbers, while Laredo is on pace to reduce its annual crime rate. Only the city of McAllen is on pace to exceed last year’s violent crime totals.    Rather, it’s property crimes and migrant rescues that have law enforcement agencies working overtime.   In the heart of the Chihuahuan Desert, the Hudspeth County Sheriff’s Office has responded to brush fires set by desperate migrants hoping to be found by authorities. They’ve reported a rash of cut fences, cut water lines and break-ins of empty ranch houses.   ""They're not stealing anything per se that's of any value, but they are breaking in and getting food and water and stuff like that,"" Hudspeth County Sheriff Arvin West said.    The same goes for Terrell County, whose sheriff’s department is now mostly occupied with migrant-related calls.   ""The takings (from break-ins) are not necessarily televisions and stereos or anything like that, it's mostly travel things — clothing, shoes, boots, food, water,"" said Terrell County Sheriff Santiago Gonzalez. ""The kinds of things you would carry when you're out camping or out walking.""   But violent crimes and murders? ""Oh no. Definitely not,"" Gonzalez said. To Pam Rivas, a landowner with several acres along the Rio Grande in Hidalgo County, the only major change in her community resulting from the border crisis is the ubiquity of state troopers. In May, Abbott deployed 1,000 state troopers and national guard members to the border region to combat drug smuggling.   Rivas spent her childhood growing up on the river-front property, but today she can't travel the roads without being closely tailgated by a state trooper or having her car searched.   Although she has seen some migrants make their way through the area, it's law enforcement that makes her feel harassed. Recently, her car was searched by state troopers after she was observed by Border Patrol driving on her own land.  ""Just because I go and take a cruise on my property, I'm guilty of something?"" she said. Although the border crisis hasn’t had a major impact on violent crime rates so far this year, one crime statistic that has spiked in some areas is car thefts.   In Lavaca County, which is over 230 miles from the border, the sheriff’s office has recorded more than 10 stolen vehicles so far this year, which is about five times higher than what the county has recorded in years prior.  ""Several of those vehicles have been recovered during vehicle pursuits with human cargo between here and the (Rio Grande) Valley,"" said Lavaca County Sheriff Micah Harmon. ""We know that that’s the reason they’re being stolen and what they’re being used for.""  And one sheriff in Goliad County reportedly found a site on a ranch that was being used to strip stolen vehicles ""for the purpose of human trafficking.""  But surging car thefts isn’t occurring everywhere. While state data shows that the number of car thefts in El Paso in the first half of 2021 is already close to last year’s total, other cities — like McAllen and Laredo — have low car theft incidents so far this year.  Nonetheless, stolen vehicles and high-speed pursuits have become increasingly common in the border’s rural areas. While the incidents themselves aren’t considered a violent crime, high-speed pursuits of smugglers with human cargo have often resulted in crashes, which have left many migrants seriously injured or killed.  ""Personally, I consider that when a driver of a stolen vehicle flees from us and he crashes into a tree and injures nine or 10 people, and fails to stop and render aid to those people — I call that pretty violent,"" Harmon said, referring to a recent pursuit involving his deputies that began in the city of Hallettsville.  Harmon’s point underscores a theme that is wound though many sheriff’s experiences of the border crisis: The people who are encountering death in the borderlands are the migrants themselves — contrary to Abbott’s claim that it’s the migrants who are bringing ""carnage"" upon Texans.  Emergency call centers routinely receive calls from lost migrants asking to be rescued. In Hudspeth County, a drought-stricken desert expanse, the sheriff’s office sometimes responds to 15 rescue calls per day. Other migrants have poorer luck.  ""I've had 20 dead ones since September,"" West said. ""They're in canyons. They're on mountains. They could be seven, eight, 10 miles from any closest road.""  ""They just don’t realize how much water it takes to come across the desert like this,"" he said.   The growing tally of deceased migrants is much the same elsewhere. Terrell County has recorded 10 — the most migrant deaths ""this county has seen in I don’t know how many years,"" Gonzalez said.  Kinney County has recorded around seven, which is two or three times the county's totals of previous years. Some succumb to heat exhaustion; others are found drowned in the river.   ""The words ‘invasion,’ and ‘carnage.’ What does that depict? That depicts horrific violence that has no place here,"" said Karla Vargas, an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project representing several landowners fighting government land seizures. ""If you want to talk about carnage, let's talk about the carnage that these people are fleeing.""  According to Abbott, the border crisis is causing Texans to suffer by disrupting their lives ""with guns and gangs and being riddled with crime."" And it's the people who are crossing the border that are causing ""carnage"" in the state, he said.   But this violent rhetoric is an exaggerated depiction of what law enforcement agencies are encountering on the ground.  If we take carnage to mean criminal violence and killings, state and local crime data doesn’t back that up. Although various law enforcement agencies in border communities have recorded a rash of property crimes attributable to traveling migrants — like break-ins, cut fences and car thefts — violent crime is relatively steady compared to last year.   We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/jul/02/greg-abbott/are-migrants-causing-carnage-texas-border-abbotts-/

The study, ""The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations — We Should Rethink the Policy,"" was done by three European researchers, led by Harald Walach, professor at Poznan University of Medical Sciences in Poland.  The researchers said that they calculated from a large Israeli field study the number of people who needed to be vaccinated to prevent one death; and that they used the Adverse Drug Reactions database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register to get the number of vaccination cases ""reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects."" The researchers concluded: ""For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination."" The European Medicines Agency, however, warns that its data on adverse reactions can’t be used on its own to conclude whether a vaccine caused death: ""The information on this website relates to suspected side effects, i.e. medical events that have been observed following the administration of the COVID-19 vaccines, but which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine. These events may have been caused by another illness or be associated with another medicine taken by the patient at the same time."" The study was published in the journal Vaccines on June 24. Four days later, the journal appended a note to the study, expressing concerns about the study and calling its main conclusion incorrect. The note said: ""The journal is issuing this expression of concern to alert readers to significant concerns regarding the paper cited above. Serious concerns have been raised about misinterpretation of the data and the conclusions. ""The major concern is the misrepresentation of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts and misrepresentation of the data, e.g., Abstract: ‘For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination.’ ""Stating that these deaths linked to vaccination efforts is incorrect and distorted."" A board member of the journal, University of Oxford immunologist Katie Ewer, tweeted that she resigned the board post because of the publication.

Yes, Milwaukee saw population growth during the pandemic. But hard to tell if it’s 'record numbers'
","Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Our Town America had not responded to a request for further data. In the response, the group confirmed its research shows 10,000 new movers to Milwaukee since January of this year. The change does not affect the rating.    If you live in Milwaukee, are from Milwaukee, or just love Milwaukee, you no doubt heard ESPN First Take’s recent comments on the city.  The program’s host said she was glad they likely wouldn’t make the trip to the site of the NBA finals this year because ""it’s going to be terrible cities."" The potential cities, of course, include Milwaukee. When asked whether he’d want to make the trip to the Brew City, commentator Stephen A. Smith replied, ""Hell no.""  And then outrage erupted.  Milwaukeeans stepped up to defend themselves, from city leaders like Ald. Khalif Rainey to Twitter users unhappy with the slight. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published a lengthy list of all the things to love about the city, though columnist James E. Causey reminded readers that there is truth to the comments for many of the city’s residents of color.  The entity at the center of the controversy — the Milwaukee Bucks — didn’t waste time jumping in. On June 23, 2021, team president Peter Feigin offered the First Take hosts a personal tour of the city, noting its eclectic neighborhoods, great dining scene and expansive Lake Michigan waterfront.  ""There’s a reason people are moving to this welcoming gem of a city in record numbers,"" Feigin said in a statement, shared by the Bucks’ official Twitter account.  Are the Bucks accurate? Are people moving to the city in record numbers?  Let’s dive in.  When asked for evidence for the claim, Bucks’ chief communications officer Barry Baum pointed to a September 2020 study from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph team showing that people fled the nation’s largest metro areas during the pandemic, favoring smaller cities like Milwaukee.   Milwaukee experienced a 4.5% increase in net arrivals to the city in April to August 2020, compared to the same stretch of months in 2019. That was the fourth-largest gain in net arrivals in the nation, the study found, following Jacksonville, Salt Lake City and Sacramento.  Baum also cited a June 4, 2021 CBS-58 story that said 10,000 people had moved to Milwaukee since January of this year, many of them choosing to work remotely at the same job in a larger city they’d left behind.  That story references research from Our Town America, a marketing company that helps businesses target new movers. An employee of Our Town America said at the time of the CBS-58 report, their company had sent mail to roughly 10,000 people who had newly moved to Milwaukee since January. But that information Baum cited is based on estimates, extrapolated from other data. The official tallies come from the U.S. Census bureau. A May 28, 2020 analysis from the Journal Sentinel’s Ideas Lab found that the Milwaukee metro area was lagging far behind its Midwestern peers in adding to its population — adding about 19,000 residents, or a growth rate of 1.2%, between 2010 and 2019, for a total of 1,575,179.  The city itself actually shrank by 0.7% between 2010 and 2019, according to Census estimates, from 594,498 residents to 590,157. Indeed, its population has been on a decline since the 1960s.  In comparison, the population of Madison, Wisconsin’s capital city and the second-largest in the state, grew by 9.8% between 2010 and 2019, the analysis found.  In that context, adding 10,000 people in a matter of six months would seem to set a record.  But Feigin didn’t specify his ""record numbers"" claim in the context of the last decade.  So is this the most people that have moved to Milwaukee — ever?  Milwaukee’s population grew dramatically in the 1800s and 1900s, according to the Milwaukee County Historical Society.  A city of less than 10,000 when it was incorporated in 1846, it had more than doubled in size four years later. Immigrants flooded in for jobs following the Civil War, keeping Milwaukee growing and diversifying through the end of the 19th century.  Historical census data shows that Milwaukee grew from about 1,700 residents in 1840 to more than 587,000 a hundred years later. Some of those decades marked particularly large waves of people moving to the city — between 1920 and 1930, the city’s population grew by 121,102 people, and it grew by at least 80,000 people in each of the four decades prior.  Since that old census data doesn’t get more granular than breaking things down by decade, it’s difficult to know exactly how many people moved to Milwaukee in a given year during that time. If we evenly divide that decade of largest growth by 10, that’s about 12,110 people moving to the city per year during the 1920s.  Still, to be fair, we don’t know how many more people might move to Milwaukee during the rest of 2021. So, it’s not yet possible to compare it to a year from a century ago.  Both Ben Barbera, director of collections and exhibitions at the Milwaukee County Historical Society, and Milwaukee historian John Gurda were skeptical of whether any recent boost constitutes record numbers.  Though Barbera said the lack of year-over-year data meant he couldn’t guarantee whether a single year during the last two centuries added more than 10,000 new residents, he said that from a percentage standpoint, those decades were ""much more impressive,"" particularly the city’s 77% increase from 1880 to 1890.  Gurda said that the term ""record numbers"" was likely an exaggeration. Milwaukee has seen slow growth for decades, he wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  ""If COVID has in fact made smaller cities attractive, that would be great news for Milwaukee,"" Gurda said. ""But I think the trend has yet to establish itself.""  Feigin said people are moving to Milwaukee in record numbers.  While it may be true that the pandemic trend of people leaving larger cities for smaller ones has benefited Milwaukee, it seems more likely that it’s too early to tell. And the explosive growth during the 19th and 20th centuries is hard to beat.  In one way-back decade, the city saw a 77% population increase.  Our definition of Mostly False is that the claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  That fits here.",/factchecks/2021/jul/02/peter-feigin/yes-milwaukee-saw-population-growth-during-pandemi/

Instagram post about man who played BTS song during Muslim call to prayer is satire
","An image circulating on Instagram and other social media platforms tells an elaborate story about a 21-year-old man who was arrested for interrupting a Muslim call to prayer.

Rising inflation fears are real but complex
","U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, caught the interest of her political opponents, plus anyone else concerned, about a June 10 report that showed the inflation rate for the 12 months ending in May at 5%. That is the highest 12-month rate since 5.5% in the 12 months ending in August 2008. ""Well, we’re not even remotely close to a point to say that we’re at rising inflation so no, I wouldn’t agree with that,"" Axne said when asked during a WHO-TV interview in Des Moines if she thought Republicans were correct when warning that federal spending on the last stimulus distribution in March was fueling inflation.  ""I mean let’s wait ‘til we have actual, an expert, who says that that’s what’s happening. Right now, we’ve been able to, you know, keep inflation from being a big issue,"" she continued, in the 8-minute, 15-second interview. Axne said in the interview she did not favor a fourth round of stimulus checks. Ian Mariani, Axne’s spokesman, said Axne is not ready to call the 5% figure shown in the report for May a trend because economic experts have not been ready to do that.  ""She’s listening to experts who say it’s not a trend,"" Mariani told PolitiFact Iowa. Moreover, it is too soon to analyze whether or not a trend exists because the nation is in the middle of the time period needed to do that analysis, Mariani said. He said Axne is relying on economic analysts to determine how much time is needed to call higher inflation a trend. Analysts already had inflation on their mind as spring wound down. The reported inflation rate in April – 4.2% over the previous 12 months – showed signs of an increase.  Consumer prices rose by 3.9% in May but the Democrat-controlled White House and independent Federal Reserve said prices would settle down.   ""Inflation has increased notably in recent months,"" Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell said at a June 16 news conference.  Driving the increases were price hikes related to COVID-19 pandemic disruptions to the supply chain for many goods and pass-through energy costs, he said. Notably, motor vehicle prices have increased. But, analysts need more information before knowing where inflation is headed, Powell said, stressing patience while analysts see more data in the coming months.  ""As these transitory supply effects abate, inflation is expected to drop back toward our longer-run goal, and the median inflation projection falls from 3.4% this year to 2.1% next year and 2.2% in 2023,"" he said. The Fed’s Open Market Committee had projected these increases in March. Economists consider inflation around 2% to be healthy. In a June 16 statement, the Open Market Committee wrote: ""The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy, but risks to the economic outlook remain."" Ira Kalish, the chief global economist for the financial auditing firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd., wrote on June 29 that consumer spending was high in March and gave credit to extra cash they had because of the government stimulus checks they received, increased vaccinations and businesses reopening after being shuttered during the pandemic.  Spending in May was up from February and at pre-pandemic levels, he wrote. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told Bloomberg News he expected inflation to remain higher than usual for longer than the Federal Reserve predicts.  ""Supply capacity of the U.S. economy may not be able to keep pace with demand growth, which is already evident in supply shortages from semiconductors through to labor,"" he said for the Vince Golle-Kyungjin Yoo Bloomberg story.  But, 49 economists surveyed May 7-13 by the National Association of Business Economics (NABE) said they think the May inflation rate will be short-lived. NABE surveys are done quarterly. ""NABE panelists have grown more optimistic about the prospects for economic growth in 2021,"" NABE President Manuel Balmaseda, chief economist at CEMEX, wrote in the NABE Outlook for May. Holly Wade, executive director of the Nashville-based small business advocacy NFIB Research Center, said 56% of those responding to the May survey expect economic growth this year, while 15% expect an economic downturn.  ""Inflation expectations moved up significantly from those in the March survey, but panelists anticipate inflation easing in the second half of 2021, with no resurgence in 2022,"" Wade wrote. Eric Wingorad, senior economist for Alliance Bernstein, told CNBC News that factors that do a better job of determining inflation trends have been subdued.  Harvard professor and former adviser for President Barack Obama Jason Furman told the Associated Press determining what will happen with inflation this year is complicated. But, he suggested inflation could be higher than the recent norm. ""I don’t think anyone thinks the recent rate of price increase is going to continue,"" Furman said in the AP interview. ""The question is, how much does it show? Does it slow down all the way back to the 2% increase every year we used to see? Or, does it slow down less than that, and we’re left with something more like a 3% increase every year?"" Axne is wrong when she says people aren’t remotely close to saying inflation exists, or that it isn’t an issue. The numbers show short-term inflation, and plenty of economists are weighing in on what that means. But, that doesn’t mean at this point long-term inflation, many of the nation’s top economists are saying. In fact, those economists say, they expect the May number to be a blip in a year when inflation will get back to the near normal or slightly elevated 3% range.  We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2021/jul/01/cindy-axne/rising-inflation-fears-are-real-complex/

She led the House’s impeachment of Trump in 2019, and famously tore up a copy of the text of his State of the Union address, on camera, in February 2020, just as he finished delivering it. After the attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters in January 2021, she and the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to have Trump removed as a president, saying his ""dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office."" When Pence declined, she pushed to impeach Trump again on charges that he incited an insurrection.

CDC says more young people hospitalized from vaccine than COVID-19 itself? False
","An Instagram post wrongly claimed that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said more young people are hospitalized as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine than from the disease itself. The post features a screenshot of a headline on the conservative website The Gateway Pundit. The headline said: ""CDC officials admit more hospitalizations of young people from vaccine than from the actual COVID virus – Including HUGE number of heart problems reported."" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The CDC rejects the claim. ""CDC has not directly stated or indirectly implied that more young people are hospitalized from COVID-19 vaccination than from COVID-19 disease,"" said CDC spokesperson Martha Sharan. ""That statement is factually inaccurate and is not representative of the safety data on COVID-19 vaccination."" The Gateway Pundit cites a blog post by Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter who has questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and steps to prevent spread of the virus.  Berenson claimed that CDC data and estimates show that for every 100,000 vaccines given to young people, ""200 will be hospitalized,"" and ""about 50 out of 100,000 adolescents have ever been hospitalized for Covid-related illness."" The CDC estimates that from March 1, 2020, to March 27, 2021, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate for people aged 12 to 17 was about 50 per 100,000 population. That is in line with what Berenson stated. Berenson’s reference to 200 hospitalizations out of 100,000 vaccines comes from CDC data presented June 23 that said 0.2% of people aged 12 to 15, and 0.2% of people aged 16 to 25 required medical care in a hospital or emergency room after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  However, those 0.2% findings are based on responses from people who completed an app-based questionnaire after vaccination, and cannot be extrapolated to the general population, said Matthew Laurens, a University of Maryland School of Medicine professor and pediatric infectious disease specialist.  ""Those who experience side effects are more likely to submit post-vaccination surveys,"" Laurens said.  If any serious health problems are reported, the CDC can investigate to try and determine whether they were caused by a vaccine. Overall, hospitalizations in the U.S. for COVID-19 have declined since a peak in January 2021, when vaccines became more widely available. The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that people ages 12 and up get vaccinated against COVID-19.  As of June 28, the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System had received 780 reports of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) among people ages 30 and younger who received a COVID-19 vaccine. Officials have confirmed 518 cases and are investigating whether there is a relationship to COVID-19 vaccination. The CDC said that most patients who received care ""responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better."" Reports submitted to the VAERS database about possible reactions to the vaccines come in unverified. The submissions do not necessarily represent a health problem caused by the vaccine. Serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination may happen, but are rare, the CDC said. An Instagram post claimed, ""CDC officials admit more hospitalizations of young people from vaccine than from the actual COVID virus.""

Van Orden mischaracterizes what dropping the Hyde Amendment would mean for paying for abortions
","When President Joe Biden released a budget proposal in May that would drop the ban on federal funding for abortions, he reversed a position he had long held, fulfilled a campaign promise and angered abortion opponents.  The Hyde Amendment, a congressional rider attached to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ budget, has blocked the use of federal dollars for abortions in most cases since 1976.  Under Hyde, pregnant people who get their health care through Medicaid, Medicare, the Indian Health Service and other federal insurance programs are prohibited from using those programs to pay for abortions.  Supporters of abortion rights say the rule discriminates against people of color and low-income Americans, while anti-abortion advocates say taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for procedures they disagree with.  That second camp includes Derrick Van Orden, a Republican and former Navy SEAL who is running to unseat U.S. Rep Ron Kind, D-La Crosse, who represents large swaths of western Wisconsin. Van Orden lost narrowly to Kind in 2020.  Van Orden tweeted about the issue on June 12, 2021, referencing a tweet from the Republican National Committee that said Biden’s decision to remove Hyde broke with decades of bipartisan precedent. ""In a single election cycle we went from the most Pro-Life President in history to one that will force Americans to pay for abortion — on demand — up to birth,"" Van Orden tweeted.  Much was said when President Donald Trump held office about whether he was the most pro-life president. Since Biden is in office now, we’ll focus on the latter half of the claim — that he would force Americans to ""pay for abortion — on demand — up to birth.""  Let’s check it out.  When asked for evidence to back up the claim, a staffer for Van Orden’s campaign said the removal of the Hyde Amendment would result in taxpayers funding abortions, including in Wisconsin and 32 other states, which follow Hyde’s restrictions and do not use state dollars to pay for abortions under Medicaid.  An important caveat: Congressional Republicans are likely to move to reinstate Hyde during budget negotiations. Experts agree that Biden will face an uphill battle to keep it out, especially since the measure enjoys support from some moderate Democrats as well as Republicans.  But let’s say Hyde does get removed through the budget process. Would taxpayers then be paying for abortion on demand, and up to birth? The Hyde Amendment applies only to the funding of abortion, not to state laws determining the gestational age at which an abortion is or isn’t allowed, Alta Charo, a University of Wisconsin-Madison law and bioethics professor, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin.  ""With the Hyde Amendment gone, its federal funding restrictions would no longer apply to legal abortions, but the states would still determine the boundaries of legality, subject to state and federal constitutional law decisions on the extent of state power and the extent of women’s rights,"" Charo wrote.  People living in states that impose limits on when during a pregnancy a person can have an abortion, then, would not be paying for abortions up to birth if Hyde were removed.  That includes Wisconsin, where abortions are prohibited at 22 weeks after a person’s last menstrual period unless the person’s life and physical health is threatened.  So if the Hyde Amendment’s removal doesn’t specifically allow for abortions up until birth, where did that part of the claim come from?  The concept isn’t new, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University.  Most recently, former Vice President Mike Pence said in an Oct. 7, 2020 debate against Vice President Kamala Harris that both Harris and Biden support abortion ""up to the moment of birth.""  Politifact National rated that claim False. (It’s important to note that abortions later in pregnancy are rare in the U.S. In 2018, 1% of abortions were performed after 21 weeks’ gestation, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control. More than 90% were performed before 13 weeks’ gestation.)  The idea arises from how abortion opponents have interpreted the landmark Roe v. Wade case, as well as another case, Doe v. Bolton, which was decided three years later, Ziegler said.  Roe, as is widely known, recognizes a person’s constitutional right to a safe, legal abortion. Doe v. Bolton allows doctors to consider a wide range of factors when determining whether an abortion is for health reasons.  That could include ""all factors physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age relevant to the well-being of the patient,"" the case said.  ""A lot of abortion opponents look at that and say, ‘Roe and this companion case legalized abortion until birth pretty much for any reason,’ "" Ziegler said.  But it’s unlikely that Biden shares that interpretation, she said.  And still, some states take a stricter reading of that particular component of the case — including in Wisconsin, where the person’s ""physical health"" must be threatened to obtain an abortion later in the pregnancy than 22 weeks.  Rather, the idea that those who support the Roe ruling and related cases support abortion up to birth is ""sort of like a social movement narrative,"" Ziegler said, in the murky world of how different people interpret abortion-related U.S. Supreme Court cases.  Biden has not said that he supports abortion up until birth. His campaign told Politifact National that he supports Roe as amended by the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which allows states to regulate abortion in certain ways as long as the regulations don’t place an undue burden on the pregnant person. Van Orden said the president would force Americans to pay for abortion, on demand, up to birth.  While he’s right that Biden’s dropping the Hyde Amendment signaled a desire to use federal funds to pay for abortions, the rest of his statement mischaracterizes Biden’s position and what reversing Hyde would do.  Dropping the Hyde Amendment, already an unlikely scenario, would not change states’ limits on when an abortion could happen and for what reasons abortions later in a pregnancy can be performed, experts say.  Our definition of Mostly False is a claim that ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.   ",/factchecks/2021/jun/30/derrick-van-orden/van-orden-mischaracterizes-what-dropping-hyde-amen/
