Isakson says energy bills higher than taxes, insurance
","
Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson wants Americans to invest in greener homes, and he is co-sponsoring a bill he thinks will help this take place.

The Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act, introduced last month, requires lenders who write mortgages backed by the federal government to consider a home’s possible energy costs along with loan payments and other expenses when they determine whether a buyer can afford it.

Energy bills are even higher than real estate taxes or homeowners insurance, Isakson said in a press release issued Oct. 19.

""The average homeowner spends more than $2,000 each year on energy costs – more than on either real estate taxes or homeowners insurance, both of which are regularly accounted for in mortgage underwriting, "" the release read.  

Even more than real estate taxes or homeowners insurance? Sounds like a big chunk of a typical homeowner’s budget. We took a closer look.

An Isakson spokeswoman referred us to a chart produced by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Market Transformation, which promotes energy efficiency and green buildings. It created a chart with average 2008 costs for energy, property taxes and homeowners insurance.

Energy costs stood at $2,278. Property taxes were $1,879. Homeowners insurance was $791.

The chart said that the IMT used U.S. Department of Energy data, U.S. Census Bureau numbers, and figures for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Researchers typically go to these sources for this type of information.  

Each year, the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy publishes the Buildings Energy Data Book, which tracks how much energy residential and commercial buildings use. They include data on how much the average household spends on energy.

For 2008, it was $2,269, or $9 lower than IMT’s figure. An IMT researcher told us that their number is higher because they included costs of wood fuel, which the Energy Department excludes.

The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey includes estimates on the median amount of real estate taxes paid for owner-occupied housing units. It was $1,897, according to their 2008 data. This is close to IMT’s number.

Then we looked at average yearly costs for homeowners insurance. We looked at census data, which is based on calculations from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. For 2008, it was $791, just as IMT said.  

Isakson was right. On average, the amount of money a homeowner pays for energy bills is higher than property taxes or homeowners insurance. He earns a True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC5E80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/07/johnny-isakson/isakson-says-energy-bills-higher-taxes-insurance/
"['Taxes', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says under his tax plan, everyone will be getting a tax cut
","
Talking up his flat-tax plan, Texas Gov. Rick Perry told Neil Cavuto of the Fox News Channel that every taxpayer should be happy because of its simplicity. Plus, he said, it’s ""a tax cut for every group out there. No matter where you are in the stratosphere, you're going to be getting a tax cut.""

Everyone?

Perry, seeking the Republican presidential nomination, spoke to Cavuto on Oct. 25, 2011, the day he’d announced he wanted to offer Americans the choice of continuing to pay taxes under the existing progressive income tax or shifting to a 20-percent flat tax with a few wrinkles.

For people who opt for the flat tax, his plan calls for a standard deduction of $12,500 per individual and dependent in a household and preserves deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations. Perry also proposes to eliminate taxes on estates, certain dividends and capital gains, as well as Social Security benefits. He also wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.

His speech outlining his plan included a claim less sweeping than what he later told Cavuto: ""Taxes will be cut across all income groups in America.""

When we inquired with his campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said an Oct. 31, 2011, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, supports the conclusion that, compared to current law, ""Americans of all income groups are better off under the governor's tax plan.""

She said in another email response: ""Americans across every income group will see a tax cut.""

We’d already consulted the center’s analysis in checking MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow’s claim that under Perry’s plan, the rich would get huge tax cuts while everyone else would see big tax increases. We rated that Mostly False. Rich taxpayers would see sizable cuts, the center’s analysis indicates, but some others -- even low-income taxpayers -- would get tax cuts. Also, no one would be forced into an increase because everyone could continue under the current system.

In a telephone interview, the center’s analyst, Roberton Williams, said the wealthy would enjoy big tax cuts under Perry’s plan because the 20 percent income-tax rate would require considerably less from them than the current maximum tax rate of 35 percent. Also, he noted, exempting capital gains and dividends from the income tax would help wealthier taxpayers. Capital gains and dividend income are currently subject to rates of up to 15 percent.

""These are substantial cuts,"" he said.

Those results aside, he said, ""it is definitely not the case that everyone will get a tax cut.""

The center’s analysis says that compared to current law, Perry’s plan would deliver a tax cut in 2015 of an average $267 to about 25 percent of the nation’s poorest 20 percent of households, with annual earnings up to $19,342. This means three in four of households in this earnings group would not get cuts.

About 45 percent of the next-poorest quintile of households, earning up to $39,862, would get a cut averaging $695, the analysis says. This means 55 percent would not get cuts.

Most Americans earning more would get tax cuts, the analysis suggests.

Compared to current law, Williams said, Americans earning more would fare better under Perry’s plan. At least three in four households earning $39,863 to $69,074 would experience a tax cut, averaging $1,722, with 94 percent or more earning $69,075 to $119,546 seeing cuts averaging $3,872, according to the center’s analysis.
   
The very wealthiest 0.1 percent of households, earning more than $2.87 million a year, would get average tax cuts of more than $1.9 million, the analysis says.

Williams said the center’s definition of current law presumes that tax cuts put in place since 2001 under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will expire after next year, which will happen unless lawmakers intervene.

Frazier told us the Perry plan presumes current tax laws would remain in place until the Perry plan passes into law.

An Oct. 31, 2011, Wall Street Journal news article, states the presumption that the tax reductions put in place will expire means that under Perry’s approach, ""a lot of people would actually face a tax increase compared to current tax levels.""

Frazier, Perry’s spokeswoman, replied to our inquiry about the center’s analysis indicating lower-income Americans would not get a tax cut by echoing Perry’s announcement of his plan: ""Americans in every income group will receive a tax cut.""

True, some households at each quintile of earnings -- from the poorest to richest -- would get tax cuts under Perry’s plan, which promises tax cuts to the vast majority of households annually earning $39,863 or more.

But it’s not the case that no matter where you are, you're going to be getting a tax cut. We rate Perry's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BD44C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/07/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-under-his-tax-plan-everyone-will-b/

Betty Sutton says that on average, 15 U.S. factories close each day
","
With Republicans in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats don’t have the clout they used to.

Hampered in their ability to pass legislation, Ohio Democrats like Betty Sutton of Copley Township are using the bully pulpit of the House of Representatives floor to make points. On Oct. 25, 2011, Sutton and a few of her Democratic colleagues spent a half-hour there sounding off on the topic of job creation and the American dream.

Sutton took aim at companies that have moved jobs overseas, and the policies that she says encouraged that action.

""Many big companies have not created jobs in the U.S. Instead, they’ve taken many of their jobs to countries with the cheapest labor, the least regulations and few employee rights. This flies in the face of the Republicans’ concern that taxes on the rich means fewer jobs,"" she said.

""On that point, every day in the United States, we are losing 15 factories,"" she said. ""Yet here on this House floor, those on the other side of the aisle are content in trying to protect the loopholes that ship jobs overseas.""

Democrats in Washington frequently discuss the nation’s overseas job losses, but PolitiFact Ohio hadn’t before heard a daily factory closure number. So we checked into it.

Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo told PolitiFact that her office used databases from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages to compute the statistic.

The data shows there were 398,887 private manufacturing establishments of all sizes in the United States during the first quarter of 2001. By the end of 2010, the number declined to 342,647, a loss of 56,190 facilities. Over 10 years, that works out to an average yearly loss of 5,619 factories. Dividing that by the 365 days in a year produces a 15.39 average daily number of factories lost.

""The congresswoman has always had a very strong focus on revitalizing our manufacturing base and bringing new jobs to Ohio,"" DeAngelo said. ""Because when you look at problems from the deficit on down, a lot of those problems can be remedied, in large part by rebuilding and revitalizing our manufacturing base.""

Bureau of Labor statistics spokesman Gary Steinberg said Sutton used the correct data to come up with her figure, though her statement would have been more precise if she specified the time period over which the shutdowns occurred.

For example,  the bureau’s statistics show the nation lost 8,660  factories in 2010, which works out to more than 23 each day that year. The rate was similar in 2009. In 2007 and 2008, roughly 1,500 factories shut down annually, which works out to just four daily closures.

DeAngelo said Sutton used the 10-year statistic because it was the most comprehensive number she could find.  And while it might have been better if she cited that time period in her speech, her numbers on factory closures add up.

""It was a good, comprehensive figure that really showed the depth of our manufacturing crisis in this country and the simple fact that we are losing so many factories and so many jobs every single day over a long period of time,"" DeAngelo said.

It’s worth noting that manufacturing is just one segment of the economy, and that other sectors are adding jobs. For example, the Bureau of Labor statistics employment situation summary for September 2011 showed gains in the health care and professional and business services sectors.

Still, a BLS publication called Monthly Labor Review found that manufacturing was one of the hardest hit employment sectors during the last recession, with losses concentrated in the transportation equipment, fabricated metal, machinery, wood product and furniture industries.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Sutton’s claim rates True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3165C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/07/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-says-average-15-us-factories-close-ea/
"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'John Klenke']","
Rep. John Klenke says Wisconsin ranks 48th in venture capital investment
","
These days, there’s one thing politicians of all stripes agree on: Wisconsin needs to add tens of thousands of jobs for the state to emerge from its economic downturn.

Economic development experts say one way to get more people working is to encourage the growth of promising young businesses in high-impact fields such as biotechnology. Those often-risky endeavors can accelerate their growth with a boost from investor ""angels"" and  companies that provide venture capital.

State lawmakers have spent a lot of time in 2011 trying to determine if taxpayer money should be used to boost such companies. The most controversial strategy calls for the use of state certified capital companies, or CAPCOS, that would serve as an investment conduit between the state and the anticipated job-creators.

Millions of dollars are at stake, especially for the firms that would be allowed to use the state money. One proposal called for $500 million to be invested in state firms over the course of six years. That’s 10 times the size of the last state venture capital plan, which had a spotty outcome.

In October, one group of Assembly Republicans, led by Rep. John Klenke (R-Green Bay) pressed ahead with a plan they had been working on all year that included CAPCOs. The lawmakers made the rounds, including to the Journal Sentinel, where they laid out their case to solve what they called the ""capital crisis.""

Klenke argued that the level of venture investment in the state was woefully low, one of the worst in the country. His presentation included a PowerPoint chart with this statement: Wisconsin ranks ""48th out of all 50 states in venture capital investment.""

Well, that would be pretty low.

Do we really stink as a venture capital state? Let’s peel the onion.

First, let’s look briefly at why the idea of including CAPCOs is so controversial, and why those firms have pressed so hard to be included in a Wisconsin program.

Journal Sentinel reporters Kathleen Gallagher and Mark Johnson have investigated the performance of CAPCOs in a previous, much smaller venture capital program. They found that one of the CAPCOs invested only about half of the $16.6 million it got under a Wisconsin program designed in the late 1990s to create jobs, taking advantage of loopholes in what some lawmakers are calling a poorly written, badly monitored law. Some $8 million in state money remains unaccounted for.

Klenke argues that CAPCOs would get money to companies faster and focus more on younger companies than conventional venture investors.

By citing the 48th-place ranking, Klenke makes the need for his plan seem even more urgent.

There’s one problem: He’s wrong.

When Klenke was questioned about his figures by Journal Sentinel reporters, he vigorously defended them. When we asked Klenke -- repeatedly -- about his assertion that Wisconsin ranks third from the bottom, he offered a brief emailed explanation five days later:  ""This was a typo from the slides. It was intended to reference the Kauffman Entrepreneurial Index.""

Oh.

The Kauffman index measures new business creation in the U.S. The report Klenke mentioned was for the period 1996-2010. It does show Wisconsin ranking 48th.

So where do we rank on venture capital?

That information is readily available. The venture capital industry is carefully studied with data broken down by state, dollar amount and so forth. The ""gold standard"" is the quarterly  ""MoneyTree Report"" issued by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the National Venture Capital Association.

In the first nine months of 2011, venture capitalists have invested $66 million in 12 Wisconsin-based companies, making us No. 25 nationally for the amount of venture investing, the report says.

For comparison purposes, California is No. 1 at $10.6 billion, followed by Massachusetts at $2.2 billion. Wisconsin is sandwiched between New Hampshire ($80 million) and New Mexico ($58 million).

John Neis, managing director of Venture Investors LLC, the state’s largest venture capital firm, said the level of venture investing here lags when compared with other factors, such as our population. We’re 18th in that category.

Part of the problem is geographic. Venture capitalists generally like to live near the firms they invest in and help run. Those firms are predominately on the east and west coasts.

Venture capital plays an ""absolutely critical role in a number of key industries,"" including information technology, clean tech and life sciences, Neis said. Those are among the fastest-growing sectors with the highest paying jobs.

For 2010, there was $121 million in venture investments in Wisconsin -- and $84 million went to two companies, Neis said.

As Neis puts it: ""We’re way behind."" But, he also notes there are a dozen states that have no venture capital under management at all.

Our conclusion

Klenke says the Legislature should approve a venture capital plan that includes the use of controversial out-of-state investment firms -- and, to make the case in presentations, he  emphasizes the sorry state of venture capital investing here.

But we’re not 48th of 50, as he claims. He’s overstated our situation, and confused his reports.

"['New Jersey', 'Elections', 'History', 'Redistricting', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie says nearly every governor for more than 48 years has lost seats in the state Legislature during his or her first term
","
Even if nothing changes, Tuesday’s election would be a historic win for Republicans.

Gov. Chris Christie said in a recent radio interview that decades of history show governors lose seats in their first midterm election. But he said this year will be different.

""Over the last 48 years, every governor at the midterm of his first term or her first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003, who was working off a newly gerrymandered map,"" Christie said Oct. 26 on WCBS 880 AM.

Christie said the Republicans face a gerrymandered map this year, ""gerrymandered in favor of the Democrats""

""But despite that we're going to make history. You will not see the Republican party lose seats ... in two weeks. And my prediction is you'll see us gain seats,"" he said.

All 120 seats in the state Legislature are on the line Tuesday. Of those, Democrats hold 71 and Republicans hold 49.

As Tuesday approaches, Christie -- and his party -- have repeated in public speeches and internal memos the claim about historical midterm losses.

PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s true.

Since Richard Hughes, a Democrat, took office in 1962, the governor’s party has lost seats in the Legislature in the governor’s first midterm election. McGreevey, also a Democrat, is the only exception.

Some New Jersey governors faced worse losses than others. William Cahill lost 26 Republican seats in the 1971 election. Fellow Republican Christine Todd Whitman lost two seats in 1995.

In 1991, Republicans gained control of 31 Democratic seats in Jim Florio’s first -- and last -- midterm election. Fellow Democrat Jon Corzine lost one legislative seat to Republicans in 2007 in what would also be his only midterm election.

McGreevey picked up six Democratic seats in the state Legislature in 2003. He was the first governor to gain seats since Robert Meyner, a Democrat, did in the 1950s.

This trend is not unique to New Jersey.

Since Harry Truman became president in 1945, the president has lost seats in Congress in the midterm of his first term, except George W. Bush in 2002.

So what gives?

The public has a somewhat schizophrenic attitude toward politicians, said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.

On one hand the public thinks ""they are all useless, at best,"" he said. On the other hand the public expects ""great things from them. And then there is a disappointment when they’re not able to change the world in two years or four years.""

Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said ""governors typically come in on a wave and when the governor is no longer at the top of the ticket some of the people who were elected during the gubernatorial election might not be as strong."" They ""ride in on somebody’s coattails and then you don’t have the coattails anymore,"" he said.

But, Dworkin said, the Republicans have ""have been downplaying expectations"" and have positioned themselves ""to be able to spin a positive message regardless of what the results are"" on Tuesday. 

""If the Republicans just stay even,"" it’s a victory, he said. But if the Republicans ""win one or two or potentially five or six seats"" between the Senate and Assembly it’s a ""huge, huge victory, even if they don’t take control of the Legislature.""

Our ruling

Christie said for more than 48 years, every governor of New Jersey has lost legislative seats at the midterm of his or her first term, with the exception of McGreevey in 2003.

Besides McGreevey, you have to go back to the the 1950s to find a governor who has picked up legislative seats from his or her party in the first midterm election.

We rate Christie’s statement True.

Rhode Island union official Paul Valletta says big change in predicted mortality rate helped create pension crisis
","
Paul Valletta Jr., president of the Cranston firefighters union, caused a stir during a recent hearing on the proposed pension overhaul plan when he claimed that General Treasurer Gina Raimondo ""cooked the books"" to create Rhode Island’s pension crisis.

Valletta, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island State Association of Fire Fighters and an opponent of Raimondo's proposed reforms, said the general treasurer did it two ways.

The  first was by scaling back the predicted expected rate of return on the state pension fund’s investments, dropping it from 8.25 percent per year to 7.5 percent. (State pension investments have earned 5.74 percent per year over the last 10 years; 1.52 percent per year during the past 5 years.)

The second was by increasing the predicted life expectancy of people in the retirement system. Both changes automatically mean the state needs more money to pay for retirement benefits. In fact, state officials say taxpayers next year will have to contribute $615 million, nearly double this year’s payment, unless the pension system is changed.

We don't predict stock market trends. Instead, we'll stick with the statements Valletta made about the life expectancy issue.

Raimondo, Valletta said, ""raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87.""  Eighty-seven is too high, he contended, because ""if you look at the Social Security mortality rate for the State of Rhode Island . . . it's 78 years old. But when they changed that mortality rate by her actuary in that meeting, they used a 1994 annuity chart"" instead of more recent and more accurate figures.

His comments raise a host of questions.

* Did the state retirement system assume that the life expectancy of state workers was age 65 before Raimondo came along?

* Did she really raise that age by 22 years, to 87, when the federal government pegs the life expectancy at 78 for Rhode Islanders?

* Did the state really use a two-decade old annuity chart to predict life expectancy?

* Did Raimodo make these decisions on her own?

We decided to investigate.

First of all, Valletta is really talking about life expectancy, not mortality rate, which is the number of deaths over a period of time.

We found Social Security data citing a life expectancy of 78.2 years for Rhode Islanders, but those numbers were from 2000. To get more recent statistics, we checked with the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiles all kinds of federal data, including life expectancies by state. Its latest statistics, from 2007, list the life expectancy in Rhode Island as 79.3 years. That's still pretty close to the 78 years cited by Valletta.

But that's the life expectancy for a child born in 2007. Actuaries need to have up-to-date forecasts for people with the same age profile as current and future retirees. (To show how it gets complicated, the 2007 Social Security life table shows that the typical 65-year-old male will live to age 82 but someone who is already 80 will, on average, live to age 88.)

When we asked Raimondo's office about Valletta's allegations, we were directed to the latest actuarial experience study done for the state Employee's Retirement System of Rhode Island. The state retirement board used the study -- based on data through June 30, 2010 -- when it adjusted the life expectancies of workers and retirees in April 2011.

The report from Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company says the actuaries started with a 1994 actuarial table, but the study also makes it clear that the table was only a starting point.

The actuaries then adjusted life expectancies based on gender and job (women and retired teachers tend to live longer than the typical male state worker).

The expectancies were further adjusted upward by 10 to 20 percent to insure that the pension fund has a cushion to cover costs, especially at a time when life expectancy is increasing. Then the estimates were compared with actual death rates to see whether further adjustments were needed.

According to the latest report, especially a key chart on page 28, the initial adjustments weren't enough.

For example, the state actuaries projected that the typical male teacher would live to age 84.8. That turned out to be very, very close to what was actually happening, based on the retirement system’s data.

From 2000 to 2006, the actual life expectancy was 83.9 years and from 2004-2010 it was 1.2 years higher -- 85.1 years. The report recommended ratcheting up the life expectancy for that group to 85.7 years.

You can see the actual numbers in this chart, calculated for those who retired at age 65.. 
  
  
Joseph P. Newton, the actuary for the retirement board, emphasized this in followup testimony before the joint Senate and House Finance Committees on Nov. 1.

""When a baby is born, [he or she] will live [on average] 78 years. We don't care because we want to measure when people are receiving pension checks, and they [typically] start receiving pension checks at 65,"" he said. ""When we say the life expectancy we're using is 87, it's for a 65 year old, somebody who has already made it from zero to 65. So now they're expected to live to 87.""

Newton said that, based on the April vote of the retirement board, the state is now using 2000 projections instead of a 1994 actuarial table.

We asked Valletta about Newton’s figures. He said he stands by his statement and believes the state should be using the Social Security life expectancy.

He said he understands how the state actuaries calculated their estimate ""but I don't agree with it. . . . I don't buy these actuary reports. . . . Whatever numbers they need to get to, they can find a way to get to.""

Our ruling

Union official Paul Valletta said General Treasurer Gina Raimondo created the pension crisis when she, in part, used an outdated annuity chart and ""raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87"" even though life expectancy (as calculated by Social Security) is actually 78.

First, the life expectancy for state workers wasn't 65 when the vote to raise it was taken. It was 82 to 88 (depending on the group).

Second, the board didn't bump the life expectancy up by 22 years. It increased it by 0.3 to 1.1 years, depending on the group, to provide a funding cushion in case life expectancies continue to go up.

Finally, Raimondo didn’t make that decision on her own. She was one vote on the 15-member retirement board, which she chairs. (The board voted 9-6 last April to approve the new life expectancies and lower the expected rate of return on the pension fund’s investment. Only one of the seven public employee representatives voted in the majority.)

Valletta's statement includes a grain of truth -- a 1994 actuarial table was previously used in the calculations and 78 years is close to the Social Security estimates for overall life expectancy for the entire state. But he has omitted crucial facts and chooses to disbelieve the actual data that leads to a very different conclusion.

We rate his statement Mostly False.

Rick Perry says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights
","
On Fox News Sunday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights. 
""You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative,"" Perry told Chris Wallace on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has ""always been pro-life,"" while Romney has ""been on both sides"" of that issue. 
""He’s been ... pro-abortion,"" Perry said. 
Perry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade ""before he was against"" it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman's body. 
So, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights? 
For another fact-check, PolitiFact National looked into that question. 
Romney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position: 
•  In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" He added: ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice."" 
•  In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard."" 
Those comments — made in public forums eight years apart — struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter. 
What about his views today? 
The ""issues"" portion of his website doesn’t have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an op-ed that was posted on the National Review’s website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The pledge includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint ""pro-life"" candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers. 
In the op-ed, Romney wrote: ""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood."" 
Romney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law ""to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion"" and ""appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written."" 
Our ruling 
Romney’s views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed.

Vin Gopal targeted in GOP attack ad for New Jersey Assembly District 11
","
Dirty politics is nothing new in the art of campaigning, especially in the final days running up to an election.

But sometimes, those dirty tactics reach the point of utter filth.

Take the case of an attack ad by the New Jersey Republican State Committee against 11th District Assembly candidate Vin Gopal. Democrats Gopal and Kathleen Horgan are challenging Republican incumbents Caroline Casagrande and Mary Pat Angelini for the seats to represent parts of Monmouth County.

""Corrupt Political Bosses. Money Laundering. Fraud. It’s Just Another Day At The Office For Vin Gopal,"" reads a campaign mailer circulating in the district.

The ad shows a $100 bill hanging from a clothesline and features Star-Ledger headlines from articles about former Assemblyman Joseph Vas, who was sentenced to 6 ½ years in prison for stealing affordable housing funds when he was Perth Amboy’s mayor and for committing federal election fraud. From February to June 2006 -- when he was a 20-year-old political science student -- Gopal was a campaign manager for Vas during his primary campaign for congress. The ad also shows a washing machine with money inside and a statement below it that reads ""To you, this might look like someone illegally laundering money … To Vin Gopal, it looks like Pay Day!""

The ad seems to imply that Gopal had a connection to Vas and his criminal activities, but does not accuse Gopal of any criminal act.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that readers of the ad could infer improprieties by Gopal, but there’s no proof that he did anything wrong.

One of the article headlines shown in the ad reads ""Aide to former Perth Amboy Mayor Joseph Vas pleads guilty to money laundering.""

Gopal, a Long Branch resident and business owner, said what bothers him most about the ad ""is the implying and lying that I was that aide.""

We pulled the Star-Ledger article and found that the aide in question was Raymond Geneske, who was a campaign adviser to Vas. Geneske was sentenced in January to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine for participating in a scheme to funnel contributions to Vas’s congressional campaign. Gopal, who told us that he was never contacted by any law enforcement agency or official about Vas, is not mentioned in the article.

We checked further by running Gopal’s name through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records database covering federal courts and bankruptcies and found that he was never charged with a crime. The Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office said it had never heard of Gopal and the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office confirmed that Gopal had no connection to the Vas case.

""The (Republican) State Committee is not suggesting Mr. Gopal committed a crime,"" Communications Director Rick Gorka said in an email. ""Rather, it is suggesting that he had a front row seat for the corruption that plagues New Jersey's political process. The fact is, Mr. Gopal, a career political operative, was the campaign manager of Vas for Congress, a campaign of a sitting State Legislator who was at the center of federal and state corruption investigations and charges. He was paid from Joe Vas’s campaign account.

""Indeed, as the campaign manager he was presumably responsible for expenditures from that account,"" Gorka continued. ""If he didn't know where the money was coming from, he should have. In the past he has been proud of his association with that campaign, touting it in his bio when he was deputy campaign manager for the short-live Kucinich for President Campaign. Now he's seeking to run away from it. The State Committee thinks the voters have a right to know about Vin Gopal's connections to those sordid events.""

A ""career political operative?""

Gopal, 26, became involved with the Vas campaign when he was a 20-year-old student at Pennsylvania State University majoring in political science and wanted to work on a campaign for class credit and to gain experience in politics. Gopal told us he applied to 20 campaigns and eventually went to work as a campaign manager for the Vas campaign. He had also worked on other campaigns. Vlad Gutman, campaign manager for the District 11 Democrats, said that although Gopal had the title of campaign manager with Vas, he managed no personnel and ""was the most junior position"" on staff.

""I would talk to the press briefly about events he (Vas) would do in a day, set up phones, work with volunteers, handle scheduling,"" Gopal said of his responsibilities. ""I never had anything to do with money, never saw money, never was at any fundraisers.""

Gopal said he learned about the case against Vas when he saw a newspaper article about it two years after leaving the campaign, and attributes the current spate of attack ads to what he called ""desperation.""

""The things they’re doing are borderline slanderous,"" Gopal said. ""It’s unethical. They’re lying and misleading the public in every way possible to hide their failed actions in this district.""

Our ruling

The Republican state committee distributed an ad in the 11th Assembly District that links Gopal to Vas, a disgraced politician convicted of election fraud and other offenses. Gopal worked four months on Vas’ unsuccessful congressional campaign. Gopal dealt with scheduling, phone banks, volunteers and occasional media queries. Given that law enforcement and a public database all confirm that Gopal had no connection of any kind to the Vas criminal case, the implications made by the ad aren’t just ridiculous, they’re also outrageous. Some laundering is definitely needed because this claim is Pants on Fire!

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney said repealing 'Obamacare' would save $95 billion in 2016
","
Mitt Romney has recently been emphasizing one of the favorite themes of the tea party movement: cutting government spending.

He’s been getting pretty specific about some of his ideas, both in an op-ed in USA Today and in speeches on the campaign trail. His plans include ending subsidies for Amtrak, stopping funding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and eliminating foreign aid to countries ""that oppose America’s interests.""

He also wants to save money by rolling back President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.

He made the point in the USA Today op-ed, suggesting he would  ""repeal ObamaCare, which would save $95 billion in 2016.""

We were surprised by his suggestion. As we remembered the health care negotiations, Democrats took pains to make sure the 2010 health care law was projected to reduce the deficit, and they bragged repeatedly about their numbers.

We contacted the Romney campaign, which referred us to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agency that independently calculates the cost of laws proposed by both parties.

In February 2011, the CBO published an analysis of a Republican measure to fully repeal the health care law. The analysis was for H.R. 2, ""the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act,"" a simple repeal bill that House Republicans approved on Jan. 19, 2011.

Keep in mind, though, that repealing the health care law doesn’t only cut spending. The law had many moving parts, some of which were revenue sources to offset the spending and reduce the overall federal deficit.

The law spent money on providing tax subsidies to help people buy insurance and by expanding the Medicaid health insurance for the very poor.

But it offset those additional costs by slowing the growth of future spending on Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans over age 65.

And, it generated revenues for the government by creating new excise taxes on high-cost health insurance plans (the ""Cadillac"" plans); adding new Medicare taxes on people with high incomes; and charging new fees to health insurance companies and health care manufacturers.

In other words, if you fully repeal the law, you would also be repealing things that reduce the deficit, such as cost reductions and higher taxes.

Romney cited a reduction of $95 billion in 2016, but that number only counts what the law spends that year. Most of the spending is for subsidizing coverage for the uninsured.

That same year, the law also is projected to raise revenues of $78 billion, largely through new taxes on the wealthy and new fees on the health care industry.

So according to the CBO analysis, a full repeal of the bill would reduce the deficit by $16 billion in 2016, much less than the number Romney cited.

And then there’s the broader picture: When the CBO looked at the first 10 years of repeal, from 2012 to 2021, it found that repeal added $210 billion to the deficit. So the deficit would actually be lower if the law is not repealed.

Finally, we should note that a repeal of the law would not necessarily be ""easy. ""Romney would need to have solid Republican majorities in Congress, including 60 members in the Senate to block filibusters.

If Romney had only criticized the law as an expansion of government spending, he would have been on firmer ground. Instead, he asserted that a repeal of the law would save significant money -- $95 billion. In fact, the law included new taxes and cost reductions so that the actual savings for the year he cited would be much smaller -- $16 billion. And, over the long haul, repealing the law actually adds significantly to the deficit. So we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966CEB40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/04/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-repealing-obamacare-would-save-95/
"['Oregon', 'Elections', 'Jefferson Smith']","
If elected, would Jefferson Smith really be the first Portland mayor to live east of 82nd?
","
In his bid to be Portland’s next mayor, Jefferson Smith has taken a decidedly populist tack, stressing, among other things, his connection to east Portland.

""Portland needs to finally meet its promises to struggling people – to communities of color, folks east of 82nd, and families being priced out of their neighborhoods,"" he says on his campaign website. ""Portlanders need a government that looks out for their needs – no matter where they live.""

In a recent press release he took up the theme again, this time announcing that if elected, he’d ""be the first Mayor who lives east of 82nd.""

It’s a claim made to symbolize his understanding of under-served communities -- and a fact that seems to be begging for a check.

First, we needed a little history lesson in terms of Portland’s boundaries. Prior to the 1900s, Portland didn’t stretch east past the Willamette River, according to a map of city annexations from the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability.

In the early 1900s, the city started edging east slowly, and by the 1980s, Portland began growing past 82nd Avenue in earnest.

That is all to say that there’s not much sense in going back any further than Terry Schrunk, who served as mayor from 1957 until 1973. The area east of 82nd wasn’t part of Portland until shortly after his tenure.

We called up Smith’s campaign to see if it could back up its claim. Campaign workers called back with a list of general areas in which the current mayor and his most recent seven predecessors lived (that goes back to Schrunk).

According to their list, they were right. Of course, we wouldn’t be worth much if we just took people at their word. So, we took their list and went to the City of Portland Archives and Records Center.

There, we went mayor by mayor and -- thanks to the staff there -- were able to get a reliable address for each of the pertinent mayors:

Schrunk, according to the city’s 1972 Annual Financial Report, lived at 5407 N. Houghton St.

Neil Goldschmidt, who served from 1973 until 1979, lived at 4011 N.E. 23rd Avenue, according to the city’s 1975 Annual Financial Report.

Connie McCready, who served from 1979 until 1981, lived at 2407 N.E. 27th Avenue. This was the address listed in the two reports cited above, during which time she was a commissioner, as well as in the 1979 Portland Directory.

Frank Ivancie, who served from 1981 to 1985, lived at 2732 N.E. Thompson St. This was the address reported in the financial reports and backed up by the 1980-81 Portland Directory.

Bud Clark, mayor from 1985 to 1993, lived at 2522 N.W. Northrup St., according to the 1985 Portland Directory.

Vera Katz, 1993 until 2005, lived at 2068 N.W. Johnson St., according to Statements of Organization the city has from when she filed to run, both in 1996 and in 2002.

Tom Potter, who served from 2005 until 2009, lived and still lives on Southeast 41st Avenue, according to a Summary Statement of Contributions and Expenditures he filed in December 2004.

And Sam Adams, our current mayor, lives on North McClellan Street, according to voting and assessor records.

Smith, for his part, lives east of Interstate 205 on Northeast Pacific Street, according to voting and campaign records.

All of this is to say that Smith was right on. If Portlanders select him as their next mayor, he’ll be the first to reside east of 82nd Avenue. We give this claim a True.

Sen. Alan Hays says proof of citizenship isn't necessary to register to vote
","
Florida state Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatilla, ignited a firestorm of criticism when he said congressional districts should not be drawn to benefit potentially illegal Hispanic immigrants and that the state should first check their citizenship.

Here's what Hays said at an Oct. 18, 2011, meeting of the Senate reapportionment committee:

""Before we design a district anywhere in the state of Florida for Hispanic voters, we need to ascertain that they are citizens of the United States. We all know there are many Hispanic speaking people in Florida that are not legal, and I just don't think that it's right that we try to draw a district that encompasses people that really have no business voting anyhow. If we know registered voters are people who have proven their citizenship then that's a completely different story, but I'm not aware of any proof of citizenship necessary before you register to vote.""

Reapportionment is a once-in-a-decade process that divides the U.S. House's 435 seats among the states based on the results of the U.S. census. In 2012, Florida will add two new congressional seats as part of that realignment. It's up to Hays and the other members of the state House and Senate to redraw the maps to include the two new seats.

What Hays might have been getting at in his comments (we don't know for sure because his spokesman said he didn't want to comment) is that the census attempts to include all people living in the United States, including illegal immigrants, children and legal immigrants who cannot vote. So while some people are talking about a proposal to draw a Hispanic-majority congressional district in Central Florida -- an area that has seen considerable growth in the Puerto Rican population -- Hays was at least suggesting it was possible that many people living there might be doing so illegally. Therefore, according to his thinking, they should not have a seat drawn to benefit them.

We'll get one thing out of the way: People from Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens and have been since 1917. If they're living in Florida, they are eligible to vote in Florida.

But what about the requirements to register to vote? Hays said you don't need to prove that you're a citizen in order to cast a ballot.

That's what this Truth-O-Meter item will focus on.

Registering to vote

Floridians can register to vote a variety of ways -- but the most common registration method is at driver's license offices. In 2010, more than 270,000 people registered to vote at driver's license offices. The second-most common method was what the state division of elections calls the ""other"" category, which includes registering in person at supervisors of elections offices.

The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, better known as the Motor-Voter law, went into effect in 1995 in Florida and was intended to boost turnout by allowing residents to register to vote at driver's license offices, other federally designated voter registration agencies and by mail.

The national law does not address the question of proof of citizenship, but each state has its own laws about registration requiring that only citizens vote, according to Bryan Whitener, a spokesman for the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.

In Florida when drivers apply for a driver's license, they must provide proof that they are in the country legally. U.S. citizens could show a passport or a proper birth certificate to verify their citizenship. Immigrants who are not U.S. citizens would have to provide the proper visa.

Applicants who prove they are citizens are asked if they want to apply to register to vote, said Ann Howard, spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The driver's license office then sends along that voter registration application to the Secretary of State. Applicants who are not citizens are not given the option to register to vote, Howard said.

But non-citizens may still obtain a driver's licenses if they are in the country legally -- including immigrants who have green cards, Howard said. The documentation requirements to get driver's licenses have been tightened as part of the Real ID Act implemented in Florida in 2010 as part of a nationwide effort to tighten the security of driver's licenses and state IDs to fight terrorism. This state website about the Real ID Act explains the criteria for citizens and non-citizens to get driver's licenses. By December 2017, everyone in the U.S. will need a license that is compliant with the Real ID Act in order to fly or enter federal facilities.

But what if someone walks into a supervisor of elections office and asks to register to vote?

In those cases, people registering to vote must sign an oath on a registration application attesting that they are qualified to vote and that all the information on the application is true. (Usually at driver's licenses offices applicants who want to apply to register to vote don't have to sign that particular form since the office already has their signature as part of the driver's license application process.)

The application includes a question: Are you a citizen of the United States? If you answer no, the form says ""you cannot register to vote.""

We asked state Division of Elections spokesman Chris Cate if the state does anything to verify citizenship.

""The answer is no,"" he said. ""The law doesn't require someone to provide proof of citizenship when they register. If they swear, attest and sign under oath that their information is accurate and that they are a citizen we will accept their voter registration.""

State law does not require any new voter applicant to provide proof or evidence of eligibility other than a sworn statement that he or she satisfies all the requirements to be able to register -- including being a citizen (or being 18, or living in Florida), Cate told us in an e-mail. The only information that is required to be verified is a personal identifying number such as a driver's license number or state ID or the last four digits of their social security number. It's possible for non-citizens to have those documents, and the purpose of providing them is to verify identity -- not citizenship.

A person who willfully submits false voter registration information or votes knowing that he or she isn't qualified to vote can be charged with a third-degree felony.

Individual supervisors of elections do have the ability to determine if an applicant is an U.S. citizen, Cate said, though it would be difficult for a supervisor to ascertain citizenship. 
Leon County Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho said the state doesn't ""forbid any election official from determining the eligibility of any voter -- that is the role of any supervisor of elections. The state has no requirement for checking citizenship and there is no easy way to do it since the INS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) is not available to do any checking.""

But Sancho said the idea that illegal residents are voting is ""laughable it's so wrong.""

""We are not seeing any problem with illegal citizens voting in the U.S. anywhere, not just in Tallahassee or Florida. It's a canard that illegal individuals are registering and voting. ... Voting requires putting your name and address on an official document and that is not something undocumented individuals tend to do.""

The local elections supervisor in Hays' own district, Lake County, sees it the same way.

""We've never had a problem with illegal voting in Lake County, no way,'' said Emogene W. Stegall, who has served in the county's election's office for 40 years.

Cate said the state doesn't track how many times non-citizens attempt to, or actually manage to, register to vote.

Our ruling

Sen. Hays said that Florida doesn't require ""any proof of citizenship necessary before you register to vote."" There is a kernel of truth here: According to the state Division of Elections, state law doesn't require new voter applicants to prove their citizenship in some physical sense. They simply must sign a sworn statement attesting that they meet the voting requirements -- including being a citizen.

But there are a couple of critical caveats.

First, willfully lying on a voter registration form about your citizenship status can lead to a felony conviction. Second, the most common way to register to vote in Florida is during the process of obtaining a driver's license -- in 2010, 57 percent of those who registered to vote in Florida chose that method. And during that process, people are asked to verify their citizenship.

Lastly, we have to consider the experiences of two actual supervisor of elections, who said there is no widespread problem of illegal immigrants registering to vote.

For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C19FB80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/04/alan-hays/sen-alan-hays-says-proof-citizenship-isnt-necessar/
"['County Government', 'Legal Issues', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin Association for Justice']","
Wisconsin Association for Justice says a state bill would end a requirement that local governments repair roads and prevent injured citizens from suing
","
As the 2011 Wisconsin Legislature neared completion of its work, a group of trial lawyers attacked a batch of Republican-sponsored legislation it contends will ""erase basic rights."" 
The Wisconsin Association for Justice -- formerly the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers -- railed against limits on attorneys fees in consumer cases, and immunity for doctors and drug makers in injury cases. 
We previously ruled Mostly True a health care advocate's claim that one of the bills ""grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products."" 
This time we’ll examine the trial lawyers’ claim in an Oct. 31, 2011, news release regarding Senate Bill 125/Assembly Bill 180.

The group said the proposal ""makes local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law, and injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages … The state law has been in place for 162 years.""

That sounds like a major change of lanes. Let’s pop the hood.

First, a bit of history.

Over several decades, it’s become much tougher for citizens in Wisconsin to sue and win when claiming negligence by their local units of government.

How much tougher?

In a 2009 Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion, Justice David Prosser, a former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said that ""so far as government responsibility for torts is concerned, immunity has become the rule and liability has become the rare exception.""

""Justice,"" wrote Prosser, ""has been confined to a crawl space too narrow for most tort victims to fit.""

Generally speaking, except in cases involving unheeded warnings over dangers involving actions they absolutely should have taken, public agencies are shielded from liability. That’s because of state laws and court rulings.

A notable and longstanding exception to that -- under a state ""highway defects"" law dating to 1849, a year after statehood -- allows up to $50,000 in civil damages when highways and sidewalks are poorly maintained and lead to vehicle damage or bodily injury.

The bill up for debate would eliminate nearly all of that statute. Local governments have sought this for years, hoping to avoid what they see as the ""automatic"" liability for defects, and get more discretion over when and how to do highway repairs -- as state officials have. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed a previous attempt.

Here’s what’s unique about the defective highways statute (893.83): Plaintiffs don’t have to clear the high legal bar they would in winning a case against the government over other mistakes.

They don’t have to show government had an absolute duty to do the specific thing in dispute -- that duty is presumed under that existing law.

Notably, the law creates a ""right to recover"" damages from government.

Many of the cases are routinely settled before getting to court -- that’s how strong the law is.

If the cases reach trial, jurors have to decide if damages stemmed from known road defects -- and whether the municipality kept the highway ""reasonably safe for public travel,"" according to jury instructions in place since 1974.

""With winter conditions, it’s awfully difficult to make sure highways are maintained every second, every hour of every day,"" said Andrew Phillips, a lawyer representing the Wisconsin Counties Association. Counties do most of the highway work.

He’s talking about potholes and defective shoulders, among other things -- problems that have been litigated all the way to the state’s highest courts.

The money stakes are not sky high, but significant: over a decade, counties served by Wisconsin County Mutual Insurance paid out $950,000 in these cases. That doesn’t include all counties, or other municipalities.

Let’s turn back to the statement.

Asked about its claims, the Association for Justice pointed us to the text of the bill.

The bill would eliminate the liability provisions except for damages resulting from the accumulation of snow or ice that has existed on a highway for at least three weeks. The chief backers of the bill, the Wisconsin Counties Association, acknowledge that.

So would that mean citizens could ""no longer sue"" and locals would not have a duty to repair, as the association claimed?

They couldn’t sue under the highway defects statute -- but still could file a claim under a more general state law, according to Phillips, the lawyer for the counties group. Even Ann Jacobs, a personal injury lawyer speaking for the Association for Justice -- the group making the claim -- agreed.

The two sides also agree localities’ legal exposure would drop if the more general state law (893.80) was the only route for plaintiffs.

The bottom line: People could still sue, though under less favorable circumstances from the complainant’s viewpoint. The ultimate effect would be decided by judges.

What about the second part of the claim? Would the bill eliminate the requirement that local governments repair roads?

Jacobs, of the trial lawyers’ group, says it effectively does because enforcement of that duty would all but disappear without the specific liability statute.

""What good is a right without a remedy?"" Jacobs asked.

Even the counties’ attorney, Phillips, acknowledges that county decisions on when and how to repair highways would be more discretionary with the strict liability gone.

The Association for Justice, at a public hearing on the bill, made that point using this language: ""Local governments would not have a general duty to maintain highways and bridges"" if the bill passed.

But in its public news release, the group’s claim went well past that -- leaving readers to believe road repairs would no longer be required.

Phillips pointed us to Chapter 83.025 of state statutes: ""The county trunk system shall be marked and maintained by the county."" And for towns, 82.03: ""The town board shall have the care and supervision of all highways under the town's jurisdiction.""

So the locals still would have the obligation to repair.

Let’s patch this up and move on.

A trial lawyers group contends that a bill would change a 162-year-old state law to ""make local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law."" It continued: ""Injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages.""

The bill could have a big impact on local government liability for highway problems, though just how dramatic remains to be seen.

But the group’s news release went too far in flatly claiming citizens could no longer sue, and asserting that highway repairs would no longer be required.

We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970242C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/04/wisconsin-association-justice/wisconsin-association-justice-says-state-bill-woul/

Does Portland really have 84 PR people on staff?
","
Nobody likes hearing about government waste -- especially not when lawmakers spend most of their time talking about which programs to cut. So, naturally, we read with interest the Taxpayer Association of Oregon's Fall 2011 ""Government Waste Watch Report.""

We weren’t a paragraph in and already something had caught our attention. The report noted that ""The City of Portland alone has 84 public relation representatives on payroll, which cost taxpayers over $6.2 million.""

The Oregonian had just published a story pegging the number of state employees working in communications at 125, or 220 if you include managers and people in design shops.

Sure, Portland is the state’s largest city by far, but 84 for the city alone?

The report cited the source for the number as a Willamette Week story from May. We did some googling and found the original article. Just a few paragraphs in and you get the salient info:

""There are a lot of them (public relations employees) — 94 in the Portland area — and their paychecks add up to nearly $7 million a year … these public-relations  people work for the City of Portland, Metro, Portland Public Schools, Multnomah County, the Port of Portland, Portland State University, TriMet and Oregon Health & Science University.""

Just a couple sentences further and the writer, James Pitkin, addresses Portland specifically: ""The biggest PR team belongs to the City of Portland. It spends $2.1 million paying its 28 PR people.""

That’s sizable, but it’s hardly the 84 that the Taxpayer Association cited in its critique.

Willamette Week also posted a list of the folks that they identified as being on the payroll in communications positions. We called Portland’s Bureau of Human Resources to see if we could confirm the names.

The Bureau sent us a copy of a public records request dated July 14, 2011 that listed 25 employees. We reconciled the two lists and found that Willamette Week included the Portland Development Commission, bumping their figure of 28 employees. With the PDC, their salaries were closer to $2.1 million, not $6 million.

We called the Taxpayer Association to see what was up. Jason Williams, the executive director, said the mistake was theirs. While typing up the newsletter, they confused the city’s figures with the Portland-area figures.

Still, he said, even 28 public relations employees was too many. ""Eighty-four is even too much even for the whole state. If government is doing its job, it doesn't need a press agent.""

The fact that Williams admitted their mistake gets the association some brownie points, but it doesn’t change the fact that they were misinforming the 10,000 people who receive their watch reports. And it doesn’t change our ruling.

We give this claim a False.

Are statistics in the Occupied Wall Street Journal correct?
","
To back up their complaints about economic injustice, protesters taking part in the demonstrations in New York's Financial District in New York have been handing out the Occupied Wall Street Journal. 
""Our system is broken,"" said an Oct. 5, 2011, article headlined ""The Revolution Begins at Home: An Open Letter to Join the Wall Street Occupation,"" which was also posted here. ""More than 25 million Americans are unemployed. More than 50 million live without health insurance. Perhaps 100 million live in poverty. Yet the fat cats are showered with billions in tax breaks while politicians compete to turn the screws on the rest of us."" 
We wondered if the article’s numbers were accurate. We’ll take them one by one: 
""More than 25 million Americans are unemployed."" This is nearly double the government's official number. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted almost 14 million unemployed Americans in September 2011. This is the number that’s used to calculate the official unemployment rate of 9.1 percent. 
But some critics have long argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting, since it doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job. So BLS also offers an alternative measure (known to economists as ""U-6"") that factors in both groups. 
Using this measure, BLS in September 2010 found an additional 2.5 million Americans who are ""marginally attached"" to the labor force, meaning they’d be ready to work if a job became available, and another 9.3 million Americans who are working part time but who would prefer a full-time job. 
Together, these three categories added up to 25.8 million people in September 2011, for a total ""U-6"" rate of 16.5 percent, or well above the official unemployment rate. 
That’s in line with what the article said -- but only if you consider ""unemployed"" to mean ""unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force, or working only part-time for economic reasons."" And while there are good reasons for looking at the ""U-6"" rate when discussing the current jobs picture, ""U-6"" is not the official definition of ""unemployed."" 
""More than 50 million live without health insurance."" The article nailed this one just about perfectly. The most recent U.S. Census Bureau study, ""Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010,"" found that 49.9 million Americans were uninsured in 2010, or 16.3 percent of the population. 
""Perhaps 100 million live in poverty."" The article hedges its claim by saying ""perhaps,"" but you still have to stretch the official definition of poverty quite a bit to make the number work. 
According to the same Census Bureau report -- ""Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010"" -- there were 46.2 million Americans below the poverty line in 2010, or 15.1 percent of the population. That's less than half the 100 million claim in the article. 
However, some critics have long questioned whether the official poverty line is set too low. So the Census Bureau also calculates the number of Americans whose incomes put them at various multiples of the poverty line -- people, in other words, who are poor but not officially impoverished. 
These numbers show that 60.4 million Americans are at 125 percent of the poverty line, 75.3 million are at 150 percent of the poverty line, and 103.6 million Americans -- or just over one-third -- are at twice the poverty line. 
So to get to 100 million Americans, the article would have to count people who are at roughly twice the official poverty level. Most people would agree that these people are in a low-income category. But according to official government statistics, they are not ""in poverty."" 
Our ruling 
The numbers in the Occupied Wall Street Journal rely on the broadest definitions of economic deprivation in America, but they are at odds with official government statistical definitions. While the number for the uninsured is essentially correct, the indicators for unemployment and poverty refer to broader, alternative measures that have some usefulness in policy discussions but that aren’t accurately described by the terminology in the article. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FAD840>],/factchecks/2011/oct/11/occupied-wall-street-journal/are-statistics-occupied-wall-street-journal-correc/

Mayor admits error on Beltline connection claim
","
Ah, deadlines.

For many, they bring panic. In one current case among metro Atlanta elected officials, a coming deadline has resulted in some attempted horse-trading and an interesting 11th-hour debate.

County commissioners and mayors across the 10-county region are attempting to finalize a list by Oct. 15 of transportation projects that area residents will vote on next year, along with a 1 percent sales tax to fund those projects. One area they’re debating is a proposal to spend about $602 million on transit projects along the Atlanta Beltline.

Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed wrote an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution arguing for money for the effort, which is located in the city limits and he argues will benefit the region. Sandy Springs Mayor Eva Galambos countered in a separate op-ed in the AJC that the $602 million should be spent on other projects that will better serve the region.

""These are worthy purposes for the city of Atlanta, but they are not related to relieving the Atlanta region’s traffic congestion,"" Galambos wrote, referring to the Beltline. ""A close examination of the Beltline website map reveals an astounding fact: Not a single segment of the proposed Beltline intersects the MARTA system at MARTA stations.""

An astounding fact! Such a claim seemed ideal for PolitiFact Georgia.

The Atlanta Beltline is a 22-mile loop of largely unused railroad tracks that circle around the core of Georgia’s capital city. Atlanta political and business leaders embraced a Georgia Tech graduate student’s suggestion to make better use of those lines and began an effort several years ago to build more homes, office space, parks and trails and construct a light-rail line along the Beltline. The effort is expected to take at least another decade before it is completed.

Beltline spokesman Ethan Davidson sent us an e-mail contending that Galambos was wrong.

""This is absolutely false ... the Atlanta Beltline corridor will have at least three additional connections to MARTA at the following areas: Lindbergh/Armour, Inman Park/Reynoldstown and West End/Oakland City,"" Davidson wrote.

He also sent us a YouTube video by the Beltline that says the Beltline environmental impact study area intersects with six MARTA stations. The study area extends a quarter-mile east and west of the Beltline’s existing and former rail lines.

We looked at the same Beltline map that Galambos referred to when we talked to her. We spotted two MARTA stations that seemed to connect to the Beltline: Inman Park/Reynoldstown and Lindbergh Center.

Davidson explained that there are plans to connect the Beltline to the West End/Oakland City station.

""[The Beltline] doesn’t work if it doesn’t connect to MARTA. … That’s the whole point of it,"" Davidson said.

In response to what we found, and the Beltline’s argument, Galambos told us that the Lindbergh Center station did connect with the Beltline. Galambos admitted she erred in not saying the Beltline connects with the Lindbergh station.

""That one is on the map,"" she said of Lindbergh.

The mayor said her point about the Lindbergh MARTA station is that connecting it to the Beltline there won’t help more people across the region to get around.

""In terms of service, I didn’t word it correctly,"" Galambos told us. ""In terms of additional connectivity, we’re not getting any.""

Galambos admitted she made a mistake by writing that the Beltline doesn’t intersect MARTA at any of its stations. We thank her for her honesty. Still, her article went off the tracks on that point. We must give her a rating of False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D3B840>],/factchecks/2011/oct/11/eva-galambos/mayor-admits-error-beltline-connection-claim/

Did Amanda Fritz persuade the Portland City Council to save water ratepayers $500 million?
","
Correction appended: An earlier version of the story incorrectly stated that the switch to UV had not saved ratepayers any money. The error does not change the ruling. 
Portland commissioner Amanda Fritz, running for another term, is proud that in her first year in office, she came out against a recommendation by the Water Bureau to build an expensive direct filtration system. Instead, she supported was to build a cheaper ultraviolet system that would zap cryptosporidium from the city’s drinking water.

""In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water,"" Fritz writes on her campaign literature. ""I partnered with neighborhood and business advocates to get this done by arranging for a Council work session and public hearing, where citizens made clear that the less expensive option is more responsible. The result was a unanimous vote reversing the Water Bureau’s previous plan.""

We here at PolitiFact Oregon take these campaign claims seriously. Was it true that Fritz had single-handedly, with citizen support and a public hearing, persuaded the City Council to go against a recommendation by the Water Bureau? And did she in fact save ratepayers $500 million?

Portland gets its drinking water pretty much untouched from the Bull Run watershed east of the city. It’s delicious and clean and we’re all very proud of it. However, we’re also under orders from the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the water we drink, following a cryptosporidius outbreak that killed at least 69 people in 1993 in Wisconsin.

That means we need to do something about the open reservoirs where we store some of our drinking water and we have to treat against cryptosporidium, even though the last time we found any was in 2002.

All the city commissioners think the federal mandate is unnecessary. But they’ve made plans to comply even as they seek a way out of some of the conditions. In 2009, the Water Bureau recommended meeting the cryptosporidium criteria with a $385 million filtration system that they argued would cost more, but be more versatile and forward-thinking in the end.

Groups such as Friends of the Reservoirs and beer makers Rob and Kurt Widmer lobbied against the filtration system. They argued that if anything had to be done, why not opt for ultraviolet light, which would be cheaper to build at $100 million.

City Council meeting records show that  Fritz, along with commissioners Dan Saltzman and Nick Fish, voiced concerns about the cost. But Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees water, backed his staff, and at City Hall, it’s considered bad form to go against the commissioner in charge.

Fritz and Saltzman went on record as opposed to Leonard. As the council vote neared, Leonard realized he didn’t have Fish either. Leonard agreed to go with UV, saying that he doesn’t think anybody ""has ever accused me of being a bad vote counter.""

So is it fair for Fritz to hog the leadership limelight? We asked the two commissioners who also expressed doubts about filtration. They said it was absolutely fair. ""She kind of pushed it; she called the question. It’s an accurate claim, for what it’s worth,"" Saltzman said.

Fish said Fritz and Saltzman were on the same page, but, ""I think she was the one who was the most outspoken on this one. Ultimately, she persuaded me that UV was the right way to go and … I became the third vote on UV.""

Fritz doesn’t have a lot of high-profile scores on her record as she defends her seat against Mary Nolan. So we can see why she talks about this ""money save"" a lot. On her city office blog, Fritz wrote Aug. 22 that ""citizens pushed successfully to save $500 million in 2009, with my leadership inside City Hall …"" In an April 15 re-election email to reporters, she said she felt ""privileged to have been in the position in the first half of my term to save Portland ratepayers $500 million on water rates …""

And in a 2010 profile, she relays this anecdote to then-Willamette Week reporter Beth Slovic:
  
""I went home that evening having gotten this 5-0 vote,"" Fritz recalls, ""and I said to my kids, ‘I saved the ratepayers $500 million today,’ and the answer was, ‘Well, that’s great, Mom. What’s for dinner?’""   

After our probing, we’re comfortable giving Fritz full credit on her persuasiveness. It’s not easy going up against the commissioner in charge of a bureau, especially if it’s Randy Leonard.

Now, on to the savings. How does she estimate she saved ratepayers $500 million? After all, the difference between $385 million and $100 million is $285 million, not ""around $500 million.""

Fritz said she takes interest costs into consideration, because the city would borrow money to build either system. She cites figures by the city’s budget office showing it would cost $180 million for the UV system and $700 million for  filtration -- or an 80 percent add-on. There’s your ""around $500 million"" in ratepayer savings, she said in an email.

But we think that calculation is inflated. Regular people don’t think in terms of what a big-ticket item like a house or car might really cost, over the long term, with interest. They don’t think that way about capital budget items on the council agenda, and government officials don’t present them that way either. But $500 million is bigger than $285 million.

Second, Fritz’s grand persuasion hasn’t saved ratepayers anywhere near $285 million or $500 million yet. The ultraviolet system still is being designed, said David Shaff, the Water Bureau’s director. Shaff expects design work to be completed by the end of this year -- which is when the state is expected to weigh in on whether we need a system at all. (We will say, however, that her push resulted in water rates being lowered from nearly 19 percent to 12 percent in 2010-11, a savings of roughly $6 million that year. )

So the bottom line is that if the state gives the city a pass -- which might happen given that a year-long study has shown no evidence of cryptosporidium -- we may not spend anything. (Does that mean the state would save water ratepayers $100 million to $180 million, depending on how you calculate cost? There’s a thought.)

Despite our misgivings about the millions saved, or to be saved, PolitiFact Oregon gives Fritz a Mostly True. She came from the political minority, challenged Leonard, and ended up with a 5-0 vote in her favor. The statement is accurate, with some additional information needed.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978AA380>],/factchecks/2011/oct/11/amanda-fritz/did-amanda-fritz-persuade-portland-city-council-sa/

Ted Cruz says David Dewhurst's camp called him a Chinese Communist
","
U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz bristled at two email blasts sent Oct. 4, 2011, on behalf of the front-running Republican for the seat, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst.

In a ""memo"" directed at Dewhurst the next day, Cruz’s campaign consultant, Jason Johnson, said: ""Yesterday, your campaign distributed two emails -- signed expressly by ‘Dewhurst for Texas’ -- that accused Ted Cruz of being a ‘Red’ Chinese"" Communist. Cruz’s campaign copied the note to ""interested parties,"" meaning reporters and anyone else tuned to the pair’s rivalry

Feel those not-so-good ‘50s coming back?

Cruz’s camp sent us the two emails from Dewhurst’s camp. One was headlined ""Red Ted Cruz shows his true colors, consistently stands with China against American interests"" and signed by Steven Cheung of Dewhurst’s campaign. The email points out that Cruz opposes legislation offered in Congress to penalize China for propping up its currency. The email closes: ""At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?""

The other email, signed by Justin Hollis of Dewhurst’s campaign, has the subject line: ""What Does Ted Cruz Have Against America?"" Its text refers to Cruz’s opposition to the Chinese currency measure and also quotes from a Laura Ingraham interview of Cruz and a blog post by Texas Monthly’s Paul Burka about Cruz, a lawyer, acting as counsel to a Chinese company accused of patent infringement by an American. The email identically closes: ""At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?""

Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch told us that Cruz’s charge is false grandstanding compared with the issues raised by the Dewhurst blasts.

The legislation opposed by Cruz would compel the Obama administration to levy tariffs and other penalties against China and other countries for having ""misaligned"" currencies, according to an Oct. 7, 2011, news post by the Wall Street Journal, amid concern that China holds down the value of its currency, the yuan, in an effort to boost the country's exports. Opponents have warned that approval of the proposal could lead China to launch a trade war.

And what of the patent infringement case? Burka, in an Oct. 3, 2011, blog post, recaps a Sept. 28, 2011, post on the San Antonio-based Plaza de Armas blog stating that in his work for a Houston firm, Cruz appealed a ruling against a Chinese conglomerate in a patent piracy case brought by a Florida businessman. Nothing wrong with that in legal terms, the originating blog says, though in political terms, ""the idea of a Tea Party darling (Cruz) representing an alleged patent thief against a geriatric American entrepreneur, at a time when the U.S. economy is in shambles and China is the largest international holder of American debt, has the whiff of trouble about it.""

Perhaps Dewhurst scores political points on these fronts.

Per our review, neither Dewhurst email explicitly says Cruz is a Chinese Communist. 
Then again, we wondered if it’s reasonable to read the ""Red Ted"" subject line of one of them as anything but a claim that Cruz aligns with, or even is, a Chinese Communist. John Drogin, Cruz’s campaign manager, pointed us to a Dictionary.com definition of ""red"" as a ""radical leftist in politics, especially a Communist."" He also noted a Republican blogger’s post interpreting the ""red Ted"" label in the email as meaning Communist.

""You know that ‘red’ is a clear euphemism for Communist and in the context of China,"" Drogin said. ""Dewhurst's staffer's remark is even more obviously so.""

The ""red Ted"" reference might seem especially pointed because Cruz’s father fought alongside Fidel Castro and the rebels in Cuba before fleeing the island nation for Texas; he later decided Castro was not the leader he’d wished for, according to a January 2006 Austin American-Statesman news article.

All told, it’s reasonable to take the subject line of one Dewhurst email as calling Cruz a Chinese Communist; the other cited email similarly depicts Cruz as siding with China over the United States, but doesn’t include the ""red"" label. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B2B40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/11/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhursts-camp-called-him-chin/
"['Immigration', 'Rhode Island', 'Education', 'Jorge Elorza']","
Law professor says R.I. has ""roughly 15,000 undocumented immigrants.""
","
The decision by the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education to allow  undocumented immigrants to be eligible for in-state tuition at the state’s public colleges and university made for lively debate on a recent Channel 10 ""News Conference.""

Jorge O. Elorza, a professor of law at the private Roger Williams University School of Law, who supports the policy, faced off with one of the policy’s most vocal opponents, William T. ""Terry"" Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement.

During the discussion, Elozra argued in favor of the policy, saying it will give undocumented students a better chance of going to college and building careers.

""The reality is that we have roughly 15,000 undocumented immigrants living in the state, and they’re here and they’re not going anywhere,"" he said. ""And so I think as a state we have to ask ourselves, do we make engineers, scientists and innovators out of them? Or do we deny them a college education . . . ?’’

Wait, did he really say 15,000?

(Yes, he did.)  

But other estimates we’ve seen say there are twice as many.

At a time of heated debate in Rhode Island and nationally over laws and policies with respect to undocumented immigrants, it’s clearly important to get as accurate a number for this population as possible.

To be fair, there are no hard numbers; only estimates.

PolitiFact Rhode Island addressed the issue in a fact-check in January of Gorman’s claim that illegal immigration costs Rhode Island $400 million a year. (We ruled Gorman’s claim Pants on Fire.) 

In researching that item, we used data from the federal Department of Homeland Security and the Pew Hispanic Center to come up with an estimate of 30,000 to 35,000 illegal immigrants in Rhode Island -- twice as many as Elorza said.

So we asked Elorza how he came up with the 15,000 estimate.

""I did a Google search,’’ the professor said.  And he sent us a link to his source material: a Web site called StateMaster.com.

Sure enough, the site has a chart entitled: ""Estimated number of illegal immigrants (most recent) by state.""  The StateMaster chart reports the estimated number of ""illegal"" immigrants in Rhode Island as 16,000. 
The facts

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics reported that the ""unauthorized"" immigrant population in this country in 2010 was 10.8 million. The agency doesn’t report data for Rhode Island; it only offers estimates for states with larger populations because of the ""uncertainty in the precision for smaller states,’’ DHS spokesman Michael Hoefer told PolitiFact earlier this year.

But a February 2011 report by the Pew Hispanic Center offers estimates for smaller states, including Rhode Island. Their estimate for ""unauthorized"" immigrants in Rhode Island in 2010 was 30,000 -- twice as many as Elzora stated during the TV news conference.

How did Pew arrive at 30,000?

We posed that question to Jeffrey S. Passel, Pew’s senior demographer. (He was in Colorado at a conference of experts who are developing projections about future levels of immigration worldwide.)

For large states and the country as a whole, Passel said, Pew researchers analyze Homeland Security data about legal immigrants entering those states. They compare that data with the number of immigrants counted in those states during the Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census. The survey doesn’t count everyone, he said, so Pew adjusts for people left out of the survey.   

From the Current Population Survey, the data crunchers can see who reported that they were not born in the United States and then use other information they reported in the survey -- such as whether they work for the government or receive food stamps or welfare -- to determine if they are living in this country legally. (To get a government job or food stamps, a person is generally required to have a Social Security number, so ""it’s a very strong indicator,’’ Passel said, ""that the people are legal."")

The researchers then create two categories: people who are ""definitely here legally,"" he said, and those who are ""possibly here illegally.""

The difference between the number of immigrants who are living in the country legally and the total number of immigrants reported in the Current Population Survey produces the estimated number surveyed who are ""unauthorized immigrants.’’

The Pew estimate for Rhode Island has a margin of error of plus or minus 5,000, so the actual number of unauthorized immigrants in the state could be 25,000 to 35,000, according to the report.

Nationally, Pew reported, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country in 2010 was about 11.2 million.

So, where did the 15,000 number that Elorza used for Rhode Island come from? 
Old data

StateMaster.com, the web site that Elorza cited, claims that its data are the ""most recent.""  

But scroll down to the bottom of its chart and read the fine print. Just below where it shows the total U.S. illegal immigrant population estimate as 6.9 million -- next to the red capital letters that say ""DEFINITION"" -- is this disclosure:  ""Latest available data - 2000 Census...’’

The chart is based on 11-year-old data.

Since then, the estimated population of undocumented immigrants in Rhode Island has almost doubled.

Peter Skerry, a political science professor at Boston College who has studied immigration trends for two decades, offers this caution about using data from the Internet.

""If I go to a dinner party and want to say something, I’ll go to Google or Wikipedia,’’ Skerry said. ""But if I’m going to do an interview on immigration . . . I’m going to rely on the best sources I can find. Everything on a computer screen isn’t necessarily right.""

To recap, the statement by Professor Elorza that Rhode Island has about 15,000 undocumented immigrants in Rhode Island is based on 11-year-old data and current estimates put the number at about twice that many.

To his credit, when the error was brought to Elorza’s attention he acknowledged it and directed us to the current data from the Pew Center report.

""Terry Gorman told me off air that he thought the number of undocumented immigrants was larger,’’ Elorza said in an e-mail. ""I told him I had no problem using the larger number; it made my point even stronger.’’

If only he had checked his numbers before he went on TV. But he didn’t, so we rate Elorza’s claim False.

Viral Facebook post on CEO-worker pay ratio has obscure past
","If you've got liberal friends and logged into Facebook lately, chances are pretty good that you've seen this chart. As people express their support with the Occupy Wall Street protests, they are citing this chart and similar statistics to show income inequality in the United States.

The chart -- here’s another version posted on the liberal website Daily Kos -- lists the ratio of CEO pay to average worker pay in the U.S. and nine other countries. The smallest ratio is Japan’s at 11 to 1. The United States is highest at 475 to 1.

We've gotten many reader requests to check the numbers, in part because the chart lacks any sourcing or additional explanatory information. But despite the lack of backup information, the chart has gone viral.

It's not only been posted and re-posted many times on Facebook, it's also appeared in countless blogs and been tweeted and re-tweeted on Twitter.  The chart is the latest reminder that factual claims can spread at lightning speed on the Internet -- even when the facts to back them up are scarce.  

Before we check the accuracy of the numbers, it's worth exploring where the chart began and how it went viral.

It's been repeatedly cited in blogs and reports, including one paper presented at a conference of a United Nations affiliate. The paper, written by Thomas Prosser of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, included the same chart that’s now circulating, which it sourced to a 2005 paper by an M. Kroll titled, ""CEO Pay Rates: U.S. vs Foreign Nations.""

We located a scanned version of the paper on the Internet, and it did appear to be written by Prof. Mark Kroll. His institution wasn’t listed, but after some additional searching, we found that Kroll had been teaching at the Louisiana Tech College of Business in 2005 and that he is now the business dean at the University of Texas at Brownsville. But it turns out he didn’t write the paper after all.

""Actually, I am the ‘recipient’ of the paper you refer to,"" Kroll told us in an e-mail. ""The paper was done as a class project by three of my students in a graduate class back in 2005. The 475-to-1 ratio that you reference is listed in a table in the paper the students wrote. They do not give a specific citation for the data in the table.""

The paper’s cover sheet fooled us -- as it fooled others -- because the professor’s name appears in the middle of the page, and the three students’ names appear together at the bottom in a less prominent spot. We tried to reach the co-authors -- Adam Choate, Dana Rowzee and Jerrod Tinsley, all of whom were working on their Master of Business Administration in 2005 -- but we did not hear back.

So how about the substance of the chart?

From previous fact-checks, we knew that American CEOs are generously paid, and we had confirmed that for ordinary Americans, incomes are stagnating.

But on the specific comparison of CEO pay and average-worker pay, we found two liberal groups -- the Economic Policy Institute and the Institute for Policy Studies -- that have produced long-running studies of this question.

The most recent chart from the Economic Policy Institute shows a ratio of 185 to 1 for 2009. According to the group’s calculations, the peak since the mid 1960s was almost 299 to 1. But it was never as high as high as 475 to 1.

Meanwhile, the most recent ratio from the Institute for Policy Studies is also smaller -- for 2010, it was 325 to 1. In previous years the ratio on two occasions has exceeded 475 to 1 -- to be specific, 516 to 1 in 1999 and 525 to 1 in 2000.

The Institute for Policy Studies’ ratios are higher than the Economic Policy Institute’s due to methodological differences. Sarah Anderson, who has co-authored the Institute for Policy Studies reports, said the figures can vary depending on several factors, including which CEOs are sampled and what types of compensation for both the CEO and the worker are used in the calculation.

Still, both of the years where the CEO pay ratio in the IPS study was at least 475 to 1 came more than a decade ago, so data from those years would be of questionable use to policy debates today.

In addition, neither of the two groups that compiled these figures made comparisons of CEO-to-worker pay across different countries, as the chart circulating on Facebook does.

So what we’re left with is an unsourced, undated chart with numbers that, at best, were only correct (approximately) in 1999 and 2000 according to one measure, and wrong according to a different measure.

Anderson of the Institute for Policy Studies said that for a paper written in 2005, a 475 to 1 ratio was not ""crazy high,"" since the figure for 2004 in her group’s study was 431 to 1.

Kroll, the professor who graded the paper, added that ""it would not surprise me if (the students’) number was ‘in the ball park.'""

Still, that argument doesn’t help today’s social-media posters. The data they’re circulating is at best six years old, and the ratios have fallen since then.

Our ruling

This is a textbook example of how claims can spiral out of control on the Internet. Just as conservatives have circulated unfounded claims about President Barack Obama's birth certificate, liberals are spreading this questionable chart.

We don’t doubt the chart’s underlying point that the ratio of CEO pay to worker pay is high in the United States, and is likely higher in our free-wheeling economy than it is in the historically more egalitarian nations of Europe.

But in its claim that the U.S. ratio is 475 to 1, the chart conveys a sense of certitude and statistical precision that simply isn't warranted -- and which is contradicted by the facts. The latest number for the U.S. is 185 to 1 in one study and 325 to 1 in another -- and those numbers were not generated by groups that might have an ideological interest in downplaying the gaps between rich and poor. We rate the claim on the U.S. ratio False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C071680>],/factchecks/2011/oct/10/facebook-posts/viral-facebook-post-ceo-worker-pay-ratio-has-obscu/

Progressive magazine editor says young worker unemployment at ""60-year high""
","
Activists participating in Occupy Wall Street, a movement that protests greed, corporate influence and unemployment, began camping out in New York’s financial district in September 2011 and have spawned similar demonstrations around the country.

Supporters include the left-leaning political advocacy group MoveOn.org and Russ Feingold, the former Democratic U.S. senator from Wisconsin, who said ""accountability for corporate greed is long overdue.""

As part of what is being billed as an international protest, local offshoots of the Occupy Wall Street plan to demonstrate in Milwaukee, Madison and Appleton on Oct. 15, 2011.

On Oct. 4, 2011, Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardindiscussed the demonstrations with Matthew Rothschild, editor and publisher of The Progressive. The 102-year-old Madison magazine calls itself ""one of the leading voices for peace and social justice in this country.""

When Cardin asked Rothschild why younger people are leading the demonstrations, he said: ""The unemployment rate for people between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high.""

Is the rate for younger workers that high?

Unemployment has been a major issue since the start of the recession in December 2007 -- and not just for people in their late teens and early 20s.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported, for example, that in December 2009, unemployment reached a record 7.2 percent among people ages 55 and over and that people in that age group spent an average of 35 weeks out of work -- considerably more than the average of 23 weeks for unemployed people ages 16 to 24.

In making his claim about younger workers, Rothschild told us he was quoting an April 2011 report from the Economic Policy Institute.

It said: ""In 2010, the unemployment rate for workers age 16-24 was 18.4 percent — the worst on record in the 60 years that this data has been tracked.""

So, although Rothschild said the current rate of unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 is at a 60-year high, he was referring to the annual rate for 2010.

The Economic Policy Institute is a liberal-leaning Washington, D.C. think tank that says it seeks to ""broaden discussions about economic policy to include the needs of low- and middle-income workers.""

Its report -- which urges ""substantial additional stimulus spending"" by the federal government to create jobs for younger workers -- says the unemployment statistics came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau is the federal government’s statistics keeper on unemployment.

We queried the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ database to create a chart showing the monthly and annual unemployment rates for people ages 16 to 24 from 1948 through August 2011.

We found that the Economic Policy Institute report was correct: Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 18.4 percent in 2010; and that rate is higher than any annual rate dating back to when statistics were first kept in 1948. That’s more than 60 years.

The next-highest annual rates, each exceeding 17 percent, were posted in 1982, 1983 and 2009.

In each of the first eight months of 2011, however, the rate has been below the 2010 mark of 18.4 percent.

Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 was 17.7 percent in August 2011, the most recent month for which statistics are available. And the year-to-date average is 17.6 percent.

So, the rate is lower today than it was for 2010 as a whole, though only eight months of 2011 are accounted for. We don’t know, of course, how the year will end up.

Our conclusion

Rothschild said unemployment among people ages 16 to 24 ""is 18.4 percent, which is a 60-year high."" The 18.4 percent is correct as the average rate for 2010, and that average annual rate is the highest in more than 60 years. More recent figures, however, show the unemployment rate among people ages 16 to 24 has dipped below 18 percent in 2011, at least through August.

We Are Ohio claims SB 5 would make it harder for nurses to care for patients
","
We Are Ohio, the main group trying to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 5, recently rolled out a TV commercial warning voters that upholding the law would compromise the health care nurses can provide.

The message is similar to a claim in a previous ad that SB 5 would make it illegal to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job. PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim Mostly True.   

""Senate Bill 5 makes it harder for nurses to give the patients the quality care they need,"" a nurse identified as Shawna Turner says in the commercial.

SB 5 – the state’s new collective bargaining law that is strongly opposed by unions and Democrats – will reduce public workers’ negotiating power, ban public-worker strikes and eliminate binding arbitration. The bill also would force public workers to pay at least 15 percent of their health insurance costs and to pay at least 10 percent of pay toward pension contributions.

The SB 5 referendum will appear on the Nov. 8 ballot as Issue 2. A ""yes"" vote would go toward upholding the law and a ""no"" vote would be for its repeal.

The commercial, which began airing on Sept. 27, raises questions about how SB 5 impacts nurses – a group of workers less commonly associated with SB 5 than others, such as police officers and teachers. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the ad’s claim.

We started by checking how many nurses belong to public unions and, therefore, will be affected by SB 5.

There are about 160,000 registered nurses in the state and between 6,000 and 10,000 of those are public employees, according to the Ohio Nurses Association. That means SB 5 would affect between 4 percent and 6.25 percent of Ohio nurses.

The Ohio Nurses Association represents about 3,000 public-sector nurses, chief executive officer Gingy Harshey-Meade said. The Ohio Civil Service Employees Association and the Service Employees International Union also represent Ohio nurses. These nurses work at places such as prisons, city or county hospitals and public health departments.

When the nurse in the commercial says the new law will make it harder for nurses to provide care, the following text appears on the screen: ""Source: Senate Bill 5; p229, Section 4117.08 (B).""

That section of the law specifies a handful of subjects that cannot be collectively bargained. Among those topics is ""the number of employees required to be on duty or employed in any department.""

In an email, We Are Ohio spokeswoman Melissa Fazekas said the restriction on bargaining staffing relates to patient care because ""it is more difficult for a nurse to provide quality care when he/she is working short-staffed.""

Jason Mauk, spokesman for the pro-SB 5 group Building a Better Ohio, sought to minimize the idea that SB 5 bans workers from negotiating staffing. He said management can discuss the issue if it chooses. As evidence, he has pointed to a different provision in SB 5 that lists ""the number of persons required to be employed or laid off"" under topics that can be negotiated at management’s discretion.

It is unclear how this provision would mesh with the ban cited in We Are Ohio’s commercials about nurses and firefighters. Certainly, however, management has no obligation to discuss staffing and unions do not have the right to collectively bargain the issue.

The current collective bargaining agreement that covers Turner, the nurse featured in the commercial, gives some insight into how SB 5 would affect nurses working conditions.

Turner, who works at the Ohio State University Ross Heart Hospital, is represented by the Ohio Nurses Association. The union’s contract with the university contains a clause that gives management the right to set staffing levels.

ONA’s contract with OSU says management has the right ""to determine staffing and staffing patterns including, but not limited to the assignment of nurses as to the numbers employed, duties to be performed, qualifications required, and areas worked.""

That sounds a lot like the rule that SB 5 would impose.

But union officials say the same contract that gives OSU the right to make staffing decisions, for example, also gives the union a significant voice in those decisions.

Kelly Trautner, deputy executive officer of the Ohio Nurses Association, pointed to a provision in ONA’s contract with Ohio State that requires meetings between the union and management to discuss ""matters of mutual concern."" Trautner said there are other provisions, too, that give the union the right to discuss staffing. But SB 5 completely removes that right and erases the provisions in past contracts that provide the union a voice in staffing matters, Trautner said.

So what about the claim that S.B. 5 make it harder for nurses to give patients quality care?

The claim contains an element of truth.

The power SB 5 gives to management for staffing decisions is significant – especially when you consider past clauses in collective bargaining agreements that empowered workers to speak up for staffing concerns will not carry over to new contracts if SB 5 takes effect.

The argument there is that a reduced staff makes it harder to give quality care.

But there are some critical facts on which the ad is silent.

First, it is impossible to say whether public employers will cut nursing staffs. The ad assumes that with staffing non-negotiable, management will cut staffs or not provide adequate staffing to a point that it will have an impact on the quality of care.

That’s where this claim differs from the claim in the previous ad involving firefighters, which specifically focused on the inability to bargain over staffing. This claim goes one step further, saying it will make patient care harder to provide.

Even more significantly, though, the commercial makes no distinction between nurses who are public employees and those who are non-public employees, and as such implies all nurses will suffer if Issue 2 passes. But only a tiny fraction of Ohio nurses are public employees - just four to six of every 100.

A listener knowing those critical facts would have a different impression of the claim.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E20500>],/factchecks/2011/oct/10/we-are-ohio/we-are-ohio-claims-sb-5-would/

Did Rick Perry's Coke claim pass the taste test?
","
Texas may be the home turf of Dr. Pepper, but that state’s governor had another soft drink company on his mind during his recent visit to Georgia.

Gov. Rick Perry, a leading contender for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, didn’t mention Atlanta-based Coca-Cola by name in a speech to the Georgia Public Policy Foundation. But it seemed clear Perry had paid some attention to an interview Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent gave a few days earlier to the Financial Times about the company’s business challenges here and abroad.

""The CEO of that company said he finds it easier to do work in China than in the United States,"" Perry said in his speech to the foundation. ""Now, think about that for a moment. When a Communist country has less bureaucratic red tape than America, we might just be on the wrong track.""

A shrewd move, perhaps, to reference Atlanta’s red-labeled soft drink company and its problems on doing business in America to ""bureaucratic red tape"" to a gathering of fiscal conservatives. Our question for Gov. Perry: Did he correctly characterize Kent’s comments?

We were largely left to our own devices on this one. Perry’s camp did not respond to e-mails requesting comment. Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers said the company doesn’t comment on political statements. Landers did e-mail us portions of the interview.

We read the transcript and watched a 14-minute interview with Kent that the Financial Times posted on its website.

Kent and the interviewer were engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the economy. The CEO was asked if America’s corporate tax structure hinders the company.

""I believe the United States owes itself to create a or architect a 21st-century policy for both individuals as well as for companies. … That calls for a simplified tax system. That calls for a tax system that doesn’t include thousands of exemptions, and I hope we can see the leadership and policymakers come up with that tax system.""

""A company is at a disadvantage doing business here because of that?"" came the follow-up question.

""Not disadvantaged doing business here per se,"" Kent replied. ""Everyone is disadvantaged in that it is so complicated and I think businesses like simplification, clarity, transparency. That’s not what we have in our tax code now. It’s an evolution of exceptions.

""However,"" Kent continued, ""if you talk about an American corporation competing in the world today whether it’s Chinese, whether it’s Russian, whether it’s European, whether it’s Japanese counterparts, of course we are at a disadvantage. Because we go and make an investment in Malaysia and we pay 20-plus percent, 22 percent tax after we make a profit. A Chinese company or a Swiss company comes and makes an investment, makes an investment in Malaysia, generates profit, pays 22 percent, and after the 22 percent, the Chinese or Swiss company can do whatever they want with those funds. We can’t; when we want to bring them back, we are faced with another fairly large tax burden of almost 10 percent, maybe more.""

Kent’s comments were the only references to China in the video interview. They didn’t really fit into what Perry said, which had us scratching our heads.

The 14-minute video, however, does not contain the entire interview. In an article that accompanied the video, Kent is quoted as saying ""in many respects"" that it is easier to do business in China. The article says Kent cites political gridlock and America’s tax structure for his opinion.

""You have a one-stop shop in terms of the Chinese foreign investment agency and local governments are fighting for investment with each other,"" Kent is quoted as telling the Financial Times.

Coca-Cola officials have not disputed the article’s content.

We believe Perry’s statement is partially accurate, but omits some details. Kent said it is easier ""in many respects"" to do business in China. He also blamed political gridlock in the United States, not just ""bureaucratic red tape.""

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Libertarian National Committee ']","
Libertarian leader says Texas Gov. Rick Perry backed a guest worker program
","
The Libertarian Party has a message for Rick Perry: The country needs a president who will defend liberty, and it’s not you. 
In a video posted on the party's website, Wes Benedict, executive director of the Libertarian National Committee, gives five examples of why he won't be voting for Perry, including the Texas governor's 2007 executive order, later blocked by the Legislature, that girls be vaccinated against a virus that can cause cervical cancer. 
Yet Benedict, who suggested we take a look at the video, also notes one area on which to compliment Perry: immigration. ""Libertarians like me embrace immigration and welcome people from Mexico and the rest of the world who seek a better life and the blessings of liberty,"" said Benedict, who used to live in Texas. ""Compared to most Republicans, you have been pretty open to immigration. I credit you for being friendly to our southern neighbors. Rick Perry, I support amnesty, and I think you do too. You supported a guest worker program to help people who would otherwise be illegal aliens."" 
Immigration has been a tough subject for Perry since he entered the Republican presidential contest in August. Fellow candidate Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, has criticized Perry’s continued support for a Texas law allowing some illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. As has presidential hopeful Rick Santorum, who has publicly disagreed with Perry’s position that building a fence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border doesn't make sense. 
In response, Perry has cited Texas policies that he says show he is tough on immigration, including the spending of millions of dollars on border security while he has been governor. 
Given that Benedict opined that Perry supports amnesty, we're not treating that characterization as a factual claim. Broadly, ""amnesty"" for undocumented workers is a politically charged term that PolitiFact Georgia has analyzed. 
In this fact-check, we're focusing on whether Perry has supported a guest worker program. 
Bluntly, it looks like Benedict got this right, though we found no sign that Perry has spoken in favor of such a program since 2007. 
Asked for backup information, Benedict pointed us to a Dec. 7, 2006, Associated Press news article about a speech that Perry gave the day before to the Texas Border Coalition, which consists of border region mayors, county judges and economic development advocates. 
In the speech, according to the text of Perry’s remarks, he touched on several border-related topics — and criticized Washington's security efforts, including the border fence Congress approved earlier that year. ""Strategic fencing in certain urban areas to direct the flow of traffic makes sense, but building a wall across the entire border is a preposterous idea,"" Perry said. 
Next, he turned to the subject of migrant workers. ""Washington needs to seek real solutions that protect our economy, that take migrant workers out of the shadows by giving then an ID and allowing them to cross freely, and that at the same time recognizes the rule of law and the importance of not rewarding those who break our laws,"" Perry said. 
He then called for the creation of a guest worker program ""that takes those workers off the black market and that legitimizes their economic contributions without doing the same for their citizenship."" 
""I would rather know who it is that crosses our border legally to work than not know who it is that crosses our border illegally to work,"" Perry said. 
According to the AP story, Perry later told reporters that workers already in the country illegally should be given ""an expanded period of time in which to come to register"" for a guest worker program. 
In a review of Perry's speeches and public statements, we found seven other times from 2003 through 2007 that Perry touted the idea of a new federal guest worker program. In nearly every one, Perry also called for stepped-up border security. In some cases, he said a guest worker program could not ""succeed"" unless the security efforts happened first. 
In November 2003 remarks at a luncheon for Vicente Fox, then the president of Mexico, Perry said: ""Let me say something about the migrant workers who cross our border to work. They provide a real value to our economy, and Texas benefits from the contributions they make. I will support reforms to our guest worker laws that allow migrant workers to contribute to our economy so long as the security of our border is in no way compromised."" 
The following year, Perry’s office issued a news release the same day that then-President George W. Bush gave a speech calling for an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws and the creation of a temporary-worker program that would ""match willing foreign workers with willing American employers when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs."" Perry’s Jan. 7, 2004, statement recapped his comments on guest worker programs at the Fox luncheon and said Bush’s proposal ""reflects"" Perry's desire for a program that ""balances"" the economic realities of Mexico and the United States with the need for homeland security. 
If Bush's proposal had become law, foreign workers applying from their home countries and people already working here illegally would have been eligible for the temporary-worker program, which would have offered legal status for three years and the possibility of extensions. 
The latest instance we found of Perry expressing support for a new guest worker program was in his 2007 State of the State address to Texas lawmakers, in which he said ""the best way to crack down on illegal hiring practices is for Congress to finally pass a guest worker program."" Such a program, Perry said, would recognize the contributions of foreign workers and capture ""their income in our tax system, ensuring they contribute to the public services we provide them."" 
We asked Perry's office whether he still thinks a new guest worker program is a good idea. A spokeswoman replied by email: ""The governor believes that our nation cannot have effective immigration reform without first securing the border. This must be our nation's priority. Once the borders are secure, then a discussion can be had about fixing our broken immigration system. Until then, it’s a moot point."" 
Our ruling 
Perry has voiced support for giving temporary legal status to laborers who aren't authorized to enter the United States, including some immigrants already working here illegally. Still, Perry apparently hasn't spoken in favor of a guest worker program for years. Benedict's statement ignores that fact. So we rate it Mostly True.

New Jersey Democrats say Republican Vince Polistina is collecting a government pension on top of $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries
","

A political mailer reaching homes in Atlantic County gives voters two choices for state Senate: a shiny, green apple and a rotten, brown one.

The campaign literature, sent on behalf of state Sen. Jim Whelan, a Democrat fighting for re-election, paints Whelan as the apple you’d want to give a school teacher and Vince Polistina, the Republican candidate in the 2nd legislative district race, as a decaying piece of fruit.

The literature, paid for and authorized by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, tells voters ""Whelan won’t let some rotten politicians get in the way of reforming government.""

Polistina, the mailer claims, is a ""backroom dealer looking to profit at taxpayer expense.""

""Polistina donated thousands of dollars to Atlantic County politicians. Then he raked in more than $6 million in no-bid government contracts paid for by South Jersey taxpayers. But that wasn’t enough for Vince,"" the mailer, which was sent to PolitiFact New Jersey on Oct. 1, says. ""He’s also collecting nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries -- plus a government pension and all the perks he can pocket.""

All of the 120 seats in the state Legislature are up for grabs this November, but the state Senate race between Whelan and Polistina is one of the most hotly contested -- and each candidate has accused the other of siphoning funds from government coffers to boost their personal wealth. For this Truth-O-Meter item, PolitiFact New Jersey researched the Democrats’ claims that Polistina is banking nearly $70,000 in public salaries and collecting a government pension.

The first part of that claim is correct. The second half is not only wrong -- it’s hypocritical.

First, let’s note that Polistina owns an engineering firm.  Polistina acknowledged the firm brought in more than $6 million from 2004 to 2010 through government contracts, but said that’s revenue with which he is paying employees and overhead expenses.

He also works part-time for two public entities. As a state assemblyman, Polistina is paid $49,000. He is also the authority engineer for the Egg Harbor Township Municipal Utilities Authority, a position that pays $20,000 annually.

So Democrats correctly stated that Polistina is collecting ""nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries.""

But is Polistina also collecting a pension?

Polistina isn’t eligible to enroll in the state’s Public Employees’ Retirement System, or PERS, as a state legislator because he was elected after July 1, 2007.

However, Polistina is enrolled in PERS through his position with the municipal utilities authority. But he is not collecting a pension, according to state treasury documents.

Those facts would leave us at a Half True.

But Whelan is doing what the Democrats wrongly accused Polistina of -- collecting a government pension on top of ""taxpayer-funded salaries.""

Whelan’s salary as a state senator is $49,000 and he made nearly $67,500 as an Atlantic City public school teacher, according to state records current as of Oct. 15, 2010.  He draws a monthly pension payment through PERS of more than $2,600 for his previous work as a government official and is enrolled in state’s pension fund for teachers, according to state treasury documents and financial disclosure forms.

Whelan did not return requests for comment. Jason Springer, a spokesman for the state Democratic committee, said the mailer ""accurately reflects the salary Mr. Polistina is collecting and the pension credits he is banking.""

We asked Springer whether the committee acknowledges that the mailer implies Polistina is currently collecting a pension -- not banking pension credits -- and if they could explain why they were targeting Polistina for something Whelan is doing.

Springer said in an email that the committee ""stands by our previous response"" and then repeated claims in the mailer.

Our ruling

The state Democratic committee said Polistina collects ""nearly $70,000 in taxpayer-funded salaries -- plus a government pension.""

Polistina is paid $69,000 for two part-time, public positions. He is in the pension system, but not collecting a pension.

The Democratic committee made the accusation against a Republican, despite their candidate collecting a pension on top of two government salaries. That makes the claim outrageous. We rate it Mostly False.

"['Corporations', 'Jobs', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Jim Sensenbrenner']","
GOP Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says U.S. has ""highest corporate tax rate in the world""
","
With unemployment remaining stubbornly high, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., was asked what the federal government could do to create jobs.

The suburban Milwaukee congressman, who was first elected to the House in 1979, didn’t hesitate in replying.

""We’ve got to address the fact that we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world,"" Sensenbrenner told the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 29, 2011. ""It’s 35 percent.""

Sensenbrenner argued that if corporate taxes in the U.S. were lower than they are in other parts of the world, more U.S.-based multinational companies would ""repatriate"" their profits back to America, creating more jobs here.

It’s Sensenbrenner’s opinion that lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate would create jobs. We can’t check an opinion.

But we can check whether the rate is 35 percent and if it is the highest in the world.

Sensenbrenner’s district director, Loni Hagerup, pointed to a 2011 report from the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development, a Paris-based group of 34 large, industrialized democracies.

The widely quoted report says the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, tops among the member countries.

Next in line were France and Belgium (both 34 percent), and then Australia, Japan, Spain and Mexico (each 30 percent).  

Seems pretty straightforward. Sensenbrenner is right, right?

Let’s first look at two points:

1. ""Combined"" corporate tax rate

Some analysts, when comparing countries, use the Paris group’s report but cite a different figure -- the combined corporate tax rate, rather than merely the corporate tax rate. The combined rate includes not only federal but also state tax rates for corporations. The combined corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 39.2 percent, which ranks second behind Japan’s 39.5 percent.

But Sensenbrenner was asked what the federal government could do to create jobs, so the corporate tax rate -- not the combined rate -- is relevant here.

2. Limitations of the corporate rate

We consulted experts at two Washington, D.C. research organizations -- Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge and Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Both said Sensenbrenner is correct in stating that the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent and that the rate is the highest in the world, but they added some context to the discussion.

Williams said the corporate tax rate ""is not a good measure of the taxes that corporations actually pay."" While some corporations might pay the full 35 percent rate, many pay considerably less, depending on the types of investments they make, depreciation they take and other factors that reduce taxable income, he said.

Hodge agreed. He added, however, that the ""effective"" federal tax rate (after deductions) that corporations pay is about 26 percent -- and that also is among the highest rates of all industrialized nations.

Our conclusion

Asked what the federal government could do to create jobs, Sensenbrenner said lower the ""corporate tax rate,"" which he said was 35 percent and the highest in the world. A widely quoted annual report says the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent and is highest among 34 large, industrialized countries. Two experts agreed with the rate and the ranking.

"['New Jersey', 'Social Security', 'Steve Lonegan']","
Conservative activist Steve Lonegan claims “Social Security system is broke.""
 ","
If conservative activist Steve Lonegan is to be believed, millions of people throughout the country should not expect to receive any more Social Security checks.

During a recent discussion on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show, Lonegan, state director of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, suggested that the federal program had run out of money. Lonegan appeared on the show with Deborah Howlett, president of the left-leaning New Jersey Policy Perspective.

""Today, the Social Security system is broke,"" Lonegan said during the show broadcast on Oct. 1 and 2. ""For the first year since the 75 years Deb talked about, they’re in a cash-flow negative situation.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Social Security is facing long-term fiscal challenges, but the program is not broke. According to federal projections, scheduled benefits should continue to be paid in full for about another 25 years.

Let’s explain how Social Security is funded.

Social Security benefits and administrative costs are paid from two trust funds, which are made up of payroll taxes, income taxes on some Social Security benefits and interest owed by the government for fund balances.

The surplus in any given year is turned over to the U.S. Treasury to finance other government operations in exchange for government securities. Those securities, which comprise the trust fund balances, essentially represent money the government owes itself.

By the end of 2010, the trust funds held securities worth about $2.6 trillion.

But here’s the sign of long-term fiscal woes: starting last year, Social Security no longer takes in enough annual tax revenue to cover its expenses each year. With interest earnings, the program’s total income will only be able to pay the bills until 2023.

After the trust funds start to make up the difference, those reserves will be depleted by 2036. At that point, tax revenues would only support 77 percent of scheduled benefits. In 2085, tax income would cover 74 percent of scheduled benefits.

So even if nothing is done to address the problem, roughly three-quarters of benefits would still be paid about 75 years from now.

Lonegan argued that ""broke"" wasn’t too strong of a word to describe Social Security. The revenues don’t match the expenditures, and the government will have to borrow money to meet the obligations of the trust funds, Lonegan said.

""They’re basically living on borrowed time,"" Lonegan said. 
Lonegan referred us to Peter Ferrara, who served in the White House Office of Policy Development under President Ronald Reagan. Ferrara agreed that Social Security is broke, partly because tax revenues don’t fully support the program and trust funds are just made up of securities. 
""Those trust funds are not real money,"" Ferrara said.

Other experts we spoke to argued that Social Security is not broke.

Henry Aaron, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank, pointed out how the U.S. Treasury bonds held by the trust funds are ""the most secure asset in the world,"" and can be presented for payment at face value at any time. 
""Is a person 'broke' if he has a big bank account that is paying interest, which together with current earnings, more than covers expenses, so that the account balance is increasing?"" Aaron said in an email. ""I don't think so.""

Virginia Reno, vice president for income security policy for the National Academy of Social Insurance, said of Social Security: ""It’s not broke in the sense that it’s gone.""

Stan Hinden, a Social Security expert with the American Association of Retired Persons, compared the program to his 15-year old car in need of repairs.

""So, could you say that my car is ‘broken’?"" Hinden said in an email. ""No, I would say that I’ve got a great car with lots of mileage left. It just needs some repairs to keep it running well.""

Our ruling

Lonegan claimed ""the Social Security system is broke."" It’s true that annual tax revenues no longer support the program’s expenses. 
But made up of government securities, Social Security’s trust funds should be able to cover full benefits until at least 2036. That deadline may be cause for concern, but it also means the system is not broke.

We rate the statement False.

Dr. Nick Tsiongas says health care is greatest contributor to increases in Rhode Island state budget
","
In September, Dr. Nick Tsiongas wrote a commentary for The Providence Journal about how the federal health-care overhaul is taking shape in Rhode Island.

Tsiongas, a former state legislator and past president of the Rhode Island Medical Society, is a founding board member of HealthRIght, a statewide group working for ""the passage and implementation of comprehensive health care reform."" 
His piece made the case for a ""robust"" health benefits exchange, which would create a marketplace where people and businesses could buy health insurance.

To frame the issue, Tsiongas began by saying, ""In Rhode Island, as elsewhere in America, the cost of health care threatens bankruptcy for those without insurance, individuals and businesses find premiums increasingly onerous and even unaffordable, and health care is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget.""

The debate about the health-care exchange can extend to a range of topics, but we wanted to test one of Tsiongas’ underlying claims: That health care is the biggest factor driving state budget increases.

We contacted Tsiongas, who said he was referring to three main categories of health-care spending: ""Medicaid (which includes RIte Care/Share and nursing home and long-term care costs … ), state employees health insurance costs, and retiree costs.""

To bolster his claim, Tsiongas cited a Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council report, which said that total state spending from all sources increased by about $2 billion between fiscal years 2001 and 2011. ""Human services accounted for the largest share of the increase (37.5 percent), followed by general government (28.8 percent) and education (26.3 percent),"" the report says.

""Grants and benefits for human services programs represent the largest share of expenditures in the total budget"" and ""the majority of these expenditures are for medical assistance programs.""

The RIPEC report noted that The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation tracks Medicaid spending by state, and in fiscal year 2009 Rhode Island ranked fourth (behind Ohio, New Hampshire and Massachusetts) in state Medicaid spending as a percentage of the general fund.

""Medicaid remains about a quarter of the state budget and projected increases are unsustainable without health system payment reform,"" Tsiongas wrote in an e-mail. ""One can argue that this and next year’s state pension contributions may dwarf other increases, but this represents a ‘catch-up’ of long-standing pension underpayments by the state, whereas the state’s health-care costs have had a sustained role in the budget over time.""

Tsiongas said the state’s health-care costs don’t just include Medicaid; they also include the cost of providing health-insurance coverage to state employees and retirees.

To check Tsiongas, we turned first to RIPEC, a business-backed organization that has been analyzing the factors that drive public spending since 1932.

In a chart it prepared for PolitiFact, RIPEC showed that ""medical assistance,"" which includes most Medicaid spending in the state, increased by $713.5 million between fiscal 2002 and the enacted budget for fiscal 2012 -- accounting for 28.4 percent of the spending increase from all sources of revenue during that decade.

No other category of spending increased by that much, according to the RIPEC chart. A category of ""other grants and benefits,"" which includes some higher education spending and unemployment insurance, rose by $566 million, accounting for 22.6 percent of the spending increase. And ""salaries and benefits"" for state employees rose by $499 million, accounting for 19.9 percent of the increase during that decade.

But it should be noted that ""salaries and benefits"" includes the employee health-care costs that Tsiongas referenced.

So when you combine all three areas of health-care spending -- Medicaid, employee health care and retiree health care -- they make up the single largest category of increased spending in the state budget over that 10-year span, RIPEC officials said.

During that time, those three areas have driven up the budget even more than state pension payments, RIPEC officials said. In recent months, public attention has focused on the pension system because the cost to Rhode Island taxpayers of financing the state-run pensions for public employees has more than doubled during the last seven years and actuaries say it could double again next fiscal year to more than $600 million.

RIPEC officials said that those rapidly escalating pension costs could become a bigger factor than the health-care costs in the near future -- if nothing is done. But they noted the treasurer and the governor are formulating a pension proposal, and they expect the General Assembly to take action to curtail pension costs during an upcoming special session.

""In 2013 and in the future, pensions will become the main issue that needs to be addressed,""  RIPEC Executive Director John Simmons said. But, he said, ""historically the Medicaid and health-care issue has been the largest driver of costs.""

State Budget Officer Thomas A. Mullaney agreed that pension costs could become a much bigger factor in the budget, if nothing is done. But, he said, ""over the last several years, particularly in the area of Medicaid, health-care costs have been the largest driver in the budget, from an absolute dollar amount standpoint.""

So Tsiongas had the correct diagnosis when he said that health care is the greatest contribution to spending increases in the state budget. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2AADC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/09/nick-tsiongas/says-health-care-greatest-contributor-increases-rh/

Pundit says 50,000 Hispanic citizens turn 18 and become eligible to vote every month
","
In an opinion column, California-based pundit Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Republicans risk offending Latino citizens with broadsides about immigrants.

""Every month, another 50,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turn 18 and become eligible to vote,"" Navarrette said in his column posted online Sept. 28, 2011, and published in the next day’s Austin American-Statesman. ""The GOP had better hope these folks have short memories and don't hold grudges toward those who tried to turn their parents into scapegoats.""

Setting aside Navarrette’s judgment, we wondered about his figure.

By email, the columnist said the 50,000-a-month count was researched by the Pew Hispanic Center, a Washington group that says it seeks to improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation. Navarrette pointed out a September 2008 news article in the Arizona Republic quoting Mark Hugo Lopez, the center’s associate director, saying: ""About 50,000 Latinos a month turn 18 (in the United States) and are eligible to vote for the first time.""

In an interview, Lopez told us he reached the 50,000 count by dividing by 12 the number of U.S.-born Hispanics recorded as turning 18 in the 2009 American Community Survey undertaken by the U.S. Census Bureau. He forwarded his table indicating that in 2009, 659,000 U.S.-born Hispanics turned 18, or nearly 55,000 a month. From 2000 through 2009, Lopez calculated, an average of 500,500 U.S.-born Hispanics annually turned 18, or nearly 42,000 a month over the 10 years.

And what of other population groups?

According to the center’s table, some 2.7 million U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites turned 18 in 2009, for a pace of 225,000 a month, and 755,000 U.S.-born non-Hispanic blacks turned 18, nearly 63,000 a month. Compared to Hispanics that year, then, more blacks and four times as many white citizens turned 18 every month. And over the 10 years, the chart indicates, an average of nearly 214,000 whites and nearly 51,000 blacks turned 18 every month.

In an interview, Lopez said he put the 50,000-a-month figure in a January 2011 center report on Latinos and congressional reapportionment. The report says that while Hispanics accounted for about 51 percent of the nation’s population growth from 2000 through 2009, not all of that growth translated to immediate electoral strength. To date, Latinos often do not vote in numbers reflecting their share of the population.

Then again, the Pew report says, many Latinos are too young to vote or are not U.S. citizens.

""Among the nation’s 48.4 million Hispanics in 2009, a record 20.1 million are eligible to vote,"" the report says. ""Yet an even greater number are not eligible to vote. Some 15.5 million Hispanics are U.S. citizens 17 years of age or younger and 12.8 million of all ages are not U.S. citizens. 
Even so, the number of the Latinos eligible to vote continues to grow. Since 2000, nearly 6 million more Latinos have become eligible to vote. The bulk of this growth was attributable to the 5 million U.S.-born Latino youths nationwide who turned 18 during this past decade. That translates into an additional half-million U.S.-born Latinos coming of age each year — a pattern that is certain to persist, and grow, in the coming decades.""

The Pew Hispanic Center elaborated on the bulge in U.S.-born Latinos under 18 in an April 2011 report stating that Latino electoral participation reached a national high in 2010, though Latinos still do not turn out in numbers equal to their share of the U.S. population. In 2010, the report says, 16.3 percent of the nation's population was Latino, but only 10.1 percent of eligible voters and fewer than 7 percent of voters were Latino.

""This gap is driven by two demographic factors — youth and non-citizenship,"" the report says. ""More than one third of Latinos (34.9 percent) are younger than the voting age of 18. And an additional 22.4 percent are of voting age, but are not U.S. citizens. As a result, the share of the Latino population eligible to vote is smaller than it is among any other group. Just 42.7 percent of the nation's Latino population is eligible to vote, while more than three-in-four (77.7 percent) of whites, two-thirds of blacks (67.2 percent) and more than half of Asians (52.8 percent) are eligible to vote.""

So, how does Navarrette’s claim stand? The 50,000-a-month count is about right. Regardless, it’s a tad misleading to showcase that figure for Latino Americans when both the number of black and Anglo citizens reaching voting age is, for now, even greater.

Barack Obama says Arab Spring sent gas prices higher
","
During an Oct. 6, 2011, press conference, President Barack Obama defended his handling of the economy. 
""With respect to the state of the economy,"" Obama said, ""there is no doubt that growth has slowed. I think people were much more optimistic at the beginning of this year. But the combination of a Japanese tsunami, the Arab Spring, which drove up gas prices, and most prominently (economic turmoil in) Europe, I think, has gotten businesses and consumers very nervous. And we did not help here in Washington with the debt ceiling debacle that took place, a bit of game-playing that was completely unnecessary, completely unprecedented in terms of how we dealt with our responsibilities here in Washington."" 
We’ll take a look at one portion of his comment -- that the Arab Spring, the grass-roots democratic movement that swept the Middle East and North Africa in early 2011, ""drove up gas prices."" We found that he's correct that the Arab Spring did have an impact on oil prices but that it was just one of many factors. 
We began by looking at weekly price data for both crude oil and gasoline collected by the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s repository of energy statistics. 
During the first week of January 2011, a barrel of crude oil on the world market cost $91.04. By mid February, when Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power, the price had risen to $96.25, an increase of just under 6 percent. 
And how about gasoline prices? During the first week of January 2011, a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. cost $3.12. By mid February, the price had risen to $3.19 -- an increase of only about 2 percent. But the increase did come, just a little later than it did for crude oil. By the first week of April, the price had risen to $3.74, making the total increase for the year almost 20 percent. 
""The president is right in part,"" said John B. Townsend II, the manager of public and government affairs at AAA-Mid Atlantic. ""Though it started in the dead of winter, the spreading upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East drove up pump prices."" 
However, many of the experts we spoke to also cautioned against oversimplification. 
One caveat they raised is that the world oil market is complex and it’s hard to single out one factor as the reason for a price increase. 
""While reduced supply in general does put upward pressure on prices, there are so many influences on price at the pump that pointing to one factor -- the Arab Spring -- is a gross oversimplification,"" said Eric Wohlschlegel, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute. 
Asked what the biggest factors in rising prices were, John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil companies' trade group, joked that ""there are three of them: China, China and China."" Along with a number of other developing nations, China is growing so fast that its demand for oil is pushing up prices even though the U.S. and other western nations are seeing economic stagnation. 
In fact, the timing of the price rises suggest that the Arab Spring may have had a modest effect within a much longer period of generally rising prices, rather than a sudden, jarring spike during the apex of the protests. 
For a full year before the Arab Spring arrived, the price of oil had already been rising steadily. From January 2010 to January 2011, the price of a barrel of crude rose from $75.55 to $91.04, or a full 20 percent increase. 
Gasoline prices, too, were already on a long-term upward trajectory. In January 2010, a gallon cost $2.72. A year later it was at $3.12 -- an increase of 15 percent. 
While Felmy agreed that the Arab Spring played a role, he added that the oil markets ""saw a pretty consistent rise from September of 2010 through early February."" 
It’s also worth noting that the price increase, in retrospect, likely stemmed more from speculative worries than actual ones. 
In a news release issued around the time of the protests, AAA cited fear of a possible ""chain reaction of unrest in North Africa and the Middle East could disrupt oil production in the region and cause oil-rich regimes to teeter, totter or topple."" 
Ultimately, such fears didn’t come to pass. Most of the countries hit by major popular protests are minor players in the world oil market. In 2010, Egypt ranked 29th in the world in oil production, Syria ranked 34th, Yemen ranked 38th and Tunisia ranked 53rd, according to the CIA World Factbook. 
The one exception is Libya, which ranked 18th in the world. And experts say that Libya is pretty much the only tangible -- as opposed to speculative -- reason the markets moved as they did. 
""The Arab Spring did result in higher gasoline prices, for one specific reason: It took almost all of Libya’s 1.6 million barrels per day of supply off the market,"" said John Kingston, the director of news for Platts, a publisher that specializes in coverage of energy markets. ""That is a significant amount of oil, and it is oil of the highest quality -- low sulfur, and with a very good yield of transportation fuels like diesel and gasoline."" 
Kingston suggested that Obama might have been more accurate had he said that prices rose due to the Libyan uprising specifically. ""It’s hard to argue that what went on in Tunisia or Syria"" made much of a difference, he said. ""But Libya resulted in an actual loss of crude output."" 
Our ruling 
Obama is right that the Arab Spring was a factor in the increase in gasoline prices. But it's important to note that prices were rising before the democratic movements began. And experts say that while there was some impact on prices, the overall increase is the result of many factors. We rate Obama's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D50180>],/factchecks/2011/oct/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-arab-spring-sent-gas-prices-high/

No CEOs have been arrested for bringing down the economy, said Michael Moore
","
Protests under the slogan ""Occupy Wall Street"" have spread from New York to cities across the United States, and their common theme is expressing anger at an unjust economic system.

But Occupy Wall Street isn't your typical protest action. The group has no list of demands, and it says it has no leaders. Rather, people are organizing through social media and making decisions by consensus. Protesters say they're following the model of Egyptian protesters and others who were part of the Arab Spring. 

An Occupy Wall Street website proclaims, ""This site has nothing to do with us."" But it also states the one thing protesters have in common: ""We are the 99% that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1%.""

Independent filmmaker Michael Moore recently spoke to protesters in Lower Manhattan, and then discussed the movement on Amy Goodman's Democracy Now radio show. She asked Moore what he thought of police arrests of the protesters.

Here's what Moore had to say:

""Well, it's highly ironic that now over 100 of the protesters have been arrested and not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America — nobody, not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008. Who created schemes, financial schemes that not only destroyed the economy, but took away the future of this generation, of this young man and his children in the future. They have completely ruined it for people while they have become filthy rich. Not one of them arrested, but 100 of these people who have stood up non-violently against this madness, and they're arrested? This just boggles the mind.""

We read the same sentiment repeated on Twitter from people supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement's protests.

We've noticed news reports before that have noted a general lack of prosecutions. But we wanted to know if Moore and others were right that not a single banker or corporate executive had been arrested. So we decided to check it out.  
To summarize our findings, we found a few prosecutions, but not many. And we wouldn't describe the targets as the people who were responsible for bringing down the economy. 

The most notable prosecutions

If you're looking for arrests and prosecutions against executives associated with the biggest banks, you won't find them. And we found no arrests of execs with the firms most widely associated with the financial crisis such as Countrywide, AIG or Lehman Brothers.

The highest-profile convictions we found were from Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, which was a mortgage lending firm based not on Wall Street, but in Ocala, Fla. Its former chairman, Lee B. Farkas, was convicted of directing nearly $3 billion in fraud that put thousands out of work and contributed to the collapse of Colonial Bank. The collapse was the sixth-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. A judge sentenced Farkas to 30 years in prison on June 30, 2011. Several other executives associated with the firm pleaded guilty in related cases. 

There were also criminal charges brought against two hedge fund managers at Bear Stearns, who were accused of lying to investors and put on trial for securities fraud. But a jury acquitted them in 2009, and the two men were mid-level managers, not top executives.

There have been many other prosecutions of mortgage fraud and insider trading. The U.S. Justice Department pointed us to its StopFraud.gov website, and sent us a long list of other ongoing actions against mortgage fraud, investment fraud, insider trading and other corporate offenses.

But the cases have not involved the highly prominent executives Moore described as bringing down the U.S. economy. (We contacted Moore for comment but did not hear back.)

Why not more prosecutions?

In reviewing the research and talking to experts about why there have not been more prosecutions associated with the financial crisis, we found several reasons.

For one thing, such cases tend to be difficult, and it's not immediately clear what offenses executives could be charged with. 

""You can't get up in front of a jury and say, 'These guys were responsible for bringing down the economy, so please convict them of a crime,'"" said Samuel Buell, a professor of law at Duke University, who studies criminal law and the regulation of corporations and financial markets. 

Criminal intent can be particularly hard to prove, and federal officials may be struggling to bring specific charges against individuals who believed they were following the law.  
Buell dismissed the idea that the Obama administration is simply indifferent to corporate crime. 

""There's no downside to putting a few people in prison and showing you're tough on corporate crime,"" he said. ""You can only imagine that would be a political benefit to this administration, which makes me think the only thing holding them back is problems of proof. The last thing they would want to do is bring a big, splashy case against the banks, and then lose and be called incompetent.""

William Black, a professor of law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law who studies elite financial fraud, was involved in a string of successful prosecutions against savings and loan officials back in the 1980s. He said the problem now is that financial regulators are not working closely enough with prosecutors to investigate and bring charges against executives. 

""It is hard, and it does take resources, and it takes expertise in fraud mechanisms so you can explain it to a jury,"" Black said. ""But this is frankly easier than the savings and loan crisis. There's nothing complicated about a liar's loan.""

Black said that back in the 1980s, financial regulators routinely referred information to prosecutors to prosecute savings and loan executives. That hasn't happened this time around.

Earlier this year, the New York Times published a detailed report on why there have not been more high-profile prosecutions; it's the single best report we've seen on the issue. Its investigation found stark differences between how prosecutors and regulators handled the S&L crisis and how the same authorities are handling the current crisis. (See this chart comparing the two eras.) It also included a list of potential crimes suggested by legal experts outside of the federal government.

As we were looking into this issue, President Barack Obama spoke about whether federal efforts have been strong enough when it comes to prosecuting crimes associated with the financial crisis. Jake Tapper of ABC News asked him to respond to the Occupy Wall Street protesters and their anger that the Obama administration hasn't been more aggressive with prosecutions. 

""One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehmans and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal, it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless. That's exactly why we needed to pass Dodd-Frank, to prohibit some of these practices,"" Obama said. (Dodd-Frank was an overhaul of the finance industry that Obama signed into law on July 21, 2010.)

""The financial sector is very creative, and they are always looking for ways to make money. That's their job. And if there are loopholes and rules that can be bent and arbitrage to be had, they will take advantage of it. So without commenting on particular prosecutions -- obviously that's not my job; that's the Attorney General's job -- I think part of people's frustrations, part of my frustration, was a lot of practices that should not have been allowed weren't necessarily against the law, but they had a huge destructive impact. And that's why it was important for us to put in place financial rules that protect the American people from reckless decision-making and irresponsible behavior.""

Our ruling

Moore said, ""Not a single banker, a CEO from Wall Street, anyone from corporate America — nobody, (there was) not one arrest of any of these people who brought down the economy in 2008."" Well, there have been a few arrests. Certainly the executives of Taylor, Bean & Whitaker who were arrested would qualify as ""corporate America.""

But Moore's larger point is correct -- there have been very few arrests among executives of firms the public would associate with causing the financial crisis. Obama implied in his recent remarks that it was because many of their actions weren't criminal.

Whatever the cause, we rate Moore's statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3AB800>],/factchecks/2011/oct/07/michael-moore/no-ceos-have-been-arrested-bringing-down-economy-s/
