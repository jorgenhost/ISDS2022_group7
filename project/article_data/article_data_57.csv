He's a year too late on this energy claim
","
Trying to tap the popular ire over gas prices, Barack Obama told an Iowa crowd the day after Christmas 2007, ""Gas prices have never been higher, and Exxon Mobil's profits have never been higher.""
 
He's wrong on both counts.
 
Gas prices have soared this year, and so have the profits of Exxon Mobil and other companies. But in saying they've ""never been higher,"" Obama overstates the case.
 
The price for a gallon of gas peaked in March 1981 at $1.42 a gallon, said Jonathan Cogan, a senior analyst for the Energy Information Administration. Sounds cheap, but factor in inflation and that's a whopping $3.38 per gallon.
 
Two days before Obama gave his speech, the Energy Information Administration put the price of gas at $2.98 per gallon — 40 cents less than the inflation-adjusted 1981 price.
 
Even without inflation, Obama had it wrong. In May 2007, prices hit $3.218 per gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration, which has tracked the average weekly price of gasoline for decades.
 
PolitiFact will grant that gas prices are uncomfortably high for many of us. Does that mean Exxon Mobil is raking in more dough than ever?
 
Not at the moment. The company did earn record annual profits of $39.5-billion in 2006. Their record-breaking streak continued through the first quarter of 2007, according to the company's quarterly statements.
 
But the company's second quarter sales fell billions short of Wall Street expectations. Profits declined in the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2007, profit fell 1 percent from the same period in 2006.
 
The Irving, Texas, company still posted healthy profits of nearly $29-billion, but Obama was wrong. Exxon Mobil's profits have been higher.
 
Too bad Obama didn't give his speech in January 2007. It would have been half true. But this week, he's just plain wrong.
 

UPDATE:

On Feb. 1, 2008, Exxon Mobil announced a $40.6-billion net profit -- a record. But Obama made his statement more than a month earlier and, as we explain above, the company had not released record profits at that time -- nor were gas prices at record highs. So we're going to keep our False ruling, but we will acknowledge that Obama was prescient, at least as it relates to Exxon Mobil's financial performance.

McCain wants to keep it on life support
","Gov. Mitt Romney has a television ad in New Hampshire that attacks Sen. John McCain for his positions on taxes and illegal immigrants.
 
Specifically, he charges that McCain ""opposes repeal of the death tax,"" officially called the estate tax, a tax on the property passed forward and received at death.
 
Just looking at the votes, Romney is right. The issue has come before the U.S. Senate at least three times, and each time McCain voted against permanently repealing the estate tax.
 
But in a closer look at McCain's record, we find he supports a plan that would render the tax moot for most people.
 
McCain says he wants a tax exemption on estates worth up to $10-million and a 15 percent tax on inheritances worth more than that.
 
Under that plan, about 95 percent of the estate tax returns filed in 2006 would be exempt, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics. Which means the tax would survive for only the wealthiest few.
 
Still, given McCain's votes against repealing the tax, we rule Romney's claim Mostly True.

Even he admits it's not true
","Mitt Romney had his flip-flop feet held to the fire by

Meet the Press

host Tim Russert on Dec. 16, 2007, and made this statement claiming he was endorsed by the National Rifle Association during his 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor.
 
But he wasn't.
 
The

Washington Post

picked up on the error that day and posted on its blog ""The Trail."" The story included a backpedaling quote from the Romney campaign.
 
""The NRA did not endorse in the 2002 campaign,"" spokesman Kevin Madden said in the

Post

blog.
 
A couple of days later, Romney campaign spokesman Kristy Campbell elaborated to PolitiFact: ""They did not officially endorse, but there had been folks doing supportive phone banking for him.""
 
We called the NRA several days in a row seeking comment and confirmation of Campbell's statement about phone banking. Despite promising to call PolitiFact back, no one did. And we could find no independent verification.
 
We did find something funny: Turns out the NRA endorsed a Romney for public office, just not Mitt.
 
Ronna Romney, divorced from Gov. Romney's brother Scott, earned the NRA's support in 1996 as she campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat representing Michigan. She won the primary, but lost to incumbent Sen. Carl Levin.
 
Maybe that's why Mitt was confused. At least he admits it's False.

George Romney and MLK marched, but not together
","Mitt Romney has said several times that he saw his father George Romney march with the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.
 
But the Romney campaign was forced to admit recently that Romney meant ""saw"" in the figurative sense after the

Boston Phoenix

, a weekly newspaper, looked into the claim.
 
Romney said it was a figure of speech and that he meant he was aware of his father marching with King. (For the curious, the Merriam-Webster Collegiate dictionary also defines ""see"" as ""to form a mental picture of,"" ""to perceive the meaning or importance of,"" and ""to be aware of."")
 
Three newspapers have tried and failed to find evidence of the two men marching together. The

Boston Phoenix

first checked Romney's statement and concluded it was false. Subsequent examinations by the

Detroit Free Press

and the

Boston Globe

found no news stories linking the two men to the same event.
 
We at Politifact.com reviewed the

New York Times

archives and found several mentions of Romney's support for King and several articles discussing marches that each participated in separately, but never a mention of the two marching together. The elder Romney was then the Republican governor of Michigan, which has a significant African-American population. King, of course, was the most celebrated civil rights leader of his day. It seems unlikely that the

Times

would have missed covering a march where the two appeared together.
 
The

Globe

interviewed Susan Englander, associate director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University, who said, ""I researched this question, and indeed it is untrue that George Romney marched with Martin Luther King.""
 
We spoke with Englander on Dec. 28, 2007, and she said she stood by that statement and does not expect evidence to turn up to contradict it.
 
The Romney campaign has pointed to a line in a history book (""The Republican Establishment: The Present And Future Of The G.O.P., 1967,"" by Stephen Hess and David Broder, p. 107) that says the elder Romney and King marched in Grosse Pointe. Two witnesses also told Politico, a political news web site, that they remembered the men marching together almost 45 years ago in Grosse Pointe. But newspaper accounts from the time and historians contradict these assertions. There is no other support for the contention that the men were in Grosse Pointe together.
 
But it's also clear that George Romney, who served as governor from 1963 to 1969 and died in 1995, supported King's goals at a time when few politicians did. When King visited Detroit and led a rally of 125,000 people in 1963, Romney issued a proclamation and sent personal representatives. (The

Times

report noted that Romney was Mormon and did not make public appearances on Sundays.) Two years later, Romney led a march of 10,000 people in Detroit to protest events in Selma, Ala. (King wasn't there.) When King died in 1968, George Romney attended the funeral.
 
""Romney, as a member of the liberal wing of the Republican party, was stalwart civil rights supporter,"" Englander said. ""He consistently supported integration.""
 
Given the elder Romney's notable support for King's politics, we can understand how people might believe, many years later, that they did march together. And it's arguably a minor point: You could call it a coincidence of history that they never attended the same event at the same time. Mitt Romney, who would have been 16 in 1963, said recently, ""I think the thing that's relevant is that my dad was a champion in the civil rights movement, that he aligned himself with Martin Luther King.""
 
That part is true. Nevertheless, Mitt Romney's statement that he saw his father march with Martin Luther King remains problematic at best. If he'd stopped at saying his father was a champion of the civil rights movement, he would have been on solid ground. Balancing the lack of evidence that the two men marched together against the elder Romney's well-documented support of Martin Luther King, we rate Romney's statement Barely True.

Romney refused to pardon soldier - and everyone else
","
In response to a TV ad by Mitt Romney that highlights Mike Huckabee's 1,000-plus pardons, Huckabee tried to turn the tables and said Romney's refusal to grant pardons denied people who committed small crimes a chance to clear their records.
 
Huckabee cited one case involving ""a decorated soldier"" who wanted to become a police officer but still had a criminal record from a minor incident when he was 13 years old and shot another boy with a BB gun. ""Didn't even break the skin,"" Huckabee said on NBC's Today Show on Dec. 19.
 
Huckabee is accurately describing the case of a soldier named Anthony Circosta of Agawam, Mass., a member of the Army National Guard who fought in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star. He then sought a pardon so he could become a police officer, but was turned down. Circosta did not return a phone call from PolitiFact this week, but Huckabee's description of the case is supported by accounts in the Associated Press and other publications.
 
""Now, I would have given that kid a pardon,"" Huckabee said about Circosta in a Fox News Channel interview on Dec. 20. ""And everywhere I've gone and asked people for a show of hands, everybody agrees with me.""
 
Romney refused all pardon requests in his four years as governor. ""I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury,"" he said during a June 2007 debate.
 
When he was asked about his policy in December 2007, Romney replied ""We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity.""
 
He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process.

Romney did 'help save' teen
","
A TV ad by Mitt Romney features former business partner Robert Gay crediting Romney with helping reunite Gay with his daughter after she went missing. 
On July 6, 1996 the girl sneaked off during the weekend to go to a rave party in New York City, where she took the drug Ecstasy, according to news reports at the time. She had told her parents she was playing tennis. 
When she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa. 
Bain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort. 
According to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teenaged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11. 
Lt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police said police reports at the time do not mention Romney, but Peterson and reports at the time show the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl. 
""The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on channel 7 and called in,"" said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station. 
Gay says Romney helped ""save"" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. ""Doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day,"" according to the  Boston Globe  in 2002. 
Newsday  reported in July 1996 that ""Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ..."" 
""She was not harmed,"" Robert Gay said at new conference after she was found, according to the New  York Daily News  . ""She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home."" 
The ad says Romney ""helped save"" the girl, and we certainly aren't going to argue over the physical condition of the girl when she was found. Her Dad says she was ""saved,"" and under the circumstances we won't disagree. The ad also says Romney ""helped."" Hard to argue with that either. True.

Yes, Huckabee pardoned many
","In a TV ad, Mitt Romney tries to portray Mike Huckabee as soft on crime because Huckabee ""granted 1,033 pardons and commutations."" The ad says Huckabee's number is ""more clemencies than the previous three governors combined"" and says that Romney himself has not issued any pardons.
 
We find Romney is accurately describing Huckabee's record. The 1,033 total for Huckabee's 10 years in office comes from an Associated Press examination of Huckabee's pardons and commutations. The Arkansas Secretary of State's office told PolitiFact the count was 1,058, which is not significantly different. Romney's claim that Huckabee granted more clemencies ""than the previous three governors combined"" also is correct according to the totals from the Secretary of State.
 
State officials in Massachusetts confirm Romney's record. He had about 150 applications for pardons and 80 applications for commuting sentences in his four-year term. He granted none.
 
The result is a striking difference: Huckabee has granted more than 1,000, while Romney hasn't granted any (although he has said he would consider pardoning White House aide Scooter Libby because the case involved an overzealous prosecutor).
 
Huckabee, a Baptist minister, says he was trying to give a second chance to people who had been convicted of minor crimes.
 
""A lot of (the pardons) that I gave were for 35-year-old single moms with kids who wanted to get a job anywhere in a nursing home emptying a bed pan, but because of the background check couldn't because when they were 18 they'd written a hot check,"" he said in a Dec. 19 interview on MSNBC's

Morning Joe.

 
Huckabee even pardoned Keith Richards, a guitarist for the Rolling Stones who had an outstanding ticket for reckless driving.
 
By contrast, Romney has a zero-tolerance approach. ""I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury,"" he said during a June 2007 debate.
 
When he was asked about his policy in December 2006, Romney replied ""We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity."" He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process.
 
In interviews, Huckabee has portrayed Romney as a political opportunist who took a hard line on pardons to appear tough on crime, while Huckabee's pardons were politically risky but better for the people of Arkansas.
 
""Now, if I'd played politics with all those people, I wouldn't have ever granted one single clemency, not one,"" Huckabee said on MSNBC. ""But this shouldn't be about playing politics with people's lives. It ought to be about looking at every case with honesty, making decisions. And, yes, sometimes they don't turn out so brilliantly. I've made mistakes. But I've tried to make the mistake on the ledger of thinking what would be in the best interest of all of us. Do I want this person unemployed for the rest of their life?""

"['National', 'Education', 'Mike Huckabee']","
Not quite the best
","Standing on a stage in Iowa, amid all his competitors for the Republican presidential primary, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee made a bold claim. Of all the candidates, he said, he owned ""the most impressive"" education record.
 
""We raised standards, we measured and we held people accountable for the results,"" he said.
 
It might seem an easy thing to prove. He had 10 years of executive leadership under his belt, compared to Mitt Romney's four and Rudy Giuliani's eight. The others, of course, had none, leaving this a contest where only three could compete.
 
Huckabee also had a pretty hefty resume behind him, including past chairmanships of the Education Commission of the States and the Southern Regional Education Board. And under his watch, he pushed for or signed legislation that improved Arkansas teacher pay, curriculum standards and education funding.
 
The results were quite remarkable. As the Education Trust reports, Arkansas was the biggest gainer in fourth-grade math and second best in eighth-grade math over seven years of the national exam known as the ""nation's report card.""
 
By the time of the debate, in fact, Huckabee had become the only Republican to be endorsed by the New Hampshire chapter of the National Education Association.
 
But as is the case with all claims of being the best or worst of something, Huckabee's takes just a small amount of poking to find points that deflate the logic.
 
First, consider Romney's record. Though in office a shorter time than Huckabee, Romney certainly can claim as strong, if not stronger, results. Massachusetts fourth- and eighth-graders rated first in the nation in both math and science on the ""nation's report card"" in both 2005 and 2007.
 
Education Week rated Massachusetts as fifth on its 2007 ""chance for success"" index, compared to Arkansas' 39th.
 
Second, consider Huckabee's critics, who say the former governor claims too much credit.
 
Tom Kimbrell, a former superintendent who now heads the Arkansas Association of Educational Administrators, minces no words in assessing Huckabee's tenure: ""He was the governor of Arkansas, but as far as being part of the process, he was not present. There was no leadership at all.""
 
Kimbrell, who was knee-deep in many of the state's education issues during Huckabee's tenure, said the Legislature and the state's education organizations made things happen on most key issues.
 
And when Huckabee did press his views, such as on arts education and consolidation of small school districts, Kimbrell contended the results were not positive. Consolidation did not save money as promised, though it did disrupt many small rural communities. And a mandate for arts education came without funding and ended up as part of a lawsuit.
 
Gary Ritter, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Arkansas, put it this way: ""He took unpopular stands in favor of strategies he believed would work. I'm not sure if they worked.""
 
Did Huckabee act on education issues? Yes. Was his record the ""most impressive"" of the bunch? Romney certainly competes. So we rate Huckabee's boast Half True.

Study quantifies homeless vets
","In a Christmas message that ran as a television ad, John Edwards said he wanted to remember the less fortunate. He opened with the surprising statistic: One in four homeless people is a vet.
 
Counting the number of homeless people is a challenging proposition, much less quantifying their military backgrounds. The number appears to come from a November 2007 study from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The nonprofit used data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that estimated the number of homeless veterans in a given VA facility's service area. The alliance than combined that data with their own population estimates for the homeless nationwide.
 
The study cited data from 2005 that showed out of 744,313 homeless people in a given year, 194,254 were veterans. That means that 26 percent of the homeless are veterans, even though veterans only make up 11 percent of the U.S. population over 18 years old, according to U.S. Census data. The study counted people who were homeless at any time, even briefly, during the year, not just the chronically homeless.
 
It's also worth noting that the number of homeless veterans fluctuates over time because of natural demographic changes and because of the numbers of people who served in the military at any given time in history. Homeless advocates expect the percentage of homeless veterans is a number that changes as the years go by.
 
The 2007 study is an estimate, but it's based on data compiled, at least in part, by a federal agency, and it appears to be the latest data available. Other studies have found lower estimates of the national homeless population, but using a more conservative number for the overall homeless would have the effect of increasing the percentage of homeless veterans.
 
Although Edwards is relying on the best available data, it's still extremely difficult to count homeless people because not all of them come in contact with service providers or other agencies. Some have health issues like addiction and mental illness that make them reluctant to be counted. Even reputable studies sometimes find different estimates for the homeless.
 
Though the percentage of homeless veterans is an estimate, the number Edwards cites appears to be based on the latest available and was partially compiled by the federal agency that serves veterans. So he is on solid ground. But we have to take off a little bit for his emphatic statement of what's actually a complex estimate. For that reason, we find his statement to be Mostly True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Club for Growth']","
He supported tax hikes to balance budget
","For months, the antitax group Club for Growth has been targeting Mike Huckabee for supporting tax hikes when he was governor of Arkansas. With just a week before the January 2008 Iowa caucuses, the group has bought $175,000 in air time for an ad that tries to use Huckabee's own words against him.
 
The ad begins with images of Democratic congressional leaders and says that ""to stop massive tax hikes, conservatives have to be united. But listen to Mike Huckabee, when he was Arkansas governor ...""
 
It cuts to Huckabee giving a speech to the Arkansas Legislature in May 2003:
 
""There's a lot of support for a tax at the wholesale level for tobacco, and that's fine with me. I will very happily sign that. Others have suggested a surcharge on the income tax. That's acceptable; I'm fine with that,"" he says.
 
""Others have suggested perhaps a sales tax. That's fine. Yet others have suggested a hybrid that would collect some monies from any one or a combination of those various ideas, and if that's the plan that the House and Senate agree upon, then you will have nothing but my profound thanks.""
 
Words on the screen say ""As governor, Mike Huckabee supported higher income taxes, sales taxes, gas taxes, grocery taxes, tobacco taxes, beer taxes, Internet taxes, nursing home bed taxes.""
 
The video has been cited by many Huckabee critics and was even used last week in a parody of Huckabee's Christmas ad. (It showed Huckabee in a red sweater in front of a Christmas tree, offering to raise taxes.)
 
We have addressed some of the Club's attacks on Huckabee with our previous article

""Taking stock of 'Tax-hike Mike,' ""

so here we will focus on the TV ad.
 
To understand Huckabee's comments, it's important to include the context for his speech. He delivered the remarks during a 2003 special session that was called to balance the state's budget in the face of a projected shortfall of more than $60-million. Lawmakers were divided over how to make up the shortfall; some wanted to use tobacco taxes while others preferred increases to income or sales taxes.
 
Huckabee said in the speech that the state had already cut $380-million from the budget and that tax increases were inevitable to pay for vital state services.
 
""We're no longer talking about merely shaving some excess. We're talking about amputating valuable and vital limbs, if we don't come up with necessary funding to meet the needs of those who depend on it,"" Huckabee said.
 
In the clip, Huckabee is trying to address the lack of consensus in the Legislature by indicating his willingness to be flexible and consider different types of tax increases.
 
But the Club for Growth ad lacks that context. It uses 40 seconds of Huckabee's speech to suggest he supports ""massive tax hikes.""
 
The Huckabee campaign has said he had little choice but to support a tax increase because Arkansas state law requires a balanced budget. ""Unable to resort to deficit spending – as other candidates are able to do – the Arkansas Legislature was forced to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure repair, conservation efforts, court-mandated education expenditures, and unfunded federal mandates,"" his campaign said Dec. 26, 2007, in a statement.
 
As for the specific taxes cited in the ad, the Club is correct that Huckabee supported increases in income taxes, sales taxes, gas taxes, tobacco taxes, Internet taxes and nursing home bed taxes. He also opposed the repeal of grocery and beer taxes, which the the Club says indicates he supported ""higher taxes.""
 
Overall, we find the Club for Growth ad to be technically correct because Huckabee did support the tax hikes cited or opposed repeals of the others. But the ad is misleading because it takes his comments out of context given the financial crisis he was dealing with in Arkansas and the mandate to balance the budget. And so we find the Club's claim to be Half True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Bill Richardson']","
He hypes the language, the numbers
","In a Democratic debate on Nov. 15, 2007, Bill Richardson had a startling way to support his view that the situation in Iraq is not improving: ""What I'm saying, also, is that look at this statistic — 65 percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier.""
 
Where did that number come from? Katie Roberts, Richardson's deputy communications director, points to a BBC-sponsored poll of Iraqis in September 2007. BBC says the poll was conducted in face-to-face interviews with 2,212 people ""in more than 450 neighborhoods across all 18 provinces of Iraq in August, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5%.""
 
But the poll does not directly support the 65 percent figure. Nor does the poll put the question nearly as starkly as Richardson stated.
 
""Thinking about the political action of other people,"" the question says, ""do you find each of these items to be acceptable or not acceptable?"" The first item was ""attacks on coalition forces,"" and 57 percent of the respondents found them ""acceptable."" Among Sunnis, 93 percent said ""acceptable;"" among Shiites, it was 50 percent, and among Kurds, it was 5 percent.
 
It's not at all clear that the same number would have said it is acceptable if people had been asked, ""Is it okay to shoot an American soldier?"" So Richardson is at least casting the response in more dramatic terms than the question interviewers asked. At the same time, the poll clearly suggests that about half of the Iraqi people consider attacks on coalition forces ""acceptable.""
 
The Richardson campaign did not respond to our request to explain the disparity in numbers.
 
Polling expert John G. Geer, professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and editor of the forthcoming

Encyclopedia of Public Opinion,

theorized that Richardson excluded the responses of Kurds.
 
Sure enough, if you subtract the 354 Kurd responses from the 2,212 total, the math supports Richardson's 65 percent figure. This makes sense if you consider many Kurds would eventually like to have a state of their own. But removing the Kurds exaggerates the poll results and does not accurately reflect Richardson's statement, which referred only to ""the Iraqi people.""
 
""The question,"" says Geer, ""is whether 'attacks on coalition forces' equates to 'shooting an American soldier,' which of course it doesn't. Possibly they'd be

more

likely to say it's acceptable, I don't know.""
 
He adds, ""It's generally a fair point to say Iraqis are unhappy with the American presence in Iraq. The general point has some validity, but he's exaggerated. That's what campaigns do.""
 
And what we do is call them on it. Richardson wasn't just ""juicing the numbers,"" as Geer said. He was deliberately hyping the language and hyping the numbers to make a stronger point than the facts justified. The best we can rule is Barely True.

Obama sworn in on his Bible
","
An anonymous e-mail says Barack Obama took the oath of office for the U.S. Senate on a Koran, the holy book of Islam. We thought it would be odd if that were true, since Obama is a Christian. In fact, it is wrong. 
The e-mail also spells the book's name ""Kuran,"" though usually it is spelled Koran or Quran. 
Two press reports from Obama's swearing-in ceremony in January 2005 mention specifically that Obama took the oath of office by placing his hand on his own copy of the Bible. The Barack Obama campaign also confirmed that it was a Bible and that the book belonged to Obama. Vice President Dick Cheney, in his role as president of the Senate, administered the oath. 
After being raised outside of any particular faith tradition, Obama became a Christian in his mid 20s and is a member of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. (Obama gave what are arguably his most extended remarks on his faith at the ""Call to Renewal"" religious conference in 2006; read the speech  here  .) 
We suspect this false claim was inspired by the 2007 swearing-in of Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., an American convert to Islam and the first Muslim elected to Congress. Ellison used a Koran that once belonged to Thomas Jefferson, borrowing the rare book from the Library of Congress. 
It goes without saying that Ellison is not Obama. And with its intent to inflame, we find the e-mail's allegation not only false, but Pants-on-Fire wrong. 
UPDATE:  Barack Obama  resigned from Trinity United Church of Christ  on May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. made controversial remarks about U.S. foreign policy and other matters.

Obama attended an Indonesian public school
","
An anonymous e-mail makes a number of specious claims to promote its Manchurian Candidate-style conspiracy theory, including, ""Obama was enrolled in a Wahabi school in Jakarta. Wahabism is the RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world."" 
Like many Internet smears, the e-mail starts with a bit of truth before lurching wildly into fantasy. It's true that Obama's father was from Africa, and Obama has said his father was born a Muslim. Obama's stepfather was from Indonesia, raised a Muslim. But there's no evidence that either man was particularly religious as an adult — Obama's father is sometimes described as an atheist, while his stepfather drank alcohol, forbidden in Islam. Obama's American mother, Ann Dunham, rejected organized religion, according to several accounts. Obama has summed up his own faith history by saying he didn't grow up in any particular religious tradition. (Obama's mother, father and stepfather are all deceased.) 
Obama lived in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather from 1967 to 1971, approximately from the ages of 6 to 10. In 1971, he returned to the United States and graduated from high school in Hawaii. 
""Madrassa"" is an Arabic word for ""school,"" but Americans generally understand the word to mean a school where anti-Western Islamic ideology is taught. The e-mail says the school taught Wahabism, a ""RADICAL teaching that is followed by the Muslim terrorists who are now waging Jihad against the western world."" Westerners typically understand Wahabism to be an austere form of Islam based on a literal reading of the Koran. So is that the type of school Obama attended? 
No. Indonesia is a Muslim country, and Obama attended a public school there, which taught a small amount of religion. CNN, the Associated Press, the  Los Angeles Times  and the  Chicago Tribune  investigated the e-mail claims by visiting the school and interviewing former teachers and students who were there at the same time as Obama. These investigations found a public school where students wore Western clothing and prayer was a small part of the curriculum. The  Chicago Tribune  reported the school was ""so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate Christmas."" 
PolitiFact found no on-the-record sources able to substantiate a claim that the school taught Wahabism or any other form of austere Islam. The great preponderance of substantiated evidence indicates Obama attended a public school that taught a small amount of mainstream Islam. The news reports say that Obama's registration form indicates his religion was Muslim, but there are errors on the forms and it seems reasonable to assume that he was registered as Muslim simply because his stepfather was Muslim. And it's worth noting — as the chain e-mail does — that Obama also attended a Catholic school in Indonesia for several years. 
So while the e-mail gets a few things right, its contention that Obama attended a madrassa that taught Wahabism seems to be a wholesale invention designed to frighten voters. We rate the claim Pants-on-Fire wrong.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966F7DC0>],/factchecks/2007/dec/20/chain-email/obama-attended-an-indonesian-public-school/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden says Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan would 'eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.'
","
During the vice presidential debate in Danville, Ky., Joe Biden attacked the Republican ticket’s proposal for Medicare.

Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, Biden said, would ""eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.""

We tackled this point when President Barack Obama made a similar point in September. We asked: Are there ""guaranteed benefits"" for Medicare today? And if so, would they be at risk if Romney wins? A lot of it depends on how you define these words.

What guarantees exist under Medicare today?

Probably the clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked.

That wasn’t always the case. Before Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965, health coverage for seniors was far from guaranteed. When people retired, they often lost coverage they had from their former employer and couldn’t afford a new plan. (For more on the pre-Medicare era, including statistics, see our article, ""Were the early 1960s a golden age for health care?"")

The Obama campaign goes further. It argues that ""guaranteed benefits"" refers to ""all the benefits that Medicare is required to cover."" Today, Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting one’s benefits depend on the amount of money they paid into the system.

""As a system of defined benefits, Medicare does guarantee those benefits,"" said Paul Starr, a specialist on health care reform at Princeton University. ""The government has a responsibility for them that it would not have in a defined-contribution scheme. There are a host of legal rights in regard to providers that are also associated with those guaranteed benefits. All that goes away with the shift to defined contribution.""

Is there a guarantee of benefits?

No, Medicare benefits aren’t guaranteed in every sense.

First, while the federal government guarantees that you will be served by Medicare once you turn 65, it doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get every possible service or treatment paid for. Indeed, an entire industry sector -- Medigap insurance plans-- has emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn’t cover. This is particularly true for the coverage for newly emergent technologies and treatments.

And just because something is covered today doesn’t mean it will be covered indefinitely, or at the same percentage of the cost.

Congress and the president can -- and do -- change the benefit rules for Medicare. In 1988, for example, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, adding a bevy of benefits, including a prescription drug benefit and a catastrophic-care benefit, said Robert Moffit, a health care specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The following year, Congress repealed it.

Obama’s own health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, doesn’t maintain the status quo indefinitely. While we have previously said that the Romney campaign is exaggerating when it criticizes Obama for cutting Medicare, the Romney campaign isn’t wrong that changes are going to be made. The fact that Obama would reduce Medicare reimbursement to certain Medicare providers -- likely resulting in the elimination or reduction of some benefits -- is proof positive that Medicare is not a fixed, unchangeable program.

Obama’s law also creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member, appointed panel that is charged with identifying Medicare savings. While PolitiFact has in the past been critical of Republican exaggerations about what the board would do, the board could force certain changes in the Medicare program. Any such future changes would undermine the notion that Medicare has ""guaranteed benefits.""

""If you are promised a benefit but find trouble accessing physicians or home care or long-term-care providers to provide that service, have your benefits been changed or compromised?"" said Gail Wilensky, a former health care official under President George H.W. Bush. ""I think a reasonable person could say yes.""

Another important factor that could infringe on any Medicare ""guarantee"" is the program’s fiscal challenges.

According to Medicare’s actuary, the trust fund for Medicare Part A -- the part of the program that pays for hospital care -- will run out in 2024 if the Obama law’s cuts remain on the books, or in 2016 if the cuts are rescinded (the course Romney has said he wants to follow). So unless something is done to change the program’s fiscal balance, Medicare would spend down its reserves for hospital payments within eight to 16 years.

""If you define guarantee benefit as simply receiving a Medicare card, then that only lasts until the money runs out,"" said Joshua Archambault, a former Romney aide who is now a health care policy specialist at the free-market Pioneer Institute. ""So I guess the president can make that claim until 2016 … but then he loses it.""

Even health care experts who are supportive of Obama’s law do acknowledge that the concept of a Medicare ""guarantee"" may be too strongly worded.

""So long as the law is in place, people who meet specified eligibility requirements are assured specified benefits,"" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Still, ""nothing in the statutes is ‘guaranteed,’ because Congress always has the option of changing the law.""

Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has advised both Obama and Romney on health care reform, agreed. ""Under today's system, you have a guaranteed benefit, but one that is subject to political risk,"" he said.

How Romney would change Medicare

As for Romney’s plan, it’s important to note that it has not been been set out in full detail, and it hasn’t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. But we’ll explain it as best we can.

Romney has said his plan would be close to the most recent one offered by his running mate, Paul Ryan. For people who are now under age 55, Medicare would no longer pay for seniors’ health care bills directly. Instead, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available.

We know that the Romney plan, like the status quo, would preserve the guarantee that people will start receiving coverage under a federal health care program when they turn 65. (The age threshold would gradually rise to 67 by 2034.)

Less clear is whether the operational changes Romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under Medicare. The Romney campaign argues that not only would be traditional Medicare be a choice, but that private plan offerings must provide coverage at least comparable to what Medicare provides today, and that those plans would be Medicare-approved.

However, since CBO hasn’t weighed in, we don’t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, especially over the longer term.

The Obama campaign argues that ""Romney has said that under his voucher system, plans have to offer coverage that is ‘comparable’ to Medicare today"" -- a term they believe falls short of a guarantee of specific benefits.

But Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health-care issues for President George W. Bush, says that’s a smokescreen. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ""establishes the benefits covered by Medicare each year, and the private insurers in Medicare Advantage and Part D, the drug benefit, are required to cover at least that minimum benefit or its actuarial equivalent. That's exactly the Romney proposal.""

Under the most recent plan, Levin said, ""seniors are guaranteed at least one and generally two options that provide comprehensive coverage for no greater out-of-pocket costs than they have now.""

Levin also disputes the notion that the Romney plan is a pure defined-contribution plan. ""The Romney approach is a hybrid of defined benefit and defined contribution,"" he said. ""The minimum benefit is set by the government, and all competing insurers must meet it, but the government payment is determined by competitive bidding among those insurers to see how cheaply they can provide at least that minimum benefit.""

The most recent Republican plans have lessened the likelihood that Medicare’s payment will fall behind the actual rise in health care costs, experts say, but given the limited details, there’s still some uncertainty on this front.

Under the Romney plan, MIT’s Gruber said, you have the same political risk of a broken guarantee as you have today, but that guarantee is compounded by health spending risk. ""As health spending rises faster than your voucher, you are in trouble,"" he said.

Our ruling

Biden said that Romney and Ryan would ""eliminate the guarantee of Medicare.""

Calling today’s Medicare benefits ""guaranteed"" is partially, but not entirely, true. Currently, Medicare does guarantee broad health coverage for seniors and, in the short term, guarantees specific benefits. But Medicare doesn’t cover everything, and Congress and the president can change what is covered -- and will be forced to do so when fiscal pressures hit.

Meanwhile, it’s plausible that the Romney plan could provide less of a ""guarantee"" than Medicare currently does, but we found sharp disagreement between supporters and opponents of Romney’s Medicare plan on that point. This disagreement is hard to resolve given the shortage of information Romney has so far provided.

On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE2880>],/factchecks/2012/oct/12/joe-biden/says-mitt-romney-paul-ryan-would-eliminate-guarant/

Obama says his plan made ""some adjustments"" to Simpson-Bowles
","
Mitt Romney has accused President Barack Obama of essentially missing the bus on the Simpson-Bowles commission’s recommendations to reduce the deficit. Obama shot back that he is in the driver’s seat -- he simply adjusted that commission’s recommendations for his own version of deficit reduction.

Here’s the back and forth from the Oct. 3 debate in Denver:

Romney: ""Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.""

Moderator Jim Lehrer: ""Do you support Simpson-Bowles?""

Romney: ""I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson-Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.""

Obama: ""That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...""

Obama’s answer could leave the impression that his own deficit reduction plan simply made ""some adjustments"" to Simpson-Bowles, and therefore that commission’s recommendations didn’t languish or die.

But is that the truth? In this fact-check, we will explore the differences between the Simpson-Bowles recommendations and Obama’s plan.

The Simpson-Bowles plan

First, here’s a little history on the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction proposal. (We’ve fact-checked claims about it before.)

Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform by executive order in February 2010. It included 18 members, split between Democratic and Republican appointees, who were charged with studying the federal budget, ""identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run.""

In December 2010, the commission released its final report, which included dozens of proposals to cut discretionary spending, reform the tax code and Social Security and rein in health care costs, among other measures. This proposal was named after the panel’s co-chairs, former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton.

The proposal failed to achieve enough ""yes"" votes from the 18 members to have the proposal sent to Congress. One of the ""no"" votes was from Romney’s eventual running mate: U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

The members’ rationales for voting ""no"" ranged from taxes to Social Security to federal spending -- either too much or too little, depending on the dissent in question.

The group’s report shows total deficit reduction between 2012 and 2020 would be about $4 trillion. The panel proposed cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending totaling $2.2 trillion and estimated interest savings of $673 billion. The remainder of the deficit reduction total involves new revenues -- a combination of closing tax loopholes and increasing certain types of taxes and other revenue streams. The new tax revenues work out to $995 billion over that period.

 Experts cite similarities and differences

We sent the Romney-Obama exchange to economists, and they summarized some key similarities and differences between Simpson-Bowles and Obama’s plan. 
Our experts included: Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense; Howard Gleckman, editor of TaxVox, the fiscal policy blog of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center; Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition; Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; Alan Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Jason Peuquet and Marc Goldwein, both of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Our experts agreed that Obama and Simpson-Bowles shared a general framework that included both tax increases and spending cuts. But beyond that, whether you agree that Obama made ""some adjustments"" to Simpson-Bowles depends on your definition of ""some adjustments.""

One of our experts -- Gleckman -- described Obama’s wording here as ""legalese"" or ""Talmudic."" Other than the general framework, ""these plans have very little common,"" Gleckman said. 
Many of our experts cited vast differences between the two plans.

Viard, who served on the President’s Council of Economic advisers under President George W. Bush, said, ""It’s a little misleading for the president to say he merely made ‘some adjustments’ to Simpson-Bowles.""

It’s no surprise that an appointed commission would recommend more ambitious reform than someone holding elected office -- the commission had the freedom to do that, Viard said.

But ""if the president had felt it was in his interest to distinguish the two plans he could have easily justified very sweeping language. He could have said my plan is a lot different ... That would have been more credible,"" Viard said.

Let’s summarize some of those key differences:

Amount of deficit reduction: Simpson-Bowles reduces the deficit more than Obama. Simpson-Bowles shows a reduction of $4 trillion by 2020 while Obama shows that same amount by 2022. If we add two years to the Simpson-Bowles plan, the reduction rises to $6.3 trillion.

Both plans put public debt on a downward path as a share of the economy later this decade but again, Simpson-Bowles goes further, Peuquet said. Peuquet’s Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has published a detailed analysis comparing the plans that shows the differences.

Tax reform: ""Simpson-Bowles calls for bold tax reform to dramatically reduce tax rates by cutting tax expenditures,"" said Goldwein, who was an associate director for the fiscal commission the year it released its report. ""Though the president gives a shout out to this concept, his plan actually calls for starting with an increase in individual rates for higher earners; and only modest reductions to tax expenditures.""

Reductions mentioned in the Simpson-Bowles plan include capping deductions for home mortgage interest and taxing capital gains and dividends at the same rates as earned income.

 Social Security, Medicare and health care: Obama doesn’t include any changes to Social Security, whereas Simpson-Bowles proposed a comprehensive Social Security reform plan, Goldwein said. Obama’s plan includes savings for Medicare, but not as much as Simpson-Bowles.

""There are some areas where Simpson-Bowles pursued structural reform – like totally redesigning Medicare’s cost-sharing structure – but the president’s budget instead focused on changes on the margins,"" Goldwein said.

Spending cuts: Obama includes many specific spending cuts that are similar to those in Simpson-Bowles, but some of those cuts are scaled back, while others were already enacted in 2011, said Van de Water, who worked at the Congressional Budget Office for about two decades.

Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense said that overall, Simpson-Bowles ""was more aggressive in going after federal program spending and reforms to entitlements. ...Obama’s budget is ""evolutionary, Simpson-Bowles is more revolutionary.""

Gleckman summarized the two plans this way: When looking at the the plans from ""50,000 feet, yes, they are similar. When you look at them at even 10,000 feet they are very different. When you look at them on the ground they are entirely different.""

Obama’s explanation

Obama’s campaign sent us a statement: ""The president has proposed a balanced approach to deficit reduction that takes a framework consistent with Simpson-Bowles, asking for both spending cuts and additional revenues from the wealthiest and closing corporate loopholes.""

The campaign also cited some of our earlier fact-checks about Obama’s plan. PolitiFact New Jersey evaluated a claim by Gov. Chris Christie that Obama failed to stand up for the proposed solutions by the Simpson-Bowles Commission. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Obama did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations at the outset, but outlined some deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission.

Even the commission’s co-chairs said so.

""We are encouraged that the president has embraced a balanced, comprehensive approach to deficit reduction similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Commission report,"" Bowles and Simpson said in a 2011 press release.

In  2011, we evaluated John Boehner’s claim that Obama ""took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one. Come on! It’s time to grow up and get serious about the problems that face our country."" We ruled that False, concluding the commission’s recommendations were sprinkled throughout Obama’s 2011 budget proposals, in recognizable -- if not always in identical -- form.

Is Obama’s plan before Congress?

The second part of Obama’s claim about this deficit reduction plan was that: ""We're putting it forward before Congress right now.""

After the president releases his budget, lawmakers introduce resolutions about that budget and took votes rejecting it. Technically his plan is still out there -- he has to submit one every year, and it does exist, but there is no indication that Congress will revisit it.

Our ruling

Obama said of his deficit plan that he ""made some adjustments to (Simpson-Bowles), and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan.""

Obama has presented plans that share the general framework with Simpson-Bowles, but Simpson-Bowles’ plan is more bold. And while Obama’s plan still exists, we don’t expect the GOP-led Congress to pursue it.

There are a lot of caveats to Obama’s claim. We rate this claim Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F037C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/11/barack-obama/obama-says-his-plan-made-some-adjustments-simpson-/

Pro-Israel group attacks Rep. Lois Capps for casting only 'no' vote
","
A new ad by the Emergency Committee for Israel -- a pro-Israel group whose board members include high-profile conservatives Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer -- pummels U.S. Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., over Middle East policy.

With a series of dark, conflict-heavy images and ominous music as a backdrop, the ad says, among other things, ""When Congress voted to condemn Iran for sentencing a Christian pastor to death, Capps was the only member who voted no.""

We wondered if it was true that Capps was really the only lawmaker to vote no on that measure.

It turns out that Capps was indeed the only ""no"" vote recorded in the 417-to-1 roll call on March 1, 2012. But Capps says she voted that way by mistake, and she sought to correct the record immediately after the vote.

Here’s what happened, based on the Congressional Record and interviews with Capps’ staff.

The bill, H. Res. 556, condemned the government of Iran for ""its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of Youcef Nadarkhani on the charge of apostasy."" Nadarkhani, an Iranian Christian, was sentenced to death in 2010 for refusing to reject Christianity. He has since been freed, but at the time of the vote, his fate was uncertain, and his case had become something of a cause celebre.

Capps cast a ""no"" vote, but within minutes of the floor vote, she or an aide realized that she had pressed the wrong button on the voting console. Within minutes, Capps addressed the House to explain her mistake.

""Mr. Speaker, I rise to correct the record,"" Capps said in remarks available on YouTube. ""I mistakenly voted ‘no’ just a few minutes ago on roll call (vote) 94 when I intended to vote ‘yes,’ and I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Record reflect that correction. I do support H. Res. 556 (and condemn) the government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of religious minorities. I concur with the resolution in calling for the exoneration and immediate release of Youcef Nadarkhani and all other individuals held or charged on account of their religion.""

That request was published in the Congressional Record, as was a longer statement that said in part, ""It is deplorable, and this House should denounce it in the harshest of terms. Pastor Youcef deserves to be free. He deserves to practice his faith and be home with his wife and young children. He deserves to have his rights as a human being upheld and respected. I urge a yes vote on H. Res. 556.""

Capps’ office was also aggressive about correcting the record in the media. When the Christian Post published a story that cited Capps’ ""no"" vote, an aide to Capps contacted the publication, which proceeded to run a correction.

Noah Pollak, executive director of the Emergency Committee for Israel, didn’t back down in an interview with PolitiFact. He said that Capps’ vote ""is entirely consistent with the rest of her foreign policy record. Whatever excuses she came up with afterward -- obviously she is entitled to argue that case, but going with the way she voted, it’s not inconsistent.""

The problem for Capps is that once a vote is over, it’s untouchable -- votes cannot be changed retroactively. So the official tally will always reflect Capps’ mistaken vote rather than the one she intended.

That said, at least one expert in congressional procedure said that Capps handled a difficult situation as best as she could.

""Since we cannot read minds as to whether they made a mistake or were subsequently told by their office staff that they would be in deep political trouble if they do not make amends somehow, we have to take members at their word,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""The sooner they correct things, the more believable they are; the later, the less so.""

Wolfensberger added that today, so many votes are taken in clusters that an honest mistake in voting is plausible.

Our ruling

The official record does show that Capps was the only lawmaker to vote ""no"" on the resolution in question, but that’s not the whole story. Quickly realizing her mistake, Capps took several steps to correct the record, including taking to the floor to clarify her position within minutes of the erroneous vote. The speed of her correction suggests that she is not simply changing her mind after the fact. The ad’s claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CFAFC0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/11/emergency-committee-israel/pro-israel-group-attacks-rep-lois-capps-casting-on/

Raymond Frank says Greg Hamilton has accepted $52,000 in contributions from cabaret, liquor and beer interests
","
Travis County’s sheriff took money from tainted interests, his Republican challenger says.

In an advertisement in the Oct. 7, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Raymond Frank, a former Travis County sheriff himself, says Democratic incumbent Greg Hamilton accepted $42,000 from strip-joint interests from 2005 to 2012 and $10,000 from local alcohol distributors from 2007 to 2012.

""It gives me no pleasure to report these events but to right the detriment it causes,"" Frank says in the ad.

In a press release on his campaign website, Frank says that Louis Warren and Glenn Williams are corporate officers of WFKR Inc., which he describes as doing business locally as Perfect 10 Men’s Club and Sugar’s Uptown Cabaret. In an interview, Frank noted that the Sugar’s website promotes both clubs, which he called a confirmation of joint ownership.

Frank also pointed out a February 1999 State Office of Administrative Hearings document stating that Warren opened Sugar’s in June 1982 and was WFKR’s president and chairman of the board as of January 1997.

From May 6, 2005, to May 21, 2012, Frank says, Warren donated $37,000 to Hamilton’s campaign. Williams, Frank says, contributed $1,250 on May 6, 2005.

Frank’s press release says that Ali Davari of Houston, described as owning a Las Vegas strip club with his brother, Hassan Davari, gave $5,000 to Hamilton on April 25, 2012. The release says: ""Ali Davari is also the president of several corporations in connection with his sexually oriented ventures in Houston.""

According to a May 11, 2011, news post by Houston’s KHOU-TV, the Davari brothers own seven strip clubs in the Houston and Las Vegas areas.

We did not reach Warren and did not hear back from Williams.

In a telephone interview, Casey Wallace, a Houston lawyer for a corporation owned by the Davari brothers, said Davari also has interests in three sports bars in Houston, but has no Travis County clubs or plans to open one there. Wallace said Davari donated to Hamilton’s campaign out of interest in a program for children overseen by the sheriff. ""The donations didn’t have anything to do with his businesses,"" Wallace said.

Frank says in another press release that Hamilton has accepted $10,000 toward his re-election from beer and alcohol distributors: Licensed Beverage Distributors Political Action Committee, $2,500; Wholesale Beer Distributors of Texas Political Action Committee, $3,500; and Dan Brown of Austin’s Brown Distributing, $4,000.

When we visited him, Frank said: ""Alcohol ruins a lot of lives. We’re in the business of fighting crime. You don’t accept money from people like that.""

Next, we checked Frank’s tally of contributions against Hamilton’s campaign finance filings with the county, finding that Frank’s figures mostly hold up, though the challenger did not note $1,000 donated to Hamilton’s effort by the Wholesale Beer Distributors on Dec. 3, 2009. So, by Frank’s reasoning, beer, wine and liquor interests have ponied up $11,000 to support Hamilton.

Alan Gray, executive director of the Licensed Beverage Distributors, the Texas trade association for wine and distilled spirits wholesalers, told us by phone that the group is mindful of Hamilton’s  past work enforcing laws as an employee of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. ""We know him to be a good man and good sheriff,"" Gray said.

Finally, we looked over Warren’s nine contributions to Hamilton’s campaign from May 2005 through April 2012. His donations tally to $35,750 which added to the $1,250 contribution by Williams equals $37,000.

On the other hand, it doesn’t look like Warren retained a leadership role in the entity that owns Sugar’s through all the years covered by Frank’s claim. The public portion of franchise-tax reports filed by WFKR, which we obtained from the Texas secretary of state’s office, lists Warren as its chairman through 2006. The 2007 filing was not available and the 2008 filing lists Warren as WFKR’s agent only. WFKR’s May 15, 2009 filing and its subsequent filings do not list Warren in any capacity.

In contrast, according to the filings, Williams was a director when he made his 2005 donation and was listed as one in all but one year of the available filings through 2012.

The absence of Warren from the latter filings suggests that $17,500 to $22,500 of his contributions to the sheriff’s campaign took place after Warren left the ownership of Sugar’s, arguably halving the questionable share of his donations. By the same logic, the total contributions questioned by Frank would total as much as $29,000, or less than 10 percent of all of Hamilton’s contributions of about $350,000 over the cited years.

We left a message with WFKR and did not hear back. We also did not hear back from Hamilton.

Our ruling

Frank says Hamilton has accepted $42,000 from strip-club interests plus $10,000 from local alcohol distributors.

His math mostly holds, though it looks like up to $22,500 of the so-called strip-club total occurred after a donor no longer was shown as having an ownership stake in Sugar’s.

"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Barbara Buono']","
Chris Christie created a new category that denies unemployment benefits forever, state senator says
","
For a certain group of New Jerseyans, losing their jobs can mean being denied unemployment benefits indefinitely, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono.

The Middlesex County Democrat recently claimed that Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, created that new category of unemployed persons when he reformed the state’s unemployment insurance law in 2010.

""A few years ago, the governor -- in so-called reform of the unemployment law -- created...this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever,"" Buono said in an Oct. 1 interview on NJToday.

Buono’s statement is essentially correct. Based on Christie’s recommendations, state officials in 2010 created a category where individuals fired for ""severe misconduct"" could be barred from receiving unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed.

But the Democrat-led state Legislature bears responsibility for signing off on Christie’s proposed changes. Also, if someone gets another job after being fired for severe misconduct, it’s possible for the wages from that first job to ultimately count toward unemployment benefits.

Buono used the phrase ""laid off,"" but state regulations typically refer to such individuals as being ""discharged"" or ""fired.""

First, let’s explain what severe misconduct means.

The state originally had two categories of misconduct cases: misconduct and gross misconduct. Gross misconduct related to behavior that was criminal in nature. Misconduct applied to everything else.

State officials created a third category of severe misconduct to recognize behavior that was worse than simple misconduct, but still fell short of being gross misconduct. Examples of severe misconduct include the use of drugs or alcohol on the job and the destruction or theft of company property.

Christie recommended adding that category when he conditionally vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature to change the unemployment insurance tax rates paid by employers. Buono voted against accepting the governor’s proposed changes, but most other legislators voted in favor of them and Christie signed the bill into law in July 2010.

""It was a bi-partisan effort to make it a fairer system,"" Harold Wirths, commissioner of the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, said in a statement.

Christina Zuk, Buono’s chief of staff, maintained that Christie created the category, pointing out that it didn’t exist until he added it to the bill through his conditional veto.

From July 2010 to August 2012, 15,961 unemployment benefit claims were denied for severe misconduct, according to labor department data.

However, there’s still a chance a person fired for severe misconduct could ultimately receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job.

Here’s how it works:

Employment benefits are based on wages earned during a 52-week period called a ""base year."" Let’s say that after being fired for severe misconduct, that person gets another job, meets certain employment criteria and then loses that job for reasons not related to misconduct.

If both jobs occurred within the same base year, then the person could cite both sets of wages to calculate his unemployment benefits, according to department spokesman Brian Murray.

But Zuk argued the new category still means individuals won’t receive benefits after they first become unemployed due to ""severe misconduct.""

""Therefore an individual who finds him or herself unemployed due to ‘severe misconduct’ will have no means of sustaining themselves until they find another job,"" Zuk said in an e-mail. ""The DOL spokesperson's statement only becomes relevant if the unemployed individual finds a new job and re-qualifies for benefits.""

Our ruling

In a TV interview, Buono claimed Christie created ""this new category where you could get laid off and just be totally denied unemployment benefits forever.""

The senator’s claim isn’t far off. Based on Christie’s recommendations, state officials created a ""severe misconduct"" category in which individuals could be denied unemployment benefits for as long as they remain unemployed.

But the Legislature agreed to create that category as well. Also, there is a scenario in which a person fired for severe misconduct could later receive unemployment benefits based in part on wages from that job.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Jon Husted claims a member of the proposed redistricting commission could not be removed for taking a bribe
","
Republican opponents of Issue 2, the proposed redistricting reform plan, have started to question the rules that would govern the new citizens committee that would handle redistricting should voters approve the measure on Nov. 6.

Secretary of State Jon Husted underscored these concerns when he recently described to reporters a startling hypothetical situation involving a commission member.

""Apparently, you could accept a bribe from somebody to get the map that you want, and you couldn’t be removed from this commission,"" Husted, a Republican and outspoken critic of Issue 2, told reporters after the Aug. 15 meeting of the Ohio Ballot Board to determine ballot language for Issue 2.

Is Husted right? Issue 2, after all, is billed as an attempt to remove political influence from the redistricting process.

PolitiFact Ohio checked into Husted’s statement.

First, some background about the current system and what Issue 2 would do if approved by voters on Nov. 6:

In Ohio now, elected officials control redistricting. Every 10 years, after the census, the governor, legislative leaders and others approve maps with new boundaries for Congressional and legislative districts. Historically, the process has been ultra-partisan, with the party in power drawing district lines that group voters in ways to ensure electoral success.

Issue 2 would establish a 12-member commission of Democrats, Republicans and independents or third-party members to draw the lines. The commission would have to approve maps with districts that emphasize compactness, community preservation, competitiveness and that reflect how Ohioans have voted.

The proposal also includes criteria for serving on the commission. State and federal elected officials, their family members, lobbyists, well-heeled donors and others are banned. Proponents of Issue 2 have labeled the panel a ""citizens commission,"" but the proposal does not prohibit mayors or other local elected officials from serving.

To insulate the commission from political influence, the proposed constitutional amendment states that ""no member of the commission shall be subject to removal by the General Assembly or any member of the executive branch.""

So, how would a commission member be removed for bribery?

We checked with Husted’s office for evidence to support his claim. A spokesman directed us to view an online video of the ballot board meeting showing an exchange between Husted and Don McTigue, a lawyer for Voters First Ohio, the union-back group that supports Issue 2.

Husted and McTigue debated how a commission member would be removed.

""You don’t see any authority that is in this amendment that allows them (the commission) to remove somebody?"" Husted asked.

""Correct,"" McTigue answered.

Husted spokesman Matt McClellan said it is clear that Issue 2 does not give the commission any power to remove a commission member engaged in questionable activity such as bribery. But that’s not what Husted said. He said a commission member could not be removed at all.

And McTigue later said there are other ways already in place to remove a commission member.

Ohio’s bribery statute says that a public official convicted of bribery is ""forever disqualified from holding any public office, employment, or position of trust in this state.""

An official convicted of bribery most likely would be removed from office by a judge during sentencing, McTigue said in an interview. But if not, Ohio law allows a county prosecutor to file a quo warranto action to remove an official unlawfully holding an office.

When we presented to Husted’s office the provisions of the bribery statute that would apply to a commission member convicted of bribery, his spokesman said Husted’s point was that Issue 2 lacks a process to remove a commission member.

Another supporter of Issue 2 said there are other ways to handle a situation in which a commission member took a bribe.

Daniel Tokaji, an Ohio State University law professor who helped draft Issue 2, however, said that existing Ohio law, enacted under Article 2, Section 38 of the Ohio Constitution, sets a process for removing an officeholder.

That section of the constitution says ""laws shall be passed providing for the prompt removal from office, upon complaint and hearing, of all officers, including state officers, judges and members of the general assembly, for any misconduct involving moral turpitude or for other cause provided by law; and this method of removal shall be in addition to impeachment or other method of removal authorized by the constitution.""

Under that portion of the constitution, lawmakers enacted Ohio Revised Code sections 3.07 through 3.10, which lay out a judicial process for removal of officeholders in cases of ""gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, drunkenness, misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance.""

Tokaji said bribery would fall under gross immorality.

""A commissioner could therefore be removed for bribery following this statutory process,"" Tokaji said in an e-mail. ""Nothing in Issue 2 prevents this.""

But the statutory process for removal presents an extremely high hurdle. The process would not begin until a complaint is filed with signatures totalling at least 15 percent of the votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election. That means more than 577,000 registered voters would have to sign a complaint --  about 192,000 more than were required to even put Issue 2 on the ballot.

Tokaji admitted that’s a high threshold to meet, but said the legislature could amend the laws to ease the requirement to initiate the removal process.

Issue 2 opponents argue that the existing Ohio law for removing officeholders would not apply to redistricting commission members. They point out that the proposed amendment prohibits the General Assembly and executive branch from removing a commission member.

But while the amendment states that lawmakers cannot remove commission members. It does not say that they have no authority to enact laws that govern how members can be removed.

So where does that leave us? Is Husted’s claim, that a member who accepted a bribe could not be removed from the commission, plausible?

No.

A bribery conviction would disqualify a commission member from serving. Further, a commission member could be subject to the judicial removal process in the Ohio Revised Code.

Husted is correct about the language in the ballot issue -- there’s nothing in the proposal that allows for the commission to remove one of its members engaged in questionable activity. But that’s not what he said to reporters in his interview.

And he went too far when he said a commission member could remain after accepting a bribe. Although there isn’t a removal process within the proposed amendment, others exist in state law.

Husted’s statement is not accurate. That’s a False on the Truth-O-Meter.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972CFE80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/11/jon-husted/jon-husted-claims-member-proposed-redistricting-co/
"['Debt', 'Health Care', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says ending Obamacare would save nation $1 trillion
","
George Allen, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate, offers the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as the prime example of what he says is an overreaching federal government under President Barack Obama.

In Monday night’s debate, he and Democratic candidate Tim Kaine were asked how they would avoid $1 trillion in automatic cuts split evenly between defense and domestic programs that are scheduled to begin Jan. 2. The cuts -- called sequestration -- can be averted only if Congress and the White House  agree on a debt-reduction package.

Allen’s plan included a big-ticket item. ""Repealing and replacing Obamacare – that’s going to save $1 trillion over a 10-year period,"" he said.

Allen gave an identical response when he was asked during a Sept. 20 debate how he would reduce debt and avoid sequestration.

We were curious if canceling Obamacare really would save the government $1 trillion.

The Allen campaign, in a blog, pointed to three studies to back up its claim:

*A Jan. 6, 2011, report issued by House Republican leaders entitled, ""Obamacare: A Budget-Busting, Job Killing Health Care Law.""  The GOP said that the health care act would add $701 billion to the nation’s debt over 10 years.

*An April 9, 2012, study by Charles Blahous, a conservative policy analyst whom Obama approved in 2010 as the GOP trustee for Medicare and Social Security. He concluded that the law would add more than $340 billion to the nation’s debt woes over the next decade.

*An Aug. 2, 2012, paperby the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. It said the reforms would expand the debt by at least $340 billion over 10 years and priced scenarios that might take the number beyond $500 billion.

So Allen offered three studies by conservative analysts and none of them came close to saying that repealing Obamacare would save the government $1 trillion over 10 years.

Allen also cited a July report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the primary agency charged with reviewing the cost of legislative proposals. He noted that the CBO estimated that the government’s price of implementing Obamacare would easily exceed $1 trillion over 11 years.

But Allen omitted a crucial fact: the CBO said the reforms would more than pay for themselves through health care efficiencies, taxes and fees.

In a July 24 letter to House Speaker John Boehner, the CBO estimated that repeal of Obamacare would increase deficits by $109 billion over 10 years.  

Here’s the CBO’s math: By repealing the law, the government would save $1.171 trillion in expanded health care costs. But it would lose $1.28 trillion in savings -- $711 billion in health care efficiencies demanded by the law and $569 billion in taxes and fees.

The CBO left itself wiggle room, saying it is difficult to predict how the Affordable Care Act will affect the budget. Contributing to the complexity, the agency said, is a June decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allows states to opt in or out of Medicaid expansion.

The studies by House GOP leaders, the Heritage Foundation and Blahous say the government is overestimating savings that will come from health care efficiencies. Those future savings, they say, could be used to pay for other programs and have little impact on deficits.

Our colleagues at FactCheck.org last year described as ""bogus"" the GOP leaders’ contention that the repeal of Obamacare would save $701 billion. They said the Republicans overestimated costs of the law and wrongly claimed that the CBO was ""double counting"" savings.

When GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney claimed that the Affordable Care Act added ""trillions to our deficits and to our national debt,"" PolitiFact National rated it False. The same ruling was given to Romney when he said repealing the law would save $95 billion in 2016.

Our ruling

Allen, in describing how he would cut debt, said repeal of the health care act would ""save $1 trillion over a 10-year period.""

The three studies he cites from conservative analysts don’t put the debt reduction anywhere near $1 trillion -- the closest he gets is $701 million in a report commissioned by the House Republican leadership. And a report by the nonpartisan CBO says the repeal of Obamacare would increase debt by $109 billion over 10 years.

We rate Allen’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A40C480>],/factchecks/2012/oct/11/george-allen/george-allen-says-ending-obamacare-would-save-nati/

Did Steve Newgard owe $13,000 in back taxes on a $1 million property?
","House Democrats have been slamming Republican candidate Steve Newgard pretty hard on his failure to pay property and income taxes over the years. Newgard faces Democrat Brent Barton, a former representative and lawyer, in the race to replace outgoing Rep. Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone, for House District 40 in Clackamas County.

Democrats have set up a website devoted to Newgard’s tax delinquency. There’s also a TV ad paid for by Friends of Brent Barton, which has been on air for about three weeks. Newgard doesn’t contest that he has failed on multiple occasions to pay his taxes on time -- although he resents the implication that what he’s done is illegal. He did pay up, along with late penalties.

But one statement made by Democrats has puzzled him and his children.  

""Newgard owed more than $13,000 for unpaid taxes on his $1 million Milwaukie apartment complex,"" says the gloomy voice-over in the bleak ad targeting Newgard. The ad later states that he ""won’t pay his taxes.""

One million dollars? If only he owned the multi-story, Craftsman-style units featured so briefly in the campaign attack ad. Alas, Newgard says, his five-unit complex in Milwaukie is decidedly more modest, ""little ramblers built in the 1960s."" The single-story units are numbered 9 through 14. (There is no No. 13.)

The Clackamas County tax assessor’s office says the property has a real market value of $302,000 for 2012.

So how do Democrats go from $300,000 to $1 million? We did some sleuthing with our Scooby nose. Apparently there are four complexes at this address, with three separate owners. Newgard owns one. Another person owns two, with a combined market value of $480,000. The third person owns the most expensive portion, valued at $1.2 million.

Newgard doesn’t own the $1.2 million property.

And it would seem that House Democrats who set up www.stevenewgardfacts.comunderstand this. Because the only property tax statement they post is the one that shows his property valued last year at $280,000.

So what gives? We sent an email to Jared Mason-Gere, spokesman for House Democrats’ political action committee. ""We screwed up,"" he wrote back late Tuesday. ""The assessment of the apartment complex is a mistake, plain and simple.""

""It was never our intent to mislead anyone on this, since the point was never about the building, it's always been about the unpaid taxes. The ad will be down tomorrow, if it's not already down, and it will be corrected with the right figure.""

We also checked with the Newgards to verify the accuracy of the amount owed on the apartment complex. Linda, Steve Newgard’s wife, said they fell behind on payments but paid the amount due with interest in July. The amount paid was about $13,200, she said.

She said they have paid taxes faithfully but fell behind when the economy soured. Her husband runs a masonry business. The commercial, she said, ""villainized him, like he had done a crime. Being on top of our taxes is important to us. These are not easy times.""

Obviously, it’s up to Clackamas County voters to decide whether this is an issue for them.

What we can confirm is that Newgard owed more than $13,000 on his apartment complex. And if the Democrats want to make the point that Newgard paid his taxes late, that’s fine. But the complex he owns is nothing like the fat cat pad pictured and claimed as valued at $1 million.

""The core argument remains,"" Mason-Gere said. ""Steve Newgard thinks he plays by a different set of rules; voters should not trust Steve Newgard with their taxes when he can't even be trusted to pay his own.""

We’re not so sure. It’s not cool to get behind on your payments to government, but it’s an option open to others, not just to Newgard. And he did pay, despite the assertion in the ad that he ""won’t pay his taxes.""

The ad, in our view, gives the image of a wealthy candidate wiggling out of rules that apply to the humble rank-and-file. And that’s what turns this into a statement that contains an element of truth -- property taxes were owed -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. A $300,000 rental property doesn’t have the same ring as a $1 million one.

Late Wednesday House Democrats shared a new version of the ad. There is no mention of the value of the property and no image of one either. We like how quickly Democrats work. We still rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3E3B80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/11/future-pac-oregon-house-democrats/did-steve-newgard-owe-13000-back-taxes-1-million-p/
"['Agriculture', 'Taxes', 'Florida', 'American Crossroads']","
American Crossroads says Bill Nelson sold pasture for big profit
","
A hokey political commercial from the conservative super PAC American Crossroads lambasts Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a politician who has gotten out of paying property taxes.

""After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year,"" the narrator says. ""Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.""

The kicker: ""Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us.""

We rated the group’s claim that Nelson is using Florida’s greenbelt assessment to ""dodge"" taxes Half True. Here, we will look at whether he sold the land for home development for at least $1.4 million.

The greenbelt exemption

As evidence for the ad, Crossroads spokesman Nate Hodson referred us to a February 2012 Tampa Bay Times story that scrutinized Nelson’s qualifications for a ""greenbelt"" assessment, which spares him from paying higher taxes on his family’s 55-acre pasture along the Indian River. Instead of paying taxes on the market value, his tax bill is based on a much lower agricultural assessment.

Nelson gets the greenbelt assessment for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to a small-time cattle owner. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and uses the land free of charge, though he is tasked with maintenance.

The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land as developers bought up farm land for malls, highways and homes.

Without the lower agricultural rate, Nelson would have paid about $43,000 in higher taxes on the land.

The ad gives voters the impression that Nelson parked some cows on land to save money on his taxes and then axed the cows in a land sale to developers. (The ad sends the cows flying with the arrival of a new brick house from the sky.)

Such a move obviously goes against the spirit of the greenbelt law, though it’s legal, and it happens. The problem with the greenbelt law, critics say, is that it’s written too broadly. Under the law, county property appraisers are tasked with determining if the land is used ""primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes.""

The Brevard County property appraiser’s office has tried to remove Nelson’s greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.)

Nelson’s land sales

The ad leaves out a lot of important context about that $1.4 million profit that Nelson supposedly gained from land sales.

When Nelson moved to Tallahassee in the mid ’90s to serve on the state Cabinet, he sold the main house that he lived in, which is adjacent to the pasture.

He sold four more nearby lots after he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a U.S. senator. Two of these were residential lots that had houses on them. Two more were lots that he cut out of his pastureland, so those had used the greenbelt exemption. The total for these four transactions to private homeowners is at least $1.4 million, the Times reported. Florida’s greenbelt law does not require him to pay back part of his tax break.

Nelson’s campaign does not dispute the $1.4 million total -- they do dispute how American Crossroads presented the transactions. That total does not represent all of the money he received from the agricultural lots; it also includes the sales of two residential lots.

The ad is leading viewers to equate the land that got the tax break with the land he sold for $1.4 million, and that’s plainly wrong. Nelson did not sell the entire pasture. The cows still graze on it, and Nelson has indicated that will not change for the land his family has had since 1924.

""I've looked at all the options on the rest of the property and I've decided not to develop it. I want to leave it to my kids,"" Nelson told the Times in February.

Our ruling

It’s not fully accurate for Crossroads to say Nelson took land that was receiving agricultural tax breaks and sold it for ""home development"" at a profit of $1.4 million. For one, the land that earned the tax break -- a 55-acre pasture -- is still a pasture. He did not sell that land ""for home development.""

Nelson has sold two agricultural lots, but those sales do not total $1.4 million. To get there, you have to factor in two more sales of residential lots adjoining the pasture. Those lots already had homes on them when Nelson sold them.

American Crossroads is cherry-picking a figure from the Times story to incite anger against Nelson’s tax break without telling the entire story. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E11040>],/factchecks/2012/oct/10/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-says-bill-nelson-sold-pasture-/

Mitt Romney ad says under Barack Obama, there are 450,000 more unemployed women
","
A new ad from Mitt Romney's campaign uses small-business owner Melanie McNamara to make the case that Obama hasn't helped the economy -- particularly for women.

""He promised to bring us all together, that we're all going to be able to prosper,"" she says in the ad. ""I don't see the prospering.""

She voted for him 2008 but won't this time, she says.

An on-screen visual says, ""Since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women.""

In exploring whether that number is accurate, we should note that economists say raw numbers are problematic because the population grows over time and the desire to join the labor force can wax and wane for reasons beyond broad economic conditions.

In examining the Romney campaign's claim, we find the numbers can be tallied different ways to tell two very different stories.

The outcome depends on when you start counting. If you start in January 2009, the month that Obama took office, there has been a 451,000 increase in the number of unemployed women 16 and up through the latest report, which was issued last week.

But start the count later and you get a much different picture. The Obama campaign often uses February 2010, which was the point when monthly job changes turned from negative to positive.

The problem is, each party’s approach amounts to cherry picking. Starting the count on the day Obama was sworn in ignores the reality that no president can have much impact on the economy in their first weeks or even months on the job -- a point that’s particularly important in Obama’s case because the job numbers were in a virtual free fall when he began his term on January 2009. On the other hand, starting the count at the low point, one year after taking office, shields Obama from any responsibility for more than a year.

We’ve often taken a middle ground, starting the count in June 2009, which was the official start of the recovery, and a few months after Obama’s stimulus law took effect.

As it turns out, using June 2009 makes a major difference in the result. Between June 2009 and September 2012, the number of unemployed women actually decreased by 548,000.

There’s also another way to look at it -- to compare the 44 months after January 2009 to the 44 months prior to January 2009. During this period -- the final 44 months of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the number of unemployed women rose by almost 1.4 million. That’s more than triple the increase in unemployed women that we found even under the least flattering measurement for Obama.

And if you look at Bush’s entire eight-year term, the number of unemployed women rose by more than 2.2 million. Even accounting for Bush’s longer tenure, that’s a rise far more rapid than occurred under Obama.

Our ruling

The Romney campaign claimed that ""since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women.""

That’s literally true, but the statistic is cherry-picked. Starting the count at the beginning of the recovery, rather than the beginning of Obama’s term, produces a starkly different result -- a decrease of 548,000 unemployed women. And the rise in women’s unemployment under Obama pales compared to the rise experienced under George W. Bush. These important pieces of context are left out of the ad. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

Super PAC says Romney takes from education, gives to millionaires
","
A new super PAC ad accuses Mitt Romney of pushing deep cuts in education to finance a tax cut for the wealthy.

The ad from Priorities USA Action, which supports President Barack Obama, shows images of children playing, along with these words:

""Take away his toys, and he’ll play with a stick. Take away their bikes, and they’ll still find a way to get where they’re going. But if you take away early childhood education, slash K-12 funding and cut college aid for middle class families, they won’t go far. Yet that’s exactly what Mitt Romney wants to do to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires.""

The kicker: ""If Mitt Romney wins, the middle class loses.""

A spokesman for Priorities USA told us that the claims about education refer to the budget proposed by Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan. We’ll check whether the ad is accurate about the budget’s impact on education and if those changes are things Romney ""wants to do"" in order to fund a tax cut.

The Ryan budget

Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, first presented his budget in 2011. Versions of it have passed the House each of the last two years, but it has never passed the Democratic-controlled Senate. The 2013 proposal cuts $5.3 trillion from the federal ledger over the next decade by enacting major changes in entitlement programs and making steep reductions in discretionary domestic spending.

It’s important to keep in mind that Ryan’s plan doesn’t say which programs would be cut or by how much, nor does it dictate that programs be cut across the board.

On early childhood education: Nowhere in the Ryan budget is there a line item cutting Head Start funding, or any other program. But because the budget reduces federal spending so drastically -- from its current level of 12.5 percent of GDP down to 5.75 percent by 2030 -- experts say deep program cuts will be necessary.

The numbers alone have early education advocates nervous. One analysis by the National Education Association determined that Ryan’s proposed 2013 budget could eliminate spots in Head Start programs for about 191,000 children in 2014, and 2 million over the next decade. Head Start uses federal funds to provide education, nutrition and parent-involvement services to help low-income kids be school ready by age 5.

Romney’s campaign website does not mention early education. We would note that during his time as governor of Massachusetts, Romney vetoed a bill that had passed the legislature authorizing universal prekindergarten in the state.

On K-12 funding: the ad points to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. The study notes that a cut of 22 percent in 2014 of non-discretionary spending, plus more in subsequent years, ""would force states and localities to reduce the quality and reach of their basic public systems — their schools, clean water facilities, and law enforcement activities, for example — or raise new revenue or cut other programs to continue meeting these needs. Either way, the result would be a huge cost shift from the federal government to states and localities.""

Again, as this study points out, these cuts are speculative. It would be state and local governments deciding on the cuts, not the federal government.

On college aid for the middle class: This charge stems from a study by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, attempting to calculate the effects of Romney’s tax proposal. The proposal lacks detail but sets some broad outlines, including allowing the American Opportunity tax credit for higher education, which was part of the 2009 stimulus bill, to expire.

According to the study, Romney’s economic advisers say that the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) would revert back to the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) tax credit, which also provides aid to college students but is less generous and covers fewer Americans than the AOTC.

In addition, Romney and Ryan have been criticized for what could happen to federal Pell Grants in Ryan’s budget. The program provides the largest source of grant funding for needy college students, with more than 9.7 million students expected to get grants worth up to $5,635 per student in 2013, according to the Education Department.
   
Republicans say in documents accompanying the budget that they favor reining in the Pell program, by keeping the maximum grant award in 2013 at this year's level of $5,550, and other means. The House Budget Committee says it would stay at $5,550 for the full 10 years of the budget, though that’s not spelled out in the budget resolution itself. In fact, the budget resolution says nothing at all about Pell grants.

Romney’s stance

So where does Romney stand on the Ryan budget? That answer is something of a moving target.

In March 2012, Romney said in Chicago, ""I’m very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. The following week, while campaigning in Wisconsin, he added, ""I think it’d be marvelous if the Senate were to pick up Paul Ryan’s budget and adopt it and pass it along to the President.""

More recently, since Ryan joined the ticket, Romney has said the two agree broadly. ""I’m sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we’re on the same page,"" he said in August. The campaign has also emphasized the Romney will put together his own plan.

But on his website, Romney makes this promise about ""stopping the bleeding"" of federal spending:

""Pass the House Republican Budget proposal, rolling back President Obama’s government expansion by capping non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels.""

Regarding the specific charges in the ad, the Romney campaign points to remarks he has made on the trail.

On early childhood education and K-12 funding: ""I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm not planning on making changes there,"" Romney said in his Oct. 3 debate with Obama.

On college aid: ""We’re going to continue a Pell Grant program. … I think the Republican budget called for a Pell Grants being capped out at their current high level. My inclination would be to have them go with the rate of inflation,"" he said at a Univision Forum in Miami on Sept. 19.

About those multi-millionaires

Finally, the Priorities USA ad says Romney will make all these education cuts ""to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires.""

The dollar figure also comes from the Tax Policy Center study. The authors found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney’s plan.

But is the accounting really that simple?

There’s not a direct link between spending cuts and tax rates for the wealthy, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

They’re separate policy areas, and legislation affecting each area would typically be handled separately.

Nevertheless, choices about spending and taxes are not entirely unrelated, given the imbalance in the federal budget in recent years and the significant debt that is building up, MacGuineas said.

We asked her in general about the various Democratic claims saying that specific spending cuts ""pay for"" tax breaks for the wealthy.

""It’s a huge fight over priorities and semantics,"" she said. ""But it’s difficult to say that one is linked to the other.""

Our ruling

Priorities USA Action said Romney wants to pay for a tax cut for multimillionaires by taking away early childhood education, slashing K-12 funding, and cutting college aid for middle class families.

Each charge is an interpretation of how the House budget, proposed by Ryan and somewhat embraced by Romney, could impact education at all levels. The warnings are plausible given the scale of spending cuts called for in Ryan’s budget, but they’re speculative -- these cuts aren’t specified in the Ryan budget, and Romney has said his policies would be different. Finally, spending cuts and tax breaks aren’t a one-to-one comparison, though they do reflect priorities.

The ad’s claim contains an element of truth but takes liberties as it tries to fill in the blanks in Romney's plan. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809773A080>],/factchecks/2012/oct/10/priorities-usa-action/super-pac-says-romney-takes-education-gives-millio/

American Crossroads attacks Bill Nelson on agricultural tax break
","
In a TV ad, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson is a down-home farmer in denim overalls, wielding a pitchfork and tending to six animated cows.

The point of the political attack: Nelson is using a farm facade to get out of paying his fair share of property taxes.

""After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year,"" says the ad from American Crossroads, the conservative super PAC founded by Karl Rove. ""Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million.""

The ad’s kicker: ""Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us.""

This claim echoes past criticism from Nelson’s Republican challenger, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV.

The attacks stem from a February 2012 Tampa Bay Times story that scrutinized Nelson’s qualifications for a ""greenbelt"" property assessment, a designation that spares him from paying higher property taxes on his family’s 55-acre pasture along the Indian River in Brevard County. Thanks to the ""greenbelt"" designation, Nelson’s land is taxed at a much lower agricultural rate.

We wanted to examine the group’s claim that Nelson used six cows and a loophole to ""dodge"" $43,000 in his 2011 taxes. Whether he ""sold the land for home development"" is the subject of another check.

Nelson said the Crossroads ad is very misleading.

""Of course, they don’t tell you that that has been a cow pasture for 60 years,"" Nelson said in an interview. ""That was my 4-H club project that started in the early ’50s and has been ever since.""

When the Times story broke, Mack’s campaign rushed to create a singalong cartoon ad called ""Udder hypocrisy."" Before an animated barn, a hokey Nelson figure and six cows sang, ""Bill Nelson’s farm’s the place to be / Just six cows and hypocrisy / Milking taxpayers like you and me / This is typical liberal hypocrisy.""

‘An agricultural tax loophole’

The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land instead of selling to developers who wanted it for highways, shopping malls and homes.

""It costs a lot to farm,"" said Adam Basford, the Florida Farm Bureau Federation director of legislative affairs. ""And a lot of times people could see a higher use in that land for development.""

Farmers are fond of the greenbelt law. Critics, though, say the law is too generous and too vague. The decision to tax land on the lower agricultural rate is determined by county property appraisers, who must weigh if the land is used ""primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes."" The lack of specifics in Florida law invites oft-documented abuse.

A 2005 investigative series by the Miami Herald chronicled several instances of property owners growing modest plants or paying ranchers to keep cows on their land to garner agricultural tax breaks on land they obviously intended to develop.

The classification also creates money gaps for counties that must be made up by other taxpayers or is lost. In 2011, nearly 248,886 properties were classified as agriculture on tax rolls, according to the Florida Department of Revenue. Even though the market value for those properties was $58 billion, the assessed value was just $5 billion.

The total lost tax revenues for local governments was about $969 million in 2011.

Nelson on the farm

Nelson’s camp says his situation is different than the abuses chronicled by the Miami Herald.

He gets a greenbelt designation for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to small-time cattle owners. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and leases the land free of charge, though he is required to keep up with maintenance.

The land has been in Nelson’s family since 1924. It’s been a cattle pasture since 1960, including when Nelson raised and sold a herd of cattle to pay for his education at Yale University.

Nelson has said he is not abusing the designation because he is preserving the land and keeping it in his family. He used to live in a home attached to the property but sold it when he moved to Tallahassee to serve as Florida’s treasurer and insurance commissioner.

Still, the savings is considerable. Without the designation, he would have paid 13 times the amount of taxes that he did in 2011.

In 2011, the market value of Nelson’s property was $2.76 million. Nelson got the lower agricultural value of $210,870 in 2011. Instead of paying $48,380 in property taxes, he paid nearly $3,696.66, according to tax records, a difference of more than $44,000.

The Brevard County property appraiser’s office has tried to remove Nelson’s greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.)

Contrary to the ad’s suggestion, Nelson is not shirking his tax responsibility, a spokesman said, nor is he covertly planning to develop or resell his land.

""You are not dodging taxes when you pay all the taxes that are owned on the property,"" said Dan McLaughlin, his spokesman.

Those who scoff at the size of the herd grazing there now should know it’s on par with most cattle businesses in Florida, McLaughlin said. About one-third of Florida farms, or 7,165, are comprised of fewer than nine cattle or calves, according to 2007 federal data.

One expert told the Times that Nelson is making an effort to ""maintain some aspect of what’s a heritage family site in agriculture.""

""I think that would be something that the state would encourage,"" Stan Geberer, who works for Fishkin & Associations, a Florida economic consulting firm, told the Times.

Our ruling

The ad’s claims and figures about Nelson’s tax bill and Brevard County property are rooted in a report from the Tampa Bay Times. It’s accurate to say that Nelson was shielded from paying about $43,000 in property taxes because of his land has a greenbelt designation.

The group emphasizes that Nelson is leasing the land, though the Times story is clear he does not charge for the Melbourne farmer to graze cows there.

We think American Crossroads is stretching the truth by claiming Nelson is ""dodging"" his taxes. That’s a derogatory phrase commonly used for someone who doesn’t pay what they owe. That’s not the case here, though people may disagree with Nelson paying the lower agricultural rate based on the presence of six cows on a vast pasture.

We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972F42C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/10/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-attacks-bill-nelson-agricultur/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Bill Powers']","
Bill Powers says each year, the University of Texas falls second only to Berkeley in number of PhDs conferred
","
In a recent speech, the president of the University of Texas boasted the Austin campus is annually close to first in the nation in bestowing very advanced degrees.

Bill Powers said in his Sept. 27, 2012, ""State of the University"" address: ""On the teaching side, a key indicator of our ‘business plan’ is the number of undergraduate and graduate degrees we confer each year. We confer more PhDs each year than any other university in America except"" the University of California, Berkeley, he said.

Nearly No. 1 every year?

UT spokesman Gary Susswein and Allison Danforth, a campus expert on reporting and analysis, told us UT-Austin’s conferral of 857 doctoral degrees in 2009-10 placed it second nationally to Berkeley, which bestowed 891. Susswein pointed out the counts are available to the public on a website at the National Center for Education Statistics, based on information collected from institutions by the U.S. Department of Education.

Susswein said that for its count, the university did not fold in degrees in law and medicine.

""The reason is very simple,"" Susswein said in a voice-mail message. ""There is no way to do an apples-to-apples comparison. We don’t have a medical school"" at UT-Austin. And, he said, Texas A&M University ""doesn’t have a law school. Texas A&M has a veterinary school. The University of Illinois has a medical school and a law school.

""Within the realm of PhDs,"" Susswein said, ""we’ve all got liberal arts colleges, we’ve all got engineering schools, we’ve all got science schools. So, it’s a more appropriate way to do an apples-to-apples comparison.""

Minnesota-based Capella University, which provides online offerings, placed third, awarding 841 doctorates, the tabulation indicates. Traditional universities rounded out the top 10: the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor; University of Florida; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the main campus of Ohio State University; University of California-Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Stanford University, where 703 doctorates were awarded.

Susswein said, too, that two days before Powers gave his speech, the national center posted information reflecting the results in 2010-11. UT-Austin bestowed 801 PhDs that year, placing third nationally behind Berkeley (920) and Capella (819).

So, UT was second to Berkeley one year and third the year after.

And how about ""each"" year, as Powers said?

At our request, UT followed up by checking the database for the PhDs given out by each institution each year starting in 2003-04 through 2008-09, the year before the one initially stressed by UT.

Over the six earlier years, Berkeley ranked first or second nationally in PhDs granted. In 2005-06, UT-Austin placed first nationally, besting Berkeley.

In each of the other years, UT’s count placed it third to sixth nationally in PhDs awarded.

For outside perspective, we reached Michael McLendon, a Southern Methodist University professor expert on higher education. McLendon said it’s not out of line for any university to compare its total PhDs granted to those given out by other institutions. He said, too, he was unaware of another measure that would give a meaninful glimpse into the productivity of universities at that level.

McLendon said a mission of the nation’s public research universities is to create the next generation of scientists, scholars and researchers.The volume of students who achieve PhDs, he said, is an important indicator. UT-Austin, he said, ""looks very good.""

Our ruling

Powers said that each year, UT-Austin confer more PhDs than any other U.S. university except Berkeley.

That was so in 2009-10 -- and in another recent year, UT awarded even more PhDs than Berkeley.

In other years, however, UT ranked third, fourth, sixth, third and fourth nationally in PhDs bestowed as Berkeley ranked first or second. In the end, this speech claim misrepresents the results for each year by cherry-picking how the two public universities finished in one year, and those results were (narrowly) not even the latest available count.

UT annually awards many PhDs. But each year of late, its total PhDs awarded has gone up and down compared to outcomes at Berkeley and a few other institutions. 
Put another way, UT fell short of this proclaimed finish in six out of eight recent years. We rate the statement, incorrectly making UT's tally out to be consistently second-best in the land, as Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BCE840>],/factchecks/2012/oct/10/bill-powers/bill-powers-says-each-year-university-texas-falls-/

In Senate race, Thompson says Baldwin backs government takeover of medical decisions
","
In his quest to win a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat, and perhaps swing control of the Senate to the GOP, Republican Tommy Thompson has persistently cast Democrat Tammy Baldwin as extreme.

On WISN-AM in Milwaukee on Sept. 27, 2012, the former governor's theme was health care.

Thompson told conservative talk show Jay Weber that if Baldwin is elected, ""she will be pushing for a national health care provision in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals.""

We’ve previously rated as Mostly True Thompson’s claim that Baldwin wants to go beyond President Barack Obama’s health care reform law to a ""Medicare system for all.""

But Thompson himself goes extreme when he says the Madison congresswoman would have the federal government decide a patient’s private medical matters.

'Takeover'

Thompson's language calls to mind PolitiFact National's 2010 Lie of the Year -- the claim that ""Obamacare"" constituted a ""government takeover of health care.""

As our colleagues observed:

""Government takeover"" conjures a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the Affordable Care Act, adopted in 2010, relies largely on the free market, with employers continuing to provide health insurance to most Americans through private insurance companies. Indeed, a larger number of people will get private health coverage through the creation of insurance exchanges.

But Thompson’s statement wasn’t as sweeping. He charged that legislation backed by Baldwin would have the government ""take over your decisions"" on medicine, doctors and hospitals.

Since it is clear Baldwin has supported going beyond ""Obamacare,"" that raises the question of whether Thompson’s specific point could be accurate.

Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe cited two legislative efforts to back Thompson’s statement, correctly pointing out that Baldwin supported Obama’s reform law, even though it didn’t go as far as she wanted, and that she supports a ""single-payer"" health care system.

We’ll note that while Obama’s law has been adopted (although not all features are yet in place), we can only speculate on the details of a single-payer health care system, since a single-payer system has not been adopted.

""Obamacare"": Boothe argued the reform law ""puts the government in between a patient and their doctor in Medicare.""

But she didn’t elaborate, other than to claim Obama is cutting Medicare funding (which PolitiFact Florida called Half True, given that his reform law reduces the growth of Medicare spending).

Boothe also argued the law ""leaves an unaccountable board of 15 unelected bureaucrats in charge of rationing care and limiting access to health care.""

PolitiFact National has reported that while Obama’s plan establishes a board to make recommendations about future savings, it does not outline a dramatic, structural overhaul of the program. Moreover, our colleagues have found, the board doesn’t make decisions for individuals.

""Single-payer"": Single-payer refers to a health care system in which the government pays for all health care services but is not involved in the delivery of health care.

Boothe argued that under single-payer, if, for example, ""an area has three different hospitals, the government could come in and dictate which one they will continue to fund."" Or, she said, the government could decide not to fund religious-affiliated hospitals, ""thus removing you from your doctor and health care provider, and ultimately making decisions on your behalf.""

But a system in which the government pays for all health care isn’t the same as one in which the government ""will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals.""

And Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus pointed out that a single-payer measure Baldwin introduced in 2009 would have allowed patients ""free choice of participating physicians and other clinicians, hospitals, and inpatient care facilities.""

Health policy experts

We contacted three experts: George Washington University health policy professor Brian Biles; Georgetown University health systems administration professor Robert Friedland; and Baruch College health care policy professor Shoshanna Sofaer.

None was persuaded by Thompson’s claim.

On the health care reform law’s changes to Medicare, Biles said the law will put more people into private insurance plans, through the creation of ""exchanges,"" allowing them to choose from among private plans. Private insurers already limit access to certain doctor and hospital networks, as they did before the health reform law, and that isn’t the government making decisions for a patient, he said.

Sofaer said virtually any physician in good standing and any accredited hospital can participate in Medicare, and that Obama’s law does nothing to change that. The law also does not change what medications or medical services are covered by Medicare, she said.

And while the Medicare advisory board is to recommend changes, said Friedland, ""the notion that this is somehow the government taking over your medical decisions or options is like saying employers are taking over your medical decisions by shopping for a better health insurance plan -- it does affect you; but it is hardly a case of your employer taking over your decisions.""

With regard to a single-payer health care system, Biles said a single-payer system -- sometimes known as ""Medicare for all,"" a term Baldwin has used -- could increase the number of health care providers available to patients, given that the vast majority of providers accept Medicare patients.

Sofaer said that with the federal government paying for all health care, the government theoretically ""would have a huge amount of control over, in particular, what services were covered and which were not.""

But ""in our form of government, with power divided in so many ways, I suspect it will be very difficult indeed for a federal program to be so authoritarian with respect to something as personal as medical care,"" she said. ""In practical terms, it would not happen.""

Our rating

Thompson said Baldwin supports a law ""in which government will take over your decisions on medicine, on doctors and on hospitals.""

He provides no evidence that Obama’s health care reform law would bring about such a change, and offers only speculation that such a change would occur under a single-payer system. Experts were unpersuaded by his claim.

Judge links arrests to high school drop out rates
","
Crime costs Georgia, and state leaders are trying to find a smarter approach to deal with teenagers who run afoul of the law.

Last month, a commission of judges, police officers, attorneys and others met to discuss ways to improve Georgia’s juvenile justice system. By some estimates, Georgia deals with 40,000 juvenile delinquents a year. The budget for the state juvenile justice system for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2013, is about $300 million, nearly as much as Georgia will spend on its technical college system.

One judge at the meeting relayed some information that piqued the Truth-O-Meter’s interest.

""We know from the research that if you arrest a kid on campus, he’s twice as likely not to graduate,"" Clayton County Juvenile Court Judge Steven Teske said. ""If they appear in court, they’re four times as likely not to graduate.""

Teske said in an interview that his concern is about ""zero-tolerance"" policies that more schools across the country have adopted concerning students who get in trouble on campus. The policies can result in more students being arrested and expelled. 

""[T]he problem with zero tolerance is that it does not distinguish between the kids who are bullies and those who make stupid decisions,"" Teske told us.

PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the numbers Teske used to base his case are correct.

Teske said his claim was based on a widely used study of graduation rates among high school students who go through the court system. The study by Gary Sweeten, an associate professor of criminology at Arizona State University, was published in December 2006. Sweeten claimed it is the first study to estimate the effect of arrest and court appearance jointly. 

""[F]irst-time arrest during high school nearly doubles the odds of high school dropout, while a court appearance nearly quadruples the odds of dropout,"" Sweeten wrote.  

In his study, Sweeten also found evidence of what are called labeling effects. The concern is that young people who get arrested are labeled as delinquents and continue to get heightened scrutiny and punishment.

Scholars on the subject say that can explain why a disproportionate percentage of students who wind up in the criminal justice system do not graduate from high school. ""This perspective argues that official intervention can be a stepping stone in the development of a delinquent career,"" two authors wrote in a 2003 study on the subject cited by Sweeten.

That study of 1,000 seventh- and eighth-graders in the Rochester, N.Y., school system over a nine-year span found that an arrest nearly quadrupled the odds of being a high school dropout, and involvement in the justice system increased the odds by about the same rate.

In his study, Sweeten wrote: ""Court involvement may put youths in close contact with other delinquent youths who may encourage further delinquency, and less attachment to high school, leading to poorer educational outcomes.""

""They think of themselves as a troublemaker now,"" Sweeten said in a telephone interview.

Sweeten’s study, though, did not focus solely on on-campus arrests. He selected a random sample of people who answer an annual survey done by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics with an oversampling of disadvantaged youths. The respondents answer a series of questions on many issues, including their educational background and criminal history.

Sweeten told PolitiFact Georgia that he hasn’t seen much research about the impact of on-campus arrests on graduation rates. He said his research ""implies"" there may be a connection.

A separate study casts a little bit of doubt on the research. Another group of researchers studied about 2,000 Philadelphia students interviewed after they finished eighth grade and then seven years later. 

""We found that arrest has no significant impact on the likelihood of a student dropping out of high school, but it does have a strong and consistent impact on a late graduation,"" the researchers wrote.

Christopher Weiss, one of the authors of that study, said they could not distinguish which arrests were made on campus. Weiss said on-campus arrests were a rare occurrence at that time. 

One study of Chicago inner-city high school students arrested during the ninth or 10th grade found they are at least six times more likely to drop out of school. A 2012 study by the American Civil Liberties Union and Citizens for Juvenile Justice concluded that students in the three largest school systems of Massachusetts who are arrested at school are three times more likely to drop out than those who are not.

To summarize, Teske referenced on-campus arrests and court interaction at the meeting. ""We know from the research that if you arrest a kid on campus, he’s twice as likely not to graduate,"" he said. ""If they appear in court, they’re four times as likely not to graduate.""

The first part of Teske’s claim is troublesome because there’s not much research on the subject of on-campus arrests and high school dropout rates. The most recent study we found, though, supported Teske’s claim. As far as the latter part of his statement, there is more support for what Teske said at the meeting. We rate his entire claim as Mostly True.

Josh Mandel dings Sherrod Brown for missing 350 votes, says Ohio needs a senator who shows up to work
","
For months, Democrats have accused Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel of neglecting his official responsibilities because he failed to attend the first fourteen state Board of Deposit meetings that occurred during his term.

Mandel denies that he ducked his duties and says his office sent a representative to each meeting. PolitiFact Ohio rated a claim about his missing work because he was traveling, raising campaign money as Half True.

Now Mandel, the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate against Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown, is airing a statewide television ad that says Brown is ignoring his official duties. The ad claims that Brown and other politicians in Washington ""think they can live by a different set of rules,"" and dings Brown for missing more than 350 votes in Congress.

""With 400,000 unemployed, we need a Senator who shows up to work,"" says the ad’s announcer, as the TV screen shows an empty chair.  ""Sherrod Brown missed over 350 official votes. When he finally showed up, voted to raise his own pay six times. Sherrod Brown, living by different rules than us.""

PolitiFact decided to look at the ad’s suggestion that Brown has not shown up for work and its claim that he missed over 350 official votes.  

A new release that announced the ad’s launch said Mandel’s campaign obtained its statistics from the GovTrack website. The news release also mentioned a fact missing from the ad that puts the missed votes in better perspective - they occurred over a period of more than 19 years, starting when Brown entered the U.S. House of Representatives in January 1993. A visit to the GovTrack website indicates there have been more than 10,000 recorded votes in that period.

The largest number of Brown’s missed votes - 83 - occurred in 2000. He missed 13.7 percent of that year’s votes after suffering broken ribs and vertebrae in a car accident in Knox County.

Brown spent more than a week in Mansfield MedCentral Hospital after the Jan. 30 crash, and missed occasional votes throughout the year because of follow-up medical treatments. For months after the crash, Brown wore an odd-looking plastic back brace around the U.S. Capitol. Then-President Clinton told Brown the brace made him resemble ""a Roman soldier in a 1960s movie.""

Brown’s second highest year for missed votes was 2006, the year of his successful U.S. Senate race against incumbent GOP Sen. Mike DeWine. He missed 51 votes that year. Thirty-four of them were in its third quarter, the height of campaign season.

Since he joined the U.S. Senate in 2007, GovTrack indicates that Brown has missed 21 out of 1779 votes - a 98.8 percent attendance record. This year, he hasn’t missed any votes. In 2011, he missed three. In 2010, he didn’t miss any.

When asked why Mandel’s ad didn’t provide the context that Brown’s missed votes occurred over nearly two decades, Mandel spokesman Travis Considine said its claims are ""factual,"" and observed that Brown’s missed vote rate was higher than the congressional median. The GovTrak website says  the median rate of missed votes for all members of Congress is 2.5 percent, while Brown’s rate is 3 percent.

""Why is it OK for Democrats to criticize Treasurer Mandel on meeting attendance but it’s not OK  to question why Senator Brown missed more than 350 votes?"" Considine asked in an email. ""Are you employing a ""different set of rules"" for Brown and Mandel? ""

Brown’s campaign responded to the ad with a news release that claimed Mandel is ""desperately trying to distract from his own appalling attendance record"" by attacking Brown. It said Brown’s voting record would have been better if not for the car crash, and the fact that he had to care for his dying mother in 2009, a year when records show that Brown missed eight votes.

There is an element of truth in Mandel’s claim: The ad correctly says that Brown has missed over 350 official votes.

But it omits critical facts that would convey a different impression. It doesn’t mention those missed votes were spread over more than 19 years that includes Brown’s time in the U.S. House of Representatives and during that time more than 10,000 votes occurred.

Brown’s voting attendance record throughout his congressional career - including time missed because of car crash injuries - is actually 96.5 percent. As a U.S. Senator, his attendance record is nearly 99 percent.

Knowing those facts, and that Brown missed 351 out of 10,074 votes since January of 1993, would give a listener a different impression.

Presidential politics goes to Sesame Street: Obama says Romney wants to fire Big Bird
","
Scare tactics have a long history in American politics. Now, the Obama campaign is trying to scare preschoolers -- and their parents -- with a claim that Mitt Romney wants to fire Big Bird.

It all started with Romney's remark in the last debate that he opposes federal subsidies for PBS.

""I’m sorry, Jim,"" Romney told debate moderator Jim Lehrer during the debate at University of Denver on Oct. 3. ""I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. …  I like PBS, I love Big Bird. I actually like you, too. But I’m not going to — I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.""

The towering yellow fellow stole the show again on Monday in Derry, N.H., when a plucky Big Bird impersonator from President Barack Obama’s reelection team hoisted a sign stating, ""Romney-Boehner. Tough on Sesame Street; Soft on Wall Street,"" outside U.S. House Speaker John Boehner’s speaking event stumping for the former Massachusetts governor.

Big Bird didn’t have much to say, but his handler, Holly Shulman, communications director for Obama for America-New Hampshire, did.

""Mitt Romney’s plan is to give $5 trillion in tax breaks skewed toward the wealthiest Americans,"" Shulman said, ""while getting rid of the things that people care about, getting rid of Planned Parenthood, firing Big Bird and voucherizing Medicare.""

Nationwide, surrogates for Obama are harping on the future of the Sesame Street hero to highlight another way they say Romney is out of touch.

On Tuesday, Obama released a sarcastic campaign commercial, mocking Romney for taking on ""menaces to our economy"" like Big Bird, ""no matter where they nest.""

Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street, has since cried fowl over the ad and asked the campaign to take it down.

But we wondered whether the campaign was going too far with its claim that Romney would ""fire"" the Sesame Street icon. And as Big Bird often says, ""Asking questions is a good way of finding things out!""

First we contacted Obama’s campaign for sources. They chirped about the small impact reducing public broadcasting appropriations would have on the federal budget, and cited articles where Romney talks about the cuts and PBS news releases about their station’s reach.

We asked Romney’s campaign for some background.

In an interview with Fortune magazine earlier this year, Romney ticked off a number of so-called subsidy programs he would eliminate if elected, including the one behind PBS.

For fiscal 2013, the federal government appropriated $445 million for public broadcasting according to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Washington Post compared that with the $1.42 billion the government spent for Amtrak, and the $146 million for the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities -- two other subsidies Romney said he would cut.

""Some of these things, like those endowment efforts and PBS I very much appreciate and like what they do in many cases, but I just think they have to stand on their own rather than receiving money borrowed from other countries, as our government does on their behalf,"" he told Fortune.

The current appropriation is just over one one-hundredth of one percent (.01 percent) of the federal budget -- approximately $1.35 per person per year, Jan McNamara, senior director of PBS’ Corporate Communications told PolitiFact in an email.

It accounts for about 15 percent of the revenue for public television and public radio overall, she added.

The way the system works is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting administers the funds with a ""definitive, federally mandated"" formula. The federal appropriation doesn’t go directly to PBS.

""By statute, the majority of funds are distributed directly to the approximately 1,300 locally owned public television and radio stations currently serving viewers and listeners,"" McNamara said. ""These locally governed, community-based stations depend on this critical seed money, which they leverage to raise the addition (sic) funds needed to provide content and services that are available to everyone, regardless of geography or ability to pay for a cable or satellite subscription.""

For each dollar in federal funding invested in local stations, the stations raise an additional $6 on their own, including millions of contributions from volunteer supporters as part of a public-private partnership.

PBS, a nonprofit public broadcasting television network, has nearly 360 member stations, according to its website. Sesame Street has been one of its staple programs for about 43 years.

Forbes also noted almost 60 percent of funding for public television comes from private donors or grants, with additional funding coming from dues paid by member stations.

Big Bird's nest egg

According to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s public affairs office, it provided $1.25 million to Sesame Street through a National Program Service grant to PBS in fiscal 2011, along with an $8 million grant to Sesame Workshop, for ""The Electric Company: Phase II.""

And in fiscal 2012, Sesame Street got $1.4 million in funding through the National Program Service grant, which supports children’s and prime-time television programming that ""engages, inspires, and educates,"" including other PBS programs such as Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, PBS NewsHour and NOVA, officials said.

According to Sesame Workshop’s most recent 990 form, filed for its 2010 year ending June 30, 2011, government grants and contributions accounted for about 5 percent of the $133 million revenue they brought in. Because much of the government money goes to other programs, the subsidy for Sesame Street is even lower.

And MSN Money pointed out that Sesame brought in $46.9 million in licensing revenue for toys and other merchandise in 2011.

So how much would slashing the public broadcasting appropriation impact the feathery, eight-foot-two-inch friend everyone’s so worried about?

Not much, according to an interview CNN did with Sherrie Westin, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Sesame Workshop.

""Sesame Workshop receives very, very little funding from PBS. So, we are able to raise our funding through philanthropic, through our licensed product, which goes back into the educational programming, through corporate underwriting and sponsorship,"" Westin told CNN. ""So quite frankly, you can debate whether or not there should be funding of public broadcasting. But when they always try to tout out Big Bird, and say we’re going to kill Big Bird – that is actually misleading, because Sesame Street will be here.""

On Monday, Westin blogged about the issue again on Sesame Workshop’s website, explaining her conversation on CNN was only ""half the story.""

""Sesame Workshop has created a financially sustainable model to fund production of our educational programming here and around the world,"" Westin wrote. ""But Sesame Street would not exist were it not for PBS and its local stations, which is the distribution system for Big Bird and friends to reach all children across the United States, particularly the low income children who need us most.""

""A CNN poll said 7% of the American public think that PBS gets as much as half the US budget! 30% think it’s 5%.  In reality it’s 0.014%.  Let’s keep that in perspective and also not forget the return on that investment: millions of children who have benefited from early childhood education brought to them by the letters, P. B. S.!""

Our Ruling

In its latest attempt to portray Romney as heartless, the Obama campaign is making a serious allegation that he wants to put one of America's most beloved children's characters in the unemployment line.

Romney has been clear that his plan for PBS is not specific to Big Bird (nor to Jim Lehrer for that matter). He simply wants to end federal subsidies.

It's a ridiculous stretch to equate that with firing the 8-foot-2 yellow bird. Just as Democrats have scared senior citizens about losing Medicare, they are now scaring preschoolers about losing Big Bird.
