Rick Kriseman says St. Petersburg has fewer small businesses than when Mayor Bill Foster took office
","With less than three weeks until the St. Petersburg mayoral election, the Oct. 15 Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 forum, like the 20-some-odd debates before it, centered on the city’s progress since Mayor Bill Foster took office. Foster asked if the city is better off now than it was four years ago. Challenger Rick Kriseman, former city council member and state legislator, took every opportunity to point out ways he felt Foster’s leadership has been lacking, especially when it comes to economic development. Among his claims, Kriseman said: ""Since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg."" We wanted to dig into St. Petersburg small business statistics to find out if Kriseman was right. (We examined other claims by Kriseman here and by Foster here.) Kriseman’s campaign manager, Cesar Fernandez, referred us to the City of St. Petersburg Business Tax Division. The office collects taxes from each business in the city. When sifting through the data with city officials, we learned there are a number of different ways to define ""small business."" University of South Florida St. Petersburg economics professor Suzanne Dieringer said the number of small businesses would vary based on how it's measured. Even when experts agree to define a small business by number of employees, there’s no consensus among experts about which number to use. ""I think if you ask six economists what’s the size of a small business you’d get six different answers,"" said City Council Chairman Karl Nurse. The U.S. Small Business Administration says any business with fewer than 500 employees fits the bill. By the SBA definition, over 90 percent of businesses in the city would be considered small. Nurse said it’s not necessarily the number of small businesses that’s important to assess economic growth, but rather the total revenue the city pulls in from business taxes. The city taxes businesses differently depending on the type. Many businesses are taxed by number of employees. Businesses with more than 30 employees must pay an additional fee for each employee, starting with No. 31. But there are other means of taxing as well. For example, warehouses are taxed by their square footage and piano instructors by the number of students they have. Tammy Jerome, the city’s director of billing and collections, said there’s no clear-cut way to define what makes a small business by things like square footage or amount of inventory, so it’d be difficult to get an accurate count of the small businesses in town. Because different businesses are taxed in different ways, calculating the number of small businesses by looking at each business that files taxes and indicates employing fewer than 500 people would leave out small businesses that pay taxes to the city based on other metrics. Since most businesses in St. Petersburg employ fewer than 500 people, we can use the total number of businesses and the total amount of tax money they pull in for the city to get an imperfect picture of how the climate for small businesses has changed during Foster’s term. Here’s how much revenue the city has generated from this policy by year, according to Jerome. We’ll start with 2009 because Fernandez said Kriseman was referring to the number of small businesses before Foster took office in 2010, but the wording of Kriseman's forum statement would lead viewers to believe he meant 2010, not 2009. The 2013 numbers we're using aren't yet final.   While the revenue’s clearly gone up since 2010, the number of businesses has taken a bumpier path. The city’s unfinalized number of 15,520, is higher than the 2010 number, but not by much. Experts can’t say for sure if the number of small businesses specifically increased or decreased. Since 2010, the revenue the city’s earned from business taxes has gone up, which contradicts the point Kriseman tried to make about the economic state of the city. If he had clearly used 2009 in his talking point, he would've been more on target. Our ruling Kriseman criticized his mayoral race opponent, saying there are fewer small businesses in St. Petersburg than there were when Mayor Foster took office. But the available data leads us to believe that the number of businesses, and the city’s revenue from those businesses, have actually increased. There are lots of different ways to define what constitutes a small business, but experts told us most city businesses could be considered small. Based on the available data, we rate Kriseman's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFD0C00>],/factchecks/2013/oct/17/rick-kriseman/st-petersburg-mayoral-candidate-rick-kriseman-says/

Rick Kriseman says fewer residents are working since Bill Foster took office
","Candidates for St. Petersburg mayor painted two very different portraits of the city’s economy during the Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 debate Oct. 15. Mayor Bill Foster touted the city’s unemployment rate, which he said is lower than the statewide average.  Challenger Rick Kriseman countered by saying fewer people are working. ""Unfortunately, since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg,"" Kriseman said, ""and there are less people employed in the city of St. Petersburg than there were prior to his taking office."" We decided to put both candidates’ claims to the Truth-O-Meter. (We checked Foster's claim here and Kriseman's claim about fewer businesses here.) In this check, we’ll examine Kriseman’s line about fewer people working in St. Petersburg than before Foster took office. Kriseman’s statement was a little perplexing. The jobs picture for the nation has improved in recent years, and the same goes for the state. Wouldn’t St. Petersburg logically follow that trend? In short, it does. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data for the city of St. Petersburg, rough as they may be, do not support Kriseman’s point. The numbers are taken from the government’s monthly survey of 60,000 households. Foster took office in January 2010, several months after the recession officially ended in June 2009. When Foster took office, just over 103,000 St. Petersburg residents were working -- lower than it had been in any point since at least 2003, according to BLS data. But the most recent federal data for July 2013 show the number of people with jobs is up over 115,000. State data offer a more up-to-date figure, showing 116,127 employed residents for August. Granted, that’s still short of the size of the city’s workforce pre-recession. But it’s certainly not a reduction from when Foster took office. Raymond James chief economist Scott Brown cautioned these figures are not consistent or fixed to match trends in population, ""but in general, you would expect to see some improvement because we tend to mirror the national and state economy."" University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith agreed. ""At the city level, especially St. Petersburg, little places like that are just slots in the overall economic cycle,"" Snaith said. ""They’ve just got to ride what’s happening. They’re not going to be able to buck global and national swings that are just incredibly dramatic as they were in this cycle."" We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7DBE80>],/factchecks/2013/oct/17/rick-kriseman/rick-kriseman-says-fewer-residents-working-bill-fo/

Were 30,000 Oregonians employed by federal government furloughed during shutdown?
","The federal government is finally reopening its doors, and hundreds of thousands of furloughed employees are back on the job. Still, the cost to the economy lingers. Recently, Standard & Poor’s, the financial services company, estimated that the 16-day shutdown cost the U.S. economy some $24 billion. In an opinion piece published on OregonLive.com a few days before the government reopened, U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., bemoaned such costs. ""The government shutdown is already causing damage,"" she wrote. ""Veterans’ benefits have been held up, national parks and museums are closed, federal research has been halted, and small business loan applications are not being processed. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, including nearly 30,000 in Oregon, have been furloughed, and millions more continue to do their jobs without knowing when they’ll receive a paycheck."" The consequences of the political brinksmanship are no doubt profound. Still, the piece about 30,000 Oregonians being on furlough caught our attention. We’d read lots of articles that mentioned the state’s nearly 30,000 federal employees, but surely they weren't all on furlough, right? We started where we usually do, with the source, and called the representative’s office. Bonamici’s spokesman, Mike Morosi, looked into the matter and quickly issued a clarification. ""The Oregonian and other news outlets have reported that there are approximately 30,000 federal employees in the state of Oregon,"" read the widely circulated clarification. ""The precise number of federal employee furloughs fluctuated throughout the duration of the 16 day shutdown. Our office has requested an analysis of furloughs in Oregon, but it will take some time before that information is made available. ""The guest editorial was careful to not claim that all federal employees in Oregon had been furloughed, but the use of the word ‘nearly’ may have been an overstatement. Some news reports indicate that roughly a third of federal employees nationwide have been furloughed, but that number differs greatly by agency and state. ""In the absence of more specific information, it would have been more appropriate to say that ‘many of the approximately 30,000 federal employees in Oregon have been furloughed.’ "" We asked Morosi how long it would take to get the furlough analysis the representative’s office has requested. Unfortunately, he said, it could take longer than a week given how backlogged much of the federal government is following the shutdown. The quick response and clarification from the office was definitely appreciated, but PolitiFact Oregon generally continues to pursue the question even if the speaker admits a mistake. Words matter and such statements can last a long time in the political arena, even if they are revised later. So we called Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist with the Oregon Labor Market Information System. He told us that the most recent data put the state’s number of federal workers at 26,926. Of those, 6,567 work for the U.S. Postal Service and were not furloughed. That left a possible 20,000 employees. But even that number is an overstatement because 3,500 work for federally run hospitals such as the Veterans Affairs medical centers. And 3,000 work for federal environmental programs and nearly 1,500 in national security and international affairs positions, including the Transportation Security Administration. Now, some of those 8,000 employees may have been furloughed, but others were considered essential and continue to work and still others, like those working for Veterans Affairs, have positions funded a year in advance or through other sources. That is all to say that the number of Oregon workers on furlough was not ""nearly 30,000."" In fact, State Economist Mark McMullen told Oregonian reporter Molly Young that about ""one-thid of those employees, or about 9,000 workers"" would likely be furloughed when the shutdown first began. In our various discussions, Morosi did note that those working still had to forgo paychecks. They’ll receive back pay, but until the government opened again, checks couldn’t be written. That was no doubt a huge strain on many households -- it certainly would be for ours -- and it’s good context. Bonamici said nearly 30,000 federal employees in Oregon were furloughed because of the government shutdown. Now it’s true that those nearly 30,000 federal employees in Oregon were affected by the shutdown, but they weren’t all furloughed. We’d love to have the full forthcoming analysis requested by the representative’s office, but even without its specifics, we know this statement isn’t accurate. We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA296C0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/17/suzanne-bonamici/were-30000-oregonians-employed-federal-government-/

DeKalb superintendent overstates outcome of accreditation review
","Things have been tough for the DeKalb County School District. The state’s third-largest school system was in danger of losing its accreditation. It has struggled financially, leaving reserves almost depleted and requiring deep budget cuts, teacher furloughs and larger class sizes. A former superintendent is currently in court on racketeering charges. Gov. Nathan Deal removed two-thirds of the school board for financial mismanagement and micromanaging that put the district at risk. And an interim chief, former state Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond, was brought in earlier this year to try to right the ship. Thurmond has been optimistic, repeatedly reminding parents and staff that the district will improve, but that it will take work to turn things around. He has continued to spread his message of hope in district updates, particularly about the school system’s accreditation. ""When SACS came back at midterm for review we got straight A’s,"" Thurmond said during a meeting with parents earlier this month. We were intrigued by the superintendent’s statement. Had DeKalb, with its ongoing legal, financial and personnel issues, secured a perfect score with an accrediting agency? We decided to do our homework and find out. Thurmond made his statement at Towers High School in south DeKalb during a parent council meeting. The then-interim superintendent had been traveling across the county, speaking to various parent and school groups. (Just last week the DeKalb school board voted to extend Thurmond’s superintendent contract two more years, through summer 2015.) To check Thurmond’s claim, PolitiFact Georgia had to research DeKalb’s accreditation history. Last year, a team from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools -- a private agency that accredits public schools in Georgia and elsewhere -- visited DeKalb to investigate numerous allegations of school board mismanagement. Representatives for SACS’ parent company, AdvancED, said the board was accused of undue interference in administrative matters, as well as wasting money. At the time, DeKalb’s accreditation -- which greatly affects students’ college acceptance chances -- was already in a precarious position, at a less than stellar ""on advisement"" status. Ultimately, the district’s accreditation was placed on probation, with SACS officials warning that a full accreditation loss was imminent without immediate changes. Earlier this year, after the system was placed on probation, the governor removed and replaced six board members. The Georgia Supreme Court is expected to rule by November on a challenge to the law that allows governors to remove school boards in districts on probation. In May, a SACS team returned to DeKalb for a three-day review, as Thurmond noted during the parent meeting. The agency issued a report of its findings in July. The report indicated that all 11 required actions from the agency’s October 2012 visit were ""in progress."" The monitoring team concluded that the district had made ""recognizable progress."" The report also noted: ""The overall progress of the district in addressing the required actions is still evolving and significant work remains to be accomplished."" Another SACS monitoring team is scheduled to return to DeKalb for a two-day visit in December. In the meantime, the district remains on probation. We asked Thurmond’s office about the superintendent’s claim and reading of the SACS report. ""In the educational arena, an ‘A’ grade is generally awarded when a student receives a score of 90-100. It is important to note that an ‘A’ does not require perfection, but an ‘A’ does represent significant and noteworthy achievement,"" a district spokesman said in an email. The spokesman said Thurmond was speaking metaphorically about the importance of the interim report, which noted significant improvements during the past two months and recognizable progress on addressing the 11 required actions. PolitiFact Georgia also questioned SACS about Thurmond’s claim. Agency representatives noted that AdvancED and SACS do not give letter grades to school systems. ""(Thurmond) was clearly using an analogy that the monitoring visit was positive,"" said an email from the company spokeswoman and CEO. ""The report clearly indicates that the district is moving in the right direction but that the required actions remain In Progress as there is much work to be done in ensuing months and years."" We also checked with the Georgia School Boards Association, which helps boards prepare for SACS visits, for thoughts on Thurmond’s statement. A board development specialist with that agency deferred to SACS for an explanation. So, was DeKalb Schools Superintendent Michael Thurmond correct that the district’s midterm review from an accrediting agency back in May resulted in a straight-A report card? It’s subjective. Thurmond used the letter grade as an interpretation of the positive SACS report. The report does note the district’s improvements on 11 requirements over the past few months. But it also notes the significant work that is left to do, and it questions whether the school board and district leadership can successfully complete it. And most important, the district remains on probation until another monitoring visit at the end of the year. An A means exceeding standards – that’s not what the district is doing. It’s making progress, which isn’t an A in anyone’s book. We rate Thurmond’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA9AD00>],/factchecks/2013/oct/17/michael-thurmond/dekalb-superintendent-guilty-grade-inflation-descr/

DNC chair says Chris Christie cut equal pay for women, called it ‘senseless bureaucracy’
","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie seems poised for easy re-election this November, one step on a path toward a possible 2016 presidential campaign. As Christie becomes a more prominent figure in the Republican Party, he’s subject to more criticism on the national level. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who oversees the Democratic National Committee, wrote a statement attacking Christie after a gubernatorial debate that gave us a taste of what we might hear more of over the next two years. For this fact-check, PolitiFact decided to hone in on her critique of the governor’s wage policy. ""He cut equal pay for women, calling it ‘senseless bureaucracy,' "" Wasserman said. ‘Senseless bureaucracy’ The New Jersey state legislature passed a package of four bills in September 2012 designed to narrow the pay gap. Christie signed one, gave conditional vetoes to two and an absolute veto to the other. Here’s a breakdown of each bill in the package and Christie’s actions: A-2647: Christie signed a statewide requirement for employers to notify employees of the right to be free from benefits and pay discrimination. A-2648: This bill was designed to extend protections for employees who reveal discriminatory actions in their workplaces. Christie vetoed this bill conditionally, because he wanted it to fall under a different existing law than what was proposed by legislators. The bill became law in August, after Christie’s changes were made. A-2649: Christie gave this bill an absolute veto. It called for government contractors to report employee gender and compensation information to the NJ Department of Labor. A-2650: This bill would grant back pay to victims of pay gap discrimination. Christie gave this a conditional veto because it didn’t specify a limitation for how far back pay could go. It hasn’t been passed. Assembly Bill A-2649, the bill requiring government contractors to report compensation by gender and the only absolute veto of the bunch, is the one Wasserman Schultz referred to in her critique of Christie’s attitude toward discrimination by gender. That’s the bill Christie described as ""senseless bureaucracy."" In his veto message, he wrote that the bill ""will burden countless employers with onerous reporting requirements, thereby driving up the cost of public contracts, which are ultimately shouldered by the taxpayer ... the reporting requirements fail to advocate sound policy over senseless bureaucracy."" The bill’s focus is on transparency surrounding pay, but it would not have directly required changes in salary by gender. Yasemin Besen-Cassino, a Montclair State University sociology professor, conducted research on New Jersey’s gender gap with the American Association of University Women. She said the bill Christie vetoed would’ve helped narrow the wage divide. ""A lot of women claim they just don’t know how much men make,"" Besen-Cassino said. ""One of the things that we found in our research was that making it public and at least available to a third party would push corporations toward equal pay."" There’s a correlation between a greater level of pay equity in the federal government and also a greater level of transparency, an AAUW report said. New Mexico passed legislation a couple of years ago requiring contractors to report pay equity information. Fatima Goss Graves, National Women’s Law Center vice president for education and employment, said the law has proven to be uncontroversial there. Vermont also has a similar law. We should note that although Christie vetoed that bill and issued conditional vetoes for others, he has not abolished any existing equal pay legislation, as a reader might assume from the wording of Wasserman Schultz’s comment. ""The governor has never ‘cut’ equal pay and he has a well-documented public position of supporting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (a national law) and equal pay for equal work,"" said Kevin Roberts, a campaign spokesman for Christie. Christie touted the importance of A-2647 and asserted his support for equal pay. ""Too often, women's value and contributions in the workplace have been undermined and shortchanged merely because of their gender,"" he said after signing the bill. Equal pay in New Jersey We wanted to take a look at the issue of equal pay in New Jersey on a broader scale and the implication that equal pay rights have not moved forward under Christie’s leadership. The median pay gap suggests that a woman in the Garden State make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. However, it’s important to remember that this number doesn’t control for factors like number of hours worked, occupation and race. The AAUW reports that one-third of the pay gap remains after these factors are controlled for. The national wage gap has not closed in the past decade, said Goss Graves of the National Women’s Law Center. New Jersey’s divide falls in the middle of the pack in terms of biggest wage differences, she added. ""I think that for Jersey, like the rest of the country, this problem has been pernicious and persistent and it’s clear that we can’t just wish it away,"" said Lisa Maatz, American Association of University Women vice president of government relations. ""We need some kind of legislative response."" Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said Christie ""cut equal pay for women, calling it a ‘senseless bureaucracy.’ "" Christie didn't cut anyone's pay, though. Instead, he said it was ""senseless bureaucracy"" to require government contractors to report more employee information, including information about gender and compensation, and he vetoed a measure that would have mandated such reporting. Experts said the measure would have improved equal pay for women. But Christie also signed two other bills that may help narrow the wage gap in New Jersey. So we rate Wasserman Schultz’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEA13C0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/17/debbie-wasserman-schultz/dnc-says-chris-christie-cut-equal-pay-wome/

Chain email says Nancy Pelosi will earn “$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical”
","Okay, people, let’s chat from the heart for a second. Congressional approval ratings nearing single digits and government shutdowns do not make viral rants about lawmakers’ pay any more true. If your in-box claims to share shocking truths in ALL-CAPS underlined exclamations!! — take your hand off the mouse button. Do not click Forward. Unless, of course, it’s to your favorite fact-checkers. Take this recent example sent by one of you to [email protected]: Subject: Obscene Salaries - Pass this on if you believe this is all wrong Salary of retired US Presidents .$180,000 FOR LIFE Salary of House/Senate....$174,000 FOR LIFE   This  is  stupid Salary of Speaker of the House ....$223,500 FOR  LIFE!  This is  really stupid Salary of Majority/Minority Leader $193,400 FOR   LIFE        Ditto last  line Average Salary of a teacher .. $40,065 Average Salary of Soldier DEPLOYED IN  AFGHANISTAN .. $38,000 Think about  this. Nancy Pelosi will retire as a Congress Person at $174,000 Dollars a year  for LIFE.    She has retired  as SPEAKER at $223,500 a year. PLUS she will  receive an additional $193,400 a year as Minority Leader. That's  $803,700 Dollars a  year for LIFE including FREE  medical which is  not available to us ...   the  taxpayers. She is  just one of the hundreds of Senators and Congress that float in and  out every year! I think we  found where the cuts should be made! If you  agree ..... pass it on, I just did.     In honor of Congress’ second-worst approval rating in Gallup history, let’s keep this simple: Do congressional lawmakers earn their salaries ""FOR LIFE? Would House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi get ""$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical""? No. And really, really, really, no. We’ll break it down. Do congressional lawmakers earn their salaries ""FOR LIFE? Let’s turn to the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the Congressional Research Service, which explains laws so even lawmakers can understand them. • Members of Congress earn their $174,000 salaries only during their elected terms. (Nope, not for life.) • They’re eligible for congressional pensions only after five years of service. (For a member of the House, that would mean getting elected to office at least three times.) Those pensions can’t be tapped until retirement age — and can’t be collected while a lawmaker still gets a federal salary. So John Kerry, for example, can’t collect his congressional pension while he serves as secretary of state, according to Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union. • The size of the pension depends on years of service and the average of a lawmaker’s highest three years of salary. The exact formula depends on when they started. Meanwhile, every paycheck, lawmakers contribute to both their pensions and Social Security. • Most congressional pensions are nowhere near a lawmaker’s salary. Under a pre-1984 retirement formula, it couldn’t be more than 80 percent of a lawmaker’s final salary, not counting cost-of-living adjustments. Under current rules, lawmakers could theoretically get more than 80 percent of their salary, but most would need to serve more than 66 years to get that. Would House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi get ""$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical""? The email writer gets a whole host of things wrong here. The message claims Pelosi will retire as a member of Congress making $174,000 — and that she’ll earn it annually, for life, on top of her full speaker’s salary of $223,500 and minority leader’s salary of $193,400, for a whopping ""$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical."" Nope. Congressional leaders do get paid more than other lawmakers. The speaker of the House earns $223,500. The House minority leader earns $193,400. That’s more than the $174,000 earned by the rank and file. But those are annual salaries that leaders earn while they hold their titles, not lifetime guarantees that get stacked on top of one another. • First, even if her pension did equal all three salaries, they add up to $590,900, not $803,700. (Unless perhaps the writer’s suggesting the ""free medical"" is worth $212,800 a year. Talk about rising health care costs!) • Second, that’s not how it works. See above. • Third, lawmakers don’t get ""free medical."" They pay a portion of their health insurance premiums, co-pays and co-insurance and can face a deductible, just like a lot of workers with employer-based health care. In January, their employer-offered health insurance will be a choice of plans offered on Obamacare’s federal exchange. Pelosi’s higher salary as House speaker from 2007-11 will boost her pension. But the congresswoman, who’s been in office since 1987, would have to work at least two more decades for her starting pension to match a regular lawmaker’s pay, much less $803,700. She’s 73. And, oh, by the way, lawmakers haven’t given themselves a pay raise since January 2009. We’re not saying they’re earning their keep. But perhaps it’ll make you feel slightly better that their salaries this year hit their lowest inflation-adjusted levels since December 1990. And that more than 200 of them were refusing pay while the government was closed. Our ruling A viral message claims congressional lawmakers earn their salaries ""FOR LIFE,"" which for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would add up to ""$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical."" Lawmakers don’t earn a salary after their terms end. They may earn pensions based on years of service, but those don’t start until retirement. They don’t get ""free medical."" It might feel good to click Forward. But it wouldn’t make this claim any less Pants on Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBCCFC0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/17/chain-email/chain-email-says-lawmakers-earn-salaries-life-whic/

Sheldon Whitehouse, Ted Cruz spar over how many Rhode Islanders signed up for Obamacare
","While Republicans and Democrats were still at loggerheads over the federal budget, the shutdown of the federal government and Obamacare, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, went on the Oct. 10 edition of CNN's ""Crossfire"" to debate all three. When the issue turned to Obamacare -- formally known as the Affordable Care Act -- , Whitehouse talked about how Rhode Islanders were receptive to the program, especially HealthSource RI, the state’s Obamacare health insurance exchange. He cited the case of one family that was so pleased, they returned to the HealthSource RI headquarters with coffee and doughnuts to thank the staff. At the time, many people were finding it impossible to sign up through exchanges run by other states and the federal government. That prompted this exchange: Cruz: ""It's interesting that you apparently found a family in Rhode Island that went on the exchanges and got insurance."" Whitehouse: ""Thirteen hundred."" Cruz: ""It was publicly reported there were 580 in Rhode Island."" We wondered who was correct, Cruz or Whitehouse. Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson said the senator's 1,300 number came via a phone conversation with HealthSource RI. We emailed HealthSource RI and asked Dara Chadwick, chief of strategic communications and media relations, how many people had signed up by the end of the day on Oct. 10, when the two senators were giving their numbers. She responded that 786 applications had been processed as of Oct 5. That's well above Cruz's number but well below Whitehouse's. And it was for the wrong date. So we asked again. When we declined to identify the politician we were fact-checking, Chadwick gave us another non-responsive answer. At that point, we sought help getting the number from the offices of both Whitehouse and Gov. Lincoln Chafee Meanwhile, we took out our calculator. On Oct. 11, the day after Whitehouse's appearance, the director of HealthSource RI, Christine Ferguson, told The Providence Journal's medical writer, Felice Freyer, that 1,698 applicants had completed their paperwork and selected a health insurance plan. The two numbers we did have suggested that about 163 applicants were completing the process each day. That means, at the time of the ""Crossfire"" appearance, roughly 1,467 applicants should have been processed. A few hours later we heard back from Chadwick. She said that at the end of the day on Oct. 10, 1,479 applications had been completed and processed. When we told her we were checking the Whitehouse appearance, she said the number supplied by HealthSource RI had been the total through Oct. 9, which was 1,313, essentially the number the senator cited. Our ruling In a televised debate on the evening of Oct. 10, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said 1,300 applicants in Rhode Island had signed up for insurance through Obamacare; his debate opponent, Sen.

Ann Coulter says no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare
","Conservative commentator Ann Coulter is not known for mincing words, but a recent column prompted many PolitiFact readers to contact us, seeking a fact-check. In the Oct. 9, 2013, column -- titled, ""Democrats to America: We Own the Government!"" -- Coulter pummels Democrats over provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law. We were most intrigued by one claim, since we hadn’t heard it before -- that ""no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."" Really? We tried to ask Coulter through her speaker’s bureau if she could provide any evidence for this, but we did not receive a reply. We are sure the claim wasn't intended as a joke, because it's included in a bullet-point list of straightforward criticisms of the law. So let’s start by looking at the claim literally. Is there any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would prevent U.S.-trained doctors from accepting ""Obamacare"" patients -- that is, patients who secure insurance through the marketplaces that are a centerpiece of the law? We feel comfortable, both from talking to experts and from our years of reporting on the law, that there is no such provision. If there were, it would probably be ripe for challenge on constitutional grounds. In fact, when we asked experts for their reaction to this claim, their responses included words such as ""outrageous,"" ""ridiculous"" and ""ludicrous."" ""Of course there's nothing in the law that would bar any doctor from seeing any patient,"" said Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard School of Public Health. So, no dice on the literal reading of her claim. Still, we wondered whether there was some other tiny, buried grain of truth in what Coulter claimed. Is the idea that American-trained doctors will be pickier about accepting insurance? There is some evidence that medical practices are wary about taking patients from plans sold on the marketplace. In September, the Medical Group Management Association -- a trade group for medical-practice executives -- surveyed 1,000 physician groups that collectively employ 47,500 doctors. The survey asked, among other things, ""Does your practice plan to participate with any new health insurance products sold on an ACA exchange?"" Only 29 percent of respondents gave a definitive ""yes."" That rate is twice as high as the share that that said ""no"" (14 percent) but less than those that were still weighing their options (40 percent). The top reasons? A fear of bureaucratic regulations, low reimbursement rates and the need to collect payment from patients with higher deductibles. However, it’s important to remember that this study is not evidence that can be used to support Coulter’s specific claim, because it says nothing about foreign-trained doctors. In fact, the closer you look at the issue of foreign-trained doctors, the less plausible Coulter’s claim becomes. According to a 2010 study by the American Medical Association, about 26 percent of physicians in the United States were trained in other countries. This number includes both foreign-born doctors who trained overseas and Americans who received their medical education in other countries. But tough licensing requirements for foreign-trained doctors -- requirements that won’t be changed by Obama’s law -- are keeping the number of foreign-trained physicians low. A key barrier is the need to obtain a residency in the United States, even if an applicant had practiced or had a residency overseas. According to the New York Times, just 42 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the leading matching service succeeded, compared to 94 percent of those who had trained in the United States. With such high barriers to entry, it’s not credible that a flood of foreign-trained doctors will suddenly swoop in and, without the help of a single American-trained doctor, serve each one of the newly insured patients who bought policies on the new marketplaces. ""I haven't seen any study that would suggest that American-trained doctors would be disproportionately less likely to see the newly insured,"" Baicker said. And even if there were such evidence, ""disproportionate is a far cry from ‘none,’ "" said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. ""There is no limit to the nonsense that some are saying. This borders on the absurd."" Our ruling Coulter said that ""no doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare."" Nothing in the law bars American-trained physicians from treating newly insured people under Obamacare. It’s a ridiculous claim -- one with a whiff of xenophobia -- that merits a Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB1C680>],/factchecks/2013/oct/16/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-no-doctors-who-went-american-medi/
"['Health Care', 'History', 'Texas', 'Ted Cruz']","
British prime minister didn't tell people the country couldn't possibly withstand Germany
","In his September 2013 day-night-and-day U.S. Senate floor speech challenging the Obamacare law, Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that anyone saying the 2010 law could not be defunded was, well, being un-American. Brave colonists rebelled against the British, the Houston Republican said, when pundits of the age said it could not be done. Unionists later fought to preserve the nation, he said, even though ""a lot of voices"" said it could not be done. Cruz continued: ""If we go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany — look, we saw it in Britain,"" Cruz said, as transcribed by the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper. ""Neville Chamberlain told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’ ""In America,"" Cruz said, ""there were voices who listened to that, I suspect the same pundits who said it couldn't be done. If this had happened in the 1940s, we would have been listening to them. Even then they would have made television. They would have gotten beyond the carrier pigeons and letters and they would have been on TV saying: ‘You cannot defeat the Germans.’"" Did Chamberlain declare his country should give way in Europe because it couldn’t withstand or defeat the Germans? We wondered. Senator's statement initially resonates Cruz offered no backup when we asked how he reached his characterization, which initially resonated because Chamberlain was unequivocally disinclined to war with Germany; he spent more than a year hoping diplomacy combined with rearmament would head off a showdown. Historians have written that he was hewing to a strategy of ""appeasement,"" a concept subsequently disparaged along with Chamberlain, who has been characterized as a failed leader who nearly let the Nazis overrun his country. A Chamberlain biographical web page from the BBC touches on the basics: ""Like many in Britain who had lived through World War One, Chamberlain was determined to avert another war. His policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler culminated in the Munich Agreement in which Britain and France accepted that the Czech region of the Sudetenland should be ceded to Germany. Chamberlain left Munich believing that by appeasing Hitler he had assured 'peace for our time'. However, in March 1939 Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, with Slovakia becoming a puppet state of Germany. Five months later in September 1939 Hitler's forces invaded Poland. Chamberlain responded with a British declaration of war on Germany. Historians say it didn't happen Still, four historians (including three based in England) uniformly told us Cruz’s claim was inaccurate in that it’s not correct that Chamberlain told the British people to accept Nazi domination of the continent because Britain couldn’t possibly stand against them. Cruz’s statement is ""skewed,"" William Roger Louis, a University of Texas history professor whose specialties include the history and politics of 20th century Britain, said by telephone. ""It’s a very distorted view."" On Chamberlain’s embrace of ""appeasement,"" Louis said: ""What Chamberlain meant was a reasoned solution to the problem… In retrospect,"" the term ""has come to mean a kind of defeatist view. That wasn’t the case at the time."" By email, Chamberlain biographer Nick Smart, who teaches at England’s Plymouth University, said Chamberlain did not say anything about giving in to the Nazis ""to anyone, let alone ‘the British people.’ There’s nothing like it in his diaries, speeches, or in any of the biographical treatments I have read."" British historian and journalist Andrew Roberts said by email: ""Of course"" Chamberlain ""didn't say that… He guaranteed"" the protection of ""Poland in 1939 and we were allied to France, so of course he didn't say Europe was not our problem. He declared wa(r) in Sept. 1939 sooner than have the Nazis in Poland and under Chamberlain we put troops into Belgium."" Checking Chamberlain biographies Next, we dipped into books on Chamberlain for indications of what he told the British people about letting the Nazis control the continent across the English Channel. Chamberlain became prime minister in May 1937 amid national wariness of another international conflict less than two decades after World War I, what was then called the Great War. Italy’s Mussolini and Germany’s Hitler both showed signs of bellicosity. Chamberlain was mindful, too, that British forces needed time to rebuild, making it necessary for him to exploit diplomacy toward slowing or stopping aggressive moves by the other countries, Smart wrote in his 2010 book, ""Neville Chamberlain."" Chamberlain, Smart wrote, agreed that Britain ""could not hope to meet simultaneously the threats of Germany, Japan and… Italy. It would therefore be necessary, as he saw it, to seek to confine and even isolate the German threat by using diplomacy to keep on friendly terms with Italy and Japan, whatever the provocation."" Meantime, Smart wrote, the prime minister accelerated rearmament. Chamberlain’s approach: Hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. Chamberlain also said the country should ""show our determination not to be bullied,"" Smart wrote. As noted by biographer Robert Self, Chamberlain said to the House of Commons in 1938: ""It is perfectly evident surely now that force is the only argument Germany understands,"" going on to stress the import of showing a ""visible force of overwhelming strength backed by the determination to use it."" Chamberlain acceded on taking of Sudetenland Still, Britain did not object when Hitler occupied German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland, that had been carved by treaty after World War I from what had been the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But later, when Hitler pushed beyond the Sudetenland to Prague, Britain delivered a ""guarantee"" of Polish independence, followed by similar vows to protect Greece, Romania and Turkey, Smart wrote. Thrice, Chamberlain personally conferred with Hitler, most famously (or infamously) in Munich in September 1938, after which he told the British people to acclaim that he believed he had secured ""peace in our time."" This was before Hitler pushed farther into Czechoslovakia and, through the summer of 1939, built up forces along Germany’s border with Poland. By email, Chamberlain biographer David Dutton, a professor at the University of Liverpool, told us ""Chamberlain did not think the Nazis could be left to get on with what they wanted to do in continental Europe. If this had been the case, he would never have got involved in the 1938 Czechoslovakian crisis in the first place."" Dutton also wrote: ""What Chamberlain did understand was that Britain was in no position to resist Germany in the 1930s, not least because we could not look to reliable allies,"" including the isolationist United States. ""He justly feared war, especially from the air… but he knew that it might eventually come and that Britain had to prepare for it as best she could,"" Dutton said. Generally, Dutton called Cruz’s claim ""superficial and misleading."" Chamberlain in charge when war was declared In the end, Chamberlain was prime minister when Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on Sept. 3, 1939, two days after he told the House of Commons that the British government had made it ""crystal clear"" to Germany that if it invaded Poland, ""we were resolved to oppose them by force."" He added that the responsibility belonged to Germany’s leader, Adolf Hitler, ""who has not hesitated to plunge the world into misery in order to serve his own senseless ambitions."" Noting that German troops had crossed into Poland and bombs were landing on defenseless towns, Chamberlain said: ""In these circumstances there is only one course open to us."" Chamberlain that day did not indicate the British couldn’t defeat the Nazis. Rather, he said British armed forces were better prepared than they had been for World War I. Chamberlain also indicated he had lost his patience with Germany in Europe. ""It now only remains for us to set our teeth and to enter upon this struggle, which we ourselves earnestly endeavored to avoid, with determination to see it through to the end,"" he said. Otherwise, he said, ""we shall merely pass from one crisis to another, and see one country after another attacked by methods which have now become familiar to us in their sickening technique. We are resolved that these methods must come to an end."" Our ruling Cruz said Chamberlain ""told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’ "" We see an element of truth in this claim; Chamberlain invested repeatedly in diplomacy in hopes of heading off war and he bowed to some German objectives on the continent. But he simultaneously committed to British rearmament and also made it clear, publicly, that his nation would not sit back should Germany invade Poland. We rate this statement as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['New Hampshire', 'Taxes', 'Jennifer Horn']","
N.H. GOP chairwoman Horn says Jeanne Shaheen “got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views""
","The 2014 election may still be more than a year away, but Republicans are already offering reasons why they think U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., should be defeated. New Hampshire Republican Chairwoman Jennifer Horn accused Shaheen of encouraging the Internal Revenue Service to impose more oversight on specific political groups. At a New Hampshire Republican Party fundraiser in August, Horn told the audience that Shaheen ""signed a letter to the IRS asking them to look more closely at some of these 501(c)(4)s,"" and that Shaheen ""got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views."" Other Republicans picked up on the theme. On Sept. 18, Jim Rubens announced his intention to challenge Shaheen for her seat. During his speech, Rubens said Shaheen ""has sicked the IRS on political groups that are saying unpopular things, breaching our First Amendment privileges."" It’s been four months since Republicans first accused Shaheen and six other senators of pressuring the IRS to look into political groups in a letter the senators wrote to former IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman. But as the campaign season heats up, we thought we would see if there’s any truth to claims like Horn’s and Rubens’. When we asked Horn for the evidence behind her statement that Shaheen ""got behind"" using the IRS to target specific political groups, she pointed to two sources: a letter Shaheen signed last year, and the senator’s comments on 501(c)(4) organizations during floor speeches. The Letter Shaheen signed a letter on Feb. 16, 2012, that asked the IRS to review its oversight of 501(c)(4) organizations that get involved in politics. (The name refers to a section of the tax code.) The Internal Revenue Code grants tax-exempt status for nonprofit organizations that promote social welfare. But Shaheen’s letter said some groups abuse tax-exempt privileges by calling themselves social welfare organizations while spending a majority of their money on influencing politics. The letter says the code specifies that social welfare ""does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for political office."" The letter came to prominence in May, after publication of a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that found that the IRS improperly targeted conservative groups. Some Republicans cited the letter as evidence that Democrats were responsible for such actions. But the accusation isn’t water-tight. Shaheen’s earliest letter was signed on Feb. 16, 2012, long after the date in 2010 cited by the Inspector General as the beginning of the IRS targeting specific groups. Her letter doesn’t mention ideological leaning of the political groups. Meanwhile, Shaheen and the same group of senators sent another letter to the IRS commissioner in March 2012. That letter did encourage the IRS to change the way it handles nonprofit organizations that spend money on politics, suggesting three changes, including that the organizations document the exact percentage of their money that goes toward social welfare. This letter didn’t mention partisan or ideological ties, either. Shaheen’s comments Horn also pointed to numerous floor speeches and comments, saying Shaheen only singled out conservative 501(c)(4) organizations, ignoring liberal social-welfare organizations that operate under the same model. Horn gave a July 17, 2012, floor speech as an example. In Shaheen’s prepared remarks, she only mentions one organization as an example: Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group. But in a video of the actual speech, she lists corporations, unions and nonprofit organizations as the groups who need transparent donation rules. She doesn’t name any one organization or party. Shaheen’s office also argued that the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending (or DISCLOSE) Act that the senator was speaking about on that day doesn’t directly address the IRS, as Horn implied. The act, which Shaheen has supported since 2010, requires groups to share information about their campaign contributions. While both the IRS regulations and the DISCLOSE Act deal with 501(c)(4) organizations, the first addresses their tax status while the second focuses on requirements to reveal their donors. Our Ruling Horn said Jeanne Shaheen ""got behind the idea of using the IRS to target American citizens for their political views."" Shaheen did ask the IRS to tighten its oversight of groups that are tax-free because they’re supposed to be pursuing social welfare efforts, but which are actually spending substantial amounts of money on political campaigns. Shaheen, however, voiced her opinion about two years after the controversial IRS efforts were already under way, and there is no evidence that she was aware of alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups before it became public in the Inspector General’s report. What Shaheen actually ""got behind"" was the DISCLOSE Act, which requires non-profit groups to share information about their campaign contributions. It’s a stretch to suggest that Shaheen favored going after citizens ""for their political views."" At most, her scrutiny was aimed at ensuring transparency about the funding sources for groups across the ideological spectrum. On balance, we rate Horn’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB07100>],/factchecks/2013/oct/16/jennifer-horn/nh-gop-chairwoman-horn-says-jeanne-shaheen-got-beh/
"['Debt', 'Federal Budget', 'Texas', 'Roger Williams']","
Roger Willliams correct government could cover projected interest costs, but paying all bills seems dicey
","In an interview, first-term U.S. Rep. Roger Williams vowed not to vote for raising the federal debt ceiling. ""I just won’t do it,"" the Austin Republican was quoted as saying in an Oct. 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. Besides, Williams said, even if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, ""we are not going to default. We have $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills."" We wondered about that, mindful that the U.S. Treasury secretary has speculated about the risks of the government not having enough cash on hand. Treasury secretary's warning The debt ceiling, now nearly $16.7 trillion, constrains how much the government can borrow to meet obligations. And in October 2013, the Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, told a Senate panel that unless Congress raised the ceiling, ""extraordinary measures"" taken since the spring would be exhausted no later than Oct. 17 ""at which point the federal government will have run out of borrowing authority. At that point, we will be left to meet our country’s commitments with only the cash on hand and any incoming revenues, placing our economy in a dangerous position. ""If we have insufficient cash on hand,"" Lew said, ""it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments to our military and veterans and contracts with private suppliers for the first time in our history. At the same time,"" he said, ""we’re relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds. Every week we roll over approximately $100 billion in U.S. (Treasury) bills. If U.S. bond-holders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll over their investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance."" Williams' backup cites projected interest costs We asked Williams how he reached his conclusion. By email, Williams’ spokeswoman Haley Graves provided a transcript of the Statesman’s question to Williams, who has long owned automobile dealerships, and his response. Statesman: ""Do you think the warnings about what a failure to enact a debt ceiling increase, the effect on the economy, is overblown or is that real?"" Williams: ""We’re not going to default because we do have $3 trillion of cash flow coming in to America. Alright? Now the cash flow doesn’t flow evenly – it’s like your business.  You have receivable, this and that, but you do have $3 trillion in cash. That’s more cash flow than we’ve ever had coming in to the government than ever. And so we can pay our bills. We can pay our debt service. We can pay our military. We’re not going to default."" Graves said Williams based his $3 trillion reference on a May 2013 projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the government would collect $3.042 trillion in revenues through the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2013. Asked if Williams was referring to the government paying all its bills, Graves said Williams has said ""all along"" that the government will not default because its cash flow would be enough to pay bond holders and to fulfill interest payments. What's default? Observers of the debt-ceiling debate diverge on how to define a government default, though they agree it’s not happened before. By telephone, economist Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute, a limited-government think tank, said Williams’ main point is supported by the CBO’s projection of $237 billion in net interest costs through the same fiscal year. Everyone agrees not paying such interest would hurt financial markets, Edwards said, but his sense is that if interest costs are paid on time, the government can avoid default, though that course could prove ""ugly,"" he said, because the Treasury would need to pick and choose which other obligations--ranging from Social Security checks to Pentagon contracts--to pay in full and on time. ""It would make people very mad,"" Edwards said, ""but it wouldn’t  be a default."" Edwards also noted an Oct. 2, 2013, Yahoo Finance interview with David Stockman. Stockman, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, said that if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, the government could easily tap incoming revenue to make its interest payments while also covering regular payments to Social Security retirees, the armed services and Medicare reimbursements. ""It is a complete red herring to say there will be a default,"" Stockman said. ""There will never be a time in which there is not enough cash to pay the interest."" Then again, Edwards told us, a counter-argument he attributed to liberals and Democrats is that it would be very hard for the Treasury to make the described alternative spending choices. A Brookings Institution economist, Gary Burtless, said by email that it’s conceivable the Treasury could prevent default on government-backed securities by keeping up with interest payments, though he said he lacked the expertise to judge whether the Treasury could legally implement a choose-the-bill-to-pay strategy. Realistically, Burtless said, if the government runs short of the revenue required to pay non-interest costs, that would seem like a default to any affected creditors. ""If a business makes timely payments on its secured and unsecured bank debt but does not make promised payment to its suppliers (for supplies already delivered), workers (for hours of work already supplied), and pensioners (for pensions promised under the company pension plan),"" he said, ""most observers would say the company has defaulted on its obligations to some of its creditors.  Suppliers, workers, and pensioners are creditors of the company just as certainly as banks that have extended the company a loan."" Also responding to our inquiry, economist Jared Bernstein of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities pointed out by email that the CBO-projected $3 trillion in revenue stands to be outpaced by predicted expenditures of $3.6 trillion in the fiscal year. This leads to a key question, Bernstein said, as to whether there will be days when cash flow undershoots what must be paid. Bernstein noted that a September 2013 report by the Bipartisan Policy Center said this will occur with, for instance, revenue a few weeks after mid-October 2013 running behind spending demands by more than $100 billion. The report also said that if the government exhausted its ability to pay all its bills by Oct. 18, 2013, the Treasury would run about $106 billion short of meeting obligations over the next 20 business days.  ""Approximately 32% of the funds owed for the period would go unpaid,"" the report said, with the reality proving ""chaotic."" Uncertainty at Treasury We did not find any indication that the Treasury has aired a strategy to pick and choose which bills it pays in the event of cash-flow slowing. A Sept. 19, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service floated opposite speculations. In 2012, the report said, a Treasury official said the agency lacked congressional guidance on prioritization and hence only had a system to pay bills as they came in, one after the other. In contrast, according to the report, the Government Accountability Office said in a 1985 letter to the then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bob Packwood, that the Treasury was ""free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States."" Burtless said that his understanding is the Treasury cannot prioritize its payments to contractors, Social Security pensioners, Medicare payees (doctors and hospitals that have provided services to the Medicare-insured population), non-furloughed civilian workers, members of the uniformed military, etc.  If a supplier, a pensioner, a non-furloughed worker, military serviceperson, doctor or hospital does not receive timely payment, does that constitute a ‘default’?"" An Oct. 13, 2013, PolitiFact story listing questions and answers about the debt ceiling said that if the ceiling is not raised, the government isn’t expected to have sufficient cash to meet all obligations in a timely manner past the beginning of November 2013, at latest. ""So what happens then?"" PolitiFact wrote. ""The most obvious solution (beyond simply doing nothing) is to prioritize payments. Bondholders would likely be paid off first, since a missed or delayed payment on a financial instrument would entail the most severe peril for the government. Outraging senior citizens by delaying or missing a Social Security check is bad enough, the thinking goes, but if investors decide en masse to abandon U.S. bonds in the future, it would put the entire stability of the federal government’s finances (and ultimately, the U.S. economy) at risk. And according to experts, prioritization has problems. ""For one thing, the federal government’s computer systems are not set up to do this, meaning it might not be a practical option (and could result in costly errors),"" PolitiFact said. ""In addition, the Treasury says it’s not clear it would have the legal authority to make those sorts of decisions. And it could cost more, since the law requires the government to pay interest on top of any payments that are delayed. It’s also not clear whether prioritizing bondholder payments would keep the United States from a ‘default.’ ""It all depends on how you define the word ‘default.’ Some lawmakers who downplay the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling argue that a default only happens if interest on securities isn’t paid. A missed payment to a federal contractor or a Social Security recipient, according to this argument, doesn’t trigger a default."" The story noted that the CRS has ""acknowledged that there’s no clear answer to this question, but it does note that Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term ‘default’ as ‘the failure to make a payment when due’ — a definition that does not restrict a default to a missed interest payment. Ultimately, CRS notes, ‘financial markets’ perceptions of what constitutes a default, or a real threat of default, may be more relevant when assessing the potential impacts of not raising the debt limit.’"" Our ruling Williams said the government ""has $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills"" and won’t default. In the 12 months through September 2014, the government is projected to raise $3 trillion in revenue, far more than enough to cover some $237 billion in its projected interest costs. In this way, perhaps, default could be avoided. Still, Williams made a broader reference to paying ""our bills,"" and on that front, there’s debate over whether the government could meet all its obligations or have the authority to pick and choose what to pay. These are important details. We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

NRCC says Rep. Ann Kuster turned “a blind eye to those in need of funding” in shutdown votes
","As the government shutdown continues into its third week, Republicans and Democrats are still exchanging jabs over who is to blame. The National Republican Congressional Committee -- the campaign arm of House Republicans -- asks Americans in a recent web video to tell U.S. Rep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H., along with six other House Democrats, to end what it calls partisan gamesmanship. In the accompanying news release, NRCC Communications Director Andrea Bozek said Kuster ""has turned her back on women, children and our nation’s veterans throughout President Obama’s shutdown, and it’s time for her and her liberal allies to stop the partisan games."" ""The House has passed bipartisan bills to help the American people while the shutdown continues, and Kuster has continued to turn a blind eye to those in need of funding."" The other Democratic lawmakers targeted by the ads are U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire, Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut, Bill Enyart of Illinois, Ann Kirkpartick of Arizona, and Rick Nolan and Tim Walz of Minnesota. The NRCC’s video draws on a series of House measures that would have opened specific portions of the government even as the larger shutdown continued. When those measures came up for consideration in the House, Kuster ""voted against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health,"" the NRCC says. We wondered if Kuster did indeed vote against funding for programs that support veterans and low-income families, groups for which she’s pledged her support. We turned to the House roll call votes for the topics highlighted by the National Republican Congressional Committee. In recent weeks, Kuster -- along with virtually every Democrat -- has voted no on the following resolutions. All of these measures would have given agencies in question the same level of funding as in fiscal year 2013, which ended Sept. 30. The resolutions would have extended funding through Dec. 15. • House Joint Resolution 72 to approve a continuing resolution for veterans benefits. The resolution passed 259 to 157. • House Joint Resolution 77 to provide money for the Food and Drug Administration. The resolution passed 235 to 162. • House Joint Resolution 75 to fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. The resolution passed 244 to 164. • House Joint Resolution 73 to give money to the National Institutes of Health. The resolution passed 254 to 171. • House Joint Resolution 59 to approve continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014. The resolution first passed on Sept. 20, in a 230 to 189 vote. Kuster voted against the resolution on that date and on two other dates when the House approved Senate amendments to the resolution. Democratic lawmakers have said they won’t support budget bills that cherry-pick which agencies or departments receive money.  Each resolution above passed along strong party lines, as have most of the resolutions that would have directed money to specific departments without ending the shutdown. In addition, President Barack Obama has promised to veto any such legislation that makes it to his desk. In other words, this has been a unified Democratic strategy to fund the entire government, rather than offering piecemeal funding for limited portions of the government proposed by House Republicans. Kuster offered this rationale when we asked her to explain why she voted no on the resolutions highlighted by the NRCC. Rob Friedlander, a Kuster spokesman, said the congresswoman believes the right way to support students, veterans, small businesses and middle-class families is to reopen the entire government. He pointed to a recent opinion piece Kuster wrote. In that op-ed, Kuster argues that piecemeal funding isn’t a solution to the shutdown because it would leave much of the government closed. ""Let me be perfectly clear: these measures are not solutions. They’re cynical political ploys. They’re half-hearted half-measures. They’re empty gestures that attempt to create the appearance of progress where none exists,"" she wrote. Friedlander also said that groups representing some of the constituencies named by the NRCC have said they, too, oppose legislation that funds individual agencies in place of reopening the government with a full budget. In a letter to U.S. House and Senate leaders, veterans representatives said that short-term continuing resolutions for the Veterans Administration aren’t acceptable because they don’t take into account the effects of inflation, increased demand for services or costs of starting new programs. The letter was co-authored by leaders of AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Veterans of Foreign Wars. The groups had more nuanced views on the specific bill -- H.J.R. 72 -- that would have provided money for disability checks and survivors compensation but not reopen other Veterans Administration offices, including information technology, medical research and National Cemetery Administration. The Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans and Veterans of Foreign Wars did not take an official position on the measure, but the groups, to varying degrees, expressed dissatisfaction with that model of legislation. ""That (resolution), in general, is bad policy,"" said Carl Blake, legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America, which expressed the clearest discomfort of the four groups about the short-term funding approach. Meanwhile, a news release from the American Public Health Association said that while the group supports the important research done through the National Institutes of Health, it ""opposes efforts to fund individual agencies at the expense of others."" Finally, the National WIC Association, which advocates for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), opposed House Joint Resolution 75. While that resolution would have given money for nutrition assistance to low-income women and children, the association called the resolution a way to use mothers and young children as pawns for political ends, and said the program has enough money to operate through October, giving lawmakers enough time to agree on a full budget. The National Republican Congressional Committee said Kuster's votes speak for themselves. ""It’s a fact that Kuster voted against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health,"" said NRCC spokesman Daniel Scarpinato. ""Don’t take my word for it, or some other organization, just take a look at the votes cited in the release."" We disagree; in this case, the context matters. Our ruling The NRCC said that Kuster has turned ""a blind eye to those in need of funding"" by voting ""against funding for our nation’s veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health."" The NRCC is correct that Kuster did vote against each of the resolutions that would have temporarily provided funding for veterans, low-income women and children, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health. However this only tells part of the story. The Democrats say they are pushing for a measure to fund all of government, not just a few pieces chosen by House Republicans. Notably, a number of advocacy groups whose funding Koster is accused of turning a ""blind eye"" to, are actually on the record saying they agree with Democrats that the government should be funded in its entirety and for a longer period of time, rather than in a short-term and piecemeal fashion. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8197C0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/16/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-rep-ann-kuster-turned-blind-eye-those-ne/

RNC says Wasserman Schultz voted to cut off veterans benefits
","The House of Representatives might not have been able to hold a speedy vote to end the shutdown but that doesn’t mean it didn’t hold lots of votes. And where there are votes, there are opportunities to use those votes against your opponents. Veterans benefits are always fertile ground for this tactic and this week, the Republican National Committee launched a robocall campaign aimed at a handful of Democrats, nominally for their failure to support veterans. On the target list are Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D- Nev., Sens. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Kay Hagan, D-N.C., and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. Wasserman Schultz is also chair of the Democratic National Committee. Here’s part of the GOP script slated for Wasserman Schultz’s district: ""Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz thinks this shutdown is a game. She voted to cut off Florida’s veterans and their benefits while the government is shutdown. In a bipartisan vote the House of Representatives wanted to make sure our veterans got the benefits they earned fighting for our freedoms. These men and women served our country with honor but Debbie Wasserman Schultz would rather put partisan politics ahead of honoring our commitment to the people who defended this country."" The claim we’ll check is whether the congresswoman ""voted to cut off Florida’s veterans and their benefits"" during the shutdown. When we asked the Republican National Committee which vote they had in mind, they pointed to H.J. Res 72, one of the mini-funding resolutions favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The bill was aimed at preventing the worst results of the shutdown rather than ending it entirely. About 95 percent of Veterans Affairs workers are exempt from the worker furloughs that have happened because of the stalemate in Washington. Accordingly, most benefits and health care services have continued. But new claims for disability benefits have been stuck at the rear of an already large backlog of claims. Plus, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki warned Congress that if the shutdown extended into November, his department would not have enough money to send out more than 5 million checks worth about $6 billion. The House measure would have provided funding to avoid that. The bill won the support of every Republican and 35 Democrats and easily passed the House, but the Democratic-controlled Senate would have nothing to do with it. As a party, Democrats took the approach that the best thing to do would be to end the shutdown across the board. With the Senate in Democratic hands, every House mini-funding bill was doomed. Wasserman Schultz was one of 157 House Democrats who voted against the bill. So did the vote actually ""cut off veterans and their benefits""? The phrasing in the robocall glosses over why benefits might be at risk. Regardless of which party was more responsible for the shutdown, and people of different political beliefs will disagree over that, Republicans have some responsibility for creating a situation where veterans benefits might be interrupted. It was House Republicans who pressed to defund President Barack Obama’s signature health care law that ended up leading to the shutdown. Wasserman Schultz might have failed to back this particular approach to ensure benefits would continue under a worst-case scenario, but they were flowing at the time of the vote, and she did not vote to cut them off. The context is considerably more complex. Veterans groups divided While the Republicans present her vote as contrary to veterans' interests, the groups that lobby on veterans behalf offered a different view. Several large groups, including Disabled American Veterans, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars, decided not to endorse the Republican bill. ""We didn’t take a position on this resolution,"" said Raymond Kelley, director of National Legislative Service for Veterans of Foreign Wars. ""Our response when asked was that Congress cannot effectively provide all of the benefits and services through a piecemeal approach and that we wanted Congress to pass a fully funded VA budget."" Veterans groups noted that the full House had passed an appropriations bill for Veterans Affairs in June. (Wasserman Schultz voted for it; the vote was 421-4.) That provided about $6.2 billion more than the stopgap measure. Veterans groups urged lawmakers of both parties in both houses of Congress to move forward with that. One organization, the American Legion, did get behind the temporary House bill. ""We are here to support veterans, not get in the middle of a political fray,"" explained Louis Celli, legislative affairs director for the American Legion. ""Of course, the whole government being open supports vets in a more holistic way, but we will never pass up an opportunity to help vets."" For example, housing and job training assistance programs exclusively for veterans are run by other departments that were untouched by the House bill. Celli said his organization does not hold a ""no"" vote against any lawmaker. He said he understands many are strong supporters of veterans, and they wanted a bigger plan to fund all programs at once. ""We won’t come out and condemn any lawmaker who voted a different way,"" Celli said. Many Democratic efforts to fund the entire government, including Veterans Affairs, were unsuccessful in the House. Wasserman Schultz’s office said she voted 17 times on measures that would have ended the shutdown. Our ruling The Republican National Committee said in a robocall that Wasserman Schultz voted to cut off benefits for veterans. The claim is suspect on several fronts. It focuses on one bill out of many that would have preserved ongoing funds for veterans programs. Wasserman Schultz could accurately claim she voted many more times to support such funding. Some of the largest veterans organizations did not endorse the Republican measure, given the overall context of a government shutdown. And the wording in the robocall makes a muddle of the entire sequence of events, beginning with why veterans benefits might be at risk, and the reality that in the short run, most benefits have been flowing.

Brian Birdwell criticized election foe for Capitol lobbyist donations before holding post-election fundraiser with Capitol lobby
","
This June, Republican Brian Birdwell of Granbury won a special election runoff to fill a vacated Texas Senate seat he's now poised to capture for a full term; he's unopposed on the November general-election ballot.

Like many a winner for state office, Birdwell subsequently welcomed donations at a post-election fundraiser in Austin to which lobbyists for special interests were invited. The Sept. 16 event was hosted by the political arm of Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which endorsed Birdwell not long after his win, TLR spokeswoman Sherry Sylvester told us.

Nothing odd about tapping the lobby for contributions after an election, right?

For Birdwell, we wondered.

As Birdwell stumped toward victory, he was critical of his final foe, pointing out in a press release that he'd raised more money from residents of the Waco-area district. He noted that his opponent, senator-turned-lobbyist David Sibley, had leaned on contributions from Austin-based special interests including lobbyists. 
Birdwell's June 15 release says Sibley's candidacy ""has little to do with our district interests, but is all about him protecting his special interests. Waco, Cleburne, Waxahachie and the many small communities of this district deserve a voice to represent them. Austin already has over 1,400 lobbyists and we don't need one as our state senator.""

The statement also says: ""The simple fact is, lobbyists and PACs can't vote, but my supporters who live in the district can.""

At the time, Birdwell certainly wasn't attracting lobbyist support. Up to his win, Birdwell drew donations from a single Austin political action committee, according to his campaign finance reports. From March through June, less than $11,200, 7 percent of his total contributions, came from four Austin donors, counting two PACs.

Has the rookie senator flip-flopped on taking donations from lobbyists?

Birdwell was unavailable for an interview. However, Maggie Mayfield, his campaign spokeswoman, shared a statement from the senator that refers to an unsuccessful Democratic Party lawsuit challenging Birdwell's legal residency in Texas which, Birdwell's statement says, resulted in ""significant legal bills.""

Birdwell didn't volunteer the names of new lobbyist donors, but his statement says he's ""happy to to have the support of groups in Austin who didn't originally back my candidacy."" 
Birdwell's statement also says his campaign is having a number of fund-raisers across his district, though he has ""no expectation"" of recouping through donations the personal loans he made to his campaign.

Birdwell's latest contribution and expenditure report doesn't show any outstanding loans. However, his campaign finance filings covering March through June indicate he put more than $170,000 in personal funds into his campaign -- about half of $337,000 in total campaign spending, we calculate. On the paperwork, Birdwell marked that he intends to get reimbursed from political contributions for the personal expenditures.

All in all, it would require a break from political reality to ding the senator for accepting contributions from interest groups wielding clout at the Capitol. That happens routinely.

Besides, we see no sign Birdwell ever vowed not to take such aid.

Still, after poking his opponent for piling up lobby money, Birdwell is evidently aboard with doing the same. Rate this a Half Flip on the PolitiFact Texas Flip-O-Meter.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EADF32C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/26/brian-birdwell/brian-birdwell-criticized-election-foe-capitol-lob/

Kilmartin says he helped create Rhode Island's witness protection program
","
You might think a state like Rhode Island, with its legacy of organized crime and corruption, would have had a witness protection program for decades. So we were surprised when Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat running for attorney general, said he helped create it just nine years ago.

On his website, Kilmartin boasts about a host of professional accomplishments during his 20 years as a state representative. Among them, he says, he helped ""create a witness protection program.""

Was there really no witness protection program before Kilmartin?

First, a history lesson. The federal Witness Security Program, the one that gives witnesses new identities and new lives, was created as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and amended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. It is run by the U.S. Marshals Service.

But that program primarily covers federal cases. Witnesses in state-level cases have occasionally been placed in the program, but only in the most dangerous of circumstances. Several decades ago, states began to realize there was a need for less drastic, localized protection when witnesses needed temporary security before and after testifying, not a whole new identity. So they began creating their own programs.

Here in Rhode Island, the push for a state policy began in the wake of a scandal involving mob informant Peter Gilbert, who used drugs, carried weapons, collected welfare and went skydiving while under the protection of the Providence police. His case led then-Attorney General James O'Neil and the legislature to create new guidelines to control the costs of monitoring witnesses and establish a board to oversee who was eligible for protection.

But there were gaps in the new policy. Local police departments continued to run their own protection programs with little coordination.

Witnesses were typically afforded temporary protection only if they said they felt threatened. That meant it was mostly limited to criminal witnesses who agreed to testify in exchange for leniency. Innocent witnesses rarely participated, according to Michael J. Healey, spokesman for the attorney general's office.

""It was a witness protection program in name only because it wasn't what you think of when you think of protecting someone who witnessed a crime,"" he said.

The flaws in the system were exposed a decade later. In the spring of 2000, 15-year-old Jennifer Rivera, a key witness in a Providence murder case, was fatally shot the day before she was to testify.

Then-Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse, now a U.S. senator, came under fire for not  protecting the teenager. He subsequently created a group to study how to remake the law to better identify and protect vulnerable witnesses.

Among its recommendations: centralize the program within the attorney general's office and devote a full-time staff person to oversee it; require prosecutors and police to conduct independent assessments of the witness's need for safety, instead of waiting for the witness to express concern; and seal the program's records to protect participants.

This is when Kilmartin, a state representative from Pawtucket, entered the picture. With the outline of the bill in hand, Whitehouse asked Kilmartin to sponsor the legislation, according to both the attorney general's office and Kilmartin.

Kilmartin was a city police officer at the time and had sponsored several law-enforcement related bills.

""I think the Rivera situation clearly showed that the statute we had was antiquated and wasn't comprehensive enough. It didn't provide the evaluation necessary to protect people,"" Kilmartin recalled. ""So we passed the bill and updated the law in response to that situation.""

The legislation was introduced in the spring of 2001 and became law that summer.

Did Kilmartin technically help create the Rhode Island's witness protection program? No. He wasn't even in office yet when the first version become law. But as the attorney general's spokesman points out, that was a protection program in name only, since it provided little protection for innocent witnesses.

What Kilmartin did through his sponsorship of the 2001 bill was to help update and strengthen an existing witness protection program to centralize it and create necessary controls.

He can't take all the credit, but we'll give him his fair share and call it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBAD040>],/factchecks/2010/sep/26/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-says-he-helped-create-rhode-islands-witn/

Kendra Yarbrough Camarena, Democrat for Texas House, says Austin politicians want bigger classes in public schools
","
Democrat Kendra Yarbrough Camarena, challenging Republican state Rep. Dwayne Bohac of Houston, vows to battle to keep classes small in elementary schools.

In a TV ad that debuted online Sept. 14, Camarena says: ""Austin politicians want to cram more kids into classrooms so they don't have to make the tough decisions to balance the budget.""

Politicians dodging tough budget decisions by crowding schoolrooms? We wanted a refresher on both parts of that.

To our inquiry, Camarena's campaign manager, Mary Bell, said ""Austin politicians"" refers to Republican legislators. Bell said the ad's statement is based on a plank in the Republican Party of Texas' 2010 platform and a May 10 news article in the Dallas Morning News.

In a section headlined ""Legislative Priorities,"" the platform says: ""Create flexibility for school districts under the class size limit mandate."" That's a reference to state law approved in 1984 pinning the permitted ratio of students to teachers from kindergarten through fourth grade in Texas public schools at 22-to-1.

The Morning News article says a special House-Senate legislative committee studying education finance in advance of the 2011 legislative session is looking at easing the mandate, which came into place with a raft of changes, including the requirement that students pass classes to participate in extracurricular activities.

The newspaper article quotes state Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, and state Rep. Rob Eissler, R-The Woodlands, the panel's co-chairs, saying it might be time to change the mandate in the face of an expected state funding shortfall.

Currently, the newspaper reported, every time a class exceeds the 22-student limit, districts must create an additional class, meaning an additional teacher and classroom, though districts can request waivers.

One special committee member, Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, is quoted saying the limit costs school districts millions of dollars annually despite a lack of evidence it boosts achievement; he's described as favoring an average class size that schools would have to adhere to, leaving the size of each class up to local administrators. Patrick recently told us he expects his proposal to gain traction in the 2011 session.

Representatives of teacher groups, which oppose larger classes, are quoted in the newspaper article saying the limit has fed improvements in student performance. They note that school districts already can and do request waivers for individual campuses.

Seeking to gauge if changing the mandate is likely, we checked on whether the Select Committee on Public School Finance Weights, Allotments & Adjustments has reached its legislative recommendations.

It has not, Eissler told us in an interview, nor is it certain the panel will revisit the class-size mandate. He said, though, he's mulling his own proposal to offer bonuses to high-quality teachers who volunteer to teach more than 22 students.

""School districts could save money on additional classrooms, good teachers would get more money, more kids would get exposed to the better teachers,"" Eissler said.

""At times (of fiscal pressure) like these, you have to explore a lot of things,"" he said.

Next, we reached Shapiro, who said school superintendents have urged lawmakers to relax the 22-1 mandate, perhaps (as Patrick proposes) by allowing districts to average 22 students per teacher in kindergarten through fourth grade.

Of Camarena's statement, Shapiro said: ""We're certainly not going to cram anybody into a classroom. That's an exaggeration,"" she said, which leaves the impression of students not getting tasks done in a room without a desk per child.

Eissler and Shapiro bridled at the second part of Camarena's statement, that loosening the class-size mandate means lawmakers ""don't have to make the tough decisions to balance the budget."" Shapiro pointed out such a relaxation would only affect local district spending--not the strapped state budget. State education aid goes to school districts based largely on the number of students they serve, not how many classes are taught at each school.

On another front, we wondered if superintendents favor changes to the 22-1 mandate. Spokeswoman Jenny Caputo of the Texas Association of School Administrators, whose membership includes most superintendents, said in an e-mail the group doesn't have an official stance on the issue, and the membership is pretty evenly divided on whether the law should be changed. Relaxing the standard, Caputo writes, is ""a tough sell -- even if a bill could get passed, which isn't likely, parents would certainly fight it and having larger-than-average class sizes is not something that attracts teachers in droves to your district either.""

Separately, Clay Robison, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, said teachers want to keep the class-size cap. ""It's very popular not only with teachers -- it's very popular with parents,"" Robison said. ""Parents don't like putting their kids, particularly their young kids, in crowded classrooms.""

Upshot: A Republican state senator says the 22-student limit for elementary grade classes should be eased to give local school administrators leeway to set class sizes. Lawmakers who helm a special Senate-House education committee each say the idea could gain support.

However, none of the trio -- Patrick, Shapiro, Eissler -- concede the goal is to ""cram more kids into classrooms,"" as Camarena says.

The second part of Camerena's statement, that changing the size limit is a way for politicians to avoid making ""the tough decisions to balance the budget,"" isn't supported. Notably, any budgetary boon from changing the limit would be enjoyed by school districts, not the state.

Still, it could end up that more than 22 children are placed in some classrooms. We rate Camarena's statement as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCE9D00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/25/kendra-yarbrough-camarena/kendra-yarbrough-camarena-democrat-texas-house-say/

Pinellas Commission challenger says county laid off 1,200 while Latvala in office
","
Pinellas County’s finances have taken a hit in the recession. And Democrat Bob Hackworth uses it to deliver punches to County Commissioner Susan Latvala, whom he is looking to unseat Nov. 2. 
His message: He knows how to better manage the county, and for proof, voters should look to how the county has fared under Latvala’s tenure. 
""I’m also struck by the irony that as we talk about jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, that the downsizing of Pinellas County government resulted in about 1,200 people being laid off in a 12 percent unemployment market,"" Hackworth told a crowd at a Dunedin candidate forum Sept. 14, 2010. 
""And so I think we have to be a little sensitive and we also have to be fiscally responsible and acknowledge that as you downsize and cut the cost of government there is a cost that you as the taxpayers bear to deal with that high unemployment number. … I can tell you that every one of them was hired from the time that Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000."" 
Every single one? And 1,200 layoffs?  
We decided to see if voters should rely on Hackworth’s math. 
Hackworth said afterward he was referring to job losses in the years since the economy slid, starting in 2007. 
Since 2007, 465 county employees were laid off, according to records provided by county agencies.  
That count excludes people who received layoff notices but decided to retire instead, or people who wound up with a new county job as departures shook out.  
If you look at the number of people who actually received a layoff notice, the count is 799, still short of Hackworth’s 1,200. 
The next question was whether all the people who were laid off were hired under Latvala’s tenure. Her first meeting as a commissioner was Nov. 21, 2000. 
Using that timeline, only 341 people hired after that date were later subject to layoff. 
""It’s parsing,"" Hackworth responded, saying many more positions were cut. 
Here we’re checking two related statements from Hackworth: ""The downsizing of Pinellas County government resulted in about 1,200 people being laid off in a 12 percent unemployment market. … I can tell you that every one of them was hired from the time that Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000."" 
On that broader point, he’s right. The county government has eliminated 1,612 positions since 2007. But not all of those jobs involved layoffs, because some were vacant, and some involved retirements that were not filled, for example. 
But Hackworth said ""layoffs,’’ and specifically of people hired during Latvala’s tenure, which numbered only 341.  
So we rate his claims False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEC0240>],/factchecks/2010/sep/25/bob-hackworth/pinellas-commission-challenger-says-county-laid-12/

Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala says she only backed one small tax hike
","
Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala has been forced to defend her record on taxes as she tries to fend off attacks from challenger Bob Hackworth, who is looking to unseat her in the Nov. 2 election. 
At a Dunedin candidates forum on Sept. 14, Latvala contradicted Hackworth directly on her votes for property tax rate increases.  
""One of the other inaccuracies, and there were many and I’m not going to address all of them, is that we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget. Absolutely not true,"" Latvala told the crowd. ""One tax increase since I’ve been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only."" 
Hackworth has criticized Latvala for voting for tax rate increases when he didn’t as a city commissioner in Dunedin. The county took advantage of rising property values that already were increasing revenue to Pinellas, he said. 
We wondered: Who is right? 
Latvala referred to a vote for the 2002-03 budget involving the municipal services taxing unit, which is a property tax paid only by residents who live in unincorporated areas of Pinellas. In August 2002, she was part of 6-1 vote to raise the property tax rate, meeting records show. Discussion at the time focused on increasing revenue to pay for recreation and other services. 
Latvala misstated the size of the hike. The rate increased a half-mill, not a quarter-mill, from $1.856 per $1,000 of taxable property value to $2.356. 
At the same meeting in which the County Commission raised the unincorporated property tax rate, it also raised a different tax, a 5.1 percent increase of the telecommunications services tax. 
And a year earlier, meeting records show that Latvala voted with the majority to increase the property tax rate countywide. 
It was a small increase, from $6.75 per $1,000 of property to $6.801, but an increase nonetheless. 
She did vote to raise taxes more than once during her nearly 10 years on the commission. 
""I goofed,"" Latvala said, when confronted with the records. 
So we rate Latvala’s claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB831F00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/25/susan-latvala/pinellas-county-commissioner-susan-latvala-says-sh/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Military', 'Florida', 'Allen West']","
Allen West says he has 'clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain'
","During a candidate forum sponsored by the Pompano, Fla., Civic Association on Sept. 21, 2010, Allen West -- a retired Army lieutenant colonel running as the Republican nominee against Democratic Rep. Ron Klein -- made a rather striking claim. West was responding to a question about tax liens that had allegedly been placed against him -- an issue that had already inspired a hard-hitting ad by Klein. According to a video made by a Democratic Party operative who trails West at all of his appearances, the candidate told the audience, ""I had a Top Secret/Security Compartmented Information classification, that is the highest you can have in the United States Army. You don’t get a security classification like that if you have financial issues like that. I still retain a Secret security clearance. And I tell you, if you look at the application for a security clearance, I have a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain because of my background."" We've already addressed questions about the lien (we rated Klein's ad Mostly True). But we wondered whether it was really possible for someone -- anyone -- to have a higher security clearance than the president. So we asked a few experts. First, some background on security clearances. There are three levels, in ascending order: Confidential, Secret and Top Secret. There are many subcategories, but the only one that is relevant here is an elite category of Top Secret called Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented information, or TS/SCI. It is for people who have Top Secret clearances but who may, in order to do their jobs, need to know certain information that is especially sensitive, such as sources and methods of intelligence-gathering. A TS/SCI clearance allows them to know the information they need, but it is not a blanket clearance for all extremely sensitive information. That's why it's called ""compartmented."" West mentioned TS/SCI in his comments at the Pompano Civic Association, though he got the name slightly wrong, calling it ""Top Secret/Security Compartmented Information."" To be picky, West would have had a TS/SCI clearance, rather than ""classification"" -- people have clearances, documents have classifications. We inquired with the Pentagon about his clearance but weren't able to get an answer Friday night. Experts we spoke to said that it was plausible for someone like West to have a TS/SCI clearance, so for the purposes of this fact-check, we'll assume he had that level. As you'll see below, his actual level wouldn't change our conclusion. Our experts also said that it's plausible that West would still have a Secret clearance today. Since retired officers can be called back to duty, and because many of them do consulting work for the military or for companies that work with the military, it's common for retired officers to maintain a security clearance. But what about him having ""a clearance that even the president of the United States cannot obtain""? We see at least two ways to look at this claim. The first is that West is saying that he had a higher security clearance than someone occupying the office of president of the United States. Even if you assume that he was referring to the period in which West held a TS/SCI, our experts say he's wrong. ""The president is the one who established the security clearance system by executive order,"" said Steven Aftergood, a national security and intelligence specialist with the Federation of American Scientists. ""Therefore it is nonsensical to speak of clearances higher than what the president has. As head of the executive branch and commander in chief of the armed forces, there is no information in government that could be denied to the president for security reasons if he determined he needed access to that information."" John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. ""This is a silly statement,"" Pike said. ""The only clearance the president needs is the mandate of the people."" The statement is even more questionable if West was actually referring to what he says is his current clearance -- Secret. ""A Secret security clearance is the most commonly held security clearance,"" Aftergood said. ""Almost anyone without a criminal record or serious financial difficulties can get such a clearance if their employment requires it."" There's one more possible interpretation, and when we reached the West campaign, they said this is indeed what the candidate meant at the forum. As a career military officer, West went through a rigorous screening and investigatory process in order to receive his TS/SCI clearance. President Barack Obama got his authority by virtue of a popular vote. There is no security process required before one becomes president. If, in theory, Obama was not president and decided to apply for a security clearance, there's no guarantee he'd qualify for one. He'd have to go through a painstaking process, and investigators may raise any number of questions. ""The fact that (Obama) admitted to cocaine use, travel to unauthorized countries years before, and his associations with (black nationalist) Louis Farrakhan and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, he probably would not have been granted a security clearance,"" said Josh Grodin, West's campaign manager. This argument does at least have a grain of validity to it. But we see some problems with it. During the presidential campaign, a similar claim was floated by some Obama opponents. One chain e-mail alleged that ""if Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist."" We ruled it False. Pike said that the one thing in Obama's background that could raise a flag for someone doing a security check is ""his unaccompanied foreign travel for an extended period of time."" Still, he added, ""the tender age at which Obama traveled abroad would almost certainly render this irrelevant, particularly in light of everything else he has done."" To the extent that West has already been cleared by national-security vetters, and Obama has not, we think West may have a small point. Still, even using this logic, West oversteps when he says that his own clearance is one ""that even the president of the United States cannot obtain."" We don't believe the evidence suggests that it's an open-and-shut case that Obama would be denied the kind of security clearance West had. And that's the most plausible interpretation of West's comment. The other interpretation -- that West's clearance, either today or in the past -- was higher than any president's is ridiculously false. The president has the highest security clearance in the land. We rate West's claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6CBF80>],/factchecks/2010/sep/24/allen-west/allen-west-says-he-has-clearance-even-president-un/
"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich accuses Strickland administration of raising state spending 10.7 percent
","
Ohios first gubernatorial debate of the campaign season focused heavily on the state budget and which candidate would best manage it. Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat, said he has been prudent with the states money, cutting taxes and spending for the current two-year cycle.

Republican challenger John Kasich, however, repeatedly declared that the current budget actually increased spending by 10.7 percent this year. The charge prompted Strickland to call for the fact checkers to examine Kasichs statement. 
PolitiFact Ohio couldn't pass up the invitation.

When lawmakers and wonks around Capitol Square talk about the state budget, they are almost always referring to the general revenue fund budget, or the GRF, which contains virtually all of Ohios tax revenues. The GRF is on pace to be $50.6 billion for the 2010-11 fiscal years, according to state spending reports available through mid-July. Thats down from $52.5 billion for the 2008-09 budget, a reduction of about $1.9 billion. So Strickland is correct when he says spending is down.

Kasich, however, instead was talking about the states all-funds budget, which includes the use of billions in federal stimulus dollars outside the GRF. The all-funds budget is estimated at $112.3 billion in the current budget, up from $102.1 billion in 2008-09. Thats an increase of about 9.9 percent from Stricklands first budget to his second budget.

The all-funds budget also includes general revenue fund money, billions in pass-through money for state and local governments such as the piggy-back sales tax that counties are allowed to add to the state tab plus state and federal fees that are slated for specific programs. The all-funds budget also includes some double-counting, as money is shifted within line items in a state agency.

So how does Kasich get to that 10.7 percent figure? With an apples to oranges comparison.

He uses actual all-funds spending in 2010 compared to projected all-funds spending in the 2011 fiscal year, which is only about three months old right now. The state did not spend $3.3 billion that was appropriated for use in fischal 2010. But by using actual spending for that year, Kasich's comparison actual makes that count against the administration because it inflates the percentage greatly.

While Strickland says thats an inaccurate and misleading way to look at the budget, Republicans argue that the all-funds budget is becoming more relevant because the GRF is shrinking, representing about 54 percent of the entire budget a decade ago and about 45 percent in the current fiscal year.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, for example, was moved from the GRF budget to the all-funds budget under Gov. Bob Taft. Strickland chose to move the Department of Public Safety and the Department of Commerce completely out of the GRF budget during the most recent budget.

And the current all-funds budget does include several new fees attached to it, including a new hospital assessment fee worth $708 million and $390 million worth of new nursing home franchise fees.

So let's cut to the chase:
  
That seems misleading especially since if he were to compare apples to apples -- all-funds proposed spending in 2010 to all-funds proposed spending in 2011 -- the figure would rise only 1.7 percent.

As a consequence, we rate his statement to be Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6CBF40>],/factchecks/2010/sep/24/john-kasich/john-kasich-accuses-strickland-administration-rais/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Nancy Pelosi cites John Boehner in saying GOP plans return to old economic policies
","
In their effort to hold a congressional majority, Democrats keep saying that if the Republicans take power, they will return to the policies of former President George W. Bush and the previous Republican majority in Congress -- policies that Democrats blame for helping cause the current recession.

The office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used this argument in responding to a Sept. 23, 2010, event in which House Republicans unveiled a ""Pledge to America"" -- a statement of policy principles that House Republicans intend follow.

A Sept. 23 post on Pelosi's ""Gavel"" blog said, ""Answering a question this morning about the preamble to the GOP’s ‘Pledge to America,’ House Republican Leader John Boehner admitted to American workers, their families and small businesses, 'We are not going to be any different than we’ve been.' Finally, we get the truth. Congressional Republicans want to return to the same failed economic policies that cost us 8 million American jobs, doubled our national debt, hurt millions of Americans, and wrecked our economy.""

The post included an eight-second video clip in which Boehner says, ""And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we're not going to be any different than we've been.""

We wanted to see if Pelosi's post accurately reflected what Boehner, an Ohio Republican, had said at the event.

So we listened to the audio recording of the question-and-answer session from which the quote was taken. Here's the full question and answer:

Question: ""Legislatively, how do you plan to honor families, traditional marriage, life and the private and faith-based organizations that form the core of our American values?"" 
Boehner: ""I think if you look at House Republicans over the course of the last year, two years -- for that matter, the last 10 years -- you will see that, by and large, we have supported those pro-family, traditional values issues. And the point we make in this preamble to our Pledge is that we are not going to be any different than what we've been. We are going to stand up for those things that we believe in."" 
So Boehner was not in fact talking about the party's economic policies. He was answering a question about what he called ""pro-family, traditional values issues."" 
Those are two very different things, and the extremely tight editing of the eight-second clip in Pelosi's blog post suggests to us that whoever edited the clip realized that Boehner's full answer would not have made the point they wanted to make. 
Others have found plenty to criticize about the Republican plan. On the Daily Show, Jon Stewart mocked Republican comments at the Pledge event by intersplicing them with nearly identical statements made by GOP leaders in the past. 
But it's a gross mischaracterization to make that point by touting Boehner's comment and saying that he was referring to economic policy. 
Pelosi's office told us they think it's fair to interpret his words broadly. ""Leader Boehner, like others in his party, may wish to take his statement back, but he was clearly in an event, speaking about the Republican agenda when he said it,"" said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami. ""The preamble is a prelude to the pledge, which is a roadmap right back to failed policies of the past."" 
That's an opinion that many Democrats share, but we still feel that the Speaker's office significantly distorted Boehner's comments. Even if you believe that the Republicans would indeed return to Bush-era economic policies, it does not justify making that point by twisting Boehner's comment, which was specifically tailored to social issues. Nor does it justify running a video clip that is highly abbreviated and removes all context from Boehner's statement. For these reasons, we rate the blog post Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE41540>],/factchecks/2010/sep/24/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-cites-john-boehner-saying-gop-plans-r/

Delia Lopez says Earl Blumenauer is trying to track Americans by putting GPS in all cars
","
Rep. Earl Blumenauer wants to know where you are and where you’re going. At least that’s what his Republican challenger has been telling voters these days on her website and in talk radio appearances. According to Republican congressional hopeful Delia Lopez, Blumenauer sponsored a bill that would put ""GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles.""

Here’s her grievance in detail::

""Earl Blumenauer is the sponsor of HR-3311 to mandate GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles. To track our every mile and know everywhere we go. The pilot program will waste hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when we are already deep in debt and spending too much. ... This bill is designed to transition us to a per mile vehicle tax system called The Road User Fee Pilot Project and would be administered by the Treasury Department otherwise know as the IRS. This system will track all American cars using a new form of taxation. Cars will be taxed by the mileage they drive. Under the bill the IRS or Treasury will appropriate $154,000,000 of taxpayers money in the form of free grants to well connected commercial manufactures. It means that every car in America will be tracked through whatever method they choose. This constitutes absolute surveillance whether on public or private property, welcome to another attack on the 4th amendment.""

Sounds more than a little Orwellian, right? The government, with one little-noticed bill, is going to start tracking your every vehicular movement. Or is it? PolitiFact Oregon decided to dig into this claim, which has been making the rounds on conservative websites even outside the state.

First, let’s start with the basics: It’s true that Blumenauer is the sponsor of H.R. 3311, and it’s also true that the bill, if passed, would cost the government a little over $154 million. But beyond that, Lopez’s argument doesn’t track.  

A reading of the actual bill shows that, rather than install GPS tracking devices into all cars nationwide, Blumenauer is looking to set up a national pilot program that would test alternative ways of taxing road use. This shouldn’t be too new to Oregonians. For more than a decade, state policy makers have been trying to figure out how to pay for road maintenance once gas taxes drop because hybrids and electric cars rule the roads.

It’s true, GPS could be used in one or more the programs that might spring up if this bill becomes law. In Oregon’s own statewide pilot program, the Department of Transportation used GPS as its main method of tracking mileage. But, as Blumenauer spokesman Willie Smith points out, GPS is just one way to go about this, and, in fact, there’s no stipulation in the bill that GPS (which isn’t even mentioned in the legislation) be a part of the trial program. ""There’s a number of methods for this,"" Smith said. ""Our bill doesn’t prescribe one way or another.""

PolitiFact Oregon reads the bill the same way.

Moreover, it should be noted that the bill includes a provision that all pilot programs be evaluated on the basis of a few criteria, including ""protection of personal privacy.""

Candidate Lopez, however, remains unconvinced. ""I think it’s quite plain that the idea in there is to put the GPS tracking in all of our vehicles,"" she said. ""It may be squirmy verbiage that’s put in there. They don’t want to admit that this is exactly what they want to do.""

Squirmy verbiage or not, a $154 million pilot program with no specific mandates for GPS and a clause that keeps an eye out for personal privacy is miles away from Lopez’s description of a bill that would mandate tracking devices in ""all our vehicles.""

Lopez is significantly distorting what Blumenauer's bill would do and ignoring the fact that GPS isn't even mentioned in it. With all that in mind, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'John  Kitzhaber']","
John Kitzhaber says 2 million people got health care coverage because of his Oregon Health Plan
","
The Oregon Health Plan is John Kitzhaber’s baby. Oregon launched his groundbreaking health plan in 1994 when the state got special waivers from the federal government to change the way it handles Medicaid, the health insurance for the nation’s poorest people.

Under Oregon’s plan, the state limits the services Medicaid pays for, with an emphasis on providing preventive and ongoing medical care. By limiting what services are offered, Oregon was able to expand the number of people who were covered. Kitzhaber came up with the idea and championed it during his years as a state senator and governor.

When the plan launched in 1994, about 350,000 Oregonians were eligible. According to an official history of the plan published by the state, 250,000 already had Medicaid coverage. The expansion added 100,000 Oregonians who, until then, didn’t have health insurance.

Today the health plan covers 523,000 Oregonians. About 20 percent of them wouldn’t be getting health insurance if not for the plan’s expanded Medicaid provisions. But the plan has struggled because of budget constraints and over the years cut back the number of people who are covered.

Kitzhaber, a Democrat now seeking a third term as governor, talks proudly of his plan. On Aug. 15, 2010, in an interview on KQEN AM in Roseburg, he assessed the plan this way:

""The health plan I think in many respects has been a big success. Over 2 million Oregonians have received important medical services because of it.""

We wondered about the ""2 million"" figure in a state that today has a population of 3.8 million.

Campaign spokeswoman Jillian Schoene says the number comes from the Oregon Department of Human Services, which oversees the health plan.

So we checked with the folks at the Oregon Health Plan. Sean Kolmer, the deputy administrator for the health plan’s office of policy and research, says the 2 million includes people who have been enrolled in the health plan at any time since 1994. He points out many people have come into the plan and left it over the years.  He says the tally doesn’t double count. ""Those are unique individuals,"" he says.

But the second part of Kitzhaber’s statement doesn’t hold up. Note that Kitzhaber told his radio listeners the 2 million health plan participants got coverage ""because of it.""

With this cause-and-effect claim, Kitzhaber is saying the 2 million wouldn’t have received ""important medical services"" if his health plan hadn’t existed.

And that’s not true. The majority of people in the plan would have had coverage under Medicaid anyway, and still would if the plan vanished tomorrow.

How many of the 2 million would have received health coverage if the plan hadn’t existed? We asked the folks at the health plan and, at our request, they did a count.

The answer: Kolmer says that 59 percent of those folks would have received Medicaid coverage anyway. That means 41 percent got coverage because of Kitzhaber’s health plan.

Kitzhaber is indeed the creator of the Oregon Health Plan and -- as the records shows -- he can legitimately claim credit for expanding health coverage to about 820,000 people.

Taking credit for the entire 2 million is a stretch. We find his claim Half True.

"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Chris Dudley']","
Chris Dudley says Oregon’s economy tanked on John Kitzhaber’s watch
","
  
Chris Dudley, the Republican running for governor, wants to make sure Oregonians remember how bad things were back in the day -- that is, when his Democratic opponent, John Kitzhaber, was running the state.

At every opportunity, Dudley notes the damage done in the early 2000s by a faltering economy and the end of high-tech’s rapid expansion in Oregon. That was when then-Gov. Kitzhaber was nearing the end of a second term marked by steep job losses and bitter fights with Republicans over state budget cuts.

""Under Gov. Kitzhaber,"" Dudley said in a recent speech in Albany, ""unemployment rose 65 percent, state spending went up 57 percent and personal incomes declined compared to the rest of the country.""

We wondered about two things: Was it really that bad? And how much can you blame Kitzhaber for what happened?

So let’s take a look, first at the unemployment number.

In 1995, when Kitzhaber took office, Oregon’s economy was streaking at a record pace and unemployment was as low as it had ever been, 4.7 percent. The rate hovered around 5 percent  for most of his career as governor because the economy remained healthy. But joblessness began to spike upward in his final two years as the national and state economies went into a deep recession. National unemployment figures followed a similar trend, although remained about a percentage point below Oregon’s. When Kitzhaber left office, Oregon’s unemployment rate stood at 7.8 percent.

So Dudley’s correct: at the end of Kitzhaber’s tenure, the unemployment rate was up 65 percent.

What about that state spending figure? That’s a little trickier.

The hot economy in the 1990s produced record-setting tax revenues for the state. Total state spending, which includes federal pass-through money, such as Medicaid and food stamp payments, indeed increased by 56 percent over Kitzhaber’s eight years, rising from $22.6 billion to $35.3 billion. General fund spending, however, rose by a more staid 26 percent -- from $8.2 billion to $10.3 billion -- and that’s widely considered the more accurate measure of state spending fluctuations.  (Oregon's population grew 11 percent between 1995 and 2003. Inflation between those two years was 28 percent.)

Worth noting: Republicans controlled the Legislature throughout Kitzhaber’s tenure, and approved all general fund spending increases.

Last, we checked on personal income.

The dot-com boom benefited not just Oregon but the rest of the nation, too. Even though Oregonians were making more money, they weren’t keeping up,  and per-capita income rates fell slightly in relation to other states. In 1995, Oregon’s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation’s, when Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent.

So Dudley’s math mostly holds up. But is it accurate to attribute those numbers to Kitzhaber’s leadership?

We checked with state economist Tom Potiowsky, who monitors the ups and downs of Oregon’s financial health.

He said Oregon’s economy, which is based heavily in manufacturing, is at the mercy of national and global economic factors. When home building goes down, Oregon’s lumber products aren’t needed. When computer sales are down, Oregon’s chips go unsold, he said.

""Those were very much national economic factors, really pushing us around,"" during Kitzhaber’s final years, Potiowsky said.

University of Oregon economist Tim Duy had a similar take. What happened at the end of Kitzhaber’s administration was caused by the national business cycle and was largely out of his control.

Yet Oregon didn’t help itself much, notes Duy and John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest, a Portland economic consulting firm. When high-tech firms were expanding, the state -- and Kitzhaber’s office -- wasn’t exactly helping them navigate the state’s strict land use rules.

So is Dudley right to hang Oregon’s economic decline around Kitzhaber’s neck?

-- His statement is factually accurate on unemployment, spending growth and the decline in per capita income relative to the rest of the nation during Kitzhaber’s term.

--  Oregon, however, was knocked for a loop by the same dot-com bust that sent the nation’s economy into a tailspin. Realistically, there’s not much a governor can do about those kind of macroeconomic factors.

-- Oregon enjoyed a robust economy for six of the eight years Kitzhaber was governor. But when things started to go south, Kitzhaber was at the helm.

We find the claim to be Half True.

Jim Huffman attacks Ron Wyden for spending $2 million on the study of exotic ants
","
It’s a popular theme among Republicans this year: Democrats are shoving the nation into endless debt with irresponsible spending -- mostly because of the stimulus. And what better way to illustrate this profligate spending than ... ant research?

Yep. Ant research. And what’s worse, it’s not research on your run-of-the-mill picnic-destroying ant. It’s exotic ant research.

Republican Senate hopeful Jim Huffman took a page out of Arizona Sen. John McCain’s book, dinging Democratic incumbent Sen. Ron Wyden in a recent television ad for voting to fund a study of exotic ants.

After an ominous intro about Oregon’s unemployment rate and the growing national debt, the ad takes its entomological turn: ""Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants,"" a man says to his wife, while shaking his head. ""And you thought he was out of touch.""

So does Wyden have a thing for ants or is Huffman making a mountain out of an anthill?

Well, before we get into all that, let’s take a look at how, exactly, ants found their way into our political picnic in the first place. Back in August 2010, Sens. McCain and Tom Coburn, R-Okla., released a list their top ""100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues.""

On Page 6, the Republican senators take aim at a favorite target, San Francisco, and a $1.9 million ant research project based out of the California Academy of Sciences. In short order, this bit of stimulus spending then found its way into the California Senate race and into the political discourse down in Texas.

So how does it relate to Oregon’s Senate race?

Wyden did, indeed, vote in favor of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, along with 60 other senators (including three Republicans and two Independents).

But that vote, it turns out, didn’t release any money to ant research -- not directly.

The federal stimulus gave  $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which otherwise had a budget of about $6.5 billion in 2009, according to the foundation’s Website. The foundation is distributing the money using the same peer-review process with which it normally decides on which research to fund.

As it turns out, one scientist’s study on ants of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa made the cut. PolitiFact Oregon caught up with Brian Fisher, the project’s leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, to pick his brain about the recent political celebrity of ants. He was, maybe surprisingly, pretty unfazed.

""I think it’s legitimate,"" he said. ""There’s no reason why people shouldn’t challenge this and question what we’re doing.""

What exactly are they doing? Well, over the course of the next five years, Fisher and his team will be studying arthropods -- a category that includes ants -- in a part of the world he describes as immensely diverse, biologically speaking. While ant research might not seem like an obvious target for government funds, Fisher provides a logical defense.

Ants, Fisher says, offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. ""You can’t monitor every single living thing, (but) there are key groups that can serve as indicators for other taxa, ants being one of them,"" he said. ""Without them, we wouldn’t have a functioning ecosystem.""

It’s also worth noting that the project has so far helped employ 16 people, at Fisher’s last count.

At Politifact Oregon, we think it would be fair to say that Wyden’s vote did eventually lead to the funding of a study of exotic ants. But it happened in such a roundabout way that Huffman’s claim that ""Wyden spent $2 million dollars to study exotic ants"" is disingenuous. Wyden voted for a bill that, despite being thousands and thousands of words long never mentions the word ""ants."" Instead it directed more money to the National Science Foundation, which then distributed the funds as it saw fit.

PolitiFact Oregon rates the claim False.

Oregon Democrats claim Julie Parrish wants a sales tax
","
Oregon House Democrats are everywhere this campaign season with the claim that Republicans support a sales tax, even one as high as 30 percent. In that vein, Future PAC, the Democrats’ campaign committee, sent a mailer recently that accuses Julie Parrish, a Republican running in House District 37, of wanting to add a sales tax.

The mailer says Parrish ""has been very vocal about where she stands"" and ""Say NO to Julie Parrish and her sales tax."" It also states, ""Julie Parrish wants to add a sales tax to everything we need to buy including food, clothing, medicine and school supplies.""

Democrats say she posted a comment on OregonLive’s website in February that provides the basis for the claim. We took a look.

In February, Parrish posted a commentary on OregonLive called ""Not feeling rich."" In it, she complains that increasingly taxes are being shouldered by businesses and people with higher incomes. She says her household income of nearly $250,000 isn’t ""rich,"" when she has school loans to repay and three kids to put through college. The piece was popular, with a lot of back- and-forth commentary between Parrish and others.

Will Rasmussen, the Democrat in the District 37, points to one of her posts, in which she writes the following at 5 p.m.: ""Instead of being arbitrary, wouldn’t it make more sense to find ways in our state to: A. cut the budget, B. assess a sales tax, C. re-do the special interest (property tax) levies?"" Then she writes, ""Why should kids in the West Linn district be entitled to a better education than those in Southern Oregon?""
 
But anyone who reads through the entirety of her comments can see that Parrish is talking about a sales tax as part of a broader tax restructure.

At 10:51 a.m., earlier that same day, she says: ""Taxing smokers (which I don't smoke) and expecting them to shoulder the healthcare in the state is unfair. Proposed taxes on drivers to fund other mass transit isn't right either. Taxation based on income is arbitrary. If you want to tax the wealthy, do it on spending -- a sales tax.""

And in response to this comment at 6:34 a.m., ""Pssst, Julie . . . whisper this to yourself . . . sales tax . . . sales tax . . . sales tax . . ."" she wrote at 10:18 p.m. ""I will....as long as we ax all the other taxes and start from scratch! In our state, we'd pass a sales tax, and keep all the other ones too - just because ;-)""

That sounds more cheeky than serious.

The claim by Oregon House Democrats and candidate Will Rasmussen contains some element of truth -- Parrish would consider a sales tax -- but it ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression. She wouldn’t be the first candidate, Republican or Democrat, to complain about Oregon’s system of taxation. And if elected to the House, she certainly wouldn’t have the power to get a sales tax implemented. We rate this claim Barely True.

Scott Walker says Milwaukee airport is the fastest growing in the country, adding 1,000 jobs
","
On Sept. 14, 2010, after winning the Republican nomination for governor, Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker in a victory speech rattled off a list of on-the-job accomplishments -- from holding down taxes to cleaning up county government.

Among the items Walker listed:

""Our county now has the fastest growing airport in America, attracting nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs.""

Every month seems to bring a new announcement from Walker’s county office of a new record for passengers at Mitchell International Airport.

But is Mitchell’s traffic growth really leading the nation? And what about those 1,000 jobs?

A review of county records shows these are boom times at Mitchell -- thanks to consolidations and convulsions in the airline business. Airlines are adding flights to and from the airport and  more passengers are coming through the gates.

In July 2010, the airport set a single-month record with 928,497 passengers, the 11th consecutive month of record passenger growth.

In the first quarter of 2010, the airport handled 2,192,859 passengers -- a 35.3 percent increase over the first quarter of 2009.

That first quarter performance put MKE near the top of an international list.

According to Airports Council International, an industry group, Mitchell’s year-over-year passenger growth was the world’s fourth largest, behind Istanbul, Turkey; Phuket, Thailand; and Moscow. 
Milwaukee was the only U.S. airport in the top 30 list.

So what is going on at Mitchell, and is Walker right to claim county credit for it?

It’s simple, according to aviation consultant Michael Boyd, of Boyd Group International in Evergreen, Colo.: Three airlines -- AirTran Airways, Southwest and Republic -- are ""trying to kill each other.""

""It has nothing to do with county government,"" Boyd said. ""It has to do with airline economics.""

After the former owner of Midwest Airlines slashed the number of flights by 40 percent and cut hundreds of jobs, the others moved in on the business.

AirTran established a second national hub at Mitchell, increasing departures from 18 to 47 in the past year. Southwest began service in November 2009, adding 10 departures. And Republic, the new owner of Midwest (now operating as Frontier Airlines), began restoring service. It now has 90 flights a day, five less than what Midwest offered a year ago.

So the airport is leading the nation in passenger growth -- in part because it is working its way back up of the decline that came when Midwest cut its flights.

But what about the ""nearly 1,000 new private sector jobs""?

No one counts ""airport"" jobs. Not the state, county or the Metropolitan Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, which compiles area employment reports each month.

When asked for documentation, the Walker campaign responded with three clippings -- one each from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (""Republic Airways to add up to 800 jobs here""), BizTimes.com (""Southwest Airlines to begin with 12 flights out of Milwaukee"") and WISN.com (""AirTran Brings More Jobs to Milwaukee""). Tallied together, they covered 940 new jobs.

The clips were all from 2009, so we contacted the airlines for fresh information.

Republic said it has added 500 jobs. AirTran said it added 100. Southwest added 41. That’s about 640 jobs -- far short of those promised of the 940 promised , though AirTran and Republic have said they plan to continue to add jobs into next year.

Of course, the new jobs come against the backdrop of lost jobs, as Midwest struggled to stay afloat. The airline cut 2,600 jobs nationwide between early 2008 and the fall of 2009. In Wisconsin, Midwest notified the state of plans to lay off 1,600 workers -- 1,379 in 2008 and 234 in 2009.

The other airlines will, no doubt, hire some of those laid-off workers. But employment remains far short of where it was before Midwest’s fall.

So, let’s see if Walker’s statement flies.

When it comes to growth in passenger count, Mitchell International Airport is leading the nation -- though much of that is through regaining traffic that had been lost in recent years. Experts note this is due to an airline battle, more so than any direct action by Walker or the county. On the jobs side, the new (and promised) jobs won’t replace all the jobs that were lost. If they ultimately come through, Walker’s election-night number of  ""nearly 1,000"" may be on target, but for now that portion of his claim can be marked ""Flight delayed.""

We rate Walker’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC763280>],/factchecks/2010/sep/24/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-milwaukee-airport-fastest-growin/

Rowing institute earmark at center of new Charlie Crist attack against Marco Rubio
","
Charlie Crist's independent campaign for the U.S. Senate is reaching back into his old Republican playbook to attack GOP candidate Marco Rubio.

In a new TV ad called ""Vetoed,"" Crist says Rubio of tried to sneak millions of dollars of earmarks and pet projects into the state budget while Rubio was House speaker. It's pretty much a rehash of an attack Crist launched back in the spring, when he was still fighting for the Republican nomination.

""Have you seen Marco Rubio's ads attacking me?"" Crist asks in the ad, which began airing on Sept. 20, 2010. ""Here's what he's hiding. Rubio tried to sneak almost $500 million in earmarks into the budget. I vetoed them. One and a half million dollars for a rowing institute. Vetoed. $800,000 for artificial turf on a Miami field where he played flag football. I vetoed that, too.

""Just remember, the Washington special interests who are paying for Rubio's ads don't want an independent like me looking out for your money.""

Back in March, PolitiFact Florida checked Crist's claim that Rubio inserted $800,000 into the state budget for artificial turf on a field where Rubio played flag football and ruled it to be Half True. In this fact check, we wanted to check the other specific claim -- which we're hearing for the first time -- that Rubio tried to steer $1.5 million to a rowing institute.

First, a little background.

Rubio served as House speaker during Crist's first two years as governor in 2007 and 2008. As speaker, Rubio wielded great influence over the state budget the Legislature ultimately presented to the governor.

""The House speaker has absolute power to direct the appropriations staff, subcommittee chairs or appropriations chair to put in the appropriation or take it out,"" said Steve Geller, a retired Senate Democratic leader. ""If the speaker said 'put it in,' it's in, if he said 'take it out,' it's out. ... One of the perks of being speaker or (Senate) president is you get to put money places.""

And one of the perks of being governor is the ability to veto individual pieces of the budget. Florida's governor has the power of a line-item veto, meaning Crist can strike a specific program or project from the state budget without having to reject the spending plan entirely.

In 2007, Crist vetoed what was said to be a record $459 million in projects from the budget. Crist vetoed more than $140 million in college construction projects. He killed a $15 million program to safeguard mobile homes from hurricanes. He axed $6 million to continue privatization of the state accounting system. 
""We are trying to lead by example,"" Crist said at the time. ""Honoring the fact that the people across the state are pinching their pennies, so are we."" 
We should note that other local projects were spared by Crist in 2007. In a parks category, he vetoed most line items but spared $500,000 to restore the fort at Fort DeSoto Park in his home county of Pinellas. And 13 projects supported by Sen. Mike Fasano, a Crist ally from Pasco County, survived the veto ax. 
In Rubio's second year as speaker in 2008, Crist's vetoes to a smaller budget were also much smaller. Crist cut just two projects, $300,000 for a lake restoration program in Central Florida and $840,000 for a Miami festival promoting ties with Miami's sizable Nicaraguan community. 
That's roughly about $460 million in budget vetoes in Rubio's two years as speaker, or as Crist says in the ad -- that's ""almost $500 million"" that Crist claims Rubio tried to sneak into the budget. It's a stretch in itself to try to link every project Crist vetoed in two years specifically to Rubio, as if he was personally pushing for $7.5 million for economic development initiatives in Pasco County (vetoed in 2007) or $1 million in startup costs for the Tampa Bay Regional Transportation Authority (vetoed in 2007). 
It's also a pretty big stretch to use the word ""sneak"" the way Crist does. The projects are listed in line items within the budget, and the governor's office keeps a spreadsheet that tracks what each request is for. 
But we'll address those stretches more in the context of the rowing center claim. 
The $1.5 million budget request was to build a boat house and improve a boat launch ramp on a water management district canal near Fellsmere, a tiny inland town in Indian River County.

The canal, called the C-54 Canal, runs in a straight east-west line between Indian River and Brevard counties, and has high dirt and grass mounds on either side. The mounds protect the water from being exposed to the wind. As a result, the canal has become a perfect venue for competitive rowers.

The state would have helped create the Tom Adams National Training Center for Rowing, a partnership between the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne and the St. Johns River Water Management District. The request for the money came to the Legislature from state Rep. Ralph Poppell, R-Vero Beach. 
In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Poppell said the money might have helped land the U.S. Olympic Rowing Team, which was thinking of training on the Florida canal for several months out of the year.

""I have been there when there would be 300-500 cars lined up on that canal bank,"" Poppell said. ""People are coming down from Michigan and Massachusetts to do events in that spot because there is nowhere else really good to go.""

Crist vetoed the $1.5 million appropriation in 2007 when Rubio was speaker, and a request for $500,000 for the canal in 2010 when Rubio had left the state House.

We asked Poppell -- who hadn't seen the Crist ad -- what role Rubio had in adding the $1.5 million to the budget.

""I think all I did with the speaker, if I remember correctly, I made him aware of what we were trying to accomplish,"" Poppell said. ""I don't think I went to him to ask him for any special favor. In his thought, he was supportive if we could find the money to do it. To be honest, it wasn't a hot button issue. He believed in it, but he also was very clear we were dealing with a tight budget.""

Poppell called us back after watching the ad online.

Crist ""needs to pin it on the person who did it. That's me,"" Poppell said. ""I'm the one who sponsored it. I'm the one who believed in it. I'm the one who fought for it. I'm the one that pushed it.

""Did it have to meet the muster of the leadership? Sure,"" Poppell said. ""But I didn't spend hours beating on Marco's door. If people are going to throw any stones about this project, throw them at me.""

We asked the Crist and Rubio campaigns about connections between Rubio and the $1.5 million rowing appropriation.

""The speaker's budget that was presented to the governor for signature or veto with the speaker's vote and support included $1.5 million for a rowing institute,"" Crist spokesman Danny Kanner said.

Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said there is no direct connection between the rowing center and Rubio, and reiterated that it was Poppell who sought the money.

In his latest television ad, ""Vetoed,"" Crist claims that Rubio tried to sneak almost $500 million into the state budget for pet projects, including ""$1.5 million for a rowing institute."" We find a lot lacking in the claim.

Rubio did vote for the 2007 budget with the $1.5 million included for the rowing center. And as speaker, he could have likely killed the appropriation before a floor vote. But that's the extent of the relationship between Rubio and the rowing money.

We found no evidence in news accounts, for example, that Rubio lobbied or pushed for the money. We also found no direct benefit to Rubio for funding a project 150 miles north of his Miami-area House district. That's a key difference from a project for Rubio's home district, or a project where he otherwise might benefit (like adding artificial turf to fields where Rubio played flag football). 
The clear suggestion from Crist's ad is that Rubio tried to sneak the money into the budget. But there's no evidence of that, either. The request was formally submitted on Jan. 12, 2007 -- months before the budget was agreed to -- and the initial request made clear what the money was for: ""Construction of necessary infrastructure along the C-54 Canal in Brevard County to facilitate use as a rowing training center."" And that request, as we now know, wasn't made by Rubio, but Poppell. And just to be even more clear, the rowing center appropriation had its own line in the budget. (See here, page 345). 
To tie Rubio to the rowing center is an oversimplification of how the state budget process works -- a process Crist as a former state senator knows quite well.

GOP said candidate Roy Barnes fought to give illegal immigrants the chance to vote
","
This election season, illegal immigrants stand alongside President Barack Obama and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as among the Republicans' favorite bad guys. 

Now a Republican spoof attacking Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Gov. Roy Barnes' career as an attorney said he pushed for them to break the law.  

At www.1888kingroy.com, sponsored by the Republican Governors Association, you'll read that
""Roy Barnes has fought to give illegal immigrants the right to vote.""

""In other words, no ID, no problemo!"" it said.

And if you call 1-888-King-Roy you'll be prompted to dial 3 ""if you're an illegal immigrant.""

It sends you to this recorded message: 

""Hola. As you know, Roy has been fighting hard to give you the ability to vote. If you are interested in voting, leave a message and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Adios. Vaya con Dios.""

Barnes was ""fighting hard"" to help illegal immigrants break the law and vote? Dios mio!

If this accusation sticks, it would be a damaging blow for Barnes, a centrist running a close race with Republican candidate and former U.S. Congressman Nathan Deal. Libertarian John Monds trails them.

The RGA's argument is this:

For years, Georgia allowed documents such as utility bills and bank statements to serve as voter identification. In 2005, the state Legislature passed a law requiring that voters present photo identification at the polls. A revised version passed in 2006 after the first law failed legal challenges.

Barnes filed a lawsuit on behalf of clients who said the legislation violated the state constitution. If the suit won, the law would not have gone into effect. That would have meant that voters could use bank statements as identification.

Because Barnes was a member of an advisory board to Georgia Appleseed, a nonprofit the RGA said ""specializes in efforts designed to aid illegal immigrants"" and has a program to ""provide advice on opening a bank account without a Social Security number,"" the GOP group said he was helping illegal immigrants get the vote.

""Clearly if he had been successful with the lawsuit, Barnes' group, Georgia Appleseed, could have provided a roadmap for more illegal immigrants to obtain bank accounts, and therefore the necessary paperwork to vote,"" the website concludes.

We took a closer look at the RGA's argument.

Barnes was an attorney for the plaintiffs in 2006's Lake v. Perdue. The suit, filed in Fulton County Superior Court, argued that a law mandating voters to show one of six forms of government-issued photo identification at the polls violated the Georgia Constitution.

The suit lost before the state Supreme Court. But according to the Secretary of State's Office and a voting expert who once served on the Fulton County Board of Registrations and Elections, if the suit had won, bank statements would have been acceptable forms of voter ID.

So the RGA is correct on that count. The old law that allowed bank statements as voter IDs would have been in effect if Barnes had won.  

But beyond this point, the RGA's argument falls apart.

For Republicans to claim Barnes fought to give illegal immigrants the right to vote, the former governor would have actually had to have pushed for it. So we took a closer look at what Barnes' lawsuit actually fought for.

There is no mention of illegal immigrants in the complaint Barnes filed on behalf of his clients, much less the idea that they should have access to the polls. The suit objected to the law because it would place high obstacles to voting on the poor, elderly, and visually and physically impaired. 

The complaint also argued that the law treated in-person voters differently than absentee voters, who are more often white than black, and that there were better ways to prevent voter fraud.

Laughlin McDonald, the Atlanta director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project, said that describing Barnes' lawsuit as supporting voting by illegal immigrants is a ""misrepresentation of the issue."" The ACLU opposed the photo ID law.

Voting rights experts we consulted also agreed the RGA's characterization is incorrect.

""This is really an outrageous distortion,"" said Daniel Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University who is an expert in voting rights.

""They were instead challenging a law that raised serious legal questions, given its potential to impede voting by U.S. citizens of limited means,"" Tokaji said. ""Whether or not one agrees with their position on the legal merits, this is a gross mischaracterization.""

Some argued the photo ID requirements might make it more difficult for noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to cast ballots, said Michael Pitts, a voting rights expert at the Indiana University School of Law. But this has mostly been a ""side issue"" in the larger debate.

""The lawsuits filed against photo identification requirements have not been based on a desire to provide illegal immigrants with voting rights, rather they have been about whether certain groups of United States citizens, such as the poor, the elderly and African Americans, might be unable to cast a ballot because they do not possess the required photo identification,"" Pitts said.

We also took a look at Barnes' connection to Georgia Appleseed, which the RGA said ""specializes in efforts designed to aid illegal immigrants."" If Barnes were indeed on the board of advisers of such a group, a more general claim that he supported advocacy work to aid illegal immigrants might contain some truth.

Executive Director Sharon Hill confirmed that Barnes served on the group's board of directors from 2005 through 2008 and now sits on its board of advisers. Georgia Appleseed issued a news release in response to the ad saying its work is being ""mischaracterized.""

Chuck Clay, a member of Georgia Appleseed's board of directors as well as a former chairman of the state Republican Party and Republican minority leader of the Georgia state Senate, said the group in no way specializes in helping illegal immigrants.

""That would be 100 percent incorrect,"" Clay said. ""It [the accusation] does make you scratch your head and wonder whether the people saying that looked up the [Georgia Appleseed] website.""

Georgia Appleseed is a public-interest law group that works to fix systemic issues in the law. The group of lawyers, civil leaders and other professionals includes leaders from both sides of the aisle. They're currently working on projects that focus on juvenile justice, effective student discipline, public education, and property passed down to heirs without a will or probate, the group's leadership and news coverage confirmed.

Hill confirmed the nonprofit did run the Financial Access for Latino Immigrants project from 2005 through June 30, 2009. The financial literacy project helped newcomers avoid being victims of violent crime by keeping their money in the bank instead of in their pockets, avoid predatory lending and build economic stability. (Between 40 percent and 60 percent of Latino immigrants do not have a bank account, according to project literature.)

Barnes was not directly involved in that project, Hill said.

A review of the project's publications found no instance in which Georgia Appleseed gave advice to illegal immigrants on how to get a bank account without a Social Security number. One brochure did mention that the ID might not be necessary for non-U.S. citizens. But ""noncitizen"" includes green card holders, foreigners on work visas and international students. It's a far cry from ""illegal immigrant."" 

So not only did AJC PolitiFact Georgia find no evidence Barnes fought for the radical notion of giving illegal immigrants the right to vote, we also found that Barnes gave none of the support to illegal immigrants that the RGA claimed.

Barnes' voter ID suit had nothing to do with illegal immigration. Georgia Appleseed, where he serves on an advisory board, is a group of lawyers and other professionals who perform public-interest work on a wide range of topics and does not ""specialize"" in aiding the activities of people who are breaking the law by entering the country. That group's program on financial literacy for Latino immigrants, which ended last year, dealt with noncitizens, not illegal immigrants. Barnes had no direct involvement in it.

It would take a leap of conspiratorial proportions to believe that Barnes had fought for such an extreme position as giving illegal immigrants the right or ability to vote. The claim is silly.

Car dealer Tom Ganley changes directions on auto sales subsidy program
","
Since her 2006 election to Congress, Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton’s signature achievement has been passage of legislation that established a temporary ""Cash for Clunkers"" subsidy for auto purchases.

The program devised by Sutton provided government rebates of up to $4,500 to buyers who traded in gas guzzlers for more fuel efficient models. The U.S. Department of Transportation says that over the weeks that program lasted in 2009, nearly 680,000 older vehicles were replaced. It says the nation's economy benefited immediately from this stimulus program, which caused a distinct upward movement in GDP and created or saved tens of thousands of jobs at a crucial time in the recovery process.

But the Republican candidate seeking Sutton’s congressional seat – Brecksville auto dealer Tom Ganley – says the program was a clunker even though government records show it helped his dealerships sell 934 cars worth $20.6 million. In recent interviews, he has insisted the program sparked a temporary sales spike that was followed by a slowdown, and had negative long-term effects on the industry and used-car consumers who could have bought trade-ins that were destroyed under the program.

Ganley’s views on the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program have evolved dramatically since he decided to run for Congress against Sutton. Ganley had nothing but praise for the program an August 2009 Time Warner Cable interview conducted while he was pursuing the GOP U.S. Senate nomination in Ohio that was ultimately won by Cincinnati’s Rob Portman.

Ganley told ""In the Spotlight"" host Bob Conklin that he generally opposed government bailouts for business, but believed the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program ""really worked.""

""I don’t think it is a double standard,"" he said. ""Once again, the government was searching for ways to stimulate our economy and create jobs. And I’m sure your read the headlines just recently. General Motors is going to a second shift in Lordstown because of this. That creates jobs it also creates taxpayers. They are bringing back something close to 1,300 employees at Lordstown.. Those 1,300 people are going to begin to pay taxes. That’s 1,300 jobs we’ve stimulated through the Cash for Clunkers. Plus, I have created jobs out of necessity in my stores now because of the large volume of folks coming in. We are bringing back people that we had laid off.""

Nearly a year later, on August 18, 2010, he told The Plain Dealer that the government stimulus and ""Cash for Clunkers"" program ""created work, not jobs."" He said he would have voted against the program if he were in Congress, even though he’s a car dealer.

""We had a tremendous spike up of business, and then a tremendous spike down,"" he said.  ""Not one job did  it create.""

Ganley spokeswoman Meghan Snyder noted that Conklin’s interview was conducted several days before the ""cash for clunkers"" program expired. She said her boss was assessing a sales surge that halted almost immediately after the interview was conducted. Sales dropped dramatically when the program ended, she said, citing National Auto Dealers Association statistics that indicated 10.4 million new vehicles were sold in 2009, down 21.2 percent from 2008’s 13.2 million. Furthermore, she said cars that could have been re-sold were deemed ""clunkers,"" and destroyed, shrinking the inventory of low-priced used vehicles.

""In mid-August, there was confidence in the program’s success, a notion that proved false when sales totals confirmed this program was an artificial surge and any temporary work was quickly eliminated,"" said  Snyder

Ganley clearly changed his tune. We rate his gymnastics to be a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAA06E40>],/factchecks/2010/sep/24/tom-ganley/car-dealer-tom-ganley-changes-directions-auto-sale/
