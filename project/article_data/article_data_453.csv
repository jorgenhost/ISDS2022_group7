E.W. Jackson says Obama is cutting Naval fleet to 1917 level
","E.W. Jackson, a minister who was the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, says President Barack Obama is trying to sink the Navy. ""(Obama) is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels, while China establishes naval hegemony over the Pacific,"" Jackson wrote in an Independence Day email announcing the formation of a veterans group seeking better treatment of active and former service members. We wondered whether Obama really is cutting the fleet to a level not seen since the U.S. entered World War I. Jackson backed his claim by sending us a 2012 PolitiFact National article detailing a downward trend in the fleet’s size and a 2014 op-ed in The Hill by two former Navy officers. Jackson is hardly the first politician to criticize the nation’s military readiness by comparing today’s fleet size with that of about 100 years ago. He joins company that includes Mitt Romney, the GOP presidential nominee in 2012; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a current presidential candidate; and Leon Panetta, Obama’s secretary of defense from 2011-2013. The comparisons usually start in the final years before the United States’ 1917 entry into World War I. In 1915, the U.S. had 231 active ships, according to Navy figures. That rose to 245 ships by December 1916. The fleet rapidly grew in 1917, the year Jackson cited. That April 6, the date the United States formally entered the war, the Navy had 342 active ships. The Navy offers no other figure for 1917. Last year, the Navy had 289 active ships, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. That’s four more ships than Obama inherited when he became president in 2009. So available statistics show it would be impossible for Obama to reduce the Navy to 1917 levels because the fleet, in raw numbers, was already below that level when Obama took office. We also examined Jackson’s statement using the December 1916 data, when the Navy had 245 active ships. Is Obama taking the Navy down to that level? There’s two ways to read the numbers. For several years, the White House has embraced a long-term plan that would elevate the Navy to 300 active ships in 2019 and keep it at or above that level through 2045. But any hope of achieving that depends on repealing sequestration -- a bipartisan agreement between Congress and Obama to slice debt by $1 trillion over nine years, with half of the savings coming from defense and half from domestic programs. The automatic cuts began in early 2013 after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on any other way to pare debt. Adm. Jon Greenert said two years ago that sequestration, if not repealed, could force the Navy to trim its fleet to 255 or 260 active ships by 2020. That would be the lowest number since the end of 1916. Greenert, the chief of Naval operations, said during Senate testimony earlier this year that the Navy would do its best to shield ship building and restoration from sequestration by trying to find savings from other parts of its budget. He said the 255-ship figure was no longer valid, but didn’t provide an updated figure. There’s a final matter to consider in Jackson’s claim. Even if the number of ships is cut to a pre-World War I quantity, would that mean, as Jackson wrote, that Navy fleet has been reduced to almost a 100-year low point in readiness and capability? Many military analysts answer with a resounding no, saying those who utter such claims confuse quantity with quality. ""Now, our fleet has nuclear-powered supercarriers and nuclear-powered attack submarines,"" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""The capabilities of the ships we have today, you can’t even compare that to the ships we had in 1917."" Alex Roland, a military history professor at Duke University, offered a similar take to PolitiFact National last year during a fact check on comments made by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. ""One of the reasons for the decrease in size -- both Army and Navy -- is that we now rely far more on technology than on sheer numbers,"" Roland said. ""The question is not how we compare to our army in 1940 or our Navy in 1915, but how we compare with our potential enemies in 2014. We are head and shoulders above them."" The bottom line, analysts have told PolitiFact time and again over the years, is that historic military numbers are not a good gauge of present-day strength. Our ruling Jackson says Obama ""is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels."" Even if we give Jackson a break and start his comparison at the end of 1916 -- prior to the U.S. entry into World War I -- his statement has significant problems. No doubt, our military is facing cuts from sequestration and, if the automatic reductions for defense and domestic programs continue, the Navy has said its number of active ships could fall to pre-World War I levels. But this has not been a solo act by the president. Sequestration is the consequence of a bipartisan deal between Congress and the White House who, otherwise, haven’t agreed on a plan to reduce debt. And counting the historic size of the fleet, analysts tell us, is a flawed way to assess Naval might. What chance would you give the dreadnoughts of the early 20th century against today’s  nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines?

Bobby Scott says U.S. is No. 2 in income disparity among developed nations
","U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott has long complained about the gap between rich and poor in the United States. ""When measuring income inequality across the globe, after accounting for taxes and transfers, the United States ranks second worst in income inequality across developed countries,"" Scott, D-3rd, wrote in a June 12 statement. Scott made the comment in explaining his vote against a sweeping trade agreement with Asian nations; he said thinks it would depress U.S. wages. The congressman has also cited income inequality in his calls to raise the minimum wage and increase taxes on the wealthy. We recently gave a Mostly True rating to his claim that U.S. income disparity is at it highest level since the 1920s. This time, we wondered whether Scott is right about the United States’ global ranking. DeMontre Boone, a legislative assistant to Scott, said the congressman drew his information from a December 2013 article by the Pew research Center headlined ""Global Inequality: How the U.S. compares."" Pew defined developed countries as those belonging to the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation, a group of 34 democratic nations seeking to improve trade. The OECD calculates the inequality of income distribution in terms of what’s called a Gini coefficient that ranges on a scale from zero to one. Zero means there’s perfect equality and every household earns the same income. One means there’s absolute inequality and a single household earns a country’s entire income. All nations fall somewhere in between. The Pew article, drawing mostly on 2010 calculations, has a chart placing the U.S. 10th highest among OECD nations in income inequality measured before taxes and transfers -- payments such as welfare and Social Security that a government makes to people without an exchange of goods or services. The U.S. Gini rating was .499, well behind the leader, Ireland, who came in at .591. Scott, you’ll remember, focused his comments on earnings after tax and transfers. And when that bottom-line data was computed, the U.S. surged to No. 2 on the disparity chart, with a .38 Gini. Chile, with a .501 coefficient, had the greatest inequality. So Scott cited information in the Pew chart correctly. But two issues still arise: So let’s look at this again, armed with data mostly from 2012 that includes all OECD nations. When it comes to income inequality before taxes and transfers, the U.S. ranked 7th. Here’s a list of those seven countries and the Gini coefficients: Now, let’s examine income equality after taxes and transfers -- the core of Scott’s claim. The U.S. rose to fourth in the rankings here, suggesting that the redistributive effects of our tax and public welfare systems are weaker than some of our trading partners. Here’s the top four list: Of course not all industrialized nations belong to the OECD. The trade organization also computed Russia’s income inequality for 2012 and the post-tax and transfers rating of .396 was higher than the United States’. If you’re wondering, the five OECD countries with the lowest post-tax and transfers income disparity -- all with a Gini around .250 --  were Estonia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Norway and Finland. Our ruling Scott said,  ""The United States ranks second worst in income inequality across developed countries,"" after accounting for taxes and transfers. Scott bases his claim on an outdated chart listing the statistical disparity in 31 of the 34 OECD nations. Updated information with all the OECD nations shows the U.S. with the fourth highest disparity and it drops another notch if you include non-member Russia. Clearly, the U.S. ranks near the top among developed nations in income inequality, but not quite as high as Scott says.

Fiorina: U.S. destroying more businesses than it creates for first time 'in our history'
","America’s economy can’t get a proper foothold to start growing quickly again, in part because the country is losing businesses faster than it creates them, Republican presidential contender Carly Fiorina said. Talking to George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week on July 12, 2015, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO said her GOP rival Jeb Bush’s talk of 4 percent economic growth is a good goal. But Fiorina said a dearth of new small businesses is preventing more than anemic growth at the moment. ""In fact, we're destroying more businesses in the United States now than are being created for the first time in our history,"" she said. PolitiFact has looked at this claim before, and when we asked Fiorina’s campaign where they found their statistic, they pointed to the same source -- the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics data. Fiorina is accurate to say that more business firms are closing than are opening, but the data can’t say for sure whether this is the first time that’s happened in the 239-year history of the United States. A Fiorina spokeswoman sent us a September 2014 article from Gallup that examined the data, which showed that the startup rate for new businesses first dipped below the closure rate in 2008. The trend has remained through 2011, the latest year of available data. Here’s a chart illustrating Fiorina’s point, from a May 2014 Brookings Institution study of the same data:  As you might notice, the chart only goes back to 1978. Why? Because the Business Dynamics Statistics database only goes back to the 1970s. Before then, there was no official metric recorded -- by the federal government or anyone else -- for business startups and deaths. Economists say that really limits the ability to judge claims like Fiorina's, who talked about the entire history of the country. Business failures may have exceeded startups at other points, such as during the Great Depression, but it’s impossible to say without reliable data. Claims like Fiorina’s are ""somewhere between plausible and impossible to prove,"" Robert Litman, a Brookings economics fellow who has studied the number of business openings and closings, told PolitiFact. He suggested it would be ""more accurate to say that for the first time since the government began tracking these things, fails have exceeded starts."" The reasons for this trend are harder to determine. ""Despite all this research, there has been no definitive answer as to why the rate of U.S. startups has declined so precipitously,"" the Gallup story concedes. Fiorina told Stephanopoulos the problem was ""crony capitalism"" and a ""very large, powerful, complicated government"" that made it difficult for smaller businesses to survive while bigger, established business have thrived. Litman, in his research, noted that ""it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones."" As HP’s CEO, Fiorina oversaw a controversial $25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2001. The move resulted in 30,000 layoffs as the two companies merged operations. HP’s board of directors fired Fiorina in 2005 for poor stock performance and missed earnings targets. Our ruling Fiorina said, ""In fact, we're destroying more businesses in the United States now than are being created for the first time in our history."" The data she’s relying on, however, only looks back to 1978, and economists say it’s going a bit too far to say this is the first time such a trend has occurred in all of U.S. history. The fact is we simply don’t have definitive data to prove it either way. Fiorina’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

When did Hillary Clinton wipe her email clean?
","Questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State aren’t going away. One part of the story that remains unknown, CNN’s Brianna Keilar says, is when exactly Clinton wiped her email server clean. The answer could be an important marker in the Clinton email story, as House Republicans continue to press for answers to Clinton’s reaction to the death of four U.S. officials in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Keilar, who interviewed Clinton on July 7, said on CNN's State of the Union July 12 that she was ""surprised"" Clinton ""didn’t show a little more contrition"" about her use of a private email account and seemed a bit irked by Clinton’s spin that she ""never had a subpoena."" (She did, though Keilar and Clinton interpreted the point differently.) ""What the campaign will say is I was asking her about facing a subpoena that she wiped her server. They’ll say that’s not true,"" Keilar said. ""But the other thing is, the campaign hasn't been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails, so there's no way to even really completely fact-check what she's saying, because they don't want to get into all of the details of those things."" We were curious about Keilar’s claim that Clinton ""hasn’t been clear"" about when she wiped her server clean. The Clintons began using the private server in question when President Bill Clinton was in office, Hillary Clinton said at a press conference March 10, 2015. According to Clinton, it contained around 30,000 personal emails and 30,000 work-related emails from during her tenure as Secretary of State. Clinton said she deleted the personal emails — ""emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations,"" she said — sometime in the fall of 2014 and sometime after the State Department asked on Oct. 28 for Clinton’s work-related correspondence. Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails and communication relevant to her role as head diplomat to the State Department on Dec. 5. Sometime after that, the entire server was ""wiped clean,"" said Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Benghazi committee, on March 27. When exactly did that happen? Keilar has a point when she says it’s unclear. The Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server shortly after they were turned over to the State Department on Dec. 5. They referred us to a letter Clinton’s lawyer David Kendall wrote to Gowdy. The Benghazi committee subpoenaed Clinton’s emails on March 4, 2015, and Gowdy asked for the physical server about two weeks later on March 19. According to Kendall’s letter, dated March 27, the emails relevant to Benghazi were in the State Department’s possession and the committee had no legal right to the server. What’s more, what Gowdy wanted no longer existed. ""During the fall of 2014, Secretary Clinton’s legal representative reviewed her [email protected] account for the time period from Jan. 21, 2009, through Feb. 1, 2013,"" Kendall wrote. ""After the review was completed to identify and provide to the Department of State all of the secretary's work-related and potentially work-related emails, the secretary chose not to keep her non-record personal emails and asked that her account (which was no longer in active use) be set to retain only the most recent 60 days of email."" ""No emails from [email protected] for the time period Jan. 21, 2009, through Feb. 1, 2013, reside on the server. Thus, there are no [email protected] e-mails from Secretary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate and legally authorized."" To recap, Clinton’s private server was wiped clean —technically, filtering out emails older than 60 days — sometime between Dec. 5, 2014, and March 27, 2015. No clearer timeline has been stated. Why does this matter? After receiving Kendall’s letter, Gowdy issued a statement accusing Clinton of ""unilaterally"" and ""permanently"" deleting all the emails when she wiped the server. The Clinton campaign and Kendall, meanwhile, contend that all the emails relevant to Benghazi and her time as Secretary of State still exist and are in State Department’s possession. Our ruling Keilar said, ""The (Clinton) campaign hasn’t been clear about when she wiped her server of her work emails."" The Clinton campaign told us the work-related emails were deleted off the server ""shortly after"" she turned them over to the State Department on Dec. 5, 2014, but did not provide a date. The paper trail so far gives us a window of sometime between December 2014 and March 2015, but no more.   That’s better than nothing, but Keilar is largely correct when she says the picture isn’t clear.

Conservative host: Noncitizens are 25% of federal inmates
","Crime by immigrants was brought front and center after a man who had been deported five times was charged with killing a young woman in San Francisco on July 1. The debate reached a fever pitch on the Fox News show Real Story with Gretchen Carlson. Carlson paired former Clinton campaign adviser Simon Rozenberg with conservative talker and IJReview.com editor Larry O’Connor. In the span of two minutes, the two talked over each other about so-called sanctuary cities, border control and the Obama administration track record on deportations. In the middle of this verbal melee -- Carlson interjected with ""Let me take control of this"" -- O’Connor said ""25 percent of federal inmates are noncitizens."" Rozenberg insisted O’Connor’s facts were wrong. O’Connor insisted otherwise. We thought we’d see what the data say. O’Connor pointed us to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website and the numbers there fully support his statement. As of the end of May 2015, 23.4 percent of the inmates (a total of 48,470) are not U.S. citizens. The largest share by far, 16 percent are Mexican, as this pie chart from the bureau shows.  That would seem to wrap things up neatly, but another division of the Justice Department has quite different numbers. According to the most recent report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, O’Connor overshot by about 100 percent. The Justice Department statisticians reported a total of 25,800 noncitizen inmates as of the end of 2013. With about 216,000 prisoners across the board, the non-Americans make up 12 percent of the total population. The time difference (2013 vs. 2015) doesn’t explain a difference of nearly 23,000 inmates. About the same gap was there in 2013, too. So what’s going on? According to Bureau of Prisons spokesman Ed Ross, when the folks at Justice Statistics (BJS) ask the prison folks to report their inmate numbers, they are told to exclude noncitizens housed in privately contracted facilities. ""Most of those who are in those contract facilities are deportable aliens,"" Ross said. ""They are convicted of a federal crime and are serving a federal sentence, and when they complete their sentence, we turn them over to ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)."" And how many people are in those facilities? About 24,000. So give or take, that’s where the difference is. And according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, roughly 19,000 federal prisoners are behind bars for having violated U.S. immigration law. The bottom line is that the percentages come out different because both agencies have about the same total head count, but when it comes to noncitizens, the Bureau of Prisons includes the people destined for deportation and the Bureau of Justice Statistics does not. So who’s right? Well, it depends on what question you want to answer. If you want to know how many noncitizens are in prison for breaking a law that all citizens must obey -- like not committing murder as in San Francisco -- then you’d probably prefer the lower number from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. If you want to know how many prisoners broke any kind of law, including sneaking across the border, then you’d find the Bureau of Prisons number more useful. Our ruling O’Connor said 25 percent of federal inmates are noncitizens. According to the Bureau of Prisons, that’s pretty much spot on. But it’s important to know that a hefty fraction of those inmates are only in prison for violating immigration laws and are in facilities more or less created to house them. If you take those people out of the equation, you’re looking at about 12 percent of federal inmates. The claim is correct, but it overlooks a significant wrinkle.

American Bridge 21st Century says layoffs show economy has tanked under Scott Walker
","Job creation was the No. 1 issue for Republican Scott Walker in his first term as Wisconsin governor, and the state’s economic performance will be examined in depth as his presidential campaign gets underway. The left-leaning American Bridge 21st Century tried to kick-start that conversation with a blog post July 1, 2015 that carried this headline:  ""Walker’s economy gets worse."" The item said: ""Scott Walker’s Wisconsin: So far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014."" It continued: ""How much has Scott Walker tanked Wisconsin’s economy? In addition to having the slowest job growth in the Midwest, Wisconsin layoff notices just passed the total layoffs in all of 2014 and are set to be the highest of Walker’s tenure by 4,000."" That’s a lot of baggage to unpack. We have done numerous items about Scott Walker and jobs, this is the first about layoffs. Is the group right that layoffs for 2015 have surpassed those in 2014, and that the situation is evidence the economy has ""tanked""? How the system works In Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin’s law is more strict than federal law, which requires notices for layoffs of more than 100 workers. As part of its claim, American Bridge linked to a June 30, 2015 report by WKOW-TV in Madison, which compared the number of people covered by layoff warning notices received by the state so far in 2015 with those for all of 2014. When we looked at the state Department of Workforce Development web site, we could not find the same numbers, but did see the same trend.  As of July 8, 2015, the tally for 2015 was 8,627, compared with 7,239 in all of 2014. But the warning notices are a lousy tool to assess the economy -- and especially employment. Why? Some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don’t reach the 50 person threshold. Also, the notices don’t always mean lost jobs. In cases when a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm. So it is wrong to equate the notices with bodies out the door, as American Bridge did. The ""data is interesting, but not very useful,"" said Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College. ""If you think about the number of employees affected, it's relatively small."" Jacobsen noted layoffs are sometimes announced and then phased in over a number of years. ""Thankfully, some of those notices change, resulting in fewer employees being affected,"" he said. ""Some employers may err on the side of giving a warning even if there is a chance the layoffs won't occur."" Another factor that the layoff notices don’t reflect is the number of jobs that have been added to the economy. Based on the most solid numbers available, through the first four months of 2015, state private sector employers added 13,300 jobs. That compares with 10,600 jobs in the same time frame in 2014. (Numbers for May are preliminary) Other indicators also suggest more of an upswing rather than a tumble. -- The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce economic trends report from July 1, 2015. ""Currently the metro area’s economic environment is marked by a solid majority of indicators in aggregate pointing upward, led largely by an improving job situation,"" said Bret Mayborne, the MMAC’s economic research director.  ""In addition, local housing and real estate indicators have been contributing to this growth trend over the past nine months."" -- The most recent quarterly survey by ManpowerGroup Inc. Issued June 8, 2015, the report said employers in Wisconsin as well as the Milwaukee metro area expect ""bullish"" and ""prosperous"" hiring prospects in the coming quarter. Our rating American Bridge 21st Century says that Wisconsin’s economy tanked under Scott Walker and uses layoff notices filed with the state as evidence. But the notices do not represent bodies out the door and, though higher than last year, they are not a reliable economic indicator.  Indeed, other reports say that employers overall added about 13,000 jobs in the first five months of the year, a pace higher than a year ago. We rate the claim False. (Editor's note: The paragraph about 2015 job totals was edited for clarity, to reflect the figure is for the first four months of 2015 -- the ones for which final monthly numbers are available. Final numbers for May 2015 are not available.)",/factchecks/2015/jul/10/american-bridge-21st-century/american-bridge-21st-century-says-layoffs-show-eco/

Senate candidate Todd Wilcox says more businesses closing than opening for first time
","An Orlando businessman vying for Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-vacated Senate seat announced his candidacy by saying fresh blood is needed to change the worst economic climate the country’s ever faced. ""It's time to restore America's prominence both here at home and abroad,"" Todd Wilcox, a former Green Beret and CIA veteran, said in a statement announcing his candidacy on July 8, 2015.  ""The economy is growing at a dismal rate. More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history."" The recent recession obviously has been an economic low point, but are the number of new businesses being eclipsed by the number of businesses closing for the first time ever? Well, it’s certainly true for as long as the government has been tracking that statistic. Beyond that is anyone’s guess. Wilcox, a Republican, told PolitiFact he was citing a May 2014 story from the Washington Post’s Wonkblog that said as much. The story was about a Brookings Institution study released that month called ""Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros,"" which examined business creation and destruction in the U.S. since 1978. The report said that business failures had held steady over most of that period, while business entries had steadily declined. Starting in 2008, the two points intersected for the first time in their 35-year history of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics data. The trend continued through 2011, the last year of available data in the study.The study’s authors said they couldn’t speak to the causes for this trend, which they called ""noteworthy and disturbing."" But they noted that ""it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones."" Where Wilcox’s claim falters is that the data isn’t for the entire 239-year history of the United States, but just the 35 years examined in the study. The Business Dynamics Statistics database only has figures from 1976 to 2012. What truly happened prior to that is largely anyone’s guess, economists told PolitiFact. ""I am not aware of any standard measures before then. I suspect that other measures do exist, but I doubt that they are systematically measured, year in and year out,"" UCLA economics professor Lee Ohanian said. While it’s possible there have been other periods of history where a similar trend has occurred, such as during the Great Depression, there is no dependable source of data measuring it, they said. ""It’s somewhere between plausible and impossible to prove,"" said Robert Litman, one of the authors of the Brookings study. He suggested it would be ""more accurate to say that for the first time since the government began tracking these things, fails have exceeded starts."" Our ruling Wilcox said, ""More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history."" He’s right that more firms are now closing up shop than starting up, a trend that started in 2008. But the stat he’s citing is from a study of a 35-year period from 1978 to 2011, not all of American history. The Census Bureau database used for that study has only been measuring entries and exits since the 1970s. Economists, including the study’s author, told us Wilcox overreached a bit, because this trend may have happened before.

Did Bernie Sanders vote against background checks and waiting periods for gun purchases?
","As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. ""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group. ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns."" Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation. The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.) But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition: • In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.   • The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992. • After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time). • He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. • The final compromise version of the Brady bill --  an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.   According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job. ""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."" In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents. ""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about."" The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us. ""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority."" ""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians."" Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half. Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position): Year Legislation Sanders’ Vote Result 1993 Imposes a five-day waiting period and background checks on firearm purchases, part of the Brady Bill Nay Passed 1993 Imposes instant background checks instead for firearm purchases, part of an amendment to Brady Bill Yea Passed 1993 Imposes an interim five-day waiting period while while waiting to put a instant background check system in place, part of Brady Bill conference report Nay Passed 1994 Bans semi-automatic assault weapons  Yea Passed 1996 Repeals the semi-automatic weapons ban  Nay Passed 1998 Increases minimum sentencing for gun crimes Yea Passed 1999 Creates ""instant check registrants"" and narrowly defines ""gun shows,"" part of the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act Nay Failed 1999 Imposes three day waiting period for guns purchased at gun shows, part of an amendment to the Gun Show Act Yea Failed 2002 Allows pilots and flight personnel to carry firearms in the cockpit Yea Passed 2003 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2005 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2006 Prohibits funds from being used to enforce trigger locks on guns Nay Passed 2006 Increases the burden of proof for the AFT to penalize law-breaking gun dealers, as part of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reform bill Yea Passed 2007 Prohibits foreign aid funding restrictions on U.S. gun ownership, as an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2008 Yea Passed 2008 Prevents the use of funds for anti-gun programs as an amendment to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Yea Passed 2009 Gives the District of Columbia seats in the House of Representatives and repeals the district’s ban on semi-automatic weapons Yea Passed 2009 Allows the use of firearms in National Parks Yea Passed 2009 Allows concealed and carry across state lines Nay Failed 2009 Allows firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, as an amendment to the congressional budget Yea Passed 2009 Prohibits higher insurance premiums for gun owners, as part of an amendment to the Affordable Care Act Yea Passed 2013 Prevents the U.S. from entering the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, as an amendment to the congressional budget Nay Passed 2013 Allows concealed and carry across state lines in states where the practice is not prohibited Nay Failed 2013 Lists all people prohibited buying a firearm in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Yea Failed 2013 Bans high-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds Yea Failed 2013 Bans assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines Yea Failed Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike.

Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog."" Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals. ""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through."" Our ruling An attack ad said, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill --  background checks and waiting periods."" The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks. Experts noted Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.   We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/

Cartoon skips specifics on wage-gap claim
","As political cartoons go, it was a fairly simple idea. The day after the U.S. Treasury announced that the portrait of a woman would be featured on a redesigned $10, the editorial cartoonist at the Washington Post offered his take. Tom Toles’ cartoon showed a portrait of ""U.S. Working Woman"" in the center, and the $10 note was worth $7.70. The motto: ""Close Enuf 4 U"" and signed by ""Hugh Ken Wait."" The same idea – that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man makes – has been the subject of repeated claims by politicians, with varying degrees of success. Among the best: a Mostly True rating for a similar claim by U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn last year. Nunn was broad enough to be on point, with some context missing. Among the worst: a Mostly False for that statistic by former President Jimmy Carter, who misread the data to suggest the gap was for equal work. PolitiFact Georgia decided to see how the Pulitzer prizewinner stacked up against the pols. We’ll get into the challenges of the statistics below. ON THE FACE OF IT Just to recap, Alexander Hamilton has graced the $10 since 1929, when the nation’s first secretary replaced Andrew Jackson, the nation’s seventh president, for the honor. Jackson, meanwhile, was moved to the $20 bill and remains the face of that note today. An advocacy group called Women on 20s recently petitioned President Obama and Congress for a woman’s face to be put on paper currency. But treasury officials had already announced that the $10 note would be the next to be redesigned. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in June that he would reveal his choice of the woman who will be on that note by year’s end. The bill will enter circulation in 2020, the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. DOLLARS AND SENSE Even as we approach that historic milestone, data clearly show that there is a wage gap between men and women. And Toles – like politicians from President Obama down to Connie Stokes, a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia – isn’t pulling that 77 percent figure out of thin air. The U.S. Census found in 2010, that the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.77. Put into dollars, that means women working full-time made 77 cents for every dollar earned by men who worked full time. An updated report for 2012 found the same gap, looking at all male and female full-time workers across the nation, regardless of occupation. The catch: The statistic is based on total wages. The Census report did not account for the fact that men generally work more hours. So the large discrepancy exists in part because it does not examine pay for the same work, or the same number of hours worked. That’s why the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reached a different conclusion of the gap. Its 2012 study analyzed pay by weekly wages and found that women earned 82 cents on the dollar for men’s median weekly earnings. Other BLS data have shown that the gap also diminishes when comparing women and men, in the same exact job, with the same levels of education and experience. In those cases, the gap falls to somewhere in the 91 percent range. So, while all evidence points to a wage gap, the exact difference is between 77 percent and 91 percent, depending on what you want to compare. OUR RULING The cartoon is broad, bluntly showing that ""working women"" across the nation would earn just $7.70 for a man’s $10. It leaves a lot open to interpretation. There is no implication that the jobs being done by men and women are identical, so Toles avoids the mistake of suggesting the gap is that wide for the same jobs. It’s not. The cartoon is an oversimplification of complex data that has been misread and misused repeatedly. But adding more context would have meant more than a one-panel cartoon. Toles keeps his claim broad enough to fall in line with the U.S. Census studies. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/10/tom-toles/cartoon-skips-specifics-wage-gap-claim/

Donald Trump's campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans
","The eccentricities and controversies of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign have polarized the Republican Party faithful, just a few weeks after Trump announced his bid. In a July 2, 2015, appearance on CNN, radio host and author Ben Ferguson joined conservatives critical of Trump, alleging a lack of seriousness and loyalty to the GOP. ""Donald Trump is not some big GOP Republican,"" he said, ""and some people are trying to act like he is."" But Ferguson took his admonishment a step further, questioning Trump’s financial commitment to the party and claiming that Trump has ""given more money to Democratic candidates than Republican candidates."" Trump’s dalliances with different political parties are well known, but we wanted to add up the donation totals to see what they said. The radio host, when reached for comment, offered a mostly anecdotal defense of his claim, citing big contributions from Trump to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Ferguson also pointed to contributions from Trump to Hillary Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Trump’s loyalties have not been exclusive to Republicans, Ferguson noted. In 2000, he launched a short-lived bid for the Reform Party’s presidential nomination, receiving more than 15,000 votes in the party’s California primary -- a tally that would have won him the state had he not already withdrawn from the race. Ferguson also directed us to his complicated history with party registration. What the numbers show We went to two authoritative databases of campaign finance data to examine Ferguson’s numbers: OpenSecrets.org, to find federal donations, and FollowtheMoney.org, for state-level donations. Trump has actually been relatively evenhanded in doling out cash to the two parties, but since 1989, he’s contributed over $350,000 more to Republicans running for federal and state offices, campaign finance records show. Data from the Federal Election Commission and state elections offices provided by the two websites show that Trump has given $584,850 to Democrats and $961,140 to the GOP over the last 26 years. The difference in donations is almost entirely captured in Trump’s recent giving. Since 2012, Trump has donated $463,450 to Republicans and just $3,500 to Democrats (California Attorney General Kamala Harris and New York Assemblyman Michael Benedetto). We’ve included those numbers below, with links to records of the individual contributions. Republicans Democrats Federal $703,900 $327,600 State $257,240 $257,250 Total $961,140 $584,850 Republicans Democrats 1989-2011 $497,690 $581,350 2012-present $463,450 $3,500 In short, Ferguson’s claim might have been true had he uttered it just a few years ago. In 2011, a Washington Post analysis of Trump’s donations found the majority of them going to Democrats. But the flow of cash from Trump to Democrats has fallen off; the last time he gave to a Democrat running for federal office was in 2010. We can’t drill down into local and city politics because there is no single campaign finance database. But we should note that Trump donated $50,000 to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2010, as well as over $25,000 more to other Cook County Democrats, among other donations that he’s made on the local level. (Trump has made his presence known in the Windy City.) At the same time, however, the real estate mogul’s gifts to Republican candidates and organizations increased dramatically. Since 2010, Trump has donated $124,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and given another $50,000 to American Crossroads, a conservative super PAC. A mix of politics and business It’s important to note that just as Trump’s political ambitions and private business interests often seem to overlap, it’s sometimes difficult to parse out the exact motivations behind many of his political contributions over the years. As an influential real estate developer in the Northeast and in cities around the world, Trump’s contributions may have not have much to do with one’s political party. From 1996 to 2007, for instance, Trump made 12 separate donations to New Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican who represents the Garden State’s Second Congressional District. The district includes Atlantic City, where the Trump Organization used to have significant holdings. While conservatives like Ferguson have criticized Trump for his donations to Democrats, Trump defended himself as having no viable Republican options in overwhelmingly blue states like New York. ""Everyone’s Democratic,"" he told Sean Hannity in 2011. ""So what am I going to do — contribute to Republicans? One thing: I’m not stupid. Am I going to contribute to Republicans for my whole life when they get heat when they run against some Democrat and the most they can get is 1 percent of the vote?"" Our rating Ferguson said that Trump has ""given more money to Democratic candidates than Republican candidates."" We can’t say definitively that his claim is wrong at all levels of government, since we don’t have the local data. But public records show that the real estate tycoon has actually contributed around $350,000 more to Republicans at the state and federal level than Democrats. That, however, is a recent development.

Jeb Bush says his 'average federal tax rate' was 36 percent
","When former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush released 33 years of tax returns, he suggested we are all paying too much in taxes -- himself included. ""I paid the government more than one in three dollars that I earned in my career,"" Bush wrote on his campaign website June 30. ""Astounding. The total effective rate was 36 percent. I think I speak for everyone, no matter your tax rate: We need to get more money back in your pocket and less in the federal kitty."" A chart highlighted Bush’s ""average federal tax rate"" as 36 percent. Was Bush’s average federal tax rate 36 percent over the years? It was a figure that drew attention and criticism. We found that it depends on how you calculate it. Bush’s tax rate Bush arrived at that 36 percent average by weighting his income -- so higher income and tax rate years counted more than the years when he earned far less -- including four years when he paid nothing in taxes and therefore had a zero tax rate. In fact, Bush didn’t start paying a rate of 36 percent or higher until he left office in 2007. Bush showed his annual tax rate for every year from 1981 through 2013. (He filed for an extension for 2014.) His footnotes explained that Bush was citing an effective federal tax rate calculated by dividing cumulative total tax paid by cumulative total taxable income. Abraham N.M. Shashy, Jr., former chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, calculated the rate for Bush. Bush’s income went up and down while he was in the private sector before he ran for governor for the first time in 1994. Later, it would drop while he was in the governor’s mansion from January 1999 through January 2007 and then rise again when he left office. As his income fluctuated, so did his tax rate. During the 1980s, Bush’s tax rate was usually less than 24 percent. For four years, his taxable income was either zero or negative as a result of losses taken on real estate and business investments while he worked with Miami real estate developer Armando Codina. His income surpassed $1 million for the first time in 1990. During the 1990s his tax rate ranged from 27 to 33 percent. Bush’s income dropped while in office from 1999 through January 2007 and then soared from $260,000 in 2006 to $7.4 million in 2013. Since 2007, his rate has ranged from 36 to 40 percent. So that means that Bush’s rate only exceeded that 35 percent for seven of his 33 years of tax returns. Whether 36 percent was his average rate depends on a few factors, including what we should count as income to determine the rate. Some of the tax experts we interviewed came up with different calculations or disagreed with how Bush calculated his rate. Here are the issues they raised: Weighted average: On this point, we found some disagreement about whether Bush used the best method or not. Bush used a weighted average, which counts the higher-earning years more than others. When we did a straight up average by adding up all the rates that Bush reported, we got an average of about 24.5 percent. Michael Kitces, a financial planning and tax expert who writes the Nerd’s Eye View blog, did his own analysis using a different income line on tax returns and calculated that Bush’s average rate was 21.3 percent. Rebecca Wilkins, a tax expert and executive director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said the weighted average is more accurate. ""It reflects what you are paying in taxes overall and doesn’t get skewed by unusual years,"" she said. Asawath Damodaran, a finance professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said that these methods simply reflect two different ways of calculating taxes. ""One is not right and the other wrong,"" he said. Although Bush cited his average, his website includes the rate for each individual year. Payroll taxes: Experts we interviewed said that Bush should not have included payroll taxes in his income tax calculation. Wilkins subtracted Bush’s payroll tax and found that his effective rate was 36 percent for 2013 -- not the 40 percent he cited. And when she averaged the rate for the past five years without the payroll taxes, she found an average of 33 percent. Taxable income: Bush used taxable income, which subtracts deductions, to calculate his rate. Here’s an example of how using taxable income rather than total income can skew the tax rate, as Kitces pointed out to PolitiFact. In 1984, Bush’s total income was $44,626 while after his deductions his taxable income was $11,276. So by dividing the $1,961 in taxes paid by the $11,276, we get the rate of 17 percent that Bush claimed. However, if we use the actual income figure of $44,626, his rate would have been 4 percent. Retirement money excluded: Roberton Williams at the Tax Policy Center says that Bush underestimated how much he earned because he omitted that his firm contributed millions to retirement accounts. (The Wall Street Journal reported that labor filings showed that the firm’s pension plan had assets of $2.4 million as of the end of 2013.) ""The bottom line is they have chosen the smallest measure of income they could use, and therefore calculated the largest tax rate they could get,"" Williams said. Not accounting for inflation: A more valid way to calculate the rate would be to inflate the dollars each year up to 2013 dollars and then determine the rate. That would cause the overall average effective tax rate to drop by a bit more than half a percentage point, Williams said. When Williams used adjusted gross income in place of taxable income that made it drop about another 1.5 percentage points. So when Williams adjusted for inflation and used the adjusted gross income, he calculated Bush’s average rate at 33.7 percent. We shared a summary of our findings from other tax experts with Bush’s campaign and asked why they used the method they used. ""Our calculation of the average effective tax rate Gov. Bush paid over 33 years takes into account his complete federal tax burden, which we believe any calculation of effective tax rate should aim to do,"" said Allie Brandenburger, a spokeswoman for Bush’s campaign. ""The 36 percent rate addresses all federal taxes, and presents the clearest and most accurate picture of Gov. Bush’s effective tax paid."" Our ruling Bush said his average federal tax rate was 36 percent. That’s the number that results if we use the method he did to calculate his taxes based on his taxable income, including payroll taxes and weighting the average to give more weight to the higher income years. However, there are other ways to calculate his average rate that would result in a lower number. For example, one way is adjusting for inflation and using a different measure of income, which lowered the rate to 33.7 percent. Other methods led to rates of 24.5 percent or 21.3 percent. Experts say it depends on what method you use. Overall, Bush did pay higher tax rates when he made more money. But he seems to have chosen a method of calculating his tax rate that results in the highest possible number.

It's a hoax: Jay-Z and Beyonce aren't trying to buy rights to the Confederate flag
","PunditFact and PolitiFact have recently checked the history and facts surrounding the Confederate flag flying outside the South Carolina statehouse. PunditFact has also looked into the extent to which retailers are prohibiting the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. Now, in the latest line of Confederate flag related news, comes another claim from Newswatch33 that has caught the attention of a variety of other media sources. The headline to the Newswatch33 article claims that Jay-Z and Beyonce are attempting to purchase the rights to the Confederate flag. With various websites alternately posting this claim as either fiction or reality, PunditFact decided to take a closer look. According to Newswatch33, the Carters want to purchase the resell rights to the Confederate flag for close to $280 million. This means that anyone who would want to sell merchandise with the flag’s image would have to request permission from the couple or risk a lawsuit. The article includes a quote by a person identified as the couple’s attorney, Ralph Hammerstein, in connection to the matter.  Is there any truth to this? The short answer is no. It’s a well-conceived hoax. Can someone even buy the rights to the Confederate flag? Again, no. About Newswatch33 Newswatch33 is masking as a real news source. Its own disclaimer says that relying on the ""accuracy (or) reliability"" of the website information is at users’ ""own risk."" Some of the other articles published by Newswatch33 have already been proven to be bogus. WPDE.com, a website powered by ABC 15, recently wrote that the events in a hate crime ""news"" story published by Newswatch33 never happened. Here is a cached image of the article that appears to have been taken down. Snopes.com took a look at another article from Newswatch 33 that claimed that South Carolina church shooter Dylann Roof received $4 million in supporter donations. Snopes rated this claim False. Other claims from the website seem just as ludicrous. Why you can't buy rights to the Confederate flag There’s no evidence Hammerstein is really the Carters’ attorney, nor any other verifiable account of this story. Even if the quote were accurate -- which it’s not -- getting the rights to the Confederate flag would be a fool’s errand. Not even for $280 million? ""No,"" said Christopher Jon Sprigman, a law professor at New York University. ""Because the flag was created under the laws of the Confederacy, even if there was a copyright on this, it’s a question of whether it would still be covered (by that copyright),"" Sprigman said. The particular design that we now associate with the Confederacy was actually rejected as the Confederate States of America’s national flag in 1861. Designed by South Carolinian Rep. William Porcher Miles, it was later an unofficial emblem of General Robert E. Lee’s army in Virginia. It is unclear whether Porcher legally laid claim to his design, but either way, federal law only protects an author’s copyright for 70 years after his or her death. The Porcher estate’s claim to the flag has long run out; he died in 1899. Just like the American flag, the Confederate flag is now in the public domain, free to reproduce and distribute. Furthermore, it would be extremely difficult to file a trademark on the flag. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), ""a refusal (of the trademark) must be issued if the design would be perceived by the public as a flag."" We could only find one instance throughout history of a flag being successfully copyrighted: Australian artist Harold Thomas sought and won the exclusive rights to the flag he created for Australia’s Aboriginal people.

Donald Trump says Mexican government 'forces many bad people into our country'
","In a July 8 interview with NBC, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump didn’t ease up his rhetoric about Mexican immigration -- at all. ""The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they're smart,"" he told interviewer Katy Tur. ""They're smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn’t believe. They're forcing people into our country. … And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico’s problems."" In the interview, Trump left no doubt that he believes the Mexican government is taking an active role in pushing migrants into the United States: He used the word ""forcing"" four times to describe what the government was doing. But is it really the government forcing Mexicans across the border, rather than individual decisions to leave, either to seek employment or to join family members in the United States? A range of immigration experts told PolitiFact that there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. (The Mexican Embassy did not respond to our inquiries, nor did a Trump representative.) For evidence, let’s start with the Mexican Migration Project, a bi-national research effort founded in 1982 to study Mexican migration to the United States. Anthropologists, sociologists and other experts with the project gather data, including field interviews with migrants, that illuminate migration patterns. The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey finds Trump’s assertion to be flat wrong. He pointed to findings from a paper he published in 2014 in the journal International Migration Review. In the paper, he and his co-authors concluded that undocumented migration from Mexico ""was driven largely by U.S. labor demand and by the existence of well-developed migrant networks that provided migrants with access to U.S. labor markets despite a rising enforcement effort. The taking of additional trips is likewise tied to U.S. labor demand and access to migrant networks, as well as the number of U.S. trips a migrant has accumulated over his or her career."" What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact. ""Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‘forcing many bad people into our country,’ "" Massey said. ""Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border."" Other experts sided with Massey. ""Immigrants come to work or to join family,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. ""And no, the Mexican government doesn’t force anyone to leave."" ""No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object,"" added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration. Tom Smith, a demographer at the University of Chicago, drew a contrast with one historical example in which a government did take a role in pushing certain people to emigrate to the United States -- the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980. ""While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups,"" Smith said. But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added. About the closest support for Trump’s claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government’s failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it’s not accurate to equate the Mexican government’s inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is forcing people to leave. It’s also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said. Trump ""does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population,"" Massey said. ""People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate."" In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well. Our ruling Trump said ""the Mexican government forces many bad people into our country.""

Deal claim he fulfilled toll promise needs major repairs
","
Gov. Nathan Deal is trying to turn the Ga. 400 toll from a symbol of broken promises to one of promises kept.

Commuters fumed in 2010 when state officials reneged on a pledge to end the 50-cent toll by the following year. Instead, they extended it to 2020. Some blame this move for sealing the fate of the failed bid to raise taxes to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta.

Deal, then vying for the governor’s seat, seized on the issue. He promised voters he’d tear down the toll by the end of 2011.

The tollbooths still stand, but now Deal’s recent announcement that the toll will come down during his term has him crowing that he kept his campaign pledge.

""Fulfilling his promise to commuters, Gov. Nathan Deal today announced that he will have the state pay off its bond debt on Dec. 1, 2013, and move rapidly after that to remove the Ga. 400 toll by the end of that year,"" Deal’s office announced in a news release July 19.

This perplexed us. Late last year, Deal earned a Promise Broken on our Deal-O-Meter for failing to meet the 2011 deadline.

Did we miss something? We put Deal’s claim that he fulfilled his promise on the Truth-O-Meter.

First, let’s review Deal’s original pledge.

On June 22, 2010, his campaign issued a news release that said ""he'll move quickly as governor to bring down the Georgia 400 toll before the end of 2011.""
   
""The state has collected more than enough money to pay for the bonds for the highway,"" Deal said in the statement. ""We are now using the tolls of Georgia 400 drivers to pay for other road projects. That’s not fair to the commuters in north Fulton and Forsyth counties. They’ve carried more than their fair share.""

Deal’s resolve waned in the coming months.

By the time Deal took office in January 2011, the State Road and Tollway Authority Board had already sold $40 million in bonds based on the revenue expected from the newly extended toll.

Ending the toll ""would be an abrogation of a contract,"" the governor’s spokesman, Brian Robinson, told PolitiFact Georgia in 2011.

Robinson did not return repeated requests for comment on this article.

The feud over the Ga. 400 toll became a flash point during the run-up to Tuesday’s unsuccessful referendum on a regional penny-per-dollar sales tax to overhaul metro Atlanta’s traffic-snarled transportation system.

Deal backed the tax, which would have expired in 10 years or less.

But tax foes said that the Ga. 400 flap was proof that the government couldn’t be trusted with transportation dollars.

Polls showed the tax measure flagging in the polls. Twelve days before the election, Deal announced that the state would pay off the $40 million in new bonds by Dec. 1, 2013. The tollbooths would come down soon afterward.

""When the Ga. 400 toll went up, the state of Georgia promised commuters that it wasn’t forever,"" his recent news release said. ""If we don’t keep that promise, we lose the faith of the people.""

Deal’s gambit did little for the transportation tax. More than 60 percent of voters in the Atlanta region rejected it Tuesday, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office.

Did Deal really fulfill his promise to commuters on Ga. 400?

When Deal promised to bring down the toll, he gave himself a deadline: ""before the end of 2011,"" as a campaign news release stated.

This new plan misses the original deadline by a full two years. That means Ga. 400 motorists will still be paying tolls much longer than they were originally promised.

Deal failed to meet a date of his own making. But he has come up with a plan to eliminate the tolls, albeit on a deadline not addressed in his original campaign promise.

Deal earns a Mostly False on this one.",/factchecks/2012/aug/06/nathan-deal/deal-claim-he-fulfilled-toll-promise-needs-major-r/

Hovde says Neumann voted four times to increase U.S. debt
","
In the Republican U.S. Senate race, Mark Neumann has portrayed himself  as a budget-cutter extraordinaire during his four years in Congress, but one of his rivals is painting him as a piggish paragon of waste.

""In Congress Mark Neumann voted for over 2,000 earmarks, including the ‘Bridge To Nowhere,’"" a TV ad by fellow Republican Eric Hovde charges. ""Congressman Neumann voted four times to increase our debt.""

Neumann did vote in 1998 for a massive transportation bill that included many earmarks, including that infamous Alaska bridge project, we reported in an item during Neumann’s failed 2010 bid for the Republican nomination for governor.

But what about the claim of voting to raise the nation’s debt ceiling?

The debt ceiling is the legal cap on borrowing by the federal government. Raising it is routinely done under presidents of both parties, but periodically that move stalls, as in the summer of 2011 when a stalemate pushed the nation to the edge of default.

Neumann’s record on the issue takes us back to 1995 when he entered Congress as a member of the GOP freshman class that ushered in the Republican Revolution under new House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

Voting records show Neumann had four chances to vote for or against extending the debt ceiling.

In all four instances, he voted to increase the limit, according to the online database maintained by the Library of Congress:

-- October 26, 1995: Neumann helped squeak through an attempt to boost the debt limit, in a broader bill, on a 227-203 vote largely along party lines. President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill.

-- November 9, 1995: Neumann, along with nearly every House Republican, voted to temporarily push the public debt limit to $4.967 trillion. Clinton vetoed this as well.

-- March 7, 1996: Congress again sent Clinton a broad fiscal bill that included an increase in the debt limit to $5.5 trillion. The vote was bipartisan, with 127 Democrats joining the majority on a 328-91 vote. Thirty Republicans dissented, but Neumann joined the majority. Clinton signed it.

-- July 30, 1997: Neumann again voted with most Republicans and 52 Democrats to boost the limit to $5.95 trillion, again as part of a broader bill. The tally was 346-85, with 32 Republicans voting no. The president signed it.

Like so many of the claims in the four-way GOP primary, Hovde’s ad takes a snippet of information that is accurate, but strips it of important context.

The thrust of the ad is that the votes show Neumann to be pro-spending and government growth. In the 2012 campaign Neumann is running on a platform to balance the budget on a five-year plan.

A look at the votes shows they came as Neumann and other conservatives pushed the Democratic president for significant spending cuts. Compromise talks failed, leading, famously, to two temporary government shutdowns.

The 1995 votes were part of the legislative battle over the GOP’s balanced budget act, which aimed to accomplish a balanced budget in seven years.

In fact, in three of the four votes Hovde cites, the debt-limit increase was part of very broad fiscal measures.

The March 1996 debt action, for example, was tucked into a multifaceted bill to reduce federal regulation of business, and as we noted it drew significant Democratic support.

Finally, the August 1997 increase in the debt limit was approved as part of an act the New York Times described as ""sweeping legislation intended to balance the federal budget for the first time since 1969.""

The government actually ran a surplus from 1998 to 2001, thanks to what observers said was a combination of an earlier tax increase, spending restraints, economic growth and stock market gains.

Foreshadowing the 2011 showdown, Neumann, an early crusader on the perils of debt, was trying to leverage the deadline over raising the debt ceiling to get deeper spending cuts.

That sounds a lot like Hovde’s position, which he laid out at a candidate forum in April 2012.  He said he could support a debt-ceiling increase but only if its tied to strict spending restraints that balance the budget within two years.

Our rating

In a TV ad, Hovde paints Neumann as a go-along-to-get-along congressman who was cavalier about federal spending and helped raise the nation’s debt.

Neumann did vote four times to extend the debt ceiling, but the ad leaves out important details: The votes were part of a historic drive by Republicans to balance the budget, and were wrapped into huge fiscal bills.

That pushes his claim down to Half True on the Truth-O-Meter.",/factchecks/2012/aug/05/eric-hovde/hovde-says-neumann-voted-four-times-increase-us-de/

DCCC ad campaign targets House Republicans for wanting to cut taxes for millionaires, but not the middle class
","
Between images of a supermarket employee and a wealthy guy sitting in a robe outside his mansion, a new Democratic ad campaign goes after House Republicans for apparently supporting tax breaks for millionaires, but not the middle class.

With a series of videos posted on YouTube last week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting 23 GOP House members, including New Jersey’s Jon Runyan (R-3rd). Runyan is seeking reelection in November against Democratic challenger Shelley Adler.

The campaign aims to ""expose"" the representatives ""who are about to vote for another tax cut for millionaires at the expense of the middle class and seniors,"" the committee said Monday in a news release.

Each online ad starts off like this: ""Good news! Republicans want to cut your taxes. Not you,"" the narrator says as an image of the supermarket employee appears on the screen.

""You!"" the narrator continues, as the ad shifts to an image of the wealthy guy outside his mansion, followed by images of a yacht, private jet and waterfront home. ""And you deserve a break -- after all, these things are expensive.""

Returning to images of middle-class folks, the narrator later adds: ""This guy? Her? They don’t need it. They’ll just buy groceries and pay the mortgage.""

The ad targeting Runyan ends with this on-screen message: ""Tell Congressman Jon Runyan -- Stop putting millionaires over the middle class.""

Here’s the problem with these ads: the proposal from House Republicans would extend tax cuts for all income levels -- not just millionaires.

This Democratic campaign centers on the pending expiration of federal income tax cuts first enacted under President George W. Bush, and commonly known as the ""Bush tax cuts."" The lower income tax rates were originally set to expire at the end of 2010, but President Barack Obama and Congress later extended them through the end of 2012.

Democrats have been pushing a bill that extends the tax cuts through 2013 for individuals with income below $200,000 and married couples earning less than $250,000.

Republicans want to extend the Bush tax cuts for all Americans.

In a 256-171 vote on Wednesday, the GOP-controlled House approved a Republican bill that extends all of the tax cuts through 2013. Runyan and the other 22 representatives targeted by the DCCC campaign voted for the bill.

Higher-income households would see greater tax savings under this Republican proposal, compared with other households. Still, it’s wrong for the DCCC to suggest the GOP only wants to cut taxes for millionaires.

In response to our findings, DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin said in an e-mail: ""If Congressman Runyan wanted to give the middle class a tax cut he wouldn’t be holding it hostage in order to get more tax cuts for millionaires.""

But unlike the Democrats’ plan, the House Republicans’ bill would not extend five other tax policies benefiting lower-income households, which are separate from the Bush tax cuts.

Those provisions -- which were first included in the economic stimulus bill approved by Obama in 2009 -- include an income tax credit worth up to $2,500 to offset higher education costs.

""The (House) GOP bill would continue most of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of the year but would allow the Obama tax cuts enacted in 2009 and extended in 2010 to expire,"" said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""The latter would raise taxes on some families, mostly those with low income.""

Our ruling

In an online ad campaign, the DCCC suggests Runyan and other House Republicans support a bill that cuts taxes for millionaires, but not the middle class.

It’s true that the House Republicans’ bill would not extend certain tax benefits originally included in the stimulus package, but the legislation would extend the Bush tax cuts across all income levels, thereby giving all taxpayers a break.

We rate the statement Mostly False.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of R.I. says growth of SuperPACs led to eightfold increase in negative campaign ads
","
Negative campaign ads: most people say they hate them, but studies show that many people are swayed by them.

Thus, major races can get pretty nasty, and there's a fear that the presidential contest this year will break all records for nastiness, thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision.  The court upheld the right of persons, organizations and corporations to spend as much as they would like on political advertising -- while hiding their involvement -- through the use of organizations known as super political action committees (Super-PACs).

To shed some light on who is behind such attack ads, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI,  has been promoting the DISCLOSE Act. The name is an acronym for Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections.

""When you don't have accountability, there's no limit to the things that people will say,"" Whitehouse said during a debate on the floor of the Senate. ""One of the restraints on the vitriol and the filth that so often is part of the American political debate is that candidates have to stand by their ads.

""And if you say something that is awful, if you engage in relentless negative attacks, voters may charge you a price for that,"" Whitehouse said. ""Well, that of course disappears when the name behind the ad is attached to no living person or corporation. It's just an entity, it's a sham, it's a phony, it's a shell.""

The DISCLOSE act would require some tax-exempt groups that engage in political advertising to reveal individual donors who gave $10,000 or more.

Critics say the act discriminates because it wouldn't apply to unions. They also say disclosure might open donors up to intimidation and ridicule, inhibiting free speech.

During an unsuccessful push to bring the proposal to a vote in the Senate -- a drive blocked twice by Republicans, on July 16 and 17 -- Whitehouse said the Citizens United decision was already sparking a giant increase in negative political advertising.

""An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008,"" he said.

That's a big jump in negative advertising. We wondered if it were true.

The context

When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson sent us to a study released May 2, 2012, by the Wesleyan Media Project at Wesleyan University. It defined a negative advertisement as an ad in which the candidate's opponent is mentioned.

The study looked only at TV ads in the presidential races and only ads broadcast from January 1 through April 22 of 2008 and the same period in 2012.

It turns out that Whitehouse quoted the study accurately. The researchers said that 70.0 percent of all ads in 2012 were negative during that period, compared with 9.1 percent in 2008.

But Whitehouse also said that the Citizens United decision is responsible for that increase in negative ads, so let’s look at that aspect.

The political scientists we spoke with said the Supreme Court decision is having a huge effect on the tone and rhythm of the 2012 campaign.

The Wesleyan study suggests that the effect was already clear in the first four months of this year.

Consider the ads purchased by special-interest groups or SuperPACs.

Of the 10,062 special-interest group ads aired during the first quarter of 2008, 75 percent were rated positive and 25 percent were rated negative.

By 2012, the number of special-interest ads had exploded, jumping more than 12-fold to 123,062. In addition, the mix of ads had reversed, with only 14 percent positive and 86 percent negative.

Meanwhile, the number of ads bought by candidates themselves plummeted, from 289,622 in the first quarter of 2008 to 74,267 this year, an indication that they were letting the special interest ads carry the ball for promoting their candidacies.

As Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, said in the report, ""That's a lot of money and airtime backed by undisclosed sources.""

Other factors affect rate

But Franz and the other experts we consulted cautioned that additional factors are also at work.

The first four months of the 2008 race were very different from the same period in the 2012 contest.

In early 2008, ""one reason the number was so low was because the [Barack] Obama and [Hillary] Clinton campaigns didn't really attack each other on TV that much,"" said Franz, now at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. ""They did off the air, and they were obviously quite ruthless. But in the ads themselves, there wasn't a lot of sniping back and forth against each other. They promoted themselves primarily.

""That changed for Obama in the general election,"" Franz said. ""He was a very negative candidate and once the general election started, it became an overwhelmingly negative campaign, as it usually is in the general election.""

During the first four months of 2012, SuperPACs drove up the percentage of negative ads, he said, ""but also candidates have been overwhelmingly negative against each other in the [2012] Republican primary.""

So let's look at the types of ads placed by the candidates themselves.

In 2008, only 9 percent of the ads placed by all the candidates in the first four months of the year were negative.

By 2012 that number had grown to nearly 53 percent.

The first four months of a presidential election year are not necessarily the best guide to the rhythm of the rest of a presidential campaign. ""I really don't think they're indicative of what's to come,"" said Mary Ellen Balchunis, a political scientist at LaSalle University in Philadelphia. ""It's how close the polls are, it's whether your opponent is going negative, it's whether you are responding.""

Early in the contest, ""the ads are generally more about who the candidate is and what the candidate would do. That's particularly true for a challenger,"" said Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va., a key swing state. ""There are always some negative ads, but they are really sprinkled in the mix. In the fall, when people are really turning their attention to the election, that's when the number of negative ads escalates.""

""In this election cycle, things are already so negative, it's hard to imagine that there's much room for them to get more negative between now and November,"" said Farnsworth, author of ""Spinner-in-Chief: How Presidents Sell Their Policies and Themselves.""

Our ruling

Sheldon Whitehouse said, ""An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008.""

He is correctly quoting the study, but the context of his comment makes it clear that he blames the SuperPACs, which were freed up by the Citizens United decision.

Those special-interest groups are certainly playing a much larger role this year, in part because they have become the major source of TV ad purchases.

But the data also reveal that the candidates are being far more negative earlier in the campaign than they were four years ago, and that also drove up the percentage of negative ads in the beginning of 2012.

Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate the claim as Mostly True.

Are about seven in 10 of Oregon’s inmates in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses, like rape, murder, armed robbery?
","
Frankly, PolitiFact Oregon was surprised to spot a press release for a new radio campaign ad designed to set the ""record straight on Oregon’s prisons laws."" We didn’t know there was a need. Was there another ballot measure pending? Was somebody spreading falsehoods about prison laws? Didn’t Oregonians vote on sentencing back in 2008? What was going on?

Steve Doell is a longtime advocate of crime victims and president of Crime Victims United, which helped get Measure 11 passed in 1994. This ad campaign is his latest venture, a nonprofit that he says is separate from Crime Victims and one that he said is aimed at giving people the facts about prison statistics.

He wants to remind voters through the ""Truth in Sentencing Project"" that fewer than one in four convicted felons is sent to prison. Less than one-half of one-percent are in prison for drug possession. And this:

""About 7 in 10 of Oregon’s inmates are in prison for violent crimes and serious sex offenses including felony assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, manslaughter, child molestation, rape, attempted murder, and murder,"" he writes in the press release.

In the accompanying radio ad, he says two-thirds of prisoners are violent criminals. In short, Oregon’s system works, he said. Doell got his numbers from the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, which administers Oregon's felony sentencing guidelines and serves as a statistical and data clearinghouse. Off we went, with a detour stop at the Department of Corrections.

According to the agency’s July 2012 inmate population profile, 9,878 of the 14,186 people in prison were there because of crimes against a person. That is 70 percent, or more than two-thirds. Hold on to the idea of a person crime.

The same population profile also tells us that nearly 9,300 of those inmates are in prison for crimes one could describe as violent: Assault, homicide, rape, kidnapping, robbery, sodomy and sex abuse. That’s about 65 percent, which is about two-thirds.

We caught up with Craig Prins, the criminal justice commission’s executive director, who confirms that 70 percent of inmates have committed a crime against a person -- but he wanted to make sure we understand that that doesn’t mean they are all necessarily violent criminals, on par with murderers and child molesters.

For example, a drunken driver who doesn’t kill anyone is categorized as committing a crime against a person, even though no one was hurt. A drunken driver who hits and kills another person has definitely committed a crime against a person, even though there was no intent to commit homicide. For Prins there is a distinction. For Doell, there isn’t. We offer the information for readers to assess.

We also have another point that readers may want to keep in mind: More non-violent offenders are being admitted into prison -- which means that the ratio of violent offenders may drop in the future.

That’s because in 2008, Oregon voters approved Ballot Measure 57, which increased sentences for drug and property offenders. It was a legislative proposal drafted in response to a more punishing measure sponsored by Doell and others. Property and drug offenders sentenced under Measure 57 are expected to add 1,000 beds to the prison system over 10 years with overall bed growth closer to 2,000.

Prins and others on Gov. John Kitzhaber’s Commission on Public Safety have been tasked with finding ways to improve public safety and save money. The commission is to come up with ideas for the 2013 Legislature. And while Doell insists the Truth in Sentencing Project is not in response to an outside force, it’s clear this governor wants to make changes in state prisons.

A June report by the Pew Center on the States, which is providing technical help to Oregon to review numbers and tease out prison growth drivers, states that Oregon in 2011 admitted more low-risk offenders than in 2000. Also, the share of property, drug and other offenders increased from 53 percent of new admits in 2000 to 59 percent in 2011. (p.20) In other words, trends are changing and they may change more with the approval of Measure 57, which went into effect in January.

Doell says the state doesn’t have the greatest record on correctly projecting bed additions. He also doesn’t think Measure 57 will change the ratio that much. ""I don’t think there’s going to be a significant change, I think it could be a percentage point or points here and there,"" he said.

We think readers should be mindful that there is a forecast and new sentencing guidelines that may change the ratio in the future, but we don’t know for sure by how much, if at all. The state would not hazard a projection other than the overall increase of 2,000 beds, of which at least 1,000 come from Measure 57.

As for a ruling? It is factually correct that as of now, 70 percent of inmates are in prison for crimes against a person, and that 65 percent are in there for crimes we can see are violent in nature. That is ""about seven in 10"" or two-thirds. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/03/steve-doell/are-about-seven-10-oregons-inmates-prison-violent-/
"['Oregon', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Steve Doell']","
Has Measure 11 really helped halve the crime rate since 1995?
","
The people behind a new radio ad looking to ""set the record straight"" on Oregon’s prisons laws say that 1994's Measure 11 has played a big role in bringing Oregon's crime rate down from its high water mark back in the 1980s and 1990s.

Here’s the full statement from Steve Doell, the executive director of the Truth in Sentencing Project, on the passage of Measure 11.

""The voters were tired of the high violent crime rate in Oregon and violent criminals receiving short sentences so they put a high priority on violent crimes. And while Oregon’s violent crime rate increased nearly 700% from 1960 until 1985, then basically plateaued through 1995, the violent crime rate has decreased more than 50% since then. We believe one of the most significant reasons for this decrease is Measure 11.""

The 700 percent figure caught our attention -- but so did this whole concept that Measure 11 was so instrumental in such a dramatic shift away from higher crime rates. We couldn’t help but check it out.

We were able to corroborate the statistics and general narrative pretty quickly by placing a call to the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, which studies these issues.

What still remained, though, was the question of whether Measure 11, which instituted mandatory jail time for certain crimes, was one of the causes of the trend. Doell drew the connection pretty sharply based on the timing of the reversal in the trend. That makes sense, but we thought we ought to look at what happened nationally during the same period.

As it happens, the U.S. saw a fairly similar pattern. Violent crime rates grew dramatically between 1960 and 1991, when finally the trend reversed. In Oregon, the rate grew through 1985, when the state posted its highest violent crime rate ever and then stagnated, more or less, until 1995, when the trend downward took hold.

When we spoke with Craig Prins, the executive director of the justice commission, he seemed less convinced that Measure 11 had much to do with the fall. He pointed to the same national data we found.

""What we're looking at nationally is that all states ... almost every state had the same type of reduction in crime,"" he said.

Prins also showed us a graph that looks at the connection between incarceration and crime rates. Essentially what Doell and other Measure 11 supporters are saying is that there’s an inverse correlation between incarceration and crimes rates -- as incarceration increases, crime decreases. But that’s not always the case.

Between 1995 and 2010, incarceration rates in Oregon grew by nearly 80 percent and, indeed, violent crime rates fell by a little over 50 percent. That’s all fine and good, but take a look at what happened in New York and California during the same period. In New York, the incarceration rate actually decreased and in California it increased by about 5 percent -- and yet both states saw larger decreases in their violent crime rate than Oregon.

When we spoke to Doell about both of these factors, he had some valid rebuttals. First off, Oregon’s violent crime rate didn’t follow the exact pattern of the national rate -- it started to fall later than the national trend. (That said, it did peak earlier.) Second, Oregon ranks below California and New York in terms of incarceration rate despite our rapid growth during the past 15 years.

There is some other important context as we look at the national trend. Between 1994 and 1996, 23 states passed some form of three-strike laws for certain habitual offenders. Measure 11 wasn’t included in that group, but it basically served the same purpose and contributed to a national trend of escalating incarceration rates.

Still, we did a quick check and found that even states -- such as Minnesota and Arizona -- that didn’t pass tough-on-crime laws during that period saw trend lines that matched Oregon’s.

We asked Prins what some of the additional factors might have been, beyond incarceration rates, and he referred us to a report that draws a pretty striking correlation between demographics and crime rates.

According to the report, which the commission released in 2010, ""most crime is committed by males age 15-39"" -- a demographic that has been on a steady decline since 1985.

One last bit that Prins pointed out: During the same time that crime rates started dropping, Oregon -- and many other states -- were busy building out their prison systems. Up until that point, overcrowding would lead to severely truncated sentences. In that regard, Measure 11 did prompt some changes by essentially forcing the system to make room for offenders that were ineligible for early release.

""I think you have to put it in context,"" Prins said. ""Measure 11, I think, was needed in the ‘90s because it did help us build our prison system, but it’s not at all what I would point to as the reason that our crime dropped.""

We checked in with one last expert, Brian Renauer of the Criminal Justice Policy Research Institute. He said that the Criminal Justice Commission’s findings mirrored those of national studies.

""Their analysis is good, their conclusions are very similar to what experts around the nation would say about the issue,"" he said. ""You're going to see this pretty strong effect as you do begin to ramp up incarceration, but those effects do tend to wear off.""

Now for the ruling. Doell says that Measure 11 is ""one of the most significant reasons"" for the decrease in the violent crime rate. That ""one of"" language is important. It acknowledges the existence of other causes. We also agree that Measure 11 made a difference, though it’s unclear whether it was because of the higher incarceration rates or the greater prison building to prevent early releases, as Prins suggests. That and the fact that Oregon’s drop was part of a national trend caused in large measure by changing demographics are needed clarifications to the statement.

For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/03/steve-doell/has-measure-11-really-helped-halve-crime-rate-1995/

His email also says the Republican-majority House would vote later that week on preventing the increases.

Canseco was hardly the first advocate to declare that the tax hike would be record-setting. When the tax cuts put in place under President George W. Bush were last up for renewal in 2010, ""largest ever"" became a rallying cry of sorts for congressional Republicans and news entities alike.
   
In a Fox News Sunday appearance that year, former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin made a similar claim. At the time, PolitiFact ruled her claim ""Pants On Fire"" because she was wrong about the ranking and incorrectly described the Democrats' plans.

The tax-related figures haven’t changed much since.
   
Estimates vary as to how much taxes would rise if the Bush-era tax cuts were allowed to expire without exceptions. Congress approved the tax breaks in 2001 through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, and adjusted them in 2003 through the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.
   
The tax cuts were set to expire in 2010, because they passed Congress through a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. But, after a heated debate, lawmakers voted in 2010 to extend them for two more years.
   
Some tax analysts have argued that, because the tax cuts were intended to be temporary, their expiration does not count as a tax increase. We’re not getting into that argument here.

Most estimates for the increase caused by repealing the tax cuts hover around $3.7 trillion over 10 years, the number represented in the Congressional Budget Office’s Budget and Economic outlook from January 2012. (The number is listed under the category of ""extend certain income tax and estate and gift tax,"" though analysts assured PolitiFact New Hampshire that it refers to the Bush tax cuts).

Another $900 billion increase would stem from keeping the Alternative Minimum Tax from socking more taxpayers.   
   
In raw dollars, then, the resulting $4.6 trillion total would rank among the greatest tax increases in history. By email, Canseco’s spokeswoman, Kyler Arnold, pointed out by email that the CBO said in January 2012 that the impact of not extending the Bush-originated tax cuts would be about $5 trillion. Table 1-6 in the report indicates that the cumulative costs of extending the tax cuts and steadying the Alternative Minimum Tax through 2023 would be $5.3 trillion, counting nearly $800 billion in debt service.

But there’s a better way to compare the potential increase with tax increases through history.

Economists do this by calculating tax increases as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP. GDP means a country's entire annual economic economic output; it's a way of measuring the entire economy. If we calculate tax increases as a percentage of GDP, it means we don't have to worry about distortions from variables like inflation or economic growth.

Spread over the next 10 years, the $4.6 trillion tax increase would amount to about 2.25 percent of the nation’s GDP. That figure, calculated with help from several tax analysts, starts from adding together the Budget Office’s projected GDP figures over the next 10 years, 2013-2022; then the total is divided by the $4.6 trillion figure. The result is higher than most tax increases in recent history, according to a 2006 U.S. Treasury report analyzing all tax measures since 1940.
   
According to the report, the Bush tax cuts have held a higher percentage of the GDP than many of the biggest tax laws in recent history. It beats out the the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which measured in at 1.23 percent of GDP by the time all its provisions went into effect in 1986. It also measures larger than the Revenue Act of 1941, which at $3.6 billion, amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP.
   
Yet, according to the analysis, the Bush tax cuts fall well below the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP. That act passed into law after the United States entered World War II.

And this would make the Bush tax cuts, should they expire, the second-largest tax increase in history, as a percentage of GDP.
   
""There is no doubt, if all the (Bush) tax cuts were allowed to expire, this would have a very big impact,"" Howard Gleckman, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, an independent tax analysis group, told PolitiFact New Hampshire.

Gleckman, author of the blog TaxVox.org, continued: ""But, if you’re asking the question, would it be the largest tax increase ever, the answer is no.""

By email, Arnold pointed out the 1942 tax increase included a 5 percent ""Victory"" income tax add-on that was repealed in 1944 ""and never designed to be a permanent tax increase"" while, she said, ""the tax increase set to occur at the end of the year is a permanent tax increase, absent legislative action. Comparing a tax bill (including a temporary tax increase for the war) to a permanent tax increase is not apples to apples.""

We ran Arnold’s thought by Gleckman, who pointed out that when they passed into law, the Bush tax cuts had a built-in end date -- one since extended by Congress. Broadly, he said, all tax laws are temporary in that sense, though Bush’s cuts were explicitly temporary.

Gleckman agreed that ending the Bush tax cuts would result in the biggest hike by the GDP gauge since 1942. However, he said, the difference between the No. 1 and speculated-about No. 2 tax increase, 2.25 percent of GDP versus 5 percent, is huge.

""This is like saying the horse that came in second by 20 lengths almost won,"" he said by phone.

Broadly, as Gleckman notes, few in Washington expect the Bush tax cuts to expire in full. Rather, the debate this year has centered on whether to extend the tax breaks for everyone or extend them for all but the nation’s highest earners. If only cuts for the most wealthy residents were allowed to expire, it would mean a tax increase of about 0.4 percent of GDP.
   
Our ruling
   
The trillions of dollars at stake with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts places them among the nation’s most costly. Still, the cuts, if allowed to expire, would amount to less than half the percentage of the gross domestic product reflected in the 1942 tax increase.

Mitt Romney would cut millionaires’ taxes, Barack Obama says
","
You comparison shop for cans of tuna. Mitt Romney rides on Donald Trump’s jet.

A new Obama campaign ad shows those scenes to hammer at the lifestyle differences between struggling middle-class Americans and the Republican presidential candidate. Then it takes aim at Romney’s economic proposals.

""Now he has a plan,"" the ad says, ""that would give millionaires another tax break and raises taxes on middle-class families by up to $2,000 a year.""

We know from our previous reporting on Romney’s tax plan that it offers across-the-board cuts, including for the very wealthy. But a new independent study offers broader perspective on how taxpayers at all income levels would be affected by Romney’s plan. 
So we decided to take a look.

Romney’s tax ""plan"" 
We need to be clear from the start that the problem independent analysts, journalists and fact-checkers have with digging into Romney's tax plan is that much of the ""plan"" isn't yet known. 
Romney has suggested general parameters: 
• The rate cuts would be paid for without adding to the deficit.
• People at the high end ""will still pay the same share of the tax burden they’re paying now.""
• Everyone would see tax rate reductions. 
He has outlined specific tax cuts on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax.
   
Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent. 
To offset those cuts, Romney has hinted that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes.  
The effect of Romney's plan 
Knowing all that, the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that evaluates tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates, examined the effect of Romney’s tax rate cuts combined with the elimination of several common tax deductions. Those include the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance. The center published its findings on Aug. 1, 2012. 
To try and keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs -- starting with the deductions for top earners first -- until they came up with enough revenue to offset the $360 billion in tax cuts that are part of Romney's plan. 
They determined that people who earn $1 million or more in taxable income would see an average net tax decrease of $87,117. They’d save $175,961 from Romney's tax cut, but lose $88,444 in deductions. 
""They would still get a tax cut,"" said Adam Looney, one of the authors. ""The dollar value of the tax cuts is just way bigger than the mortgage interest and other deductions. There’s no way to implement this plan in a way that doesn’t result in a pretty big tax cut for that group (those making more than $1 million).""

People who earn between $500,000 and $1 million would see a cut of about $17,000, and taxes for people with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 would decrease by about $1,800, the study found. 
But to make Romney's plan revenue neutral, deductions would also have to be removed for people with incomes below $200,000, and the effects of that would be significant, the study found. In fact, the elimination of the deductions would mean outright tax increases for everyone with incomes below $200,000. People with taxable income between $50,000 and $75,000, for example, would see an average net tax increase of $641. They’d save $984 from Romney's rate cut, but lose $2,672 in write-offs.

The authors specifically noted that taxpayers with children whose income is below $200,000 would see their taxes go up by an average of $2,041 -- the figure highlighted in Obama’s ad.

The reason for the increase is that the most popular tax breaks heavily benefit middle- and lower-income families, the 95 percent of the population earning less than $200,000 who carry mortgage debt and use employer-provided health insurance. 
And though Romney has suggested he would focus on taking the deductions away from the wealthy, the study concluded that alone would not make up the difference of the revenue sacrificed when rates are slashed.

""Somebody has to foot the bill for those tax cuts,"" Looney said. ""You have to tap into middle- and lower-income households."" 
Bottom line: the study found that Romney couldn't keep all his goals based on what we know about his plan.

Romney campaign’s response

When the study appeared online, the Romney campaign posted a response on its website that did not specifically address the discrepancy.

""President Obama continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending. We've been down that road before – and it's led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent,"" said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams.

Looney is a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings who has a Ph.D. from Harvard University. He served on Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2009 and 2010. William Gale, another of the authors, is vice president of Brookings and director of its economic studies program. He served on President George H.W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers.

Lanhee Chen, the Romney campaign’s policy director, later added in a press release that the study ignored the corporate tax rate cut Romney proposes and his deficit reduction plan.

""These glaring gaps invalidate the report’s conclusions,"" Chen said. 
The Romney campaign said that the study ignored the assertion that lower tax rates will grow the economy -- which they say will translate into more tax revenues. That will help make the plan revenue neutral even with lower overall tax rates. 
Spending cuts, likewise, could help balance the tax cuts without having to raise taxes on people making less than $200,000. The study, for the record, did consider that possibility but concluded it was impossible to evaluate the effect of spending cuts without knowing what would be cut.  They also noted that ""government spending tends to benefit low- and middle-income households."" 
We find nothing in the study that distorts Romney’s proposals. It makes assumptions favorable to Romney, namely that his plan would lead to greater economic growth and raise revenues. The Tax Policy Center, whose director is another former adviser to Bush, is well-respected for its unbiased work, and even the Romney campaign praised it in November 2011 for offering ""objective, third-party analysis."" 
Our ruling

Obama said Romney is proposing a tax plan ""that would give millionaires another tax break and raises taxes on middle class families by up to $2,000 a year."" 
The claims are based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, which used what Romney has said about his tax plan and attempted to calculate outcomes for different groups of taxpayers. 
The study prioritizes the idea that the plan would be revenue neutral. In that scenario, millionaires lose deductions, but the lower rates would still decrease their tax bill by an average of $87,000. 
Middle-class taxpayers would see lower tax rates, too, but the loss of exemptions and deductions would hit them harder. People making $200,000 or less a year would see their taxes rise by an average of about $2,000. 
The study is making the point that Romney’s plan is untenable: to cut rates that much without adding to the deficit, something has to give. It necessarily makes some assumptions, and therefore these conclusions are not definite as long as the details of the plan remain unknown. For that reason, people should be cautious in calling this Romney's plan.

"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
George Allen says Tim Kaine tried to raise taxes on people ""earning as little as $17,000""
","
Republican Senate candidate George Allen recently accused Democratic opponent Tim Kaine of being a tax hiker, even on people of modest means.

During a July 21 debate in Hot Springs, Allen criticized Kaine for ""actually proposing tax increases that would be hitting people earning as little as $17,000 a year.""

We checked to see if Kaine, who was governor from 2006 to 2010, really did try to raise taxes on people at that income level.

The Allen campaign, in a website post, backed Allen’s statement by citing news articles about a proposal Kaine unveiled in December 2009 as part of his farewell biennial budget proposal for 2010-2012. Kaine called for adding a 1 percent income tax surcharge and giving all proceeds to localities in return for them scrapping the car tax they levy on personal vehicles.

Legislators in 1998 adopted a five-year plan to phase out the personal property tax on most cars and reimburse localities for their lost revenues. But the program was more expensive than anticipated and legislators eventually capped the state reimbursement at $950 million a year. The remaining share is paid by vehicle owners.

Ending the car tax would mean the state wouldn’t have to provide the annual $950 million payment to localities, Kaine said in a speech to the General Assembly’s money committees. Kaine wanted to use the savings to help balance the state’s recession-wracked budget.
News articles from the time said Kaine’s policy would raise the maximum state income tax rate from 5.75 percent to 6.75 percent. That maximum rate applies to all taxable income above $17,000 after deductions and exemptions are taken into account.

The state charges gradually higher income tax rates up to that level. Virginia puts a 2 percent levy on the first $3,000 of taxable income, 3 percent of the next $2,000, 5 percent on the next $12,000 and then 5.75 percent on all taxable income above $17,000.

The bill advancing Kaine’s proposal did not say the added tax would only be levied on taxable income of $17,000 or more. The added 1 percent surtax would have pertained to all income levels, according to Joel Davison, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Finance.

Virginia does not require individuals with a state adjusted income below $11,950 and married couples with a state adjusted income below $23,900 to pay state income taxes. So they wouldn’t have been affected by the tax increase.

Kaine’s proposal was killed by the General Assembly.

It should be noted that some people earning $17,000 would have benefitted from Kaine’s plan if their savings from the elimination of the car tax outstripped their increased income tax. There are no estimates of the number of Virginians who would fallen into this category, but we suspect it would be a small group. Here’s why:

For starters, we can eliminate those who didn’t own cars.

Now, let’s consider those who did own vehicles. A single filer with no children earning $17,000 would have a taxable income of $13,070 after taking the standard deduction and exemption. A 1 percent income tax increase for that person would come to almost $131 a year.

The car levy paid by that person would depend on where he or she lived because each locality sets it own tax rate based on the assessed value of the vehicle. In Richmond, a person wouldn’t pay a $131 levy unless they had a car worth about $9,000. In rural Henry County, a vehicle would have to be valued at about $17,500 to merit a $131 tax.

Our ruling

Allen said that Kaine proposed a tax increase that would have affected people earning ""as little as $17,000 a year."" Not everyone at that level would have paid more under Kaine’s plan, but it’s a safe bet that large number of them would have seen their overall tax bill rise.

Fellow GOP Senate candidate Eric Hovde backed billions for rail, banks, Mark Neumann says
","
According to polls, support for Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde is strongest among tea party supporters and the most conservative voters.

Yet, in a July 17, 2012 TV ad, there’s a smiling Hovde, a Republican, pictured alongside a smiling President Barack Obama.

The ad is from fellow GOP candidate Mark Neumann, who has stepped up his attacks on Hovde as the Aug. 14, 2012 primary approaches.

""Like Barack Obama,"" the ad says, ""Hovde supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail and, like Obama, billions more to bail out banks.""

It ends stating that Hovde is ""too liberal"" with ""your money.""

With the comparison to Obama -- whose policies Hovde has sharply criticized -- Neumann tries to portray Hovde as a backer of big government.

Let’s see just how much support Hovde voiced for spending billions for high-speed trains and to bail out troubled banks.

High-speed rail

To back the high-speed rail part of Neumann’s claim, Neumann campaign manager Chip Englander cited the November 2008 edition of Hovde Industry Update, a newsletter published by one of Hovde’s financial services companies.

The publication date is important in understanding the context of what the newsletter says.

Even before Obama took office in January 2009, he was working with Democratic congressional leaders on an economic stimulus plan. What emerged, in February 2009, was a nearly $790 billion bill that included $282 billion in tax relief and $507 billion in spending, with about $48 billion for the Department of Transportation. (The estimate of the bill’s total cost has since been raised to $840 billion.)

The newsletter -- all eight pages were devoted to one article -- was headlined: ""Welcome to the government spending bubble.""

But far from welcoming government spending, the newsletter’s first paragraph ends with a warning:

""At the core of these problems"" in the U.S. financial system ""is the toxic mix of Wall Street and Washington, which first led to the Internet bubble, then to the credit and housing bubble, and now to what may become a governmental spending bubble at the worst possible time.""

The newsletter goes on at length to criticize actions by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury in banking. Then it turns to the stimulus, saying the stimulus ""needs to achieve the maximum effect and to address the root causes of this (financial) crisis.""

High-speed rail comes into play when the newsletter suggests stimulus money should be focused on ""targeted federal infrastructure projects"":

""Again, building high-speed, light rail systems on the East and West coasts would stimulate job creation, increase productivity for those people and companies that transact business up and down the coastlines, and vastly reduce fuel consumption, as more people opt to use mass transit rather than drive their own automobile. Obviously, achieving a material reduction in oil demand would help attack this country’s single greatest cause of our massive trade and capital account deficits. Lastly, these programs would provide tangible, long-lasting benefits to society.""

Hovde doesn’t mention spending billions, but it’s easy to see that even a single high-speed rail project on either coast could cost that much. The proposed Milwaukee-to-Madison high-speed line spurned by Gov. Scott Walker had been slated for $810 million in federal funds. And the $48 billion in stimulus received by the federal DOT included $8 billion for high-speed and ""inter-city rail programs.""

When we asked for a response from Hovde, his campaign spokesman, Sean Lansing, cited a July 2012 interview Hovde did with a Green Bay TV station. Hovde said the claim that he supported billions for spending for high-speed rail was ""totally false."" But then he acknowledged his newsletter did say that ""during the height of the financial crisis, if we feel it necessary to spend money on stimulus,"" the money could be spent on high-speed rail on the coasts.

We also found that in a March 2009 interview with CNBC-TV’s ""Squawk Box"" program, Hovde noted that he had previously advocated for spending stimulus money on high-speed rail.

So, at a point when it was clear there would be a stimulus bill, Hovde supported spending stimulus money on high-speed rail, which likely would involve billions of dollars.

But Neumann’s ad leaves out vital context from the newsletter: That Hovde opposed the stimulus money. He was arguing if there were a stimulus, it should be spent on projects that make an impact, such as high-speed rail on the East Coast. 

The ad also skips past the fact that these comments were made before Hovde was a candidate, presenting them as if he is an unabashed booster of spending as part of his campaign.

Bank bailouts

To back the part of the claim that Hovde supported billions ""to bail out banks,"" Englander cited a clip from a TV appearance in which Hovde says:

""Without question, I was an advocate from the get-go to inject capital into the banking system.""

This has some similar problems.

The clip comes from an earlier interview Hovde did on ""Squawk Box,"" in November 2008, about TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It was signed into law the previous month by President George W. Bush. Criticized by some Republicans as a bailout, the law authorized the U.S. Treasury to spend up to $700 billion to stabilize financial markets.

Hovde criticized TARP for several minutes, though he said ""something needed to be done."" Then one of the hosts asked him: ""Didn’t the government do something right by preventing the financial market from collapsing, by preventing the banking system from collapsing at some point?""

Hovde replied with the part of the quote that Neumann cites, then said more:

""Without question, I was an advocate from the get-go to inject capital into the banking system. But you should've done it on terms that were a little bit more punitive and required them to access private capital along with it, as well as putting the government's money -- taxpayer money -- in the most senior position.""

He added: ""If they would have structured it properly and forced the banks to go to the private sector, there was a lot of private sector money that, on the right terms, would have come in. And, yes, we needed to stabilize the system.""

In response, Hovde spokesman Lansing again cited the July 2012 Green Bay TV interview. Asked if he supported billions to bail out banks, Hovde said: ""I have been opposed to that from Day One."" He said he had written and given interviews in 2008 asserting that, ""if we needed to give money to these companies, then executives should have been replaced and the cost of the capital should have been higher.""

Like the high-speed rail part of Neumann’s claim, Neumann’s ad takes a partial statement and ignores critical context. It further muddies things by comparing Hovde to Obama, when the TARP proposal in question was done under Bush.

On the other hand, Neumann’s ad didn’t say Hovde supported TARP but rather that he supported billions to bail out banks. Hovde did express support for a taxpayer-funded bailout, albeit with an approach he asserted would better protect taxpayers.

Our rating

Neumann compared Hovde to Obama, saying Hovde ""supported billions in stimulus for high-speed rail"" and ""billions more to bail out banks.""

Hovde was critical of the stimulus plan, but did back high-speed rail as a spending option when it was clear the stimulus program would be created.

Similarly, Hovde didn’t back TARP, as the ad implies, but did favor taxpayer assistance provided in a different way.

Neumann’s claim is partially accurate, but takes Hovde’s statements out of context -- our definition of Half True.

Scott Garrett claims Affordable Care Act cuts Medicare funding, creates “rationing board”
","
For U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett, there is one way forward on health care: Congress must fully repeal the federal law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court this summer.

But to support that position the Republican congressman relies on some questionable facts.
""Even without the weight of this act, Medicare and Medicaid are already on the path to bankruptcy. With the Health Care Act, the situation is even worse. The president’s health care law raids Medicare by more than $500 billion and creates a Medicare rationing board — a group of 15 unelected bureaucrats — to slow the growth of Medicare spending,"" Garrett wrote in a July 29 opinion column published on NorthJersey.com.

Here, we’ll assess Garrett’s claims about the law’s impact on Medicare funding and spending.

In June, PolitiFact New Jersey gave Republican U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan a Mostly False for saying there are ""$500 billion in Medicare cuts required to pay for this flawed legislation.""

Garrett repeats that misleading talking point about the law, formally named the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but often called ObamaCare.

Medicare spending will continue to increase, just at a slower pace.

Because of changes in the law, growth in Medicare spending over 10 years will be more than $500 billion less than had been projected, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

That reduction -- the biggest portion of which comes from cutting annual increases in Medicare payments to medical providers -- will help offset other costs in the law.

Still, over the same decade, Medicare spending will increase.

Garrett also said in his column that the health care law creates a ""Medicare rationing board"" of ""15 unelected bureaucrats"" to ""slow the growth of Medicare spending."" Though there is some truth to that statement, it needs significant clarification. Specifically, the board is restricted from making any recommendations to ration care.

The health care law creates an Independent Payment Advisory Board with 15 members, who are appointed and must have expertise in health care..

The board -- a controversial provision of the law -- was formed in response to national criticism that legislators have been unable to rein in Medicare costs.

The group will offer recommendations to prevent Medicare spending from surpassing certain levels. If Congress fails to act on the board’s proposals, its changes are automatically implemented.

But the law forbids the board from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" including raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increasing deductibles. The board also can’t change Medicare eligibility requirements, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue.

But it can decrease government payments to health care providers for services and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending.

As PolitiFact noted in a previous fact-check, some may argue that since the board can reduce the money doctors receive for giving certain treatments to Medicare patients, its decisions could result in an indirect form of rationing. But the law clearly forbids the board from directly rationing care.

Our ruling

Garrett said that the ""president’s health care law raids Medicare by more than $500 billion and creates a Medicare rationing board — a group of 15 unelected bureaucrats — to slow the growth of Medicare spending.""

The national health care law does not cut funding for Medicare, though it does decrease projections for future spending growth. Spending on the program will continue to grow, but at a slower pace.

The law does create a 15-member board to prevent Medicare spending from exceeding certain growth targets, but the board is specifically forbidden from proposing any plans to ration care.

Overall, we rate this statement Mostly False.

Congressman: Nearly 900,000 veterans are unemployed
","
A recently posted YouTube video had your PolitiFact Georgia scribes worried about our men and women in uniform.

It showed U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop of Albany objecting to parts of a bill setting the budget for the U.S. Department of Defense. He said it weakened labor laws that protect veterans and other workers from discrimination.

Such changes would hit veterans hard. They’re already struggling to find work.  

""There are close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now,"" the Democrat said in the video posted July 23.

Is that correct? We contacted Bishop’s office for more information.

While the video was posted recently, the speech was made in December. Bishop’s motion to change the bill failed.  

Bishop’s press secretary, Maxwell Gigle, backed up the claim by sending us news releases from the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs and the congressman’s office.

Two cited the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official keeper of labor data, as the source of their numbers.

Each month, the agency conducts what’s called the Current Population Survey. This survey collects data on employment, earnings, work hours, demographics and related issues from about 60,000 households across the nation.

The survey includes questions designed to track the employment status of veterans, which it defines as men and women who previously served on active duty in the U.S. military and were civilians when the survey was conducted.

In 2011, an average of about 11.3 million veterans were in the workforce, according to the yearly report. Some 945,000 of them were out of work.

Veterans of the wars waged after the 9/11 attacks had the hardest time. About 12.1  percent of them were unemployed last year. By contrast, unemployment among all veterans averaged at about 8.3  percent.

The number of unemployed veterans has since dropped to 806,000, according to the BLS’ June 2012 figures. That’s 7.4 percent of the veteran workforce.

When Bishop made his speech, the latest data available was from November, when 832,000  veterans were unemployed.

Veterans are faring better than U.S. workers as a whole. In June, the unemployment rate for all workers stood at 8.2 percent, according to the BLS.

In conclusion, Bishop said in his speech before Congress that there were ""close to 900,000 unemployed veterans in America right now."" This number is a bit lower than the yearly average and higher than the latest unemployment figures available at the time.

His statement rates a True on the Truth-O-Meter.",/factchecks/2012/aug/03/sanford-bishop/congressman-nearly-900000-veterans-are-unemployed/

Both parties are guilty, as PolitiFact has noted repeatedly, but today, it’s the National Republican Congressional Committee’s turn. Consider what the NRCC said on July 30, in an apparent attempt to gain senior votes:

Congresswoman Betty Sutton ""voted to destroy Medicare.""

No, Sutton did not. This is a bit like the earth-is-flat argument, put to rest hundreds of years ago. PolitiFact has been through several iterations of the Medicare claim, voiced in variations by both parties, but here’s the thing: People are still using it.

The NRCC claim is based on Sutton’s 2010 vote to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which you might know as ""Obamacare."" The act, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, aims to make health care readily available to uninsured Americans. But it also slows the rate at which Medicare will grow over the next decade. Medicare is the government program that provides health insurance to seniors, and a number of experts say its growth rate is unsustainable.

So here is what will happen to spending on Medicare because of the Affordable Care Act. Its cost will grow $7.1 trillion over a decade, according to Congressional Budget Office projections previously reviewed by PolitiFact.

You read that right. It will grow.

Without the Affordable Care Act, Medicare spending would grow even more, by an additional $500 billion. The difference means the rate of growth will be slowed by about 7 percent.

With $500 billion less, you’d think that Medicare might have to scale back its ambitions or services. President Barack Obama’s administration says the savings will come from eliminating waste and duplication. Savings also will come from a program called Medicare Advantage, which provided extra money to private insurers in hopes that they would expand their coverage to more rural areas. That didn’t happen, so the government says it wants to stop giving them extra money and will grade Advantage programs -- and give or withhold bonuses -- based on effectiveness.

Reasonable people can be suspicious as to how, exactly, this will play out. Some Medicare Advantage patients have enjoyed a generous level of government benefits, and they fear they will lose some.

But the CBO has been clear: Medicare spending will grow. The Affordable Care Act has extra money for prevention services, and seniors are getting a break on out-of-pocket expenses for their prescription drugs.

OK, don’t believe the government. Skepticism is healthy and sometimes deserved. Now  consider that Sutton, a Democratic congresswoman from Copley Township, voted for the Affordable Care Act.

Does that mean that she ""voted to destroy Medicare,"" as the NRCC said in its news release July 30?

We asked NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill about the claim, since Prill sent the email to reporters. Prill cited, among other things, a Washington Post articlein 2010 that described $500 billion worth of ""cuts"" to Medicare under the health law.

But the Washington Post’s own Fact Checker column has been over this repeatedly, and has saidthe characterization of ""cuts"" is an ""oldie but goodie."" (The Post also said, ""Someone must be falling for this stuff, however, or else it would not keep getting repeated."")

Prill also cited a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in 2011 that referred to health care ""rationing"" from an unelected 15-member Medicare advisory panel. The piece said that this Independent Payment Advisory Board,  to be appointed by the president by 2014 to make recommendations on controlling Medicare costs, could ""throw granny over the cliff"" if Medicare isn’t reformed.

Granny doesn’t want to go over the cliff, assuredly. But Prill’s third piece of backup seems to soften that likelihood.

Prill cited a story last March from Bloomberg BNAabout a House of Representatives committee hearing in which health experts discussed the Medicare advisory panel’s power. They said the panel’s real power will be limited, leaving members few choices other than to recommend cutting fees that doctors earn by treating Medicare patients. Doctors in turn will limit the number of Medicare patients they see, stop taking new ones or quit practicing, one witness said.

We’re not sure if that’s the same as throwing granny over the cliff. But that very argument -- that doctors will stop taking Medicare patients or quit -- is voiced every year right now, because of what has been a regular failure by Congress to assure physician reimbursements. Granny’s doctor is tired of this annual game, and says so regularly. Yet this plays out as often as the buzzards return to Hinckley, Ohio.

Might Medicare change? It’s possible. If you are in an Advantage plan, you might want to ask your insurer a lot of questions or look at other coverage options.

But destroying Medicare is strong medicine, and it goes far beyond the inconvenience of changing coverage. Sutton did not prescribe it.

In fairness, both parties play this game. Sutton falsely accused her Republican opponent, Rep. Jim Renacci, of voting to ""end Medicare"" because he supported Republican budgets that would privatize the program and provide vouchers. PolitiFact Ohio gave Sutton a Falseon the Truth-O-Meter for making the claim.

That doesn’t make the GOP claim against her any more accurate.

Republican Jewish Coalition says half of recent college grads ""can't find a job""
","
The Republican Jewish Coalition recently launched a $6.5 million series of ads targeting voters who have ""buyers remorse"" about voting for President Barack Obama in 2008. Florida will be seeing these ads in heavy rotation: About a quarter of the ad spending is being earmarked for the Sunshine State, which is home to a large population of Jewish senior citizens whose support is highly sought after by both political parties.

One of the ads features comments by Michael Goldstein, who is identified on screen as a ""Democrat. Jewish. Voted for Obama."" Goldstein criticizes several aspects of Obama’s presidency, including several concerns about his policy toward the Middle East. But Goldstein also takes on Obama’s economic record.

At one point, Goldstein said that ""one out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job."" We wondered if that was correct, so we looked into it.

We reached out to the coalition, but they did not get back to us. However, we found some research that we believe was the source of the comment. It was an article by the Associated Press that got wide play when it hit the wires on April 22, 2012. The headline, at least in some publications, was, ""In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed.""

The article is based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs.

Here’s how the AP summarized the findings:

""A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ...

""About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year.""

Upon reading this, we concluded that the speaker in the ad had garbled the statistic a bit.

Rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job, the reality is that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren’t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed and about half are in jobs that don’t require a college degree.

To make sure our interpretation was correct, we checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research. Sum agreed with our analysis and said ""the numbers being cited in the ad are not correct.""

The ad would have been more accurate if the claim had been phrased this way: ""One out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job or can’t find one that requires a college degree.""

We also think there’s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. Viewers shouldn’t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which is currently at 8.5 percent. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities.

According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- ""before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields."" That’s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets.

Still, there’s reason to be concerned about the current rate: At 53.6 percent, it’s the highest it’s been in at least 11 years.

Our ruling

The ad claims that ""one out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job."" That’s not quite right -- according to Sum’s research, about a quarter of recent college grads literally can’t find a job, while another quarter have found a job, but one that doesn’t require a college degree.

Still, the actual statistic does support the ad’s point -- that the employment picture for college grads is grimmer than at any time in more than a decade. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/02/republican-jewish-coalition/republican-jewish-coalition-says-half-recent-colle/

Sandy Adams says John Mica voted for $10 trillion in debt
","
The federal debt is at the center of a bruising interparty war between Republican Reps. Sandy Adams and John Mica.

Adams, a freshman from Orlando, is using Mica’s 20-year voting record to paint him as a Washington insider steeped in a culture of excessive spending.

""Mica voted to borrow $10 trillion,"" an Adams mailer claims.

The mailer’s flip-side contains the following text beside an overdue bill: ""We got the bill for Mica’s spending spree. Over $30,000 for every man, woman and child in America.""

Indeed, the amount of gross debt has increased by more than $10 trillion since 1993, when Mica started his first term in the House. The debt increased from $4.17 trillion on Jan. 4, 1993 (his second day in office) to $15.87 trillion as of July 31, 2012, leaving a difference of $11.7 trillion. Another measure, using debt owed by the public, gives a difference of $8 trillion.

So the number is right, but is this a fair attack?

Not entirely.

The debt ceiling vote is a routine but often politicized procedure in Congress, with the party in charge voting yes and the opposition voting no. Since 2001, Congress has voted 11 times to increase the cap because of ""persistent budget deficits and additions to federal trust funds,"" according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. (You can see the increases in the debt limit since 2001 here. Click on Table 7.3)

Mica has voted against some debt limit increases, particularly ones that were part of laws aimed at preventing collapse of the housing market and banks, as well as the economic stimulus.

But Mica has also voted to raise the debt ceiling since taking office in 1993. Mica spokesman Alan Byrd said five favorable votes came ""in time of war, after 9/11 and when he and Congress balanced the budget."" 

Interestingly, his most recent vote -- the controversial August 2011 deal that increased the national debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion -- also snagged support from Adams. Add that to Mica’s other votes to raise the debt ceiling since 1996, and the increases total $3.95 trillion, not $10 trillion.

Bruce Bartlett, an economist who blogs for the New York Times, said the bills Adams spokeswoman Lisa Boothe sent us as evidence appeared randomly selected. Bartlett previously held positions in under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

""None appear to be tax cuts. Several are debt limit increases. It is fundamentally stupid and dishonest to claim that voting for a couple of different bills were THE reason the debt increased,"" he said. ""This claim is beyond ridiculous.""

We wanted to look at the bigger picture. Yes, Mica has voted to raise the debt ceiling, and the campaigns can quibble over the total amount of increases he supported. The more important thing for voters to understand is Mica, like many other members of Congress, voted for some of the policies that explain our bleak debt situation today.  
Some of the largest factors driving the growth of the debt over the last 10 years come down to three things: spending on the unpaid wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 (and extensions of 2003 and 2010), and President Barack Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus package. 
In 2001, nonpartisan economists at the Congressional Budget Office expected the government would pay off its debt by 2006 and have a surplus by now. That clearly didn’t happen, so the agency evaluated in 2011 how much of the debt could be attributed to legislative and economic factors.

The breakdown: $8.5 trillion driven by legislation such as the Bush tax cuts, the stimulus, and the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, for imperiled banks, and $3.2 trillion for economic reasons.

Mica -- like many Republicans, including Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and fellow Florida Rep. C. W. Bill Young -- voted for the Bush tax cuts and the wars. The Washington Post breaks down how current members of Congress voted on these three areas in this 2011 interactive graphic.

While Mica’s votes play a role, there’s blame to be shared with his colleagues. And 75 percent of all members of the current Congress voted for at least one of these drivers, according to the Post’s 2011 analysis.

How much of the legislation passed within the past 10 or so years led to the debt we have now? A report from the nonpartisan Pew Fiscal Analysis Initiative determined about 68 percent of the growth in federal debt between 2001 and 2011 could be attributed to new legislation. Of that, 40 percent was the result of Bush tax cuts. The remaining 60 percent was from increased spending on the wars, the stimulus, the bank bailouts and Medicare Part D.

The debt has dramatically risen since the onset of the country’s recession in 2007 and 2008, rising to about 70 percent as a share of the economy, said Jason Peuquet, research director at Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

""Legislation contributes to that, but also a big, huge part is the strength of the economy,"" Peuquet said, ""and for that it’s much harder to assign credit or blame.""

One humongous challenge not being addressed in campaign materials is how to reduce the debt before it spins out of control, Peuquet said. It won’t take long (think 2020s) for that to happen, he said, if this path continues.

""By that measure, no lawmaker has been successful, because we haven’t enacted debt reduction legislation that puts us on a successful path,"" he said.

Our ruling

Adams said Mica ""voted to borrow $10 trillion."" What she meant, her spokeswoman says, is the debt has increased by $10 trillion since he took office, an increase made possible by his sporadic votes to allow growth of the debt ceiling. 
We found his votes on the debt ceiling don't really tell the whole story. More importantly, we think, is the fact that he voted for some of the policies that caused the need for debt ceiling votes in the first place. Still, it takes more than one member of Congress to drive the debt up by the trillions.

Sarah Palin says 1 in 7 American families is on food stamps
","Shortly before Ted Cruz won the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, he got a star-power boost from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin at a get-out-the-vote rally north of Houston.

Firing up the crowd in her July 27, 2012, speech in The Woodlands, Palin touched on some claims PolitiFact has recently addressed, plus one we haven’t: ""One in seven American families are on food stamps.""

Based on past PolitiFact work, Palin was batting better than .500 on these statements:  
So how’d she do with her food stamp claim? Another hit, according to the experts we asked.

U.S. Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Alyn Kiel told us by email that Palin was correct -- in fact, one in seven individual Americans is on food stamps, aka the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kiel cautioned against translating SNAP’s term ""households"" to ""families.""

""There is no single definition of a household,"" Kiel told us. ""The Census Bureau defines it one way (anyone who lives under the same roof together); SNAP defines it another (more strictly as a group that purchases and prepares food together, so you could, for example, have a household of one, which you cannot by the Census Bureau definition). The Census Bureau defines families even more strictly than households.""

J.C. Dwyer, state policy director of the Texas Food Bank Network, told us by email, ""Most of the time, a ‘household’ is roughly equivalent to a ‘family,’ and so contains more than one person. However, a single individual living alone is also considered a ‘household.’

""That's why one in seven individuals benefit from the program, and one in five households,"" Dwyer said.

He sent us USDA's monthly report for May 2012, which shows that 22.3 million U.S. households encompassing 46.5 million individuals were on SNAP. He calculated the ""one in seven"" and ""one in five"" ratios using the U.S. Census population clock and average household size in 2010 (2.59 people), he said.

Dwyer cautioned against tying increases in SNAP recipients to any specific president or government policy, noting that the national food bank network Feeding America has reported SNAP participation mirrors unemployment.  

An April 19, 2012, report from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said that, nationwide, ""Spending on SNAP benefits more than doubled between 2007 and 2011."" Charts from the report show an increase in participation after the recession began in 2007; CBO predicts the increase will peak in 2014.    In Texas, SNAP participation has also risen compared to 2007, but has held fairly constant since early 2010.

Jonathan Lewis, a specialist in food policy for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin, emailed us a link to state data showing that the number of Texans on SNAP has remained within the range of 3.5 million to 3.7 million since March 2010, when it was at 3.4 million. The total was 2.3 million in July 2007 and 3.6 million in July 2012.

Lewis told us, ""Palin’s statement about one in seven families on SNAP in the U.S. is correct besides her use of families rather than households. However, I think the public views them as the same.""

Lewis included a link to the Texas Administrative Code’s definitions of families and households. For purposes of the SNAP program, the code defines a household as the person or persons included in a single SNAP case by state Health and Human Services. A family, the code says, is defined as a group of relatives living together and meeting certain other conditions.

The state data show 1.5 million cases, or households, on SNAP in Texas for July 2012.

"['New Jersey', 'Pensions', 'Shirley Turner']","
New Jersey judges’ pension system is the most underfunded, while justices earn some of the richest benefits, senator says
","
Take a severely underfunded pension system, combined with some of the richest benefits paid to public employees, and according to state Sen. Shirley Turner, you’ve got a ""recipe for disaster.""

That’s how Turner characterized the retirement system for New Jersey judges when state legislators returned to Trenton this week to ensure jurists contribute more toward their pensions and health benefits.

The state Supreme Court recently ruled those higher payments unconstitutional. To counter that ruling, the state Legislature on Monday approved legislation placing a question on the November ballot to amend the state constitution and allow the greater contributions.

""The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees,"" Turner (D-Mercer), who sponsored the legislation, said during a speech on the Senate floor.

""That mixture of underfunding and high benefit is a sure recipe for disaster, both for the jurists promised the pension and also our hard-working taxpayers who would be on the hook if this system fails.""

As PolitiFact New Jersey learned, Turner’s recipe isn’t missing any ingredients.

Of the five major pension funds, the Judicial Retirement System has the lowest percentage of funds necessary to meet future pension obligations, according to the latest data from the state Department of the Treasury.

At the same time, judges, on average, are receiving the largest annual pensions of all public employees in those systems, according to Treasury data.

First, let’s address how the Judicial Retirement System is underfunded.

As of July 1, 2011, the system had about $305 million in assets, but had accrued nearly $586 million in long-term liabilities. In other words, the state only had roughly 52 percent of the money needed to fulfill its obligations.

That percentage represents the lowest amount of the five major pension funds.

Now, we’ll talk about the pension amounts paid to judges.

The average annual benefit among all retirees in the Judicial Retirement System was $90,837 as of July 1, 2011, and more than $100,000 for those who retired in the preceding year. Those pensions represent the highest benefits among public employees in the five major systems.

By comparison, the Public Employees’ Retirement System, which includes both state and local government employees, provided an average annual benefit of $22,486 among all state retirees and $32,495 for new state retirees.

Our ruling

In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Turner said: ""The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees.""

The senator’s claim is on target. The Judicial Retirement System has about 52 percent of the funds needed to meet future pension obligations, marking the lowest amount of the five major pension funds. 
Retired judges also receive the largest annual pensions of the five funds with certain average benefits exceeding $100,000. 
We rate the statement True.
