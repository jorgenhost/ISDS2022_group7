The Kanye West Wing? No. Those Kentucky election tallies aren’t real.
","Kanye West is on the Kentucky ballot as an independent candidate for president but election results showing him leading Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden by more than 10,000 votes are not real.  But a video of the rapper that’s being shared on social media gives a different impression.  ""19%, 40,000 votes,"" West says in the video. ""Kentucky. Get the West Wing ready! Let’s go! Let’s go!"" The post also shows an image of what's described as ""President Kentucky results"" with ""100% of precincts reporting.""

Ukrainian’s firm paid Rep. Mucarsel-Powell’s husband, but attack goes too far
","Claims of corruption continue to mark a competitive South Florida race for the House, where Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is being challenged by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez, a Republican. One of the latest is a guilt-by-association attack on Mucarsel-Powell. It’s over ties that her husband, lawyer Robert Powell, had with a Ukrainian oligarch, Ihor Kolomoisky.  The attack comes in an ad shot in black and white from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that works to elect Republicans to the House. ""This town is far too familiar with violent thugs,"" the narrator states, as photos of authoritarian leaders Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and Cuba’s Fidel Castro appear on the screen.  ""And Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is far too familiar with violent warlord Ihor Kolomoisky. Mucarsel-Powell’s family received more than $700,000 from Kolomoisky’s firm. He’s been accused of embezzlement, bribery and murder."" Robert Powell was paid some $700,000 while previously working for a firm partly owned by Kolomoisky. But Powell has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with various allegations against Kolomoisky. And Kolomoisky doesn’t have the same stature as Maduro or Castro. Mucarsel-Powell is finishing her first term in Washington. Gimenez has served as mayor of Florida’s most populous county since 2011.  The Cook Political Report rates the race a toss-up. It is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate races up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. The incumbent attacked Gimenez for extending a contract to a firm with ties to his sons; we rated it Half True. Also Half True was her claim that Gimenez boosted his own pay and pension, and kept a taxpayer-funded Mercedes-Benz. Kolomoisky is one of Ukraine’s richest men, controlling businesses in many sectors of the Ukrainian economy, including metals, energy and media. Widely seen as Ukraine’s most powerful figure outside of government, according to the New York Times, he spent millions of dollars to field and equip fighters and helped stop the Russian advance into the country in 2014. But his stature is not on the level of the two nation leaders invoked in the ad.   Castro, the late Cuban leader, ruled his country for nearly half a century, until stepping aside with illness in 2006. He was ""among the world’s most repressive leaders"" who executed or jailed thousands of political opponents, according to the Washington Post’s obituary. In Venezuela, a UN investigation in September concluded that unlawful executions, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture ""amounted to crimes against humanity."" Maduro, who has been president since 2013, likely ""side-tracked the chain of command to ensure the commission of crimes,"" the report said. The Daily Beast reported in 2018, during Murcasel-Powell’s first run for her seat, that Robert Powell spent much of the previous 10 years as general counsel for companies owned at least in part by Kolomoisky, including Optima Acquisitions, which acquired companies in the United States, and Felman Trading, a New Jersey global supplier of manganese and ferroalloys.  Kolomoisky has been accused of bribery and embezzlement in recent years by business partners and government authorities, the Miami Herald reported. The allegations also include involvement in contract killings.  Robert Powell responded to the Daily Beast story at the time with a statement from his wife’s campaign, declaring: ""I have never worked for, represented, answered to, or received any payment from Mr. Kolomoisky at any time."" But Powell received $695,000 in salary in 2016 and 2017 from Felman Trading, Mucarsel-Powell’s 2017 federal financial disclosure form shows.  Mucarsel-Powell’s campaign confirmed to PolitiFact that Robert Powell was paid that much over the two years. Kolomoisky is in more legal trouble today — but there is no indication Powell is involved. In August, the U.S. Justice Department brought allegations against Kolomoisky and another Ukrainian oligarch, Gennadiy Boholiubov. As the previous primary owners of PrivatBank, one of the largest banks in Ukraine, they are accused of embezzlement and defrauding the bank of billions of dollars, from 2008 through 2016. That was during the period when Robert Powell worked as the general counsel. Two other associates in Miami created entities, usually under some variation of the name Optima, to launder the money and buy hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate and businesses across the United States, according to the civil forfeiture complaints filed in Miami. Kolomoisky and his associates bought at least 22 properties, including a skyscraper in Cleveland, a shuttered Motorola facility in Illinois and the former headquarters of Mary Kay Cosmetics in Dallas, according to a September article by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. They ""left a trail of empty, boarded-up buildings, unpaid property taxes, dangerous factory conditions, unemployed workers, and at least four steel mills that filed for bankruptcy,"" according to the article. But Powell is not named in either of the Justice Department complaints. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with what is alleged in the complaints, the Miami Herald reported. Making a guilt-by-association attack, the Congressional Leadership Fund says Mucarsel-Powell's family received $700,000 from the firm of ""violent warlord Ihor Kolomoisky,"" comparing him to Fidel Castro and Nicolás Maduro.  The comparison of the Ukrainian oligarch to authoritarian leaders of two nations is a stretch. Mucarsel-Powell’s husband, Robert Powell, was paid $695,000 by a company partly owned by Kolomoisky, but he has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with allegations made against Kolomoisky.

No proof that Jaime Harrison was left off touch-screen machines
","South Carolina Democrats are eager to see if Jaime Harrison, with a massive fundraising haul, can pull off an upset of Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in the red state.  But a Facebook post suggests — without evidence — that something nefarious is happening with the ballots.  ""Jaime Harrison is being left off of SC ballots,"" states the Facebook post. ""South Carolinians who are voting ‘straight Democratic’ have noted that Jaime Harrison isn’t included on their ballots. Voters have had to manually go through and select individual names."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The South Carolina Election Commission had received complaints from the state Democratic Party that some voters said Harrison’s name was missing when they cast ballots on touchscreen machines at early voting. Chris Whitmire, a spokesman for the commission, said the state consulted with local elections officials and checked out the complaints and found no proof of problems. Whitmire forwarded to us the email correspondence between Shaundra Young Scott, a voter protection lawyer for the state Democratic Party, and Whitmire between Oct. 12 and 14. ""We have had multiple reports that Jaime Harrison's name is missing from the ballot,"" Scott wrote Oct. 12, citing complaints from voters in Florence and Georgetown counties. In an email the next day, Scott said that the Democrats had reports from two voters who said they were unable to vote for Harrison when they voted straight party and had to try multiple times. Scott wrote in a subsequent email that a similar situation occurred with a straight party voter in Beaufort who had to try three times before Harrison’s name was included. It wasn’t clear from the emails exactly how many voters had made allegations, but Scott told us in an interview it was a handful. We spoke to Whitmire on a video call so he could show us how voting works on touch-screen machines in South Carolina, one of a handful of states that offer what is known as straight party voting. Roughly half of South Carolina voters generally opt for straight party voting, where they can select all of a party’s candidates in partisan races without having to select them individually. Here’s how it works: The voter sees a screen that allows the voter to choose their party. (A voter who doesn’t want to vote straight party hits the ""next"" button.) If a voter chooses Democrat, then the party’s candidates automatically appear  In this case, when the voter is on the Senate screen, Harrison’s name automatically appears with a green check mark. But if the voter touches Harrison’s name, then his name is deselected.  Writer Jennifer Cohn tweeted an image of what deselecting Harrison’s name would look like. The machine warns voters if they haven’t chosen a candidate in a race. The touch screen has a review screen at the end, and then prints out a card that shows the voter’s choices. If a voter sees that their selection for Senate wasn’t on the card, the voter can tell the poll manager that it’s wrong, and then the voter starts over. (The printed card is scanned for tabulation. Only one card per voter is ultimately put through the scanner.) State officials contacted the election directors in Florence and Georgetown counties, and neither one was aware of any voter seeing a ballot without Harrison’s name, Whitmire told Scott in an email. Whitmire wrote that one possible explanation is that some straight-ticket Democratic voters are touching Harrison’s name to make sure they’re voting for him and end up unintentionally deselecting his name. ""In this situation, when the voter reached the review screen, they would see no selection, and if they printed their ballot they would also not see Harrison’s name,"" Whitmire wrote. ""Of course, this situation could happen with any partisan candidate."" We asked Scott if it was possible that voters were unintentionally deselecting Harrison’s name.  ""I don’t want to speculate. We are still investigating and trying to figure that out,"" she said. The party has poll watchers inside polling sites. So far, she said, no poll watchers told her that they had seen a situation with Harrison’s name missing from ballots, but she has asked them to be on the lookout. We also contacted the Harrison campaign and asked them to send any evidence they had that Harrison’s name was omitted from the ballots.  ""We are not currently aware of the problem you described,"" said Guy King, a Harrison spokesman. ""South Carolinians who experience any difficulty trying to vote should call 1-855-785-0222 or go to VOTEBLUESC.com."" Harrison is a former lobbyist who became the first African American to run the South Carolina Democratic Party. Some polls have shown the race as close while others have shown Graham with a lead. Harrison raised $57 million in the most recent quarter, shattering the quarterly record for a Senate candidate set by Beto O’Rourke in Texas in 2018.  RELATED: Lindsey Graham’s Truth-O-Meter from PolitiFact A Facebook post said ""Jaime Harrison is being left off of South Carolina ballots."" We found no evidence that Harrison’s name has been left off the ballot, and Harrison’s campaign told us they know of no evidence showing that, either. Elections officials investigated and said voters using touch screens may be accidentally deselecting Harrison after voting straight-party, but it’s possible to fix such an error before casting a final vote.  We rate this statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3A6F00>],/factchecks/2020/oct/16/facebook-posts/no-proof-jaime-harrison-was-left-touch-screen-mach/

Cuomo's claim on nursing home deaths not whole story
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo continues to be under fire for his administration’s handling of the novel coronavirus in nursing homes, where residents are vulnerable to serious illness or death from the virus.  In a call with reporters, Cuomo was asked again, this time by the Finger Lakes Daily News, about how his administration dealt with nursing homes, specifically a controversial March 25 order, rescinded in May, regarding patients leaving hospitals and going to nursing homes. Nursing homes felt pressure to accept coronavirus patients from hospitals following the March 25 order. Cuomo pushed back on what he considered the premise of the question.   ""You look at the nursing home deaths in this state,"" Cuomo said. ""Do you know what number we are by percentage before you made that statement? We're No. 46 out of 50 states, and we had the worst problem, and we're 46th in terms of percentage of deaths in nursing homes.""  The way that New York has counted COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes has come under scrutiny, and we wondered whether Cuomo is correct.  We reached out to Cuomo’s press office, and spokesperson Jason Conwall directed us to a New York Times data analysis of deaths in long-term care facilities by state.  In the most recent data, published Sept. 16, nursing homes accounted for larger shares of COVID-19 deaths in 41 other states and the District of Columbia - not 45, though Conwall said Cuomo was referencing previous iterations of the Times' data.  The Internet Archive showed a previous version of the list making New York 45th.  We reached out to KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan source of health information, to ask about Cuomo’s claim. Priya Chidambaram, a policy analyst for the foundation, tracks data about COVID-19 deaths and long-term care. She told us that one of the key differences between New York and other states is that New York excludes deaths that were not in a nursing home. Nursing home residents who develop serious illness and need to be treated in a hospital, and do not recover, are not counted as part of the state’s nursing home deaths, she said. State data is not comparable because of the different ways states report these deaths. Some states include various long-term care facilities in their data, while others just include nursing homes. Other states report residents and staff, some just report residents. The best comparable data for analyzing nursing home deaths comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Chidambaram said. In its data, which uses a different metric, New York ranks in the middle - not among the lowest - for the share of nursing home deaths among its population of nursing home residents. CMS ranks states by deaths per 1,000 nursing home residents. New York had 50.5 deaths per 1,000 residents, ranking 20th on a list of 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of the week ending Sept. 27. The federal government began requiring this data in May, long after the pandemic began in New York. New York's health commissioner, Howard Zucker, has defended the administration's approach, and said the state does not want to double count deaths - attributing a single death to a nursing home and a hospital, and that he wants to only release data that is completely accurate. A spokesperson for the department has said that the state has been a leader in releasing facility-level data on deaths.  Cuomo said 45 other states had higher portions of nursing home residents as a share of the total coronavirus deaths in a state. He was referencing an analysis from the New York Times, which puts New York near the bottom, 43rd in a list of 46 states and the District of Columbia, with five states left off the list because of insufficient data.  But the Times cautions readers about making comparisons among states because of the different ways each level of government and each facility reports the data. Cuomo's claim contains an element of truth: There is a New York Times database and it includes death numbers for nursing home patients across the nation. But the governor left out some critical facts that would give a different impression about how New York compares with other states for how nursing home residents are faring. New York counts deaths that occur in a nursing home, leaving out those deaths of residents in hospitals. And there's inconsistencies in the reported data that ends up in the database among states and facilities.  According to federal data, which calculates deaths per 1,000 nursing home residents, regardless of where they die, New York lands near the middle.  We rate his claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BCC540>],/factchecks/2020/oct/16/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-claim-nursing-home-deaths-not-whole-story/

He criticized the Trump administration ""and some of its most ardent right-wing supporters from the Ku Klux Klan"" and the ""alt-right"" who he said are trying to undermine the progress the country has made in achieving equality.   Around the 20:12 mark, he said this (emphasis ours): ""And using religion or culture as a license to discriminate, demonizing the community and individuals to score political points, is no more justifiable around the world than it is here at home and our policies should reflect that.

He was referring to a ""small percentage"" of Americans whom he describes as ""forces of intolerance"" oppressing the LGBTQ community.  While he did say that those people have an ally in the White House, Biden’s comments, taken as a whole and not a soundbite, make it clear that he is not broadly targeting Americans who support the president.

Biden’s tax plan would not impose 40% capital gains tax on most home sales
","If Joe Biden wins this year’s presidential election, you may have a big tax bill coming your way should you decide to sell your home — at least, that’s according to some folks on social media. An Oct. 12 text post on Facebook claims the Democratic presidential candidate would dramatically increase capital gains taxes, affecting anyone who sells their home. ""Biden’s capital gains tax means that when you sell your home you’ll owe taxes of 40% of your profit!"" the post says over a background of poop emoji. ""Let that sink in."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The source of the post is a Trump-supporting real estate agent based in Eugene, Ore. We reached out to her for evidence to back up the post, but we haven’t heard back. So we looked into it. (Screenshot from Facebook) The post is wrong — several fact-checkers have debunked it. Biden would increase capital gains taxes for Americans who make more than $1 million per year. Those taxes apply to home sales if sellers make hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit. First, let’s review what capital gains taxes are. A capital gain is the difference between what someone paid for an asset, also known as the ""basis,"" and what they sold it for. The capital gains tax is the main federal tax that the Internal Revenue Service imposes on real estate. For example, if you purchased a house for $250,000 and sold it for $300,000, your capital gain would be $50,000. However, the IRS typically lets sellers deduct up to $250,000 in capital gains if they’re single and $500,000 if they’re married and file joint tax returns, so you probably wouldn’t owe anything. Biden has not proposed changing those exemptions. He also hasn’t advocated raising taxes on Americans making less than $400,000 per year, as we’ve reported.  On his official campaign website, Biden says he would double the long-term capital gains rate from 20% to 39.6%. His administration would use that money to help pay for Biden’s health care plan. However, the 39.6% tax rate would only apply to those making more than $1 million per year. That means Biden’s proposal would not affect the vast majority of people — 8.5% of Americans make more than $200,000 annually.  According to the Internal Revenue Service, the capital gains tax rate ""is no higher than 15% for most individuals."" ""Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than $78,750,"" the agency says. ""A capital gain rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is $78,750 or more but less than $434,550 for single; $488,850 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); $461,700 for head of household, or $244,425 for married filing separately."" What does that look like in practice? Let’s break it down. Let’s pretend you’re married and file taxes jointly. You and your partner’s combined annual income is $650,000, putting your household in the IRS’ top federal income tax bracket. You decide to sell your house, which you purchased for $400,000. To your surprise, you get your full asking price of $700,000. RELATED: No, Joe Biden doesn’t want to impose a federal tax on homes Your capital gain would be $300,000 on the home — several times higher than the nationwide average. Since your household’s annual income is less than $1 million, Biden’s proposed capital gains tax rate would not apply to you. And since you’re married and file taxes jointly, you probably wouldn’t owe the IRS capital gains taxes anyway.  So in what real estate scenario would Biden’s proposed capital gains tax rate kick in?  First, your household would have to make more than $1 million per year. Then, if you’re single, you’d have to sell your house for at least a $250,000 profit. If you’re married and jointly file taxes, you’d have to make $500,000 on a home sale. For the vast majority of Americans, that is unlikely — and far from a blanket tax on home sales, as the Facebook post says. We reached out to the Biden campaign for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. The Facebook post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BF8880>],/factchecks/2020/oct/16/facebook-posts/bidens-tax-plan-would-not-impose-40-capital-gains-/

Republican super PAC misleads on Hoadley’s blog posts in new ad condemned as homophobic
","In a new TV ad, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC dedicated to securing a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, attacks Democratic congressional candidate Jon Hoadley. ""Jon Hoadley's judgment is disturbing,"" the ad claims. Hoadley currently represents Michigan’s 60th District in the state’s House of Representatives and he’s trying to unseat incumbent Republican Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, who was first elected to Congress in 1986. CLF’s ad inaccurately characterizes blog posts Hoadley wrote in 2004 and 2005, over 15 years ago, when he was a college student at Michigan State University. CLF claims that what Hoadley wrote was ""sexist"" and ""creepy."" The ad distorts other posts Hoadley wrote, claiming that Hoadley ""wanted to learn about crystal meth"" and ""wrote that his sexual partners were his victims."" Hoadley’s blog, which has since been deleted, contained some insensitive comments but doesn’t substantiate CLF’s characterizations. In a statement to the New York Post which published a piece on the blog, Hoadley’s campaign said the posts were ""bad college poetry."" In a Facebook video released Aug. 10, Hoadley issued an apology: ""I said things 16 years ago that I would never say today that aren’t reflective of who I am, and so for folks that I hurt with my words, I’m sorry."" Hoadley is 37 years-old and the first openly LGBTQ person to run for Congress in Michigan. The LGBTQ Victory Fund, a national organization dedicated to electing LGBTQ candidates, accused CLF of using harmful tropes about gay men. CLF press secretary Will Reinert defended the ad in an email, reiterating its claim that the blog shows lack of judgment. A closer look at each of the ad’s claims in context showed that CLF’s ad is inaccurate and misleading. In a blog entry dated Jun. 20, 2005, when Hoadley was 21 years-old and had just completed his junior year in college, Hoadley recapped a weekend in D.C., including going out to straight bars with two friends. ""Glad I went…but my straight fix has been satisfied for a while. I’m not going to lie: breeder=weird/bad dancers. Disagree if you want—you’re just deluding yourself,"" Hoadley wrote. According to Urban Dictionary, a ""breeder"" is a derogatory term to describe straight people. The term can refer to either straight men or straight women. The term is contemptuous, but it’s not sexist and Hoadley wasn’t using it to describe straight women exclusively. This needs context. In a blog entry dated May 23, 2005 Hoadley wrote, ""Tonight I went to an event at a leather bar. By myself. To learn about crystal meth. Don't do meth."" Hoadley told an LGBTQ news website that the event was an information meeting about meth’s impact on the LGBTQ community. This is misleading. Before sharing a poem titled ""Burned By Love"" on Jun. 14, 2005, Hoadley told his readers the post was fictional: ""Wrote this awhile ago...looking for some feedback. BTW, sometimes fiction is the best way to tell truth — so don’t go getting any ideas about me."" The poem, which appears to be about the search for connection, contains the lines, ""I turn to my little black book that’s commonly called a cell phone. My fingers walk as I talk to the latest victim of my sexual conquest."" CLF’s claim does not disclose Hoadley’s note that this was not about him. This is inaccurate. In a Aug. 12, 2004 blog post, Hoadley shared what appeared to be a jovial conversation he had with a friend who said that he had a secret desire to be a flower girl. Toward the end of the conversation, Hoadley wrote ""just don't let them make you look too fresh...you know how hoochie they try to make the flower girl,"" using a derogatory word to describe a sexually promiscuous woman. Hoadley’s friend responded, ""I KNOW! I mean I shudder everytime I see a four year old wearing a thong."" Hoadley did not write about a four-year-old wearing a thong as CLF claims. Nevertheless, CLF called the comment ""creepy"" in its ad but both Hoadley and his friend noted their revulsion to sexualizing children. Drawing from posts Hoadley wrote on his college blog, CLF’s ad claims, ""Hoadley called women ‘breeders.’... wanted to learn about crystal meth and wrote that his sexual partners were his victims. Hoadley even wrote about a four year-old wearing a thong."" Hoadley used the term ""breeders"" to refer to straight people, not women specifically. Hoadley attended an event to learn about the impact of crystal meth on the LGBTQ community. CLF’s claim implies that Hoadley was interested in experimenting with the illegal substance. Hoadley wrote a poem that contained the line, ""I talk to the latest victim of my sexual conquest,"" but his blog post noted his writing was a piece of fiction and that he was not talking about himself. Hoadley relayed a conversation in which his friend said he ""shudders"" at the thought of a four year-old being dressed in a thong.

Donald Trump’s false claim of DACA changes ‘because of the pandemic’
","President Donald Trump at an NBC town hall faulted the coronavirus pandemic for changes his administration has done to an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants from deportation. What Trump left out, however, is that his efforts to end the program started during his first year in office. A town hall attendee asked Trump if he would pursue his efforts to cut Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, if elected to a second term. ""We are going to take care of DACA. We are going to take care of Dreamer(s). It’s working right now, we are negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law,"" Trump said. ""But we are working very hard on the DACA program, and you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year, because I feel the same way as you do about it."" NBC host Savannah Guthrie pointed out that Trump’s administration had actually curtailed the DACA program. She said that no new applications were allowed and recipients have to renew every year as opposed to every two years. ""What happened is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front,"" Trump said Oct. 15. ""Mexico is heavily infected, as you know, and we've made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic and other reasons, and crime."" Trump’s comment left the wrong impression: Trump’s efforts to undo or restrict DACA were not tied to the pandemic. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in September 2017 announced that the Trump administration was rescinding the program, arguing that Obama’s administration circumvented immigration laws when it created it. The administration at the time said it would adjudicate applications filed by Sept. 5, 2017, on a case-by-case basis, but it would reject any new requests filed after that date. Legal challenges to the administration’s efforts have left that program in place, with some caveats. The administration is required to process renewal applications for immigrants who have been granted DACA and want to renew it. However, immigrants who have never had DACA are not allowed to file an application seeking the protection for the first time. As Guthrie said, the Trump administration also has reduced the length of the renewable DACA protection, from two years to one. Immigration officials announced that specific change in July 2020, in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision related to the administration’s efforts to end the program. DACA does not benefit people who are newly arriving in the country. To have been eligible for DACA, people had to be continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007, have no felony convictions, and meet other criteria. About 644,000 people had DACA protection as of March 31, 2020, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigraiton Services. Trump said that changes to DACA are ""because of the pandemic."" His administration began making changes to DACA in 2017, his first year in office. DACA also benefits people who have been in the United States for many years, not those arriving during the pandemic. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False. RELATED: Republicans and Democrats claim to support Dreamers. So why can’t they pass a law?

Joe Biden wrong to say COPS funding has been ‘eliminated’
","During a town hall hosted by ABC News, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden touted the Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, program, which was enacted as part of the 1994 crime bill.  The 1994 bill, which Biden spearheaded, included some provisions on prosecution and sentencing that have recently been criticized for exacerbating criminal justice disparities for minority groups. But at the town hall, Biden highlighted other parts of the law that have been more popular. The idea behind community policing was to develop new policing strategies focused on engaging officers members of the community on their beat, rather than seeming like an occupying force. In an exchange with host George Stephanopoulos in the Oct. 15 town hall, Biden lamented that ""they eliminated the funding for community policing."" Biden was vague about who eliminated the funding, and when. Either way, he’s wrong about the elimination of funding. Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact that he was referring to Trump’s fiscal 2019 budget proposal, which would have halved funding for the community policing program. But this proposal wasn’t enacted, and it did not amount to an ""elimination."" The program is smaller than it was in its early years, when its budget ranged between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, and crime rates were higher. But funding was never zeroed out.  Since 2012, which was under the Obama-Biden administration, funding has been around $200 million a year. Crime rates are also much lower now than they were during the early and mid-1990s. Here’s a rundown of the annual budgetary authority for the COPS program from the Congressional Research Service:   Biden said, ""They eliminated the funding for community policing."" That’s incorrect. While the program’s funding is lower than it was in the 1990s, it was never brought down to zero and remains in the neighborhood of $200 million a year.

Tucker Carlson distorts new CDC report, makes false mask claim
","Fox News host Tucker Carlson misrepresented the findings of a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, amplifying misinformation from social media as he claimed on his TV show that the study showed masks don’t work like experts say. Running through a series of data points listed in the CDC’s report, Carlson said during his Oct. 13 show: ""Almost everyone — 85% — who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly this doesn't work the way they tell us it works.""  The Fox News host’s take ran counter to comments he made in April touting the effectiveness of masks. It also contradicted the guidance of public health officials, who say mask wearing on a broad scale can slow the spread of the coronavirus. Carlson’s misleading claim about the CDC study appeared to make its way to President Donald Trump, a frequent Fox News watcher and guest. ""Did you see, the CDC, that 85% of the people wearing the masks catch it, OK?"" Trump said during an Oct. 15 rally in Greenville, N.C. The data in the CDC report, however, cannot be generalized to say ""almost everyone"" who wore a mask in July got the coronavirus. It’s from a very small sample the authors said may not be representative of the United States, and mask use was self-reported. The report does not say masks don’t work to slow the spread of COVID-19. The CDC paper summarizes findings from a survey of 314 people. The total included a group of 154 symptomatic people who tested positive for the coronavirus in July and a control group of 160 symptomatic people who tested negative for the coronavirus in July. Based on the results of the survey, the CDC report said two activities were linked to a positive coronavirus test: close contact with someone who also tested positive, and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as bars and restaurants. RELATED: No, masks don't collect the coronavirus Of the 160 survey participants who tested negative, 74.2% said they ""always"" wore a mask or face covering and 14.5% said they ""often"" did so. Of the 154 survey participants who tested positive, 70.6% said they ""always"" wore a mask or face covering and 14.4% said they ""often"" did so. Those numbers form the basis of Carlson’s claim that 85% of people ""who got the coronavirus in July (were) wearing a mask."" A Fox News spokesperson pointed to those figures and a segment from Carlson’s show the following night. In the segment, Carlson addressed a statement he said the CDC made to Fox News. Carlson said the agency called his commentary on the September study ""misleading."" ""CDC guidance on masks has clearly stated that wearing a mask is intended to protect other people in case the mask wearer is infected,"" the CDC said in the statement. ""At no time has CDC guidance suggested that masks were intended to protect the wearers."" Carlson told viewers the CDC didn’t address his original claim. ""The spokesman didn’t dispute that we had showed accurate data from the CDC, including that 85% of people who tested positive for coronavirus in July reported wearing a mask always or often,"" Carlson said. But the CDC study wasn’t measuring the impact of masks. ""Participants were asked about mask use as an individual behavior,"" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald told PolitiFact. ""However, the aim of the study was to assess possible situations for community exposure, not mask use."" It’s misleading to leap to conclusions about the effectiveness of masks from the CDC report, since most participants reported wearing them and the study was not controlling for mask use.  ""You can’t just look at a table and draw conclusions without understanding the details of the study,"" said Cindy Prins, an epidemiologist with the University of Florida. ""It is difficult to detect the effect of an exposure or intervention when it is widely deployed or used,"" McDonald added. He said both groups of participants had high levels of mask use, and that the rates of people who always wore a mask in each group were not ""statistically different."" The study did find a significant difference between the groups: whether participants went out for food or drink. The study authors wrote that those with positive test results were ""approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant"" than those who tested negative. The link between restaurants and catching the coronavirus is important to Carlson’s claim, since most people lower their masks to sip their drink or eat their food. ""Restaurants and coffee shops are places where people will tend to not wear a mask,"" Prins said. The study’s authors noted that masks ""cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking."" But Carlson claimed that 85% of July cases were ""wearing a mask"" and ""infected anyway."" ""Going to places where mask use and social distancing cannot be maintained might be an important risk factor for COVID-19,"" McDonald said. Carlson’s comment also ignored limitations listed in the study. The people were surveyed at 11 health care facilities, where they’d all sought testing because they were experiencing symptoms. So they ""might not be representative of the United States population,"" the study’s authors wrote. Ben Neuman, a virologist with Texas A&M University, Texarkana, also took issue with the survey’s reliance on the participants’ self-reporting of their own mask use.  ""There are certain things that are embarrassing or politically and socially sensitive, and you generally won’t get honest answers if you just ask them on a questionnaire,"" Neuman said. Carlson’s claim also mischaracterized the science behind masks. While masks do provide some protection for wearers, experts and public health officials say they are most effective as ""source control,"" preventing infected people from transmitting the virus.  ""When a person who is infected with COVID-19 wears a mask, it helps to reduce the amount of virus that they release when they cough, talk, or even breathe,"" Prins said. The CDC recommends wearing masks in public and when social distancing isn’t possible. Neuman previously shared three studies with PolitiFact that found wearing masks reduces the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. Other studies have said the same. ""Growing evidence increasingly shows that wearing masks in community settings reduces transmission among individuals in that community,"" McDonald said. ""There are laboratory studies, animal studies, community and epidemiological studies, as well as policy studies that show masking reduces transmission in communities by blocking exhaled respiratory droplets."" The Fox News spokesperson cited CDC Director Robert Redfield’s September testimony as an example of how mask wearing ""doesn’t work the way they tell us it works,"" as Carlson claimed. Redfield touted the effectiveness of masks relative to a potential coronavirus vaccine. ""I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine,"" Redfield said in a clip Carlson played on his show. But Redfield never said that masks only protect the wearer — or that they offer complete and total protection in that regard. He was comparing masks to a potential early vaccine, which he said wouldn’t necessarily guarantee an immune response. ""He was suggesting if everyone around him wore a mask, he would be protected until a vaccine became available,"" McDonald said.  The CDC has been clear elsewhere that masks help keep infected people from passing the virus to others. The CDC’s website, for example, says masks help ""prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others."" It adds: ""The protective effects — how well the mask protects healthy people from breathing in the virus — are unknown."" Carlson said that according to a recent CDC report, ""Almost everyone — 85% — who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly this doesn't work the way they tell us it works."" Carlson didn’t pull the 85% figure out of thin air, but the conclusion he drew is wrong in multiple ways. For starters, the CDC report wasn’t designed to measure mask effectiveness, and the study’s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S. The findings don’t prove masks are ineffective, either. Masks are most effective at preventing infected people from spreading the virus, and studies show they can help slow the spread.  The correlation the CDC found between positive coronavirus tests and going to restaurants and bars suggests that taking masks off to eat or drink might increase risk.  We rate Carlson’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFEBC80>],/factchecks/2020/oct/15/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-distorts-new-cdc-report-makes-false/

Roy Cooper compares Georgia's COVID-19 numbers to North Carolina
","Roy Cooper and Dan Forest agree that North Carolina’s coronavirus response stands out among southern states. But the gubernatorial candidates disagree over whether that’s a good thing. Democratic Gov. Cooper and Republican Lt. Gov. Forest squared off on Wednesday night for North Carolina’s only gubernatorial debate of the year. At one point in the debate, Forest praised North Carolina’s border states for allowing many businesses to reopen while their respective governments addressed the coronavirus outbreak. ""This COVID science is an interesting thing because you cross the border into South Carolina and South Carolina’s open and people are out there going to restaurants and doing things,"" Forest said. ""You cross into Tennessee and Tennessee is open, you cross into Georgia and Georgia is open. They’re learning how to live with the virus and protect the vulnerable and get people back to work."" Cooper immediately offered a comparison between North Carolina and Georgia. ""It’s interesting that Dan mentions Georgia … He wants to be like Georgia,"" Cooper said. ""Georgia is about the same size as North Carolina, yet they have almost 100,000 more cases, almost twice as many deaths and almost 600 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina."" Cooper is right about the sizes of North Carolina and Georgia. Georgia is the eighth most populous state in the U.S. and North Carolina is the ninth most populous, according to 2019 census data. The states are separated by fewer than 130,000 people. So what about those stats Cooper mentioned? Cooper spokeswoman Liz Doherty referred us to a coronavirus tracker on the New York Times website and nursing home data on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website. PolitiFact North Carolina also looked at information on the North Carolina and Georgia state websites. Case counts vary a little bit, depending on the source. But otherwise, Cooper is mostly spot-on. Cooper said Georgia has almost 100,000 more cases than North Carolina. On the night of the debate, data from each state’s health department showed Georgia with about 98,100 more cases. So Cooper’s not far off.  North Carolina’s health department reported 236,407 confirmed cases and Georgia’s health department reported 334,601 cases.  The New York Times map showed 236,810 cases for North Carolina and 319,609 total cases for Georgia, for a difference of about 82,800. Cooper didn’t compare each state’s infection numbers to its population. But that statistic provides useful context. The night of the debate, the New York Times’ reported that North Carolina had 2,258 cases per 100,000 residents and Georgia had 3,010 cases per 100,000 residents. Cooper said Georgia had ""almost twice as many deaths"" as North Carolina. This claim is on track too. On the night of the debate, North Carolina’s health department reported 3,856 total deaths. Twice that many would be 7,712 deaths. Georgia’s health department reported 7,470 total deaths.  The Times, meanwhile, reported 3,882 total deaths in North Carolina (a rate of 37 deaths per 100,000 residents) and 7,298 total deaths in Georgia (meaning 69 deaths per 100,000 people.) So if you look at total deaths, the Times and the NC health department both show there have been about 3,800. Georgia is 200 to 400 deaths away from having twice as many.  Finally, let’s look at nursing homes. Cooper said Georgia has had almost 600 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina. On debate night, data tracked by the federal government showed Georgia having 569 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina. CMS reported 1,328 nursing home deaths in North Carolina and 1,897 in Georgia. Cooper didn’t mention nursing home cases. To round out the full picture, we’ll report them anyway. On the night of the debate, CMS reported 6,523 total nursing home cases in North Carolina and 9,483 total cases in Georgia. Cooper said Georgia has ""almost 100,000 more cases, almost twice as many deaths and almost 600 more nursing home deaths than North Carolina."" His claim about cases requires the most rounding, but isn’t far off. But his claim about deaths — in total and in nursing homes — are spot-on.

Fact-checking claim on Amy Coney Barrett and a racial slur in the workplace
","In the midst of Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, users on social media began sharing a supposed quote from the judge, claiming she once said that ""calling a Black employee the N-word does not make for a hostile work environment."" Barrett did not outright declare that being called the racial slur does not ever constitute a hostile work environment. But she did write in an opinion that one plaintiff who was called the racial epithet by a former supervisor was not sufficient evidence to support their claim of a hostile work environment.  Posts sharing the alleged quote were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In 2019, while sitting on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel that upheld a district court’s dismissal of a workplace discimination lawsuit by a Black employee, who claimed he was called a racial slur by a supervisor. In the Smith vs. Illinois Department of Transportation case, Terry Smith, a Black Illinois transportation employee, sued the department under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 after he was fired, arguing that he had been subjected to a hostile work environment and was fired in retaliation for his complaints about racial discrimination. He lost his case in district court and appealed to the circuit court. The three-judge panel, which included Barrett, unanimously affirmed the district court’s ruling. Barrett authored the court’s opinion, and wrote that, during Smith’s probationary employment period, Smith ""challenged and failed to follow directions, was confrontational, engaged in unsafe conduct, and received unsatisfactory evaluations.""  In affirming the lower court’s decision, the Seventh Circuit opinion stated, ""Given the extensive evidence that Smith was not meeting his employer’s legitimate expectations, a reasonable jury could not find that the Department fired him because of his protected activity rather than for his poor performance nor could a reasonable jury have resolved the hostile work environment claim in Smith’s favor."" Smith claimed that his former supervisor, Lloyd Colbert, called him a ""stupid ass n-----’."" In her opinion, Barrett called the comment an ""egregious racial epithet"" but dismissed Smith’s claim, saying that his relationship with supervisors at the department had long been problematic and that this single incident in which Colbert referred to Smith by using the racial slur wasn’t enough to constitute a hostile work environment in the context of the other issues: ""Smith can’t win simply by proving that the word was uttered. He must also demonstrate that Colbert’s use of this word altered the conditions of his employment and created a hostile or abusive working environment. ... He introduced no evidence that Colbert’s use of the N-word changed his subjective experience of the workplace. To be sure, Smith testified that his time at the Department caused him psychological distress. But that was for reasons that predated his run-in with Colbert and had nothing to do with his race. His tenure at the Department was rocky from the outset because of his poor track record. He clashed with his supervisors over pay, and they confronted him with foul language. As early as August — the first month of his employment — he sent memoranda to the Department complaining of a ‘hostile work environment.’ On Smith’s own account, his supervisors made him miserable throughout his employment at the Department. But as we have already discussed, he has no evidence that his supervisors were lashing out at him because he was Black."" Posts online claim Amy Coney Barrett once said that ""calling a Black employee the N-word does not make for a hostile work environment."" According to the opinion she wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel, Barrett said that a plaintiff being called that racial slur by a former supervisor didn’t in and of itself establish a hostile work environment for several reasons. She wrote that Smith failed to show how it changed his workplace experience, which was already fraught. Barrett did not write that being called the racial slur doesn’t ever constitute a hostile work environment.

Conspiracy theory targets first recipient of UK COVID-19 vaccine as crisis actor
","On Dec. 8, 2020, news organizations around the world published stories about the first patient in the United Kingdom to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outside of trials: 90-year-old Margaret Keenan. Along with the stories came images showing Keenan with her sleeve rolled up as she got the first dose at University Hospital in Coventry, England. But it didn’t take long for some users on social media to start circulating a bogus conspiracy theory that suggested the story wasn’t legitimate, because the same images appeared online months earlier.  ""Excuse me but how is it the exact same person who’s the ‘first to get vaccinated’ today... also in a CNN photo wearing the exact same clothes, in the exact same chair, and getting a shot back in October?

Mindy Robinson, a conservative actress who lost a recent congressional run in Nevada, wrote on Twitter.  Robinson’s tweet, which was re-shared on Facebook, includes screenshots of two different articles.  One depicts a Dec. 8 BBC article that shows Keenan getting the shot, while the other appears to show an unrelated story by CNN published on Oct. 22, with the same images of Keenan receiving the vaccine. But this is a misunderstanding of how some news websites, like CNN’s, will sometimes display the latest stories at the top of other, unrelated articles. Keenan is not an actor, and CNN did not publish photos of her receiving the vaccine in October. Another post on Facebook also ambiguously claims that Keenan is a crisis actor because she apparently made a hand gesture that has been connected to the Illuminati, and by including screenshots of another, unnamed woman who is supposedly an actress. There is no evidence that the images of the woman (or women, the grainy screenshot isn’t clear and may show more than one person) pictured is Keenan, or that her innocuous hand gesture signals something nefarious. The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  A reverse-image search shows that photos and videos of Keenan receiving the shot were not published before Dec. 8. The Oct. 22 CNN story in the screenshot covered a report estimating that the U.S. COVID-19 response resulted in 130,000 to 210,000 avoidable deaths. It does not include any images of Keenan.  Some article pages on CNN’s website display videos from other stories, often the most recent ones, underneath the headline. A reel showing a handful of videos, which currently includes the Dec. 8 vaccinations in the UK, is displayed under that. These clips were not published at the same time as the Oct. 22 article, but simply feature other CNN segments that viewers can watch if they want. Many conspiracy theories latch onto the flawed claim that people who appear in various news stories — often tragic events like mass shootings — are actually paid actors pushing a pre-ordained narrative.

Dominion Voting Machines didn’t switch 37 votes to Biden in Ware County, Georgia
","Dominion Voting Systems, which makes election software and hardware, has been at the center of baseless claims of voter fraud in the aftermath of the 2020 election. U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., amplified one of these claims in a Dec. 4 tweet. ""Yesterday we learned a forensics examination of a Ware County, GA #DominionVotingSystems machine found votes were switched from @realDonaldTrump to @JoeBiden,"" he tweeted. ""This is one machine in one county in one state. Did this happen elsewhere? We need to know! EXAMINE ALL THE MACHINES!""  Yesterday we learned a forensics examination of a Ware County, GA #DominionVotingSystems machine found votes were switched from @realDonaldTrump to @JoeBiden.This is one machine in one county in one state.Did this happen elsewhere? We need to know!EXAMINE ALL THE MACHINES! Hice’s claim misleads on several fronts. He seems to be referring to the results of a hand recount in Ware County, which changed by 37 votes from the initial vote total. State election officials told us that the small difference between the initial count and the recount resulted from human error, not a failure of Dominion software.  A spokesperson for Hice’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. Ware County Supervisor of Elections Carlos Nelson explained that the error occurred while a worker tabulated ballots. Absentee ballots are digitally scanned in batches of 100. If a scanning machine detects a ballot with a rip or a tear, the machine stops, forcing election workers to reject the batch, fix the torn ballot, and then resubmit the 100-vote batch for tabulation. In this case, the worker accidentally submitted the same batch twice after a flawed ballot stopped the machine, once before the ballot was fixed and once after it was fixed. According to Nelson, Ware County election officials caught the error in an internal audit and quickly updated the result. The corrected numbers were affirmed during an electronic recount that the Trump campaign requested in Georgia.  ""The system worked as it was intended to work,"" said Nelson. ""We reported the error right after the election, updated all the numbers, and there was no issue for three weeks until the narrative changed."" Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official, mirrored Nelson’s claims, calling Hice’s tweet ""flat-out misinformation"" in a tweet.  Hice’s claim appears to have originated in a Dec. 3 press release put out by the advocacy group Voter GA, which claims, without evidence, that the 37-vote-difference resulted from a Dominion Voting Machine, which ""flipped"" votes from Trump to Biden.  The press release compares the discrepancy in the Ware County vote totals to Antrim County, Mich., where a clerk incorrectly tallied votes a day after the election. The mistake was quickly corrected, and there is no evidence that Antrim County’s inaccurate vote count was caused by Dominion technology.  It’s unclear what forensic examination Hice was referencing. The Georgia Secretary of State’s office did conduct a forensic audit on a random sampling of Dominion voting machines, but that audit found ""no signs of cyber attacks or election hacking"" and ""no evidence of the machines being tampered.""

Alternative health website spreads false claim about COVID-19 vaccine side effects
","An alternative health website that has published articles claiming vaccines cause autism is now setting its sights on the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. In a Dec. 6 article, GreenMedInfo wrote that a document from the Food and Drug Administration revealed the government was worried about a slew of potential side effects from coronavirus vaccines. Among them: death. ""Public discussion and documents reveal that the FDA knows that rushed-to-market COVID-19 vaccines may cause a wide range of life-threatening side effects, including death,"" the article says below a large advertisement for an alternative health book. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s been shared thousands of times by anti-vaccine Facebook pages and groups, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. As U.S. coronavirus cases near 300,000, public health agencies are developing a strategy to distribute vaccines to millions of Americans in 2021. The first doses could be only days away, so we wanted to take a closer look at the claim that they could cause serious harm. The article is misleading.  (Screenshot from GreenMedInfo) While the FDA is monitoring for potential adverse side effects, it has not found that any of the coronavirus vaccines seeking approval cause death. And just because COVID-19 vaccines were developed in record time doesn’t mean they’re unsafe. GreenMedInfo cited an Oct. 22 presentation given during a meeting of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. A slide in the presentation shows a ""working list of possible adverse event outcomes"" from coronavirus vaccines. Among them are chronic conditions like autoimmune disease and arthritis, as well as stroke and death.  But that doesn’t mean the FDA has reason to believe the coronavirus vaccines awaiting emergency-use authorization could cause death.  ""As indicated on the slide, this is a description of the possible, not known, adverse event outcomes that the FDA will be monitoring for as the vaccine is deployed,"" a spokesperson told PolitiFact. ""As described in slides, the FDA plans on monitoring 10-20 outcomes of interest."" While vaccines often take 10 to 15 years to develop, several potential COVID-19 vaccines were developed in a matter of months. There are several reasons for that, including the fact that scientists had previously worked on vaccines for similar coronaviruses and funding agencies poured billions of dollars into COVID-19 vaccine research. The FDA uses emergency-use authorizations during public health emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. A vaccine that’s granted an emergency-use authorization is different from an FDA-approved vaccine in that for emergency authorization, ""the totality of scientific evidence"" must make it ""reasonable to believe that the product may be effective."" For official approval, vaccines must demonstrate ""substantial evidence"" of efficacy and proof of safety. Vaccines that are granted an emergency-use authorization still go through a rigorous review process, including all phases of clinical trials. ""Clinical trials are evaluating investigational COVID-19 vaccines in tens of thousands of study participants to generate the scientific data and other information needed by FDA to determine safety and effectiveness,"" the FDA says on its website. ""These clinical trials are being conducted according to the rigorous standards set forth by the FDA."" We reached out to GreenMedInfo for a comment. Founder Sayer Ji said his website’s intention was ""to counterbalance the highly biased promotion of vaccines as ‘safe and effective’ a priori."" Ji also cited an FDA briefing document on the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its partner, BioNTech. The United Kingdom on Dec. 8 became the first country to start distributing the vaccine, and Canada approved it the next day. In the document, the FDA reported that six of 43,448 participants died during clinical trials of the vaccine held from April to November. Two had been given the vaccine, and four had received a placebo.  Both participants who received the vaccine and died were older than 55; one died from cardiac arrest, the other from arteriosclerosis. The vaccine was not listed among the causes of their deaths, which the FDA said were characteristic of their age groups.  Although the agency did note some minor side effects associated with the vaccine, including fatigue and headache, it said there were ""no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance"" of emergency use authorization. RELATED: Many Americans say they don’t want a vaccine. Should we be worried? The FDA’s assessment supports Pfizer’s Nov. 18 announcement that its vaccine was safe and 95% effective at preventing the coronavirus. The agency will meet Dec. 10 to discuss whether to approve the emergency-use authorization, after which it will be assessed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and continue to be studied in clinical trials. ""The FDA would only issue an EUA if the vaccine has demonstrated clear and compelling efficacy in a large well-designed phase 3 clinical trial,"" the FDA told PolitiFact. ""If an EUA is issued, the process will not be rushed, and no shortcuts will be taken around having the relevant phase 3 efficacy results."" GreenMedInfo was created in 2008 and has published several articles that falsely claim there’s a link between vaccines and autism. In 2018, Pinterest banned the site for violating its policies against anti-vaccine misinformation.  The website’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972379C0>],/factchecks/2020/dec/09/blog-posting/alternative-health-website-spreads-false-claim-abo/

Fact-checking claim that ties Sen. Kelly Loeffler to QAnon, ‘white supremacist’
","In a Georgia debate that could help decide which party controls the Senate, Black pastor Raphael Warnock went after white businesswoman Kelly Loeffler on race.  ""And she says she is against racism and that racism has no place,"" Warnock, the Democratic challenger, said of Loeffler, the GOP senator.  ""But she welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview. I don't think she can explain that."" Warnock was referring to Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, and conservative activist Jack Posobiec, who once interviewed Loeffler. Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church once led by Martin Luther King Jr., has repeatedly made the claim against Loeffler.  In the debate, Loeffler didn’t respond directly to the two-part attack, but said: ""There’s not a racist bone in my body."" Loeffler did embrace an endorsement from Greene in a campaign event, so that part is true. The evidence Warnock relies on for the other part of the claim doesn’t flatly label Posobiec as a white supremacist, but notes that he has ties to people in that movement, and Posobiec and has praised some of them.  The QAnon conspiracy theory claims public figures like Hillary Clinton, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey are part of a ring of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles, and that President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to bring it down.  The FBI has described the QAnon movement as a potential domestic terrorism threat. But Greene, a former construction executive heading to Congress, has called it ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out,"" and has made derogatory remarks about Black people, Jews and Muslims. Loeffler appeared with Greene at an Oct. 15 campaign event to tout her endorsement from the House candidate. By then, Greene had won a primary runoff to represent Georgia’s safely Republican 14th congressional district.  Loeffler praised Greene’s defense of ""conservative values."" ""I've gotten a lot of work done in Washington already in that regard — and I'm thrilled to know I've got a strong, conservative champion that's going to be fighting right alongside with me,"" Loeffler said of Greene. In the Nov. 3 election, Greene won easily, becoming the first open supporter of QAnon to win a seat in the U.S. House. Loeffler gave an interview July 31 to Posobiec, who is known as a conservative activist and is a correspondent for One America News Network, a conservative cable news channel.  Loeffler highlighted the interview, which aired on OANN, on her campaign’s Twitter account. She said she did the interview ""to discuss why I had to call out"" the Black Lives Matter ""political organization — and why the woke mob is trying to cancel me."" To back its claim about Loeffler sitting for an interview ""with a white supremacist,"" Warnock’s campaign cited a news report about Posobiec from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and a report about Posobiec from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a social justice nonprofit that in recent years has been criticized over some of its tracking of hate groups. Those reports talk about Posobiec’s association with white supremacy. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution led its article about the Loeffler interview by saying Posobiec is ""associated with white supremacy and Nazism."" The article said Jewish groups and media observers pointed out that Posobiec ""promotes conspiracy theories and once associated with white supremacists including Richard Spencer."" Posobiec has praised Spencer, a white nationalist who was one of the leaders of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where a white supremacist rammed a car into a counterprotester, killing her. The Southern Poverty Law Center, in a report published July 8 on its Hatewatch blog, said Posobiec ""collaborated for years with white supremacists,"" including Spencer. ""Posobiec’s ties to far-right extremists travel beyond borders into Europe. His connections to white supremacy are too numerous to compile into one article, so Hatewatch is running a series of stories on the correspondent’s ties to the movement and promotion of it."" The center does not include Posobiec on its list of white nationalists, or its broader list of extremists. ""The only reason we have not formally listed Posobiec yet is that we are still reporting out his history within hate movements,"" Michael Edison Hayden, who wrote the Hatewatch blog post on Posobiec, told PolitiFact. ""We have more to publish about Posobiec soon, also related to promotion of an anti-immigrant politician and his collaboration with white supremacists. Do not interpret the current absence of his extremist profile as a suggestion that he is somehow less extreme than figures like Richard Spencer."" Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said Posobiec ""has apparently cozied up to various white supremacists."" Loeffler ""should know that granting an interview to such a person, while criticizing those who point out his bigotry and disturbing associations, legitimizes the toxic views he so dutifully promotes."" Loeffler’s campaign and Posobiec did not respond to our requests for comment. Warnock said Loeffler ""welcomed the support of a QAnon conspiracy theorist, and she sat down with a white supremacist for an interview."" Loeffler did welcome the endorsement of her campaign by a QAnon supporter. Loeffler gave an interview to a man who has praised a prominent white nationalist and who, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, ""collaborated for years with white supremacists."" The center does not include the interviewer on its list of white nationalists, but says it is continuing to investigate him. We rate Warnock’s statement Half True.

Amanda Chase makes bogus claim of voting fraud in Virginia precinct
","State Sen. Amanda Chase, who calls herself ""Donald Trump in heels,"" recently failed to prove her claim that Virginia’s fall elections were rigged. Chase, R-Chesterfield County, is running for governor in 2021 as an Independent, having recently abandoned her Republican candidacy in the wake of feuds with state GOP leaders. She’s been calling for gun rights, the preservation of Confederate monuments, and has opposed COVID-19 restrictions. Since the Nov. 3 election - which Democrat Joe Biden won in Virginia with 450,000 more votes than Trump - she’s been promising to ""expose the voter fraud that’s going on in Virginia."" During a Dec. 1 radio interview on WRVA in Richmond, conservative host John Reid pressed Chase to prove her fraud claim, and she focused on Chesterfield’s heavily Democratic Southside precinct. Here’s the conversation: Reid: ""If there’s an overvote, if it’s supposed to be - and I’m just picking a number - 85,000 people are registered to vote and then 87,000 votes are counted, then you don’t have to be a Ph.D. from M.I.T. to know you’ve got a problem. Is it that simple; are we seeing that? Is that true or not true?"" Chase:  ""...There are situations, historically, like I know in Chesterfield, the Southside precinct is infamous for having over 100% of the vote count, which really should be impossible if they’re doing what they’re supposed to be doing."" Reid: ""...You’re saying there are places where over 100%?"" Chase: ""There are, yeah. Absolutely.""  Reid: ""This year?"" Chase: ""I haven’t looked at that particular precinct this year. But I know in years past I’ve actually, before I ran for office, I worked behind the scenes to get Republicans elected and I would go to the Southside precinct because I remember (it) historically having over 100% voting and I’m like, that’s a precinct I want to go work, and I actually saw voters coming in with stacks of votes. They were illegally harvesting votes is what was going on. We fact-checked Chase’s overvoting claim, using election records from the Chesterfield registrar’s office.  The Southside precinct is near Meadowbrook High School, roughly between Iron Bridge and Cogbill Roads. The working-class precinct was established in 2008, and its highest turnout came that year when 70% of its voters cast ballots in the presidential election won by Democrat Barack Obama. That was below the statewide 74% turnout. We asked Chase to reconcile the statistics with her overvote claim, and she said she might have gotten things wrong. ""Maybe it didn’t happen,"" she said. ""It was a memory I had in the back of my mind."" She added, ""I wouldn’t put any credence in what I was saying.""  Records show the Southside precinct has voted overwhelmingly Democratic in each of 27 contested elections it has seen since its start. Chase lost the precinct by 3-to-1 ratios in her 2015 and 2019 state Senate races. Our ruling Chase, trying to prove there’s voting fraud in Virginia, says Chesterfield’s Southside precinct is infamous for logging more votes than there are voters.  Election records show the strongly-Democratic precinct has never had a voter turnout greater than 70% in its 12-year history. Presented with statistics, Chase says of her overvote claim ""maybe it didn’t happen,"" and ""I wouldn’t put any credence in what I was saying.""

Recount finds Trump did not win Wisconsin, despite his victory claim
","In his first major appearance since the presidential election, President Donald Trump was the main attraction at a Dec. 5, 2020 rally in Valdosta, Ga., where he hoped to boost the campaigns of Republican U.S. Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. The pair are competing against Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, respectively, to keep their seats in the Jan. 5 runoff that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Loeffler and Perdue, however, were not the primary focus of the president’s speech.  Instead, Trump turned to a broken-record of wrong and baseless claims, arguing there had been massive fraud and he had actually won the election, defeating Democrat Joe Biden. He and his lawyers have been aggressively pulling every lever, from recounts to lawsuits to public pressure, to undo the results of the election. Naturally, Trump turned to Wisconsin, one of the state’s that narrowly swung to Biden. ""A poll came out ... Washington Post, ABC, just before the election,"" Trump told the crowd. ""(It said) I’m going to lose Wisconsin by 17 points. I said ‘No, I’m going to win Wisconsin.’  ""Actually, I won Wisconsin."" Actually, Trump didn’t.  He lost Wisconsin. Let’s dig in. On Nov. 4, 2020, the morning after Election Day, the Associated Press declared Biden the winner in Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported unofficial results showed Biden with a lead of about 20,000 votes -- and that the Trump campaign was already vowing to request a recount. When it did request the recount, Trump’s team focused only on heavily Democratic Dane and Milwaukee counties. But, by the time the recount was over, Trump actually fell further behind. Biden netted 132 votes in Milwaukee County and Trump netted 45 votes in Dane County. Taken together, that increased Biden’s statewide margin to 20,695 votes out of about 3 million cast, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on Nov. 29, 2020. (A day later, the figures were revised: Trump's pickup was 58 in Dane (instead of 45), and the final margin was 20,682.  The overall net pickup for Biden in the two recounts became 74 (instead of 87 as initially reported). Having failed, the Trump campaign turned to the court system. But on Dec. 3, 2020, in a 4-3 decision, the state Supreme Court rejected the campaign’s request to overturn the certification of votes. Instead, the court said Trump’s campaign had to start at the circuit court level. It was a major setback, with even dissenting judges indicating they may reject the call to throw out hundreds of thousands of ballots. A day later, the court said it would not accept a lawsuit by Trump allies who wanted to let Republican lawmakers decide how to cast the state's electoral votes, rather than the electors chosen by voters in the election.  Meanwhile, the campaign also went to the federal court, where U.S. District Judge Brett Ludwig questioned whether the case should even be before him, calling part of the lawsuit’s requested remedy ""really bizarre"" and told an attorney for the Trump campaign it was seeking  ""pretty remarkable declaratory relief."" Ludwig has scheduled a hearing for Dec. 10. In any case, for our purposes here, the main thing that matters is the results themselves. On Nov. 30, the recounted totals were certified by the chair of the state elections board and Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat. In a statement, Evers said: ""Today I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election, and as required by state and federal law, I've signed the Certificate of Ascertainment for the slate of electors for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.""  That sets in motion the Electoral College vote Dec. 14, which will involve 10 Democratic electors. It also means Biden -- not Trump -- won. At a Georgia rally, President Trump said ""Actually, I won Wisconsin.""  There is a preponderance of evidence, including Election Day tallies and a partial recount, illustrating exactly the opposite -- that challenger Biden is the winner in Wisconsin.   Meanwhile, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump won Wisconsin. The claim, on its face, is ridiculous. Therefore, we rate it Pants on Fire.    ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E68840>],/factchecks/2020/dec/09/donald-trump/recount-finds-trump-did-not-win-wisconsin-despite-/

Map showing Trump winning election with 410 electoral votes is bogus
","One feature of 2020 election misinformation that fact-checkers are hip to: faulty electoral maps that claim to show the supposedly ""real"" outcomes of the presidential election. President-elect Joe Biden leads with 306 votes to Trump’s 232, with all battleground states certifying their results. But some of the maps we’ve seen online show Trump winning — they’re simply inaccurate or, in one case, old, like this one showing results from the 2016 election. Now, a new Facebook post is spreading an unrealistic electoral map that shows Trump with a stunning 410 votes, and Biden at 128 votes. ""This is the actual results of the election,"" text above the map reads. ""People in Germany saw this before Dominion servers were seized. This will probably get removed so share as much as possible. The fraud is massive. Shame on these people."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  This is wrong.  The map does not reflect the real election results, as the post claims, and there’s no evidence any servers were seized. The map was aired by One America News Network, known as OAN or OANN, a pro-Trump cable network based in the U.S., and there is no evidence it surfaced in Germany. OAN included the map in a segment it aired on the unfounded conspiracy theory that the U.S. military seized election-related servers in Germany. In a clip of the segment found on YouTube, an anchor is heard saying that ""new reports claim the real results of the 2020 U.S. election were found on a computer server that was seized by the U.S. military in Frankfurt, Germany."" The anchor then refers to a tweet with the map, which flashes on the screen, and says it's ""allegedly based off the data from that server"" and shows ""a landslide victory for President Trump with 410 electoral college votes including liberal strongholds, California and Minnesota.""  The map is sourced solely to a defeated congressional candidate Manga Anantatmula, and does not reflect state-certified election results. Among its wild inaccuracies: it awards all of California’s 55 electoral votes to Trump. California has been won by Democrats in every presidential race since 1992, including 2020. We previously debunked similar posts that said the U.S. Army raided Spanish election software company Scytl in Germany and seized its servers. Some versions claimed the servers had ties to Dominion. Scytl said in a statement that the U.S. military hasn’t and couldn’t have seized any of its equipment, because it doesn’t have offices in Germany. The Army also denied to the Associated Press that such an event took place.  The company has delivered election modernization projects for U.S. elections since 2008, but none involve tallying votes, according to its website. The services include online initiatives like election worker training, electronic ballot delivery and real-time, visual representation of votes.  In a statement rejecting the claims, Scytl said that its technologies for the U.S. are hosted and managed domestically by a Tampa-based subsidiary, SOE Software, and that it does not provide any voting machines in the U.S. or online voting services for U.S. elections. Chris Krebs, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, who was fired by President Trump after he rejected claims of widespread voter fraud, took to Twitter to debunk the claim before leaving the agency.  ""Election-related servers WERE NOT recently seized in Europe by the US Army contrary to #disinfo rapidly spreading across social media,"" Krebs wrote. Scytl and Dominion share no ties, according to statements from both companies. A Facebook post shares an electoral map that shows Trump beating Biden with 410 electoral votes, and says that people in Germany saw these real results before ""Dominion’s servers were seized."" The map is not legitimate and was aired by a U.S. pro-Trump cable network. There’s also no evidence of a U.S.-election related raid or server seizure in Germany. We rate this Pants on Fire!

Blunt’s wrong: Trump did not get the highest minority vote percentage in 100 years
","President Donald Trump found some success attracting the support of non-white voters in the 2020 election. So much, in fact, that early reports said he made history.  Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., affirmed Trump’s gains with the minority population in a Nov. 24 interview with the Southeast Missourian. ""The president got the highest percentage of minority votes of any Republican candidate for president in over 100 years,"" Blunt said. According to exit polls, in 2004 President George W. Bush did better than Trump with non-white voters.  Exit poll voting data is readily accessible on the internet.  Between the Civil War and the 1930s, the Republican Party performed better than Democrats did with Black voters. The shift to the Democratic Party began during the Great Depression, but the most rapid change occurred in 1964, when Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater denounced the Civil Rights Act that had passed that year. Since then, the party alignment has looked much as we know it today: non-whites have mainly voted for Democratic presidential candidates. According to exit polls from the 2020 election, President Donald Trump received 12% of the Black vote. When looking back on data from the Roper Center for Public Opinion and Research, there have been numerous candidates who performed better than Trump among Black voters over the last century. Richard Nixon received 15% of the vote in 1968, Gerald Ford got 17% in 1976, and Ronald Reagan won 14% in 1980.  Trump can’t claim historic success with Asian and Hispanic voters, either. Using the same data from the Roper Center, Asian voters selected George H.W. Bush in 1992 at an overwhelming rate of 55% percent. In 1994, 1996, 2000, and 2004, all the Republican candidates garnered larger percentages of the Asian vote than President Trump’s 34%.  As for Latino voters, Trump won 32% of the vote, which trails both elections won by Ronald Reagan (37% and 34%) and George W. Bush (35% and 34%).  If you put all minority voters together, however, President Donald Trump’s performance was notable. He won an estimated 26% of the overall minority vote, which ranks as the second best showing in the past 100 years by a Republican candidate, trailing only the 2004 election in which George W. Bush received 28% of the vote. Blunt said, ""The president got the highest percentage of minority votes of any Republican candidate for president in over 100 years.""  Trump received 26% of the overall non-white vote, but George W.

NC Congressman wrong about marijuana reducing IQ
","Only five Republicans supported a House bill that would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. Congressman David Rouzer was not among them.  The legislation — if passed by the Senate and signed by the president — would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and eliminate criminal penalties for people who carry or distribute small amounts, CNN reports. The House passed it 228-164 on Dec. 4. Rouzer, who represents southeastern North Carolina, used Twitter to announce his displeasure with the House vote. ""As @HouseDemocrats push marijuana legalization instead of small business COVID-19 relief, remember: the @NIH states that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points (which may be irreversible) and impairs memory and learning,"" Rouzer tweeted. First, we should note that the House did pass a bill in October that authorized more financial support for small businesses through the HEROES Act. But here we focus on another part of the claim: Is it true that the National Institutes of Health, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, says ""regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points""? The topic is relevant in North Carolina, where a task force appointed by Gov. Roy Cooper recommends decriminalizing marijuana as part of a push for racial justice. Turns out, Rouzer overstates the effect of marijuana on the brain and the NIH’s position.  John Elizandro, Rouzer’s communications director and senior adviser, referred PolitiFact NC to a report compiled by the NIH in July. The 42-page report addresses available information on both the health benefits and potential detriments of marijuana use, including whether it can diminish someone’s IQ. The report specifically mentions a large study in New Zealand, which found that ""persistent marijuana use disorder with frequent use starting in adolescence was associated with a loss of an average of 6 or up to 8 IQ points measured in mid-adulthood. Those who used marijuana heavily as teenagers and quit using as adults did not recover the lost IQ points."" What Rouzer doesn’t mention in his tweet is that the findings applied only to smokers who began using during their adolescence. The report says of the New Zealand study: ""People who only began using marijuana heavily in adulthood did not lose IQ points."" Furthermore, Rouzer ignores language in the NIH report that explicitly states that more research is needed to establish a link between marijuana use and a decline in IQ points. The report summarizes research this way: ""Some studies have also linked marijuana use to declines in IQ, especially when use starts in adolescence and leads to persistent cannabis use disorder into adulthood. However, not all of the studies on the link between marijuana and IQ have reached the same conclusion, and it is difficult to prove that marijuana causes a decline in IQ when there are multiple factors that can influence the results of such studies, such as genetics, family environment, age of first use, frequency of use, having a cannabis use disorder, duration of use, and duration of the study."" The NIH webpage summarizing the report mentions other reasons links are hard to establish. Different strains of marijuana have varying levels of THC, the main active ingredient in cannabis, the NIH says, and the ability to draw definitive conclusions about marijuana’s long-term impact on the brain ""is often limited by the fact that study participants use multiple substances, and there is often limited data about the participants’ health or mental functioning prior to the study."" The report mentions another study, which tracked 4,000 people over a 25-year period. It found that lifetime exposure to marijuana affected memory ""but did not affect other cognitive abilities such as processing speed or executive function."" We contacted the NIH about its view of marijuana’s effect on a user’s IQ levels. Spokeswoman Simona Combi said the NIH believes more research is needed.  ""The New Zealand study mentioned here has limitations that limit our ability to draw definitive conclusions from it,"" Combi said in an email. ""Per the report, not all studies have come to the same conclusion, and more research will be needed to answer definitively whether marijuana use causes long-term IQ losses."" Rouzer said the ""NIH states that regular marijuana use can reduce IQ by 8 points."" The NIH itself has not actually established a link between marijuana use and loss of IQ points — and it says so explicitly in the report Rouzer cited.  Rouzer cherry-picked a stat in a study from another country. He then mischaracterized it as the NIH’s findings and tweeted it without proper context, failing to note that it applied only to people who started marijuana use in their adolescence. His tweet contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Many Americans say they don’t want a vaccine. Should we be worried?
","A vaccine to prevent coronavirus infections is tantalizingly close, with the first inoculations in the United States weeks or even days away. But concern persists that not enough Americans will be willing to be vaccinated to fully halt the virus’ spread. President-elect Joe Biden raised this concern during a Dec. 3 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. When Tapper asked whether Biden planned to be vaccinated before he’s inaugurated on Jan. 20, Biden said he would. ""People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work,"" Biden said. ""Already, the numbers are really staggeringly low. And it matters what a president and a vice president do. … And it's important to communicate to the American people it's safe to do this."" We interviewed seven experts for this story. They expressed disappointment with Americans’ relatively low willingness to take the vaccine so far, and they were especially concerned about deeper skepticism of a vaccine among racial minorities. But they added that these early findings do not mean that the effort is doomed. Most of the polling so far has asked about a vaccine that was still theoretical. Now, several vaccines have been presented to regulators with strong initial results, and if the initial rollouts are smooth — and if targeted educational efforts begin to have an effect — the experts expect Americans to become more comfortable with taking a vaccine. (The Biden campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Since May, at least seven pollsters have taken a look at Americans’ willingness to receive a coronavirus vaccine.  Most polls have found between 50% and 70% of respondents willing to get vaccinated. (Some of the differences may stem from differences in how the question was worded in each poll.)   Respondents’ stated willingness to receive the vaccine fell in the summer and the early fall before recovering somewhat in October and November. Observers said this might have to do with early, positive results for several vaccine trials — making a vaccine less theoretical to Americans — or relief among Democratic survey respondents that Joe Biden will be president during most of the vaccine rollout, rather than Donald Trump. To understand the public’s wariness about a coronavirus vaccine, it helps to take into account ""the politicization of the virus and seemingly everything surrounding it, as well as the level of misinformation being circulated,"" said Jason Salemi, an associate professor of public health at the University of South Florida. While less-than-optimal levels of vaccination will still help ease the pandemic, epidemiologists say that something approaching full eradication can occur only if most people receive their shots. ""Given what we know about the virus so far, we are going to need higher proportions of people to take the vaccine then who are now saying they will for protection to occur on a population level,"" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor in Claremont Graduate University’s school of community and global health. An especially important issue is that some subgroups of the population are less welcoming of a coronavirus vaccine than the public at large. While 33% of white respondents to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll said they would probably not or definitely not take the vaccine, the rates were higher for Hispanics (37%) and Blacks (49%). A survey by the COVID Collaborative found that 14% of Black respondents and 34% of Hispanic respondents said they mostly or completely trust that a vaccine will be safe. Only 18% of Black respondents and 40% of Hispanic respondents said they mostly or completely trust that a vaccine will be effective. Most analysts attribute the hesitancy about vaccines in the Black community to a legacy of unethical medical experimentation, as well as longstanding disparities in the quality of health care available to racial minorities. ""There are historical reasons that justify that caution and skepticism,"" said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine, health policy and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University.  If Black Americans do end up forgoing vaccination at especially high rates, it could be especially problematic, since rates of illness and death from COVID-19 have been higher for Blacks than for whites. One reason for this may be their added risk of exposure. ""Minority groups are overrepresented among essential workers, and these are groups that are among the most important for the vaccine to reach,"" Gatto said. Before assuming widespread vaccine skepticism will lead to poor vaccination rates, it’s worth noting some context. Flu vaccination coverage among adults in the United States has fluctuated between 37% and 48% in the past decade, Salemi said. Compared against the widely available vaccine for the flu, the survey data for a coronavirus vaccine is ""not ‘staggering,’"" Salemi said.  In addition, there’s evidence that older Americans — those who are more susceptible to the virus’ worst impacts — are more willing to get vaccinated. For instance, a CNN poll in October found that 60% of those age 65 and older said they would try to get a vaccine, compared with 49% among those younger than 45.  And history suggests that concerted public education campaigns can help boost low public confidence. ""Successful mass-vaccination campaigns have been carried out previously in the United States, including for polio in the 1950s and more recently for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,"" said Matthew B. Laurens, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. ""Maintenance of public trust will depend on clear messages to the public regarding vaccine benefits and side effects, transparency of vaccine developers and researchers regarding what is known and is not known about available vaccines for COVID-19, and continuous engagement and dialogue with communities and individuals."" Campaigns can work well by leveraging community members, faith leaders, celebrities and athletes — ""people who can demonstrate by example,"" Gatto said. Ultimately, though, one of the biggest factors driving lower-than-desired public approval of a coronavirus vaccine is simply an understandable caution about trying something new. ""A dose of healthy skepticism is normal,"" Schaffner said. ""These are new vaccines with new technologies against a new virus.""  Experts agree that the public’s view of vaccines can change, since Americans are being bombarded every day by new information about the virus and possible vaccines. ""We have to be realistic about the ebb and flow as more information comes out about the particular vaccines — how the initial vaccination efforts go, and what happens to the first folks taking it,"" said Mollyann Brodie, executive vice president for public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Even today, we don't yet have a vaccine that has been given the green light by the FDA, and most of these surveys were taken before data from Moderna and Pfizer were released,"" added Tara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist.  Experts express cautious optimism that a smooth rollout will ease concerns among Americans who are currently reluctant. ""I do think the comfort level with the vaccine will indeed increase over time,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. Also important to remember ""is that we have some time,"" Schaffner said. ""We can’t vaccinate everybody in a week and a half."" Biden said, ""People have lost faith in the ability of the vaccine to work. Already, the numbers are really staggeringly low."" Experts agree that the initial percentages of Americans saying they’re willing to take the vaccine are lower than would be ideal to fully eradicate the coronavirus, and that the numbers are especially low among racial and ethnic minorities even though those groups have been hit disproportionately by the pandemic. However, experts aren’t despairing yet, because they see public opinion as fluid and likely to be shaped by new information, including regulatory approvals and the rollout of the actual vaccines. History has also shown that concerted educational efforts can help increase comfort with new vaccines.

No, a Danish study didn’t prove wearing masks is ineffective
","Public health officials have long recommended wearing face-coverings to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  But some who oppose measures such as mask mandates are pointing to a study conducted in Denmark in April and May as evidence that masks are ineffective against the virus.  ""The first randomized controlled trial of more than 6,000 individuals to assess the effectiveness of surgical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection found masks did not statistically significantly reduce the incidence of infection,"" reads one viral Instagram post that features an excerpt from a longer blog post on the same topic. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s and Instagram’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on News Feeds. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Instagram claim misconstrues the results of the study, published Nov. 18 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  First, it’s important to note that the public health recommendation in favor of wearing masks hinges on evidence that masks help minimize spread of respiratory droplets from reaching others through the air. But the Denmark study was focused on the results for the wearer. It was designed ""to assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon,"" according to the study’s abstract. Researchers assigned roughly 6,000 people who left their homes at least three hours a day to two groups. Members of one group were given a box of 50 surgical masks and told to wear a mask whenever they went outside of their homes. Members of the other group were not told to wear masks — but, like the mask group, they were encouraged to follow safety recommendations made by Danish officials at the time, which included things like social distancing. After a month, the researchers used antibody tests, PCR tests or hospital diagnoses of COVID-19 to determine if participants had been infected with the virus.  The study concluded that recommending people wear surgical masks ""did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use.""  It is important to note the phrase, ""by more than 50%"" in the researchers’ findings. The study was designed to examine whether the masks provided high levels of personal protection. That would have been evidenced by significantly reducing the infection rate for those wearing masks. But this was not what researchers found.  Even so, the study’s researchers also concluded that the data suggested mask wearing did lead to ""lesser degrees of self-protection"" — not that they had no protective benefits for wearers at all. One of the researchers, Henning Bundgaard, a professor of cardiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said publicly that the study should not be used to discourage mask wearing.  ""Even a small degree of protection is worth using the face masks, because you are protecting yourself against a potentially life-threatening disease,"" Bundgaard told Forbes. The study was published alongside two editorials also in the Annals of Medicine that contextualized the researchers’ findings.  The first editorial was written by doctors who serve as Annals of Internal Medicine editors, including editor in chief Christine Laine, associate statistics editor Steven Goodman and deputy statistics editor Eliseo Guallar. The experts noted that the study was ""designed to examine only the masks' protective effect,"" and was not to examine whether wearing a mask prevents the spread of COVID-19 if the individual wearing the mask is the infected ""source,"" who would be spreading the virus. The experts also noted that the study ""examined the effect of recommending mask use, not the effect of actually wearing them."" People do not always listen to public health recommendations, they said. Additionally, experts said the effectiveness of masks depends on other factors, such as the prevalence of the virus and the adherence to social distancing. The other editorial was also penned by two doctors: former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, and Shama Cash-Goldwasser, a senior adviser at Resolve To Save Lives. Their organization aims to help governments prevent deaths from disease and epidemics.  Frieden and Cash-Goldwasser said no one method would be enough to end the pandemic on its own, but ""widespread masking in the community can mitigate spread"" as part of a larger set of protocols. ""Masks have been shown to protect others and, despite the reported results of this study, probably protect the wearer,"" the two experts wrote. ""If everyone wears a mask when near others, everyone is safer."" Other fact-checking organizations have debunked similar claims about the Danish study.  The CDC recently released a scientific brief focused on the use of cloth masks to control the spread of the coronavirus. ""Experimental and epidemiological data support community masking to reduce the spread,"" the CDC said. ""The prevention benefit of masking is derived from the combination of source control and personal protection for the mask wearer."" The CDC also noted in its brief that more research is needed to ""expand the evidence base"" on how much protection cloth masks offer to the wearer. Regardless of how protective masks are for the individual wearing them, the CDC was clear: ""adopting universal masking policies can help avert future lockdowns, especially if combined with other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, hand hygiene, and adequate ventilation.""  Our ruling Social media posts claim, ""The first randomized controlled trial of more than 6,000 individuals to assess the effectiveness of surgical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection found masks did not statistically significantly reduce the incidence of infection.""  The study concluded that wearing masks did not offer a very high level of personal protection to mask wearers in communities where wearing masks was not common practice. The study noted, however, that the data suggested masks provided some degree of self-protection.

Do states verify citizenship of voters in federal elections?
","One of President Donald Trump’s many recent complaints about the U.S. election system is that states are lax in securing their voter rolls. ""Most Americans would also be shocked to learn that no state in the country verifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federal elections,"" Trump said in his 46-minute speech overflowing with falsehoods about voter fraud. ""This is a national disgrace."" Trump has made false statements about noncitizen voters since his 2016 campaign, relying on faulty evidence. He’s revived the talking point in the weeks since the Nov. 3 election, which he lost to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. In this case, he has a point that the federal form that registers someone to vote doesn’t require documentation to show proof of citizenship. But Trump left out the efforts by many states to cross-check their records with available data to avoid this problem.  People who wish to register to vote must attest under penalty of perjury that they are citizens and eligible to vote, according to federal law. Both the federal registration form and state versions warn that making false statements is a crime and that noncitizens should not fill out the form. The consequences for noncitizens registering or voting include deportation, incarceration or fines. Noncitizens risk that a government official will check their voting record during a background check if they apply for naturalization.  ""So anyone who’s not a citizen, and lies, is setting themselves up not only for future prosecution, but tanking their ability to become a citizen some day,"" said Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt. In an Arizona voting case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states are obligated to permit registration for federal elections using the federal form, which does not require documentary proof of citizenship. States may have their own form, but they must be willing to accept the federal form. Trump’s spokesperson didn’t respond to our request for evidence, but he specified ""federal elections"" in his statement. It’s not apparent from Trump’s claim, but many states have tried various means of confirming the citizenship status of voters. These methods have not been foolproof and have led to some errors and legal fights.  Some states have permission to use a federal resource of data, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, for the purposes of verifying that voter registration applicants are citizens. Implemented in 1987 and administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government benefits, such as Medicaid. SAVE , is not a database of people who are U.S. citizens, but it will show a person’s immigration or citizenship status. Arizona and Colorado election officials told us that they use SAVE. Florida tried, but it did not go well. Florida election officials briefly used SAVE in 2012 as part of a voter purge effort, but it wrongly flagged many voters including a Brooklyn-born World War II veteran. The state scrapped the effort. Some states look at driver’s license records to see whether any noncitizens also registered to vote. But driver’s license records can be outdated and may not reflect if a noncitizen later became a naturalized citizen. That’s part of why an effort in Texas to find noncitizen voters fell apart in 2019. Wendy Underhill, an election expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that in some states, driver’s license records are better for verifying citizenship than they’ve ever been. Some state driver’s license systems are set up to ask a person if they want to register to vote only after they have shown a birth certificate or naturalization paper that proves citizenship.  We contacted election officials in a few states to ask what steps they take to verify that voters are citizens. In Colorado, election officials review the entire voter registration database to see if anyone is registered who showed a non-U.S. credential to receive a driver’s license. The state uses the SAVE database as needed.  In Georgia, applications for voter registration are compared with data from the state Department of Driver Services and the Social Security Administration. In cases where the information does not match or an applicant is flagged as a noncitizen, the application is moved to pending status, and the applicant is notified as to how to resolve it, said Joe Sorenson, a spokesperson for Gwinnett County, outside Atlanta. The steps include a list of acceptable documents for proof of citizenship that can be submitted immediately or when they vote. They are not moved to the voter rolls until they can prove citizenship.  Four states have laws on the books that require additional proof of citizenship to register at the time of application, but only Arizona’s is actually in effect, said Dale Ho, director of the voting rights project at the ACLU.  In Arizona, applicants using the state registration form must provide proof of citizenship to be a ""full ballot"" voter to cast votes in local, state and federal races. That proof can be a state-issued ID such as a driver’s license, as long as they obtained it while they were citizens, or other forms such as naturalization documents, birth certificate or passport. If the applicant provides a driver’s license number, election officials will verify their citizenship using state motor vehicle records. If applicants attest that they are citizens but provide no proof and the state can’t verify their citizenship, those applicants can vote in federal races only. About 25,000 of the state’s 4.2 million voters are ""federal only"" voters. Kansas, Alabama and Georgia also have laws requiring documentary proof, but none is in effect, Ho said. Kansas’ law was struck down in federal court in April; Alabama and Georgia never enforced their laws.   A spokesperson for the Kansas secretary of state told us that they don’t independently verify proof of citizenship. Trump said, ""No state in the country verifies United States citizenship as a condition for voting in federal elections."" The kernel of truth here is that the federal form to register to vote doesn’t require documentation to prove citizenship. But applicants who use that federal form, or register using state forms, must attest to being citizens. Voter registration forms warn applicants that signing the form with false information is a crime. There have been scattered cases of non-citizens who cast ballots, but among millions of votes cast they are statistically rare. Some states told us that they access federal or state databases to verify citizenship of voters. Such methods have sometimes erroneously flagged citizen voters. While they are not foolproof, they do contradict Trump’s claim that no states verify U.S. citizenship for federal elections. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097255FC0>],/factchecks/2020/dec/07/donald-trump/do-states-verify-citizenship-voters-federal-electi/

Wisconsin Sen. Stroebel misfires with claim CDC admits old ‘science’ was wrong on COVID quarantine
","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a change in guidance on coronavirus quarantines earlier this week, which could ease the strain on people who are exposed to the virus but need to get back to work or other responsibilities.  In the updated guidance, released Dec. 2, the CDC said an exposed person who lives in a community with adequate testing can quarantine seven days instead of 14 provided they test negative for the virus at some point in the last two days of their quarantine. Quarantine could end after 10 days without a test if the person watches for symptoms of the virus and has none, the guidance adds. The person is expected to continue symptom-monitoring and wearing a mask for the full two-week stretch.  It sounds like good news, but state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Cedarburg, didn’t seem to take it that way.  ""CDC admits old ‘science’ was wrong, says new ‘science’ is only a 7-day quarantine after close contact followed by no symptoms and negative test, 10-day quarantine w/o testing and no symptoms,"" Stroebel tweeted Dec. 3, along with a link to the new information.  But it’s actually the senator who is wrong. Here’s why. The move came as the CDC acknowledged that a 14-day quarantine is tough on some Americans, particularly those who need to get back to work in-person. Experts say a shorter quarantine may make people more likely to comply with staying home and more willing to work with public health employees to identify their close contacts so transmission can be cut off.  It also hones in on the period in which a person would be most capable of passing the virus on if they’d become infected. John Brooks, chief medical officer for the CDC’s coronavirus response, said people who quit quarantine after seven days carry just about a 5% risk of still passing the virus on, and those who stop after 10 days bear just 1% risk.    So the agency isn’t saying their previous guidance was wrong. In fact, their recommendation to quarantine for 14 days if it’s possible is still in effect. The new guidance simply provides two alternatives for people who are unable to wait.  ""Any option to shorten quarantine risks being less effective than the currently recommended 14-day quarantine,"" the guidance states.  Like others who have sought to downplay the seriousness of the virus, Stroebel is undermining scientific evidence by criticizing a change in what experts are saying.  While it certainly would have saved lives if we knew everything about COVID-19 as soon as it emerged, that’s just not how science works.  The world had never seen SARS-CoV-2 before early last year, so there’s a lot to learn about it. That means guidelines will change to keep us safest in accordance with what we’re learning.  Some examples:  Scientists determined early-on that masks help keep you from giving the virus to others. In November, the CDC released a bulletin saying for the first time that they may protect the wearer, too. This change is expected — it signals research progress being made.  In July, the World Health Organization announced that the virus may linger in the air in indoor spaces, a form of transmission it had previously called doubtful. Again, new scientific evidence helped bring this revelation to light. Inside hospitals, health care workers discovered that proning, a technique where patients lay on their stomachs to promote better lung expansion, can sometimes alleviate the need to put a patient on a ventilator, which was initially thought to be one of the most critical tools for a seriously ill coronavirus patient. Once again, this was a product of learning more about the virus.  This is how scientific research works all over the world. The Ebola virus, for example, was discovered in 1976, and scientists and public health officials were still studying and making changes to their approach when an outbreak arose in West Africa nearly 40 years later. It is extremely likely, if not inevitable, that we’ll still be learning about the novel coronavirus four decades from now, too. In response to an email asking for backup to the senator’s claim, policy director Brian Sikma said Stroebel believes public health recommendations should continue to be revised as more research and data add to our understanding of the virus.  ""Because science never stops questioning itself, public health officials and policymakers should be transparent in their recommendations and avoid broad, absolute statements when actual knowledge is still evolving,"" Sikma wrote. That reflects an acknowledgement of the scientific process that Stroebel’s claim did not. But it also provides no evidence of his claim. Stroebel claimed the CDC admitted it was wrong about its previous recommendation that people who were exposed to the virus should quarantine for 14 days.  But they adjusted the guidance because scientists learned more about its contagious period, and because they wanted to make it easier for people to stay home. A 14-day quarantine is still their recommended route, if people can make it work. The CDC guidance remains in place, so it wasn’t ""wrong,"" and there was no admission. We rate Stroebel’s claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809764CDC0>],/factchecks/2020/dec/07/duey-stroebel/wisconsin-sen-stroebel-misfires-claim-cdc-admits-o/
