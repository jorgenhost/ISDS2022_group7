No, Hillary Clinton isn't furious at Melania Trump over hospital gift
","A provocative headline suggested beef between first lady Melania Trump and Hillary Clinton. ""Hillary Clinton furious at ‘special gift’ Melania Trump sent her from her hospital bed,"" said a May 17 headline on Any Politics, a website crowded with clickbait headlines. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump underwent kidney surgery to treat a benign condition at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on May 14. But there is no credible reporting to suggest she sent any gifts while at the hospital, nor that they sparked Clinton’s indignation. A sincere thank you to Walter Reed Medical Unit @WRBethesda & to all who have send good wishes & prayers! I am feeling great & look forward to getting back home @WhiteHouse soon. Another blog post claimed that President Donald Trump was planning to donate his kidney to his wife. That story was also made up. The story provides no evidence of the gift, and no major news outlets reported anything about it. The story did, however, get something right: the popularity of Melania as a baby name. The name came in fifth among the fastest-growing girls’ names, leaping from spot 1,650 in 2016 to 930 in 2017, according to Social Security data. But that doesn’t support the ridiculous headline.

Website falsely claims Jeff Sessions 'caught colluding with Obama'
","A website called the Conservative Patriot falsely claimed Attorney General Jeff Sessions was ""caught colluding with Obama."" There are no legitimate news reports to back up the headline of the April 1 post published on theconspatriot.com, and the story does not offer any evidence either. The Justice Department declined to comment. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed.

The Conservative Patriot’s story recaps President Donald Trump’s displeasure with Sessions’s recusal from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians. The story includes comments on Fox News’ Hannity from legal and political analyst Gregg Jarrett, who said Sessions ""betrayed the president"" because he didn’t tell him that he would recuse himself from the investigation. In the same interview, Sara Carter, a Fox news contributor, said Sessions ""was being advised badly"" at the time, and Jarrett interjected to say, ""by Obama’s holdovers."" In March 2017, Sessions said he consulted ""senior officials"" about his role in the investigation and that ""my staff recommend recusal."" In a press release, Sessions said he ""met with the relevant senior career Department officials"" and after meetings, decided to recuse himself from investigations related to the campaigns for presidency. Still, that does not prove ""colluding with Obama."" Here’s what Sessions then said in a press conference about the recusal: ""I have been here just three weeks today. A lot has been happening in this three-week period. I wish I'd had more of my staff on board, but we're still waiting for confirmation for them. ""Much has been done. Much needs to be done. But I did and have done as I promised. I have met with senior officials shortly after arriving here. We evaluated the rules of ethics and recusal. I have considered the issues at stake. … ""I asked for their candid and honest opinion about what I should do about investigations, certain investigations. And my staff recommended recusal. They said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation. I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation. I believe those recommendations are right and just. Therefore, I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign.""

Is the Mueller probe costing $20 million, as Donald Trump says?
","President Donald Trump has criticized the special counsel investigation headed by Robert Mueller on a variety of grounds. In a recent tweet, he took it to task for its price tag. On May 20, he tweeted: ""At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption..."" ....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption... Trump’s tweet caught our eye, because it doubled his estimate of the Mueller probe’s cost from $10 million just five days earlier. Trump echoed a comment by one of his lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, that pegged the figure at $20 million. Is the Mueller probe really approaching $20 million? It does if you use the most aggressive accounting method. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The Mueller investigation is being funded through mandatory spending, which essentially means it is set up to be free of executive branch influence. However, Justice Department officials do have a degree of oversight to make sure that money isn’t wasted, as with any other department office. Mueller’s office has released one accounting of its expenses so far. The report was released in December 2017, and it covered the first four and a half months of the probe, from May 17-Sept. 30, 2017. According to the report, the Mueller investigation spent $3.2 million directly during that period. The biggest category was $1.7 million for staff salaries and benefits, while the second-largest was for equipment. Smaller categories included travel, rent, utilities and supplies. If you prorate that amount out to a full year—the approximate length of the investigation at the time Trump sent his tweet — it would come to about $8.5 million spent so far. That’s well below the $20 million Trump cited. As it happens, Congress and the White House projects that the Mueller investigation will be racking up costs at an even faster clip than what has been reported so far. The special counsel’s office is officially budgeted for $10.4 million in direct costs for fiscal year 2018 (running from Oct. 1, 2017, to Sept. 30, 2018), and the Trump administration has earmarked another $10.4 million in its budget request for fiscal year 2019 (running from Oct. 1, 2018 to Sept. 30, 2019). If the investigation ends up spending at this pace, it’s possible that it could eventually surpass $20 million in direct costs. That would be speculative, however, because that would occur months in the future, and because we don’t know whether the investigation will keep spending money at the same rate. Using a different accounting method, however, the $20 million projected cost isn’t implausible. A footnote in the report says that the investigation has also incurred $3.5 million in indirect costs, a category it says is ""neither legally required"" for disclosure nor reported in filings by previous special counsels. Mueller’s office argues that these indirect expenses don’t amount to additional taxpayer expenditures, since these resources — especially personnel, such as employees of the FBI or other agencies — would have been devoted to other cases if there had been no special counsel investigation. However, if you do count the indirect expenses, the total comes to $6.7 million spent during those first four and a half months. Prorated to cover the investigation’s full first year, the total of direct and indirect expenses reaches $17.9 million. That's not too far off from $20 million. Here’s a summary of what’s been spent by, authorized for, and requested for the Mueller investigation so far: Fiscal year Start date End Date Direct spending Indirect spending Total spent Authorized (direct only) Requested (direct only) 2017 May 17, 2017 Sept. 30, 2017 $3.2 million $3.5 million $6.7 million $3.9 million -- 2018 Oct. 1, 2017 Sept. 30, 2018 Not yet reported Not yet reported Not yet reported $10.4 million -- 2019 Oct. 1, 2018 Sept. 30, 2019 -- -- -- -- $10.4 million The investigation of President Bill Clinton over Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky — headed by Kenneth Starr and then by his successor, Robert Ray — cost upward of $52 million over half a decade. Another $40 million-plus went toward a handful of other Clinton-era independent counsel investigations. Meanwhile, the investigation of Reagan administration officials over the Iran-Contra Affair, headed by Lawrence Walsh, topped out at more than $47 million over a roughly similar period. Those figures are direct costs only, and are not adjusted for inflation. Their price tags would be far higher when converted to 2018 dollars. Trump tweeted that the Mueller investigation will soon be $20 million. Officially, it’s not costing that much. Counting direct costs only, as Justice Department and executive branch accounting rules specify, the investigation’s first year cost an estimated $8.5 million, assuming Mueller’s team continued to spend at the same rate it did for the first four and a half months. (It could be months before we have updated figures.) However, with the addition of indirect costs, the first year would be expected to cost a prorated $17.9 million, which is within shouting distance of the $20 million Trump cited.

No, CNN isn't closing after ratings drop
","CNN’s ratings drop in one week has caused the TV network to shut down, a false story on Facebook said. ""CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent,"" said a May 18 headline on Your News Wire. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. Your News Wire, a website that often posts misleading and fake news, repeated information from the conservative website Breitbart, which celebrated a recent drop in CNN’s ratings. Your News Wire used real data from Ad Week to show a 29 percent primetime rating drop during the second week of May compared to the same week last year. Then the story declared that as a result of the ""nosedive"" in ratings ""the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end."" The story included a photo of what appears to be a CNN studio going up in flames but had no evidence that the network has shut down or plans to do so. CNN spokespersons didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. While a ratings drop or spike by a network can be used by networks to boast about their position, ratings for a short period of time don’t reveal much about a network’s viability. Networks sell ads on longer-term data, so a drop in ratings over a couple of weeks may not mean much. Ratings also must be examined based on news events during the time period in question -- it's built into the business model that some news weeks are slower than others. For example, during the week of May 8-14, 2017, President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified to a Senate panel about Michael Flynn, a former Trump adviser, in the Russia saga. The idea that CNN would shut down is a bit of a fantasy for conservatives who share Trump’s allegation that the network is ""fake news."" While Trump uses the term ""fake news"" to describe news coverage that is unsympathetic to his administration and his performance, at PolitiFact we refer to fake news as fabricated content that intentionally masquerades as news coverage of actual events. Statements by Trump have been named PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year award twice. Your News Wire said in a headline ""CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent.""

This Democratic candidate for governor says he lives in Milwaukee, but that's misleading
","When businessman Andy Gronik filed papers to run for governor, he listed his residence as N. Beach Drive in Fox Point, an upscale suburb in Milwaukee County. Gronik’s Twitter account and campaign website also say he lives in Fox Point, where his home has an assessed value of $1.4 million. But Gronik portrayed himself as much more urban at a May 13, 2018, education forum for the Democratic candidates for governor, which was co-hosted by the Milwaukee teachers union and partly focused on central city kids. He went so far as to say: ""I’ve lived (in Milwaukee) all 61 years of my life."" What’s going on here? When it comes to living in Fox Point or Milwaukee, Gronik seems to want it both ways. ‘Our neighborhood’ in MKE Gronik and lawyer Matt Flynn were the only candidates on the dais at one point during the forum, which was held at a theater on Milwaukee’s east side -- where Flynn has lived for nearly 40 years. In a wide-open primary contest with a crowded field, connecting with voters in heavily Democratic Milwaukee is important. Gronik and Flynn were asked their position on choice (also known as voucher) schools, which are focused on central city Milwaukee families who are unhappy with their neighborhood public schools, not suburban families. Flynn made it a point to say he is the only gubernatorial candidate who lives in the city. When it was his turn, Gronik said he would gradually wind down voucher schools in the city -- and suggested he lives in Milwaukee. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Gronik said: So, for me as governor, I’m going to focus resources on public schools -- and hear me on this -- stop the expansion of vouchers, sunset those things over five years. We have a real plan to make it happen. But I’m going to also make sure that we’re not taking any kid out of a productive learning environment until that school in their neighborhood is the best choice.  I want to put it in just stark terms here, because I did speak to parents all throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee. And I’ll give it to you in just blank terms here. Black families are sick of white people telling them where to send their kids to school; that’s just the reality. So I am going to be a governor that’s going to fight for every kid. We have lost generations --  generations of children -- and we’re not losing another generation on my watch. So, in the context of choice schools in the city, Gronik says he ""did speak to parents throughout our neighborhood in Milwaukee."" And the neighborhoods that he refers to as having ""lost generations"" of children are in Milwaukee. Not his neighborhood in Fox Point. ‘I’ve lived here’ A few minutes later, responding to a question about supporting unions for teachers, Gronik again gave the impression he lives in the city, saying: We need to make sure that we restore teachers’ voices in that classroom, (that) we spend more one-on-one time with those kids, that we have the resources to help kids that are at-risk; that before we lose another generation of children in my neighborhood, too -- I’ve lived here all 61 years of my life. And I’ve watched what’s happened with kids throughout these neighborhoods, our neighborhoods, kids that do not have the kind of bright future that they should have. It’s a huge reason I’m here. Again, Gronik’s reference to a lost generation, and to kids lacking a bright future, is to kids in the city, not ""in my neighborhood"" in Fox Point. Latest Gronik fact checks:
""Black Americans still earn less than 73 percent of what white men make."" Half True. Wisconsin 'guaranteeing' nearly $3 billion to Foxconn with no job guarantees. Half True. Scott Walker ""has taken money away from internet expansion in our state."" Mostly False. His explanation Gronik promptly called us when we told his campaign spokesman that we would be fact checking his claim that he’s lived in Milwaukee his whole life. He started off by acknowledging that he grew up in Glendale, another Milwaukee County suburb, and lives in Fox Point. Gronik also told us: 1. ""As you well know, when I plug in my ZIP code (53217), it says Milwaukee."" If you run a Google search of Gronik’s street address, depending on the website you choose, some responses show Fox Point while others show Milwaukee. But that doesn’t change the fact that Gronik lives in Fox Point, not Milwaukee. 2. ""I consider Milwaukee to be my hometown. I’m not trying to suggest that I grew up other than where I grew up."" Gronik is trying to have it both ways -- saying he’s from Milwaukee, but not denying that he grew up in a suburb (and now lives in another suburb). 3. ""I’ve never made any bones about the fact that I live in Fox Point. I really think that you’re splitting hairs. I am in no way, shape or form misleading anybody as to my address. But I do consider everyone in Milwaukee County to be part of my community."" If Gronik were asked in an airport in Atlanta where he lives, saying Milwaukee would be fine; most people have not heard of Fox Point. But in speaking to Milwaukee teachers about Milwaukee schools, to say you’re from the city when you really live in a high-income suburb, is misleading. Our rating Gronik told an audience made up largely of Milwaukee teachers at an education forum in Milwaukee: ""I’ve lived here (in Milwaukee) all 61 years of my life."" Gronik acknowledged to us that he grew up in one Milwaukee suburb, Glendale, and now lives in another, upscale Fox Point. ""Milwaukee"" as sort of a blanket term for the city and its close-in suburbs is not entirely wrong. But in the context of Gronik’s claim, it’s misleading.

Congressman: deal ensured Iran could hit US with nuclear bomb
","Most congressional Republicans applauded as President Donald Trump announced plans to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement. Among them was Rep. David Rouzer, a Republican from southeastern North Carolina. Rouzer argued (accurately) on Twitter that Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism. But then he went a step further. ""The #irandeal ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US,"" Rouzer tweeted on May 8. PolitiFact has heard and reported on a lot of rhetoric surrounding the Iran deal, an agreement signed in 2015 by Iran, the United States, and other nations and championed by former President Barack Obama. In Rouzer’s claim about a nuclear bomb ""capable of reaching the U.S.,"" the word ""guaranteed"" stands out to us. We contacted Rouzer’s office and asked for evidence to support his claim. His staffer, Danielle Smotkin, referenced three people’s comments to support the congressman’s claim: In an April 2015 interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran was developing intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach the United States. In an August 2015 interview with an Iranian news outlet, a member of Iran’s negotiating team said Iran expected to reach ""complete industrial (uranium) enrichment"" eight years after the deal. In October 2017, Iranian Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari said Iran’s missiles can hit U.S. forces and interests within 2,000 kilometers, which is 1,200 miles. About that missile range: That means Iran is capable of reaching U.S. interests in the Middle East, but isn’t capable of striking the United States mainland — 7,200 miles away. (PolitiFact has written before about how likely it is that Iran will develop intercontinental ballistic missiles.) The Iran deal, officially titled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, puts a cap on how much uranium Iran can enrich until 2030. How it works As part of the deal, Iran drastically limited its ability to build a weapon by giving up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile when it signed the deal. Iran could also build a weapon with plutonium, but the agreement bans plutonium reactors for 15 years and stipulates that Iran must dismantle its current one. Some of the deal’s terms last forever, including a ban on nuclear weapon design and manufacturing. The Additional Protocol, separate inspection guidelines for the International Atomic Energy Agency, improves international oversight of nuclear fuel. It also allows broader inspections, such as collecting environmental samples at any location to detect radioactive materials. ""In fact, the text of the JCPOA explicitly states that ‘under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons’,"" said Elena Chachko, coordinator of Harvard’s Empirical Legal Studies Series and a doctoral student at its law school. So the deal, on paper, restricts Iran from building nuclear weapons. And so does an agreement among about 190 countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, Chachko said. ""As a non-nuclear-weapon state under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is banned from acquiring nuclear weapons under international law regardless of the JCPOA,"" she said. A broader point David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security, suggested that the public not judge Rouzer’s words in the literal sense. He agreed with Rouzer’s broader point that, years from now, Iran could have enough materials to secretly build a nuclear bomb. The Iran deal ""kicked the can down the road and did not settle the question of Iran building nuclear weapons,"" he said. Ian Williams, managing editor of Missile Threat, a product of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed. ""The deal does not completely block the path"" toward a nuclear bomb, Williams said. ""On a very fundamental level, it leaves them everything they would need,"" he said. However, the Iran deal ""definitely made it harder"" to make a bomb. However, ""the tweet is inaccurate. It makes it seem like, in 10 years, we will give them a nuclear weapon,"" Williams said. Our ruling Rouzer tweeted that the Iran deal ""ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US."" For one thing, the deal didn't promise Iran a nuclear weapon. In fact, language in the deal — and in the separate Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — bans Iran from possessing such a weapon. Experts acknowledge the deal didn't necessarily prevent Iran from getting the bomb — but said it made it more difficult. Further, Iran is currently limited to missile strikes within a 1,200-mile range, not nearly far enough to reach the United States.

Is the minimum wage worth less now than 50 years ago?
 ","  Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., took to Twitter recently to tout her support for a $15 minimum wage. In the tweet, Smith wrote that ""one of the proudest things I did"" as lieutenant governor serving under Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton was helping to raise Minnesota’s state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour. ""Now, I’m proud to back a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024,"" she wrote, referring to a measure introduced by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Patty Murray, D-Wash. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25, though states can set higher levels if they wish — and a majority do, from a small amount more than the federal level to $11.50 in Washington state. In a threaded tweet, Smith gave some historical perspective on the minimum wage: ""The federal minimum wage hasn’t been raised in a nearly a decade. Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago. And prices for everything from milk to prescriptions has skyrocketed."" The federal minimum wage hasn’t been raised in a nearly a decade. Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago. And prices for everything from milk to prescriptions has skyrocketed. We wondered if Smith was correct, so we looked at the data. Back in 1968, the minimum wage was set at $1.60. That is equivalent to $11.76 in today’s dollars, which is well above today’s minimum wage level and an all-time high when adjusted for inflation. (We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator for this purpose.) Over the last 50 years, the situation in 1968 — greater purchasing power for the minimum wage than today — has been common, though not universal. By contrast, we only found seven years in which today’s minimum wage is able to buy more than a previous minimum wage could. (Those years were 1989, 1995, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.) Here’s the full chart, with the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage shown in red: All told, then, the minimum wage has been worth more than it is today for 86 percent of the time over the past 50 years, and less than today’s during 14 percent of that time. Smith said, ""Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago."" Smith’s strict comparison with 50 years ago is accurate, and her comparison even holds for most years out of the past 50, suggesting that the year she picked is not an unreasonable choice.

No links between Ritalin and school shootings, as NRA's Oliver North claimed
","The National Rifle Association’s new president, Oliver North, deflected attention off guns and onto medication in the wake of the latest school shooting. ""The problem that we got is we are trying like the dickens to treat the symptom without treating the disease,"" North said. ""The disease in this case isn't the Second Amendment. The disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence. ""They have been drugged in many cases. Nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases. And they have come through a culture where violence is commonplace. All you need to do is turn on the TV, go to a movie,"" North continued. ""If you look at what has happened to the young people, many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten."" Pundits have long harped on the dangers of violence in movies, television shows and video games. But we were curious about the link North suggests between Ritalin, prescribed for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and gun violence. The overprescription of ADHD medication has been the subject of heavy debate. For the record, we found no evidence that the suspected Texas shooter was diagnosed with ADHD, or prescribed Ritalin. More broadly and to North’s point, we found no evidence to back up the idea that ADHD medication was behind school shootings or that ""many"" shooters had been on Ritalin. ""The short answer is that this is nonsense,"" said Katherine S. Newman, Torrey Little professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts and author of Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings. For Rampage, Newman and her fellow researchers studied medication as a precipitating factor in the school shootings that took place between 1970 and 2000. They found no evidence drugs played a role. ""​The vast majority of shooters were, sadly, not under any kind of medical supervision,"" Newman said. ""Indeed, the shocking finding is that despite evidence of serious mental disorders (after the fact at least), these young men had — in the main — not been seen by physicians for any kind of psychological disorder and were hence not under medication at all."" Peter Langman, a psychologist in private practice who has been studying school shootings for over a decade, said he has not found any ties between psychiatric medication and rampage attacks, either. Langman looked at 48 school shooters between 1966 and 2012 in his 2015 book School Shooters: Understanding High School, College, and Adult Perpetrators. Langman found that two of the 24 secondary school shooters he profiled were taking medication at the time of their attacks. A third shooter might have been, or he may have stopped his medication three weeks before the attack. Including that case, 12.5 percent of the shooters Langman studied were taking medication. The 12.5 percent statistic held true for the 48 shooters Langman studied, too, which also included adults and college students. Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA, sent along various stories about the overprescription of Ritalin. Only one was a scientific study mentioning both ADHD medication and violence. The study found that three ADHD drugs were responsible for 108 of 1,937 case reports of violence toward others in a 69-month period FDA database. But Russell Barkley, a clinical professor of psychiatry who monitors ADHD research weekly at the Virginia Treatment Center for Children, explained that the study does not control for the high probability that patients receiving treatment with these drugs were already highly aggressive to begin with. ""We have no research in our scientific literature of more than 50,000 articles showing that Ritalin increases aggression on average,"" Barkley said. ""Research in fact shows that stimulants like Ritalin reduce aggressive behavior in those with ADHD."" There is also no evidence that any of those reports of violence were related to school shootings. ""We don’t know that any of those people in the study had anything to do with a mass rampage attack,"" Langman said. ""Even if the drug gets people to get agitated or angry, there’s a difference between that and plotting and carrying out a mass murder."" North said, ""They have been drugged in many cases … many of these young boys have been on Ritalin since they were in kindergarten."" A minor percentage of school shooters studied had been medicated, not ""many."" The notion that many have specifically been on the drug Ritalin since kindergarten has no factual basis. More broadly, causation has never been established between the medication and violence. We found no specific ties between ADHD medication and school shootings, either.

Have more students been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones?
","  After a student gunman killed 10 people in Santa Fe, Texas, a claim circulated widely on social media that compared the number of deaths in the military with the number of deaths in school shootings. One of the politicians who shared it on social media was Gwen Graham, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House who is now running for governor of Florida. In a May 18 Facebook post, Graham wrote, ""So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones. We are WAY past the point of talking. We need action now."" Graham’s post linked to an article by Philip Bump of the Washington Post titled ""2018 has been deadlier for schoolchildren than service members."" The article found that ""more people have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while serving in the military."" We wanted to look at the data ourselves. Graham’s formulation was a bit narrower than the newspaper’s: Her  post said ""students"" rather than individuals ""at schools,"" and ""in combat zones"" rather than ""while serving in the military."" Either of the definitions is plausible; as it happens, Graham’s parameters make an even stronger case than the Post article does. We found five shooting incidents that resulted in student fatalities in 2018. The figures below do not include adults slain in these incidents, because they are outside the scope of Graham’s statement. Benton, Ky., Jan. 23, 2018: 2 students killed Parkland, Fla., Feb. 14, 2018: 14 students killed Birmingham, Ala., March 7, 2018: 1 student killed Great Mills, Md., March 20, 2018: 1 student killed Santa Fe, Texas, May 18, 2018: 8 students killed Total: 26 students killed in school shootings through May 18, 2018. (Including the adults killed would raise the count to 31 total fatalities.) There are two active combat operations for the U.S. military: Operation Inherent Resolve, which includes anti-ISIS efforts in Iraq and Syria, and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, which includes military activities in Afghanistan. In 2018, there have been five deadly incidents in Operation Inherent Resolve, on Jan. 8, Feb. 19, March 7, March 15, and March 30. Each of these incidents resulted in one American service member’s death, except for the one on March 15, in which seven airmen died in the crash of an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter in western Iraq. So the total number of deaths in 2018 for Operation Inherent Resolve is 11. Meanwhile, there have been two deaths this year in Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. They occurred on Jan. 1 and April 30. Total: 13 service members were killed in combat zones in 2018. That's half the number of student deaths in school shootings this year. The first caveat to consider is that today’s snapshot in time is unusual in recent history. Specifically, the number of school-shooting deaths is unusually high in 2018, according to the Post’s database of school shootings. Through May 18 of 2017, there were two deaths in school shootings. Through May 18 of 2016, it was one; for 2015 it was zero; and for 2014 it was one. Looking at full-year totals, the Post article found that the number of military deaths in 2017 exceeded 30, compared to five school-shooting deaths. The second caveat to know involves the death rate — that is, deaths divided by the total population at risk of death. The death rate remains significantly higher for members of the military in combat zones. There are currently an estimated 50.8 million students enrolled in K-12 classes. That’s vastly larger than the combination of personnel serving in the two military operations cited above, which is less than 20,000 people, according to publicly disclosed data. The Post article that Graham linked to made this point. ""The figures for 2018 do not suggest schools are more dangerous than combat zones,"" the article said. ""So far in 2018, a member of the military has been about 40 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting."" Graham wrote, ""So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones."" On the numbers, she is right. This year at least, within Graham’s stated parameters, exactly twice as many students have died in school shootings than military personnel have died in combat zones. It is important to know, however, the likelihood of being killed in a combat zone is still vastly higher than it is in a school. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFFBF40>],/factchecks/2018/may/21/gwen-graham/have-more-students-been-killed-schools-soldiers-co/

No evidence Santa Fe killer expressed love for Obama
","Within hours of the shooting at Santa Fe High School, fake news stories appeared on social media claiming that the shooter had clear political allegiances. ""Breaking: Santa Fe killer expresses his love for Obama,"" said a May 18 headline by The Daily World Update. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence that the suspect loved Obama. The story falsely said that ""Dimitrius Pagopogouritz is a liberal whose immigrant parents raised him on welfare in the projects of San Dimas."" The story invented a ""leaked interview with police"" in which the suspect ""admitted he was an Obama-loving moonbat who was looking to ‘end gun violence’ by adding another shooting."" The first sign that this is made up is that the suspect’s name is wrong; his actual name is Dimitrios Pagourtzis. The story also makes up all sorts of ridiculous details, including that suspect’s father is serving a life sentence for stealing ""6,000 pounds of tainted turkey bacon."" Law enforcement has not released information about a motive for the mass shooting that left 10 people dead. The mother of one victim said that her daughter had recently turned down the advances of the boy. The Daily World Update is linked to a frequent purveyor of hoaxes, Christopher Blair, who says he creates fake stories to make money. While Blair identifies The Daily World Update as satire, other blogs often pick up Blair’s stories without the satire asterisk.   Fake accounts imitating the suspect on Facebook also depicted him wearing a hat showing support for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid, with a background photo displaying a banner espousing anti-fascists, or Antifa, views.

Mo Brooks' incomplete comments on Antarctic ice
","It’s not every day that a hearing of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee goes viral, but that’s what happened on May 16, 2018, when a Republican lawmaker questioned aspects of climate change. The most frequently shared exchange from the hearing involved Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and a witness, Phil Duffy, the president and executive director of the Woods Hole Research Center. At one point, Brooks suggested that England’s White Cliffs of Dover and the California coastline are continually eaten away by erosion, perhaps driving a rise in sea levels that scientists ordinarily blame on melting ice. Others have debunked the idea that cliff erosion or sediment release from rivers constitutes a significant factor in sea level rise. (Philip Bump at the Washington Post estimated the current annual sea level increase of 3.3 millimeters would require, every year, ""a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States’ 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world’s oceans."") So we won’t go over the same territory. Instead, we decided to look at another comment from Brooks’ exchange with Duffy: Brooks: ""Would it surprise you to know that if global temperatures rise, assuming for the moment that they do, that that actually increases the amount of ice that is collected on Antarctica?"" Duffy: ""That’s not true, sir."" Brooks: ""I made a trip down to Antarctica and met with National Science Foundation scientists, and they all agreed with global warming, and they emphasize that you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming.… ""Do you understand that as temperatures rise, more moisture is contained in the atmosphere and then that moisture in Antarctica collects on land, and it takes hundreds and hundreds of years for that ice that is deposited on Antarctica to actually ever reach the shoreline where it touches the oceans where it can affect in some way sea level increases?"" Is it true, as Brooks said, that ""you’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming""? In a statement to PolitiFact, Brooks reiterated what he said he learned from the scientists in Antarctica, including those who believe that global warming is real. The increase in interior ice, he said the scientists told him, should ""offset the loss of Antarctic sea ice, Arctic sea ice, and whatever melting occurs in places like Greenland."" (Read Brooks’ full statement here,) However, more than a dozen scientists told PolitiFact that while Brooks is correctly describing one part of the complicated interplay around Antarctic climate change, whatever ice gains materialize from this process are almost certain to be overwhelmed by melting ice that he’s overlooking. What Brooks said ""is like talking about the money in your bank account by only looking at deposits and ignoring withdrawals,"" said Gary T. Mitchum, a professor and associate dean at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science. ""It’s just flawed. I sure wish I could get away with this at my bank."" How could ice increase due to global warming? It stems from the tendency for a warmer climate to produce more precipitation. In the context of Antarctica, this means increased amounts of frozen precipitation. ""On the whole, the amount of precipitation increases in the coldest climates as they warm,"" said John Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University atmospheric sciences professor. ""This comes about because the amount of moisture the atmosphere can hold -- and thus deliver as snow -- increases dramatically as the temperature warms."" In fact, there’s already evidence of this occurring in certain parts of Antarctica. One paper documenting this was written by Jay Zwally, a glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in 2015. He found significant increases in ice in eastern Antarctica. Zwally is considered a credible scientist, but other scientists said his methodology in the study is not foolproof. Critics suggest that much of the increase Zwally measured may be coming from additional snow rather than ice. Because ice contains more water than snow does, an increase in snow rather than ice would mean that Antarctica isn’t taking as much water out of circulation as the paper suggests. Indeed, a study using a different method, headed by Alba Martin-Español of the University of Bristol in England, concluded that the ice gains in eastern Antarctica were only about one-third as large as Zwally had found. An even more important point is that any ice gains need to be measured against losses elsewhere. To look only at the ice gains, as Brooks did, amounts to cherry picking. ""The important thing for science and policy is whether there's a net gain or loss of ice on Antarctica"" from all sources, Nielsen-Gammon said. Scientists we checked with agreed that, while Antarctica’s increased banking of water through precipitation is a real phenomenon, it pales in comparison with the amount of water being lost through melting. Basically, the continent may be adding ice in one place, but it’s losing a larger amount elsewhere due to melting, evaporation, or glaciers falling into the sea. ""Rep. Brooks is correct that one may expect an increase in precipitation in a warmer climate,"" said Justin C. Burton, a physicist at Emory University. ""However, this is a small feedback effect compared to melting from a warmer climate, and especially a warmer ocean."" For the past few decades, most scientific studies have shown that the net change in ice has produced shrinkage overall, not expansion, said Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. In western Antarctica, Scientific American has reported, ""the floating platforms of ice that ring the coast are thinning, glaciers are surging toward the sea, meltwater is flowing across the surface, fast-growing moss is turning the once shimmering landscape green, and a massive iceberg the size of Delaware broke off into the ocean in July of 2017."" ""The near unanimous view is that the net effect, by a pretty big margin, would be melting,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the joint program on the science and policy of global change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The fear, he said, is that ice ""will break loose and float out, raising sea level and in turn reduce the friction holding back ice on shore, which will then flow faster into the ocean."" Given this degree of melting, Scambos said, the likeliest impact from the increased snowfall that Brooks is pointing to would be to ""slow the pace of ice loss slightly,"" Scambos said. ""Greenland, which is somewhat more impacted by climate change, has not shown enough increase in precipitation to offset the very large peripheral losses in the past few decades."" Even beyond melting, sea level is increasing as the temperature warms because when water gets warmer, it expands. It’s worth noting that the net change in sea level has zig-zagged a bit. In 2011, for instance, it fell, prompting some to suggest an end to the problem. However, sea levels soon started rising again. Such blips are ""common,"" said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz. ""There are year to year variations, but the overall trend is clear."" All told, ""the vast majority of scientists agree that a warming climate will most certainly lead to a net ice loss from Antarctica,"" Burton said. ""The question is really how much and how fast?"" Brooks said, ""You’re going to have an increase in the amount of ice in Antarctica because of global warming."" Scientists agree that parts of Antarctica may already be seeing higher levels of frozen precipitation due to global warming. However, focusing on this increase amounts to cherry-picking, because the same higher temperatures also mean faster melting of existing Antarctic ice. On balance, scientists expect the amount of ice lost from added melting to be much higher than the amount of ice added from greater precipitation. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C088F80>],/factchecks/2018/may/21/mo-brooks/mo-brooks-incomplete-comments-antarctic-ice/

Pants on Fire for attack that, without evidence, links U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin with 9/11 mastermind
","Does U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin have so much more concern for a 9/11 terrorist, compared to the president’s nominee to run the CIA, that she would vote against the nominee? It’s an attack that appears to question the Wisconsin Democrat’s patriotism. And if it’s correct, where is the evidence? The claim was made by Leah Vukmir, who is vying with fellow Republican Kevin Nicholson for the chance to run against Baldwin in November 2018. As stated, Vukmir’s claim draws a conclusion based on what is publicly known about Baldwin’s stance toward Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.   Let’s examine if the evidence matches the rhetoric. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc ‘Team Terrorists’ Vukmir took flak, even from conservatives, when she branded Baldwin and Mohammed as ""Team Terrorists."" But Vukmir then doubled-down and even tripled-down in a series of statements, including one that makes the claim we want to check. In a May 14, 2018 interview, Steve Scaffidi, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, asked Vukmir to explain ""what you were trying to say"" in tying Baldwin to Mohammed. Vukmir alluded to Gina Haspel, the nominee of President Donald Trump to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and said: Tammy and her party are more interested, and they’re more worried about, the mastermind of 9/11 -- the individual that plotted and ultimately killed over 3,000 Americans on our soil. And she‘s more worried about those individuals than to support a very strong woman with a track record to be the head of the CIA. No evidence When Vukmir did the interview, it was expected that Baldwin would ultimately oppose Haspel. But Baldwin had not yet said whether she would vote for or against the nominee, who needs Senate confirmation to become CIA director. (Three days after the interview, Baldwin announced she'll vote against the nomination.) In any case, Baldwin’s support or opposition to Haspel is not what we’re fact checking here. When we asked Vukmir’s campaign staff for evidence to support Vukmir’s claim that Baldwin is ""more worried"" about Mohammed than supporting Haspel, it was lacking. Latest fact checks on the Senate candidates: Baldwin: 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks. Mostly True. Nicholson: Baldwin cosponsored legislation that wanted to establish the Department of Peace and Nonviolence."" Mostly True. Vukmir: Baldwin ""claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words."" False. We were referred only to a New York Times news article, published six days before Vukmir’s interview. Vukmir’s campaign said the article shows Mohammed’s ""opposition"" to the nomination of Haspel, a career CIA officer. The article reported on Mohammed’s request to share six paragraphs of unspecified information about Haspel with the Senate Intelligence Committee, before the committee voted to recommend Haspel’s confirmation. Mohammed had been captured in 2003 and tortured by the CIA. But it is not known whether Haspel was involved, directly or indirectly, in his torture, according to the article. Haspel has since declared that the agency should not have undertaken its interrogation program in which al Qaeda detainees were tortured after the Sept. 11 attacks, and is likely to be confirmed by the Senate, according to another Times news article. The article did not even mention Baldwin -- much less provide any evidence that Baldwin had any concern for Mohammed. About Baldwin For her part, when asked the day after Vukmir’s interview about Haspel and Vukmir’s ""Terrorist Team"" attack, Baldwin said on MSNBC she was on a ""third iteration"" of attempts to meet with Haspel. Two other points are worth noting: Baldwin did not call for Mohammed’s testimony to be allowed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. (She is not a member of the panel.) In the days after 9/11, Baldwin, as a member of the House, voted for a measure overwhelmingly approved by Congress that gave the president authority to use force to invade Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks. In short, Vukmir provided nothing of substance to support linking Baldwin with a terrorist. Our rating Vukmir says Baldwin is ""more worried about the mastermind of 9/11"" than supporting Trump’s nominee for CIA director. She provided no information to back up an extreme claim that Baldwin has serious concern for a terrorist that it is motivating her not to support the nominee. We rate Vukmir’s statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097479C40>],/factchecks/2018/may/18/leah-vukmir/pants-fire-attack-without-evidence-links-us-sen-ta/

No, Maxine Waters did not say she would impeach Donald Trump if she were president
","Maxine Waters may be just one of 435 members of Congress, but President Donald Trump has elevated the profile of the California Democrat. In March, at a campaign rally in southwestern Pennsylvania, Trump called Waters — a fierce opponent and the president’s ideological opposite — ""a very low-I.Q. individual."" ""You ever see her?"" Trump continued, to boos aimed at Waters. ""You ever seen her? You ever see her? 'We will impeach him! We will impeach the president!' But he hasn't done anything wrong. ‘It doesn't matter, we will impeach him!’ She's a low I.Q. individual. You can't help it. She really is."" Given Waters’ role as a foil for Trump, she has become fodder for social media posts by Trump’s allies. One we came across was the following post that appeared on May 15, 2018, on the Facebook page ""Judge Jeanine Pirro has Fans."" This Facebook group bills itself as an independent fan page for Pirro, a Fox News host who is closely allied with Trump. According to the Facebook group’s ""about"" page, ""Judge Jeanine Pirro is out spoken and always on target. This site will expound on what the Judge is talking about and report what mainstream media won't."" The group counted 713,110 followers when we first saw the post. The post shows what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN appearance by Waters with host Anderson Cooper. The chyron at the bottom of the screen said, ""Maxine Waters 2020,"" and the meme offered the following dialogue: Anderson: ""If elected what would your first act as President be?"" Waters: ""Well Anderson, I would impeach Donald Trump."" The group shared the image by saying, ""And we pay her a salary!"" The problem: Waters never said anything of the sort. The image appears to be from a real newscast on April 19, 2017, when Cooper interviewed Waters about Bill O’Reilly’s departure from Fox News. .@MaxineWaters on O'Reilly: ""There's something wrong with him psychologically. ... I hope he seeks some help."" https://t.co/zDEyMNNAqe But the chyron ""Maxine Waters 2020"" is fake. The original chyron said, ""Bill O’Reilly Out at Fox News."" The meme aims to make it look like Waters actually said that she would impeach Trump if elected president, which would be nonsensical. Obviously, there would be no need to impeach Trump if she either defeated him or succeeded him after he left office. Also, it’s up to Congress to impeach the president. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization, we depend on — and answer to — you. Your support directly impacts our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.

Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! Waters has called for investigations that could lead to Trump’s impeachment, but on several occasions — including an interview with the platform Cheddar and a rally at the U.S. Capitol — she called for Trump’s impeachment directly. When she denied on MSNBC in April 2017 that she had called for Trump’s impeachment, we rated her claim Pants on Fire. We found no evidence that Waters is seriously considering a run for president. While she has occasionally joked about it, she shot down the idea during an appearance on The View in August 2017. (Her office did not respond to an inquiry for this article; nor did the administrator for the Pirro fan site) Snopes.com noted that the meme appeared elsewhere before the Pirro fan site picked it up. The faked dialogue seems to have initially started as a joke in a May 11 tweet, and a version with the Cooper-Waters visual was retweeted May 14 by Fox News host Brian Kilmeade (he added: ""genius""), earning more than 900 retweets and more than 3,000 likes. Viral social media posts said Maxine Waters told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that her first act as president would be to ""impeach Donald Trump."" This exchange never happened; it appears to have emerged as a joke that was eventually attached to a screenshot of an unrelated interview. In any case, the comments are nonsensical and may have more to do with making Waters look unintelligent than with the actual impeachment process.

Olbermann says Rep. Hoekstra Tweeted whereabouts of top secret mission to Iraq
","Once again, U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., is embroiled in a twitterversy. It centers on his Tweet likening the messages of disgruntled Republicans during a congressional squabble with the messages from bloodied Iranian protesters who say they were disenfranchised. Keith Olbermann, host of MSNBC's  Countdown  , noted on June 18, 2009, that this wasn't Hoekstra's first Twitter controversy. ""This would be the same congressman who last year Tweeted the whereabouts of a top secret mission to Iraq,"" Olbermann said. Here's the background on that: Back in early February (not last year, as Olbermann said), Hoekstra was part of a legislative delegation that went to Iraq. The delegation included House Minority Leader John Boehner; House Minority Whip Eric Cantor; John McHugh, R-N.Y.; Jo Bonner, R-Ala.; and Tom Latham, R-Iowa. Some media learned or were told about the trip beforehand, but for security reasons agreed to keep the story embargoed until the group returned. But while on the trip, Hoekstra sent several Tweets. ""Just landed in Baghdad,"" one said. And another: ""Moved into green zone by helicopter. Iraqi flag now over palace. Headed to new US embassy. Appears calmer, less chaotic than previous."" A  Congressional Quarterly  reporter took Hoekstra to task with a Feb. 6 story headlined, ""So Much for Embargoed."" That story, and a follow-up on Feb. 10, questioned whether Hoekstra broke protocol for such trips by providing sensitive information that could pose a security risk. The story of Hoekstra's Tweets got picked up in media outlets around the globe. ""Generally speaking, we encourage the members to hold off any communication until they are wheels down at Andrews,"" Courtney Littig, spokeswoman for Democrats on the intelligence committee, told the  New York Times  . Hoekstra called the controversy ""nonsense,"" and noted that similar trips by congressional delegations had been preceded by news conferences. Some legislators have even invited the public to sign banners they could give to the troops. Hoekstra's staff provided reporters with citations showing instances in which Democrats have issued press releases prior to legislative trips to combat zones (including one from Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2005 prior to a trip to Iraq); or even held live press conferences from war zones (including one from then Sen. Barack Obama in Afghanistan in 2008, and a 2005 interview with then Sen. Hillary Clinton in Baghdad in 2005). ""The only difference is the technology,"" said Dave Yonkman, a spokesman for Hoekstra. ""He was trying to give his constituents as much information as he could about his congressional activities."" Nonetheless, Hoekstra's Tweets prompted the Pentagon to review its policy on congressional delegations traveling to war zones. And on March 13, 2009, Department of Defense Legislative Affairs distributed this policy to all services: ""In order to protect the movement of the CODEL (congressional delegation) and all of the associated supporting personnel in the combat zone, it is important to maintain strict operational security. Adherence to operational security complicates the enemy's targeting process by ensuring they do not have flight plans, travel times, or party composition specifics, all elements needed to prepare a successful attack on U.S. personnel.  In addition to the individual losses, the enemy could easily exploit any successful attack against key U.S. lawmakers for propaganda purposes, possibly extending the conflicts.  ""To this end, CODELs or staffdels should not communicate — via any means — their movements in advance of the trip, communicate their current locations, or communicate future movements or method of movements while in the AOR (area of responsibility) . . . Again, DoD's goal is to ensure members are offered the opportunity to present their initial observations in the combat zone while ensuring the safety of everyone in the traveling party and those who are supporting the group."" In other words, congressmen shouldn't be Tweeting about their whereabouts or where they are heading in a combat zone. And if they do want to make public statements — including live press conferences — those should be coordinated with military officials. But Olbermann is wrong to characterize the delegation's trip as a ""top-secret mission to Iraq."" The term ""top-secret"" means something in military and government circles. There is a hierarchy of classified information, beginning with ""confidential,"" graduating to ""secret,"" ""top-secret"" and ""special classified information."" You need varying levels of security clearance in order to be privy to classified information. This trip was none of those. But more to the point, ""top-secret mission to Iraq"" conjures images of rifle-toting troops on a highly sensitive military operation. This wasn't a military mission, it was a congressional visit. In fact, many in the news media knew about the trip, but just agreed to keep it embargoed. Hoekstra's staff knew about it. His wife knew about it. ""We're not talking about something that was classified,"" said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Les Melnyk. ""Not at all. Top-secret? No. We see these reported all the time in the press."" So Olbermann hasn't just exaggerated, he's incorrectly described the visit as a ""top-secret mission."" Without knowing the background, you might think Hoekstra spilled the beans on some covert military operation. We rule Olbermann's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978F89C0>],/factchecks/2009/jun/24/keith-olbermann/olbermann-says-rep-hoekstra-tweeted-whereabouts-to/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Pundits', 'Taxes', 'Paul Krugman']","
Bush tax cuts greater than health care? Probably.
","Paul Krugman, a noted economist and a columnist for the  New York Times  , made the case in  a recent column  that Democratic senators need to unite to pass health care reform. ""I'm not that worried about the issue of costs,"" Krugman wrote. ""Yes, the Congressional Budget Office's preliminary cost estimates for Senate plans were higher than expected, and caused considerable consternation last week. But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance — even those high estimates were less than the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts."" We wanted to know if Krugman was right that the initial cost estimates for health care legislation by the Congressional Budget Office were less than ""the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts."" The CBO released its study of a draft bill from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) on June 15, 2009. The report concluded that the plan would cost $1 trillion between 2010 and 2019. It also said the plan would reduce the rolls of the uninsured by 16 million, which is only about a third of those currently without insurance. (So the plan as rated is not ""universal."") Those findings have fueled debate. Opponents of health care reform said they show the plan is too expensive and won't cover everyone. Health care supporters said that the draft legislation does not include all the major elements of health care reform that will increase coverage or reduce costs, such as a public option health insurance plan or requirements for employers to contribute to insurance plans. But the draft bill is the best we have to work with, because so far it's the only one rated by CBO, a nonpartisan group that estimates the cost of legislation. Next, we wanted to put a price tag on the Bush tax cuts. Krugman doesn't give a time frame for the $1.8 trillion price tag.  The law was written so that the tax cuts expire in 2010, and we think that's the time frame he was talking about.  (We e-mailed him about this but didn't hear back.) Looking back, how much have the Bush tax cuts cost us so far? There's not a CBO report on that puts a dollar figure on that, and different think tanks calculated the lost revenues different ways. Keep in mind, we're talking about estimating something that didn't happen: How much in revenues didn't the government collect? Economic conditions change over time, and changes in tax code can affect that. So it's not a straight-up calculation. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agrees with Krugman. The center's 2009 report on the Bush tax cuts states: ""The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts added about $1.7 trillion to deficits between 2001 and 2008. Because they (were) financed by borrowing — which increases the national debt — this figure includes the extra interest costs resulting from that additional debt. This figure also includes the cost of 'patching' the Alternative Minimum Tax to keep the tax from hitting millions of upper-middle-class households, a problem the tax cuts helped cause. Over the next decade (2009-2018), making the tax cuts permanent would cost $4.4 trillion, assuming that the tax cuts remain deficit-financed."" We then asked the conservative Heritage Institute about the Bush tax cuts. Brian Riedl analyzes the federal budget for the group. He said Krugman's $1.8 trillion number only considers the government's lost revenue, and doesn't account for the economic activity that lower taxes generate. He said the number was ""defensible, but an overstatement."" He estimates there would be a stimulative effect from tax cuts that could shave about 25 percent off that tally. Still, he said, Krugman is in the right ballpark for a static score of uncollected revenues. ""I can't believe I'm actually saying one of Krugman's numbers is defensible,"" he added. There's one other implicit assumption in Krugman's statement. He writes, ""But the fundamental fact is that we can afford universal health insurance — even those high estimates were less than the $1.8 trillion cost of the Bush tax cuts."" We know the CBO report scored the first draft at $1 trillion, but we also know that CBO determined the draft was not a ""universal"" plan — only about a third of the uninsured would be covered. But would a truly ""universal"" bill still come in under $1.8 trillion? ""Absolutely,"" said Kenneth Thorpe, a health care expert at Emory University. He said draft version of the bill could be modified to expand coverage to everyone and trim costs, and he thinks the total cost of that would likely be just over $1 trillion. He said the Senate Finance Committee is working on a new plan, though it has not been released to the public. ""I think that you can provide universal health care coverage for all 46 million of the uninsured for just over $1 trillion,"" he said. After reading many studies on the cost of the Bush tax cuts, it seems to us that Krugman is in the ballpark with his $1.8 trillion estimate. But we believe there are a couple of important caveats to his comparison. First, his wording implies that CBO's much-discussed estimate is for universal coverage, but it's not. Also, he doesn't offer a time frame for the Bush tax cuts, so we can't be sure he is comparing the same number of years. Finally, the health care plan is still very much in flux, and the CBO estimate is based on an early and incomplete bill. So we find Krugman's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809784D080>],/factchecks/2009/jun/24/paul-krugman/bush-tax-cuts-health-care-probably/

Claims that the war spending bill does more for the IMF than the wars
","
In an unusual role reversal, most Congressional Republicans recently voted against a war funding bill. Some said they opposed the bill because it had so much money for the International Monetary Fund, a coalition of 185 countries that tries to foster global economic growth.


Among the Republicans sounding off was Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, who wrote this on his party's blog:

 

""We’re getting an alleged war spending bill that actually spends more money on the International Monetary Fund than on the war,"" he wrote. ""We have the ability to bounce back out of this recession, but we can’t afford to pay for a global bailout – we have more than enough bailouts going on in our own country, thank you very much.""


All but five of the 178 Republicans in the House voted against the measure on June 16, 2009. The bill is at the White House awaiting President Barack Obama's signature.

 

The IMF's profile has risen in recent months in the wake of the economic crisis, and some financial leaders want the agency to loan more money to jump-start the global economy. We wondered if it was possible that a war funding bill would have more money for the IMF than the wars.

 

Overall, the bill costs about $106 billion, according to the House Appropriations Committee. Approximately $82 billion — or about 77 percent — is for war-related items, everything from new machinery to hospitals.


And for the IMF?


Zero dollars, according to the Appropriations Committee.


So does that mean Westmoreland's claim is false?


Not so fast.


The bill does establish a $100 billion line of credit for the IMF that the agency could use to make loans to other countries. But the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the actual cost to the Treasury at approximately $5 billion. That sum is largely the product of some confusing budgetary gymnastics based on estimates of how dramatically the IMF would have to use the line of credit and how quickly loans would be repaid, the CBO explained on its Web site.


""In forming this estimate, CBO envisioned various potential state of the world economy,"" wrote CBO director Douglas Elmendorf on May 19, 2009. ""In the most likely situations, the IMF would draw against only a small portion of the U.S. commitment and, CBO assumes, the likelihood of those funds being promptly repaid would be high. Thus, the cost of the U.S. commitment would be close to zero in those cases.""


The CBO said there's a slight chance the IMF would need to loan most or all of the line of credit. In that case, the IMF might not recoup all of the money and the cost to the U.S. Treasury would therefore be higher.


CBO noted that no IMF borrower has defaulted on its obligations, but many have had their loans extended or been late on their payments.


We spoke with budget experts who said the CBO's estimate is reasonable because it reflects the likely risk to the taxpayers.


Loans are a routine part of the annual appropriations process, and they are typically assigned some cost based on risk, said Brian Riedl, a budget expert at the Heritage Foundation. If no money is paid back, ""that does potentially make it the most expensive part of the bill. But the odds of it becoming the most expensive part of the bill are slim.""


The real cost to the Treasury Department all comes down to whether other countries pay back those loans, said Edwin Truman, who is an IMF expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an economic think tank.


""Since no country has ever lost money in [IMF's] history, the notion that we will lose $5 billion is a stretch,"" he said.


So as for Westmoreland's claim, he's wrong that the appropriations bill spends more money on the IMF than for the war. Lawmakers aren't literally giving the organization a bundle of cash. But he's right that there's a potential for the U.S. Treasury, over time, to give the IMF quite a chunk of change as a result of the line of credit. However, Westmoreland's claim is based on the premise that countries borrowing from the IMF will never pay those loans back, which is a worst-case scenario that experts say is unlikely to occur. So we rate his claim Barely True.

Hannity claims loophole in Cash for Clunkers program would allow people to buy and then trade in a junker
","
On his Fox News Channel program on June 18, 2009, political commentator Sean Hannity mocked the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program recently approved by Congress, saying a loophole would allow someone to buy an old heap at a junkyard, have it towed to his or her house, and the government would pay $4,500 for it.
 
The Cash for Clunkers program is actually called the ""Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009."" Having passed the House and Senate, it now sits on the president's desk awaiting his signature.
 
Under the program, people can get $3,500 to $4,500 if they trade in their old gas-guzzler for a more fuel-efficient new car. The idea is to boost the ailing auto industry while improving the environment.
 
There are lots of eligibility rules, and you can read all about them
 
here

in a Web site created by the government.
 
The bill provides $1 billion for the program from July through November. In an interview with Hannity, Sen. John McCain criticized the program as more ""out-of-control spending"" by the Obama administration. Hannity then added his claim about how it would be easy to game the system to soak the government.
 
""Listen, all we've got to do is you got to go to a local junkyard — all you've got to do is tow (the car) to your house. And you're going to get $4,500,"" Hannity said. ""I'm going to go do that.""
 
Actually, legislators anticipated just such a scheme and included provisions to prevent it.
 
First, the law requires that the vehicle must be in ""drivable condition."" So if it needs to be towed to your house, no dice.
 
And second, the trade-in has to have been ""continuously insured consistent with the applicable state law and registered to the same owner for a period of not less than one year immediately prior to such trade-in."" In English: You have to have owned the car for a year, and you have to be able to prove it.
 
Those safeguards were written into the bill to safeguard against the very scenario Hannity described, said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Hannity's statement is ""not accurate,"" he said.
 
You could always lie and forge documents. (Don't do it, Sean!) But that would be fraud. And the bill says anyone who knowingly violates the provisions of the program could face a fine of up to $15,000.
 
The wording in the legislation makes this one an easy call for us. The bill is written to prohibit the very scenario Hannity describes as possible. His statement goes on the junk heap. We rule it False.

Ann Coulter criticizes Obama on Muslim history
","Conservatives had lots of reasons to criticize President Barack Obama’s speech in Cairo. Some thought Obama went too far in praising his Muslim audience, some thought he was too harsh on Israel, and some thought he shouldn’t have been there in the first place.

Ann Coulter had her own angle. She went after Obama's accuracy.

""Obama listed, incorrectly, Muslims' historical contributions to mankind, such as algebra (actually that was the ancient Babylonians), the compass (that was the Chinese), pens (the Chinese again) and medical discoveries (huh?),"" she wrote in a June 10, 2009, op-ed on the  Human Events  Web site. (The words in parentheses are Coulter's as they appeared in the column.)

She said Obama was ingratiating himself to the same community that launched the 9/11 attacks.

""All these inventions came in mighty handy on Sept. 11, 2001! Thanks, Muslims!!"" she wrote.

Here's exactly what Obama said in the Cairo speech:

""As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam,"" said Obama in his June 4, 2009, speech. ""It was Islam — at places like Al-Azhar — that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment. ... It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.""

Obama's larger point is that elements of Islamic culture are found throughout Western society. ""I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear,"" he said.

So, what of these inventions that Obama praised and Coulter critiqued? Was he wrong?

Our friends at FactCheck.org already  did some digging  and found he was generally correct, but we wanted to address Coulter's criticism more directly.

Let's start with Obama's assertion about algebra. (Don't worry. We're dealing with history here, but no linear equations.)

Indeed, algebra does have roots in Islam. Baghdad-born Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi is ""the father of algebra"" according to the United Kingdom-based Foundation for Science Technology and Civilization, an organization devoted to explaining Muslim contributions to science. His seminal work,  Hisab al-jabr w'al-muqabala  — or  The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing  — was written in 820 A.D. and is widely considered the first book on algebra. In fact, the world  al-jabr  from the title is the root of the word ""algebra.""

Nevertheless, others have contributed to algebra, including Diophantus, a Greek who some historians say should share the prestige of being the father of algebra with al-Khwarizmi. Diophantus lived some time between 200 and 298 A.D., some 500 years before al-Khwarizmi. His book,  Arithmetica  , is significant because it prompted the rebirth of number theory, or the study of positive numbers, according to  Encyclopedia Britannica  .
 
Regardless, al-Khwarizmi's role in developing algebra is largely without dispute. And though the Babylonians did live in what we consider modern-day Baghdad, Coulter incorrectly identifies the origins of algebra.
 
Moving on to navigation and the creation of the compass, Coulter is correct that Obama is on shakier ground. While many cultures used primitive navigation devices, the Chinese are usually credited with popularizing the magnetic compass, which, in its earliest form, involved a magnetized spoon-shaped stone that aligned with Earth's magnetic field. There is strong evidence, however, that Muslims made navigation tools easier to use; an astronomer named Azarchel, for example, created an all-in-one astrolabe, a device used to determine direction using the constellations.
 
Writing instruments come from ancient Egypt, where people used pens made from river reeds to inscribe papyrus. However, Al-Mu'izz, a Muslim who ruled Egypt from 953 to 975, is credited with inventing the fountain pen. So, Obama's claim that the ""mastery"" of pens originated in the Muslim world is in the ballpark.
 
Printing, however, is decidedly of Asian origins; the Chinese and Koreans developed woodblock and movable type printing. And around 1440 A.D., a German named Johannas Gutenburg invented the printing press, his most well known project being the Gutenburg Bible. Obama overstates the role Muslims played in printing. He would have been more accurate if he pointed out that followers of Mohammed were instrumental in disseminating the printed word, according to Jonathan M. Bloom's  Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World  .
 
Lastly, Obama contends that Muslims developed certain aspects of modern medicine, which is partly true. According to the National Institutes of Health, the Greeks influenced healing practices in the Islamic world, but then the work of many Muslims influenced the ideas and practices in late medieval Europe from which early modern medicine eventually arose.
 
Dr. Max Gross of Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding said it’s fair to say that Muslims created or contributed significantly to all the inventions Obama outlined in his speech.
 
""I have no difficulties with what Obama said,"" said Gross.
 
Nevertheless, Gross pointed out that innovation can develop in different places at nearly the same time, so there is inevitably some disagreement with where certain tools or ideas originate.
 
He used the astrolabe to emphasize his point.
 
Muslims did not ""create all navigation tools, they refined the astrolabe,"" he said. ""The astrolabe is what Europeans used to navigate the oceans.""
 
Let’s review this little history lesson by revisiting Obama's words. He didn't say Muslims were the sole inventors of these disciplines, he merely said their innovation contributed to the development of disciplines. We find Coulter is incorrect about Obama's statement about algebra, that she's largely right about navigation, that she's wrong about pens and that it's fuzzy about how much Muslims contributed to modern medicine. So we find her criticism to be Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280975A7580>],/factchecks/2009/jun/19/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-criticizes-obama-muslim-history/

Glenn Beck, on anchor babies, claims U.S. is only country with automatic citizenship upon birth
","On his June 10, 2009, Fox News program, host Glenn Beck raised an immigration hot button that has gained some legislative traction in recent months: the issue of whether the United States ought to continue to grant citizenship to any child born in the country, even if the parents are illegal immigrants. ""You know, the anchor baby thing has always really hacked me off,"" Beck said. ""You know the anchor baby. You know what that is. It's when a child that is born here, becomes a citizen and they help the illegal parents become citizens, right?"" He continued, sarcastically, ""Remember empathy. Oh, empathy. No one wants to separate that family. Oh, that baby is a child. It's an anchor. It's an anchor to stay here."" ""Why do we have automatic citizenship upon birth?"" Beck asked. ""Do you know? We're the only country in the world that has it. Why?"" Beck went on to explain that the 14th amendment granting citizenship to ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States"" was drafted after the Civil War ""to protect newly freed slaves and their children and guarantee their rights as citizens. Last I checked, I don't think we're having that problem anymore. Can we have some common sense?"" Beck touches on an issue that has caught the attention of a growing number of Republicans in Congress. In April, Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, proposed H.R. 1868, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009. It seeks to amend immigration law so that babies born in the United States would only be granted U.S. citizenship if one of the parents is 1) a U.S. citizen or national; 2) a legal permanent resident of the United States; or 3) is serving in the U.S. armed forces. The bill currently has 77 cosponsors, 76 Republicans and one Democrat. Every year, about 400,000 babies are born to mothers who are undocumented immigrants in the United States, acccording to Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies. Once those children become adults, they can sponsor their parents or extended family for legal permanent residency. Our aim is not to enter the fray over the proposed legislation but to check Beck's claim that the United States is the only country in the world that grants automatic citizenship to anyone born in the country. And to that end, we refer to a report from NumbersUSA, a group dedicated to reducing immigration levels, and which backs Deal's bill. They found that in addition to the United States, there are 33 countries that offer automatic, unconditional citizenship to children born within their borders. They offer several qualifiers. No European nations grant birthright citizenship (but we note that Romania is on the list). Canada is the only developed nation other than the United States. No nation in the group other than the United States has more than 200 million people. Only the United States, Pakistan and Mexico have 50 million or more. For the full list, go here . By way of reminder, Beck said, ""We're the only country in the world that has it."" We might be inclined to cut Beck some slack if the only other countries were Saint Lucia, Antigua and Lesotho. In fact, we'll even admit that we had to look up what continent Lesotho is even on (Africa). But Canada, Brazil, Romania? We didn't have to go looking for those. It might be surprising to Americans that automatic citizenship isn't more common in the developed world, but the bottom line is Beck made a blanket statement that is just wrong. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C118AC0>],/factchecks/2009/jun/19/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-us-only-country-automatic-citize/

More than 500 Guantanamo detainees were released or transferred under Bush
","
For weeks, Republicans have questioned the wisdom of closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Barack Obama plans to transfer the approximately 230 remaining detainees to other countries or to prisons in the United States.
 
Responding to the Republicans, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on June 16, 2009, that it's important to consider Obama's plans in context with the overall number of releases in the past seven years.
 
""Some 500 detainees were released from Guantanamo during the Bush administration,"" Hoyer said.
 
We wondered if he was correct.
 
Indeed, government documents indicate more than 500 detainees were released or transferred from Guantanamo while George W. Bush was president. A White House executive order issued on the second day of Obama's presidency said, ""

The federal government has moved more than 500 such detainees from Guantánamo, either by returning them to their home country

or by releasing or transferring them to a third country.""
 
That's backed up by a fact sheet from the military task force that runs the detention camp, which says 520 detainees had been released or transferred by March 2009.
 
Our only quibble with Hoyer is his use of the word ""released."" That could be interpreted to mean that under Bush, 500-plus detainees left the center and were immediately freed. But the Pentagon says there is a difference between a release and a transfer to another country. The vast majority of detainees leave Gitmo under a transfer, which means they are transported to another country that places them under some type of restrictions. Some are incarcerated in those countries because of criminal charges, while others face monitoring or travel limitations.
 
But Hoyer only said ""released,"" so we'll take him down a notch to Mostly True.

62 percent support new health care legislation, not Barack Obama's particular plan
","
A new ad urges support for President Barack Obama's push for major health care legislation. Created by the liberal group Americans United for Change, the ad argues that 62 percent of the public supports ""the president's plan to reform health care,"" and that Republicans in Congress should too.


Here's the full script of the ad; you can also watch it

via YouTube

:


""In the Senate, they call 60 percent support a supermajority. Well, a new poll shows 62 percent of Americans support the president’s plan to reform health care. That means lowering costs, so everyone has access to quality, affordable care, protecting your choice of doctor, letting you choose between keeping the private insurance you have and a public health insurance plan. So if the Republicans in Congress ignore what 62 percent of us support, you gotta wonder: Who are they listening to?""


It's true that polls show solid majorities of the American public think the health care system needs change.


But there's a big difference between general support for health care legislation and the particulars of Obama's plan. The ad from Americans United for Change cites a Diageo Hotline Poll of June 10, 2009, saying that it showed 62 percent support for ""the president's plan to reform health care."" The actual question was this: ""Do you support or oppose Congress and the president enacting a major overhaul of the U.S. health care system?"" That question gauges whether people broadly support the president and Congress working together to change health care. (The poll was a random sample of 800 registered voters, and the Hotline is part of the nonpartisan news group National Journal.)
 
But the ad repeatedly cites the number in a misleading way. It makes it sound as if the 62 percent singled out the president's plan for support. It further distorts the poll by saying that same 62 percent backs a public health insurance plan, sometimes referred to as a public option. When the ad mentions the public option, a big ""62%"" flashes on the screen.
 
A public option is controversial in Congress. Democratic advocates for it say the public option would act as an insurer of last resort for people who have problems getting private insurance. Some Republicans say it will be a Medicare-style plan that will pay doctors and hospitals significantly less than private insurance, thus undermining the private insurance system. The devil is in the details here, and Congress is debating what a public option might look like.


The ad from Americans United for Change implies that 62 percent support a public health insurance plan. But the Diageo Hotline poll did not ask specifically about the public option.
 
A poll that did, the Rasmussen Reports poll of June 15, 2009, asked the question plainly — ""Would it be a good idea to set up a government health insurance company to compete with private health insurance companies?"" — and found support split, with 41 percent answering yes, 41 percent answering no, and 18 percent saying they weren't sure. That's nowhere near 62 percent support.


It's true that large majorities of the public do want health care reform. The Diageo Hotline Poll showed that an even larger majority — 94 percent — said it was important or somewhat important that health care legislation pass this year. But it's not accurate to say that 62 percent favor Obama's plan above and beyond other ideas being considered in Congress. And it's incorrect to attribute that specifically to the public option. The ad gives the impression that rock-solid majorities are in favor of the specifics of Obama's plan. But the poll doesn't say that. We find their statement False.
 

Update, June 22, 2009:

We ruled this statement False because the ad distorted the results of the poll.  Several days after we published this item a

New York Times/CBS News poll

showed 72 percent support for a public option.  But we're not changing our ruling because the New York Times poll hasn't changed the circumstances our the original fact we checked: The ad distorted the facts about the poll that it referenced.

Sen. Bill Nelson says offshore drilling won't pay for Florida schools
","
Floridians who support offshore drilling to rescue the crippled state budget will be disappointed, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned this week.
 
The federal government limits what the offshore drilling revenues can be used for, Nelson said, and it doesn't include things like paying for public schools.
 
""I’ve had a few questions lately about this idea of Florida getting oil-drilling revenues to help with its sagging budget — and, things like schools,"" Nelson said in a statement on June 15, 2009. ""If you’re swayed by this argument and big oil’s latest push to put rigs off the tourism state, then you need to know something: oil money from federal leases cannot be used for that kind of stuff.  It can only be used to clean up the mess and damages from drilling.  Here’s how the law allows royalty money to be used: mitigation of effects from drilling activities through onshore infrastructure projects; associated planning and administrative costs; coastal protection; and, mitigation of damage to animals or natural resources. There you have it. No budget windfall. Fact is — oil money won’t build schools, or roads or pay teachers.  It’ll just 'mitigate' — slow down — the oil industry’s ruination of the fourth largest state’s economy and environment.""
 
Some background: In the Gulf of Mexico, which is the focus of the debate over more oil production, offshore drilling is banned within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 100 miles of the Florida Panhandle through 2022. But in early June, the U.S. Senate energy committee approved a measure to allow oil and gas drilling just 45 miles off Florida's west coast.
 
Nelson strongly opposes drilling off Florida's coast, and has threatened to filibuster if the amendment is attached to a broader energy bill.
 
Nelson includes a key caveat in his warning about how Florida might be able to spend royalties from drilling. He notes that he's talking about

federal

leases. That's important because the federal government generally controls waters more than 10 miles offshore, while Florida and some other states control the waters inside 10 miles. So if Florida allowed drilling within those 10, it could use proceeds from oil leases however it sees fit, including for teacher salaries. (There's also a provision where the state could get some money for leases between 10 and 13 miles.)
 
Currently, four states receive money from federal royalties — Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Under federal law, that money can only be used for protecting and restoring the coast through projects such as conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources.
 
Nelson is generally correct about the requirements as they relate to those four states, said Eileen Angelico, a spokeswoman for the federal government's Gulf of Mexico Minerals Management Service. But you can't assume the same provisions will apply to Florida, she said.
 
""There's no guarantee that if Florida is added that it'll have to go along with the same rules,"" she said. ""(Congress) can write it however they want to.""
 
We think there's also a danger that people will misinterpret Nelson's comments, to assume that he means Florida schools could not profit from

any

offshore drilling. The fact is, Florida schools might benefit quite a bit if the state decided to allow drilling within 10 miles of its coast. States like Texas and Louisiana have reaped billions of dollars for their schools from offshore drilling leases.
 
Texas, for example, has reaped more than $3.5 billion in revenues from offshore drilling. Most of that comes from drilling within 10 miles the coast. The money goes into an education investment fund. Every year, the state taps that fund for $800 million for public schools, said Jim Suydam, a spokesman for the Texas General Land Office. It translates to about $400 per student, and is sometimes referred to as the school's textbook fund. Texas also will get more than $35 million this year from the federal government for its share of royalties on drilling more than 10 miles offshore, he said. That money is limited to mitigation.
 
So in fact, some gulf states have gotten quite a bit of money for their schools for allowing oil drilling off their coast. But that's mostly from drilling very close to the coast, within 10 miles.
 
Nelson correctly specifies that the restrictions apply to federal leases. And the legislation being considered by the Senate is for drilling at least 45 miles off the western coast of Florida (in other words, entirely federal waters).
 
We think many people might miss that distinction, however. Nelson's strongly worded statement will probably leave them with the impression that Florida couldn't get

any

education money from any drilling, when it could opt to do what Texas has done and use revenue from drilling within 10 miles for education.
 
He also is extrapolating the rules from other states to apply to Florida when in fact Congress still must address how the state would be affected. And it's conceivable that Congress could change the rules for Florida or the other states, and allow that money to be spent for broader uses. So we subtract a few points and give Nelson a Mostly True.

Jose is No. 1 baby name in Texas — Social Security Administration says so
","It's not unusual for a minority party to engage in soul-searching, finger-pointing and general agonizing over why it lost power. The Republican Party is in the midst of such a process right now. Mike Murphy, a GOP political strategist, has argued that the Republicans need to address why they lost so badly among two demographics: the young and Latinos. Obama crushed McCain among Hispanic voters by a 35-point margin, Murphy wrote in  a column in  Time   magazine. ""By 2030, the Latino share of the vote is likely to double,"" Murphy wrote. ""In Texas, the crucial buckle for the GOP's Electoral College belt, the No. 1 name for new male babies — many of whom will vote one day — is Jose."" Murphy added, ""Latinos need to see a quick end to the Republican congressional jihad on immigration,"" Murphy concluded, adding that they should support immigration reform with a path to citizenship. ""Republicans should differentiate themselves from the left by heating up the lukewarm American melting pot with a firm insistence on learning English and a rejection of the silly excesses of identity politics."" We were intrigued by his claim — which he repeated on  Meet the Press  on June 14 — that Jose was the No. 1 baby name for boys in Texas. We wondered if that could be proved with hard numbers or if it was mostly conjecture. It turns out that the Social Security Administration compiles  baby names  for infants born in the United States, based on applications for Social Security numbers. The administration includes  a few caveats  about the data — names are counted only when the year of birth, state, and gender are known, for example. But it's hard to think of a better source for name popularity. In 2008, the No. 1 name for a baby boy born in Texas was indeed Jose. (It's held the top spot since 1996.) Nationally, it was 41st. In Texas, Jose was followed by Jacob, Daniel, Christopher, Joshua, David, Angel, Ethan, Juan and Michael. In case you're wondering, that same year in Texas, the most popular name for a girl was Emily, followed by Isabella, Abigail, Emma, Madison, Sophia, Mia, Natalie, Ashley and Ava. We're not rating Murphy's political advice one way or the other. But the numbers confirm he had his facts right about Jose. We rate Murphy's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809770E7C0>],/factchecks/2009/jun/15/mike-murphy/jose-no-1-baby-name-texas-social-security-administ/

""Obama has more czars than the Romanovs — who ruled Russia for 3 centuries. Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20.""
 
First of all, yes, John McCain — the guy criticized during the presidential campaign for being computer illiterate — is tweeting.
 
But what about the czars? It sure seems like we keep reading about one czar after another being appointed to oversee the auto industry, the Great Lakes, and the closure of Gitmo, and we wondered: Just how many czars does the Obama administration actually have?
 
First off, the Obama administration doesn't usually call any of these people czars. We only found two instances of President Barack Obama using the term, once in an April 15, 2009, interview with

CNN En Espanol

when he talked about the role of his ""border czar,"" and once during the campaign when he promised to appoint an ""autism czar"" to coordinate a nationwide autism effort (he hasn't yet). And in announcing Obama's nomination of Gil Kerlikowske as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Vice President Joe Biden referred to the position as ""our nation's drug czar.""
 
We're sure there are more, but the point is that, by and large, you don't often hear the administration talking about its czars.
 
In fact, the administration has at times gone to some lengths to avoid the moniker, as was the case in this somewhat humorous (in an inside-the-Beltway sorta way) exchange between a reporter and White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on June 10, 2009:
 

Reporter: On Ken Feinberg, I think that he's maybe the 20th czar-type position you've named.

 

Gibbs:  No, I think the title is ""special master.""

 


So who exactly qualifies as a czar? As best we can tell, it's whenever someone in the media says so. You can identify a guy as ""Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Co-Chair of the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology,"" but it's a lot easier on everyone to just say ""Science Czar."" And ""Special Master"" sounds like Richie Rich's best friend.
 
So the title of czar is largely arbitrary media shorthand for ""It's this person's job to make sure (blank) goes right."" And we think everyone can agree that ""Terrorism Czar"" sounds way cooler than ""Deputy National Security Adviser for Homeland Security.""
 
Below, we have compiled a wildly unscientific list of Obama administration ""czars."" But we're not the first. Talking Points Memo has a slideshow of Obama's ""czars.""

They count 23

. And ForeignPolicy.com came up with

at least 18.

We've got 28.
 
Some of these ""czars"" are carryover positions from previous administrations. And ""czars"" go way back in presidential history. Roosevelt had a slew of so-called czars. But to the extent that Obama has created a number of new positions to oversee various issues and to cut through bureaucratic red tape, he seems to have a lot more czars than his predecessors. Or you could argue that the media has just seized on a new buzzword it likes. We're not going to wade into the debate about whether having more czars is a good idea, but Fox

ran a story

about concerns some lawmakers have with it.
 
We're just fact-checking McCain's claim that Obama has more czars than the Romanovs. According to the

World Book Encyclopedia

, there were, as McCain said, 18 Romanov czars, starting with Michael Romanov in 1613 and ending with Nicholas II, who was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.
 
As for Obama's czars, we've got 28 who have been referred to as a czar ... somewhere. Undoubtedly some will take issue with some of the ""czars"" on our list, but we think McCain is on solid ground. He earns a True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Karl Rove']","
Rove's op-ed distorts health study
","Republican strategist Karl Rove argued against the Democrats' blueprint for health care, citing a Lewin Group study about what might happen under a public option for health care. The public option has become shorthand for the government offering an insurance plan to compete with private insurers. Advocates for the public option said it would be an insurer of last resort, such as for people who lose their health insurance when they lose their job. In a column in the  Wall Street Journal,  Rove said the public option would lead to America ""becoming a European-style welfare state."" ""The Lewin Group estimates 70 percent of people with private insurance — 120 million Americans — will quickly lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage,"" Rove wrote. ""They'd be happy to shift some of the expense — and all of the administration headaches — to Washington. And once the private insurance market has been dismantled it will be gone."" The public option ""is just phony,"" Rove wrote. ""It's a bait-and-switch tactic meant to reassure people that the president's goals are less radical than they are. Mr. Obama's real aim, as some candid Democrats admit, is a single-payer, government-run health-care system."" We'll note that President Barack Obama has said that is not his aim. But we were more interested in Rove's description of the study. The Lewin Group report, which we've looked at before, ran a number of different scenarios on what would happen if the government offered a public option. One scenario was a Medicare-style plan that was open to everyone. Under that type of public option, the government would pay health providers much less than private insurers and offer lower premiums to the public. The study model found that 118 million people would choose to drop their private coverage in favor of cheaper public coverage. (We'll note here that the Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, which also offers private health insurance.) But Rove misrepresents the report in a couple of significant ways. First, he neglects to mention that the 120 million number is only for the public option that is most like Medicare, and if everyone were allowed to enroll. That is the most extreme option that could drive the most people from private insurers. But there are other ways to set up a public option health care plan. Under the Lewin Group's estimates, if you restrict a Medicare-style public option only to individuals and small businesses, only 32 million would leave private coverage. And if the public option is less like Medicare and competes more like a private insurer, the number drops further. What a public option might actually look like is one of the biggest questions Congress is grappling with right now. A group of fiscally conservative Democrats known as the Blue Dogs have said they do not support a Medicare-style public option, and have  laid out specifics  for the kind of public option they would support. They envision a public option that operates more like a private insurer and would only be available as a last resort. Under that type of scenario, the study says the number of people who would switch from private to public insurance could be as low as 21.5 million or 10.4 million. Which brings us to another problem: Rove says people would ""be forced"" to switch, but the report is modeled on the idea that consumers choose health plans based on price and would opt for a public plan — not be forced into one. Rove's comments give the impression that 120 million people would be booted out of their private insurance and forced to turn to the government. That's not the scenario the report describes. When we've covered this issue before, some of our readers have argued that we're missing the point. If millions of people choose to leave private insurance, the readers say, that would injure the private system to the point that government would have to step in — Rove's ""bait and switch"" argument. After people leave their private insurance for the public option, it would become too expensive for employers to continue to offer coverage to smaller pools of employees. But that's not how Rove described the report. He said, ""The Lewin Group estimates 70 percent of people with private insurance — 120 million Americans — will quickly lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage."" That's wrong. The report said that people would choose to leave private insurance if given a cheaper option, but the report provided smaller numbers for other options. The debate in Congress over what a public option will look like is fierce and ongoing. So Rove is picking the worst-case scenario and then distorting the cause and effects. We rate Rove's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A362E40>],/factchecks/2009/jun/12/karl-rove/roves-op-ed-distorts-health-study/
"['National', 'Energy', 'Stimulus', 'Sarah Palin']","
Sarah Palin says she vetoed stimulus money for energy efficiency because it required tougher building codes
","In a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity on June 8, 2009, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin criticized the stimulus package as a ""dizzying debt that we're handing to our kids."" She said, ""I vetoed a bucket of the money, not a whole lot, we did accept education dollars and infrastructure dollars, but dollars that were tied to universal energy building codes for Alaska, kind of a one-size-fits-all building code that isn't going to work up there in Alaska and really prohibits opportunity to build and to develop, and just wasn't going to work up there in Alaska, so I vetoed a bucket of that money.   ""...I don't think that it would be a healthy thing for our state to adopt because it would be a federal mandate, fixed, centralized government, telling Alaskan communities that have opted out of building codes for the most part.   ""Them telling us what's best for our businesses and residences, how to build them, and we're all for energy conservation. We have hundreds of millions of dollars, in fact, budgeted for programs there but we don't want those fat strings attached where centralized, big government is going to tell us what is best."" We wondered if the building codes were as strict as Palin claimed. She did, in fact, veto $28.6 million in federal stimulus money for weatherization and other projects to make new and existing homes and buildings more energy efficient. But many state legislators in Alaska, including some of her fellow Republicans, say Palin has overstated the strings attached to the federal money. She initially promised to take a pass on as much as a third of the stimulus money. She later agreed to take all but 3 percent — the $28.6 million she vetoed. Palin was specifically concerned with a provision in the stimulus (it is Section 410, as she will refer it later) that ties the energy efficiency money to assurances that the state or local governments ""will implement"" a ""building energy code for residential buildings that meets or exceeds the most recently published International Energy Conservation Code, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings"" as well as ""a building energy code (or codes) for commercial buildings throughout the State that meets or exceeds the ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1–2007, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings."" The provision also states that recipients of the federal money must implement a plan to achieve compliance with the building codes within eight years in at least 90 percent of new and renovated residential and commercial building space. That language seems pretty rigid, but then along came Missouri, which applied for the money, but instead of agreeing to the specifics of the building code, committed merely to ""working with communities to create model energy efficiency standards that,  if local units of government choose to implement    (our emphasis), should reduce energy costs for Missourians."" The Department of Energy approved the application. So Palin's chief of staff wrote to the Department of Energy to get some clarification about what exactly Alaska would be committing itself to if it accepted the money. In response, Steven G. Chalk of the DOE said the stimulus provision recognizes that not every state has statewide building codes, and that the governor does not have the authority to force local governments to implement building codes. In those cases, Chalk wrote, it's sufficient for the governor to simply ""promote"" the codes. It is enough, he wrote, for the state to work with local governments to create model energy efficiency standards, but no municipality would be forced to adopt any new codes. As for Palin's claims of ""one-size-fits-all"" building codes, Chalk wrote that the provision ""provides flexibility with regard to building codes"" and ""expressly includes standards other than those cited so long as the standards achieve equivalent energy savings."" So Palin is wrong. The municipalities are not forced to accept the specific standards and, given that local governments set their own codes, the feds would be satisfied if Alaska merely  promoted  such building codes. Despite these assurances from the Department of Energy, Palin vetoed the money and insisted the provision amounted to ""big brother"" government involvement. The state legislature is now threatening to pursue a very rare veto override. In a May 29, 2009, letter published in the  Anchorage Daily News  , Palin said, ""Alaskans have a strong history of independence and opposition to Washington, D.C., meddling in local issues. Our constitution ensures 'maximum local self-government.' Our communities have had the option to adopt building codes for decades. Most have not done so. ""Alaska communities have the right to determine for themselves whether to adopt building codes,"" she wrote. ""I asked the feds to clarify their position. The Department of Energy finally admitted section 410 and their previous statements were 'inappropriate' for some states but still wanted an agreement to push model codes on all Alaskan communities. I said no. ""Beware of Washington, D.C., trying to cajole local community leaders to eliminate the choices Alaskans have when building or renovating homes and businesses. These new codes are so detailed they would dictate the kinds of lights that can be installed in a home in Akutan, and how thick window panes must be in Chignik."" But that's not what the DOE letter said. While it did say the governor should ""promote"" more energy-efficient building codes, local municipalities were under no obligation to implement new codes. And the letter was also very clear that it was not mandating a ""one-size-fits-all"" code, that local governments could tailor their own unique codes to meet their needs so long as the standards achieved similar energy savings. In other words, accepting the money would not have dictated ""the kinds of lights that can be installed in a home in Akutan, and how thick window panes must be in Chignik."" A strict reading of the requirements for the energy-efficiency money might give credence to Palin's concerns. But the experience of Missouri and the explicit letter from the Department of Energy to Palin's office made clear the feds are not imposing a ""one-size-fits-all"" building code. Palin sounds like someone looking for a fight when there isn't one. We find her statement to be False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AE29C0>],/factchecks/2009/jun/11/sarah-palin/palin-veto-stimulus-energy-efficiency-building-cod/
"['National', 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Mike Pence']","
Pence claims that Obama said energy costs will skyrocket with a cap-and-trade plan
","With Congress debating a cap-and-trade plan to reduce global warming, House Republicans are touting an alternative that they say will be less expensive.

Instead of regulating carbon dioxide by forcing power companies to buy and trade polluting credits, why not subsidize renewable fuel production and build new nuclear reactors, posited GOP Congressman Mike Pence on MSNBC's  Morning Joe  on June 10, 2009. Otherwise, he said, power companies will pass the cost of buying those credits on to the consumer, driving up the price of energy.
 
Pence wanted to make clear that he was not taking credit for that economic prediction.

""I don't think you need to look any further than the president himself ... who literally said [if] his cap-and-trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, 'necessarily skyrocket,'"" said Pence. He added that Democrat ""John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax, and a 'great big one.'""

It didn't take us long to find Barack Obama's original quote, which came from a videotaped interview he did with the  San Francisco Chronicle  editorial board very early in the presidential campaign, January 2008.

""Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket,"" Obama told the  Chronicle  . ""Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers.""

While Obama was talking specifically about cap-and-trade, he was also making a larger point that the biggest challenge will be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary.

""The problem is can you get the American people to say this is really important,"" Obama said.

So, Pence is right. Obama did say that cap-and-trade would be costly to power plants and to consumers.

What's fuzzy, however, is  how  costly. PolitiFact has already  looked into the issue  and found that estimates vary. Republicans say each household will pay $3,100 a year, a figure they came up with based upon a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study that predicted a cap-and-trade proposal would generate $366 billion annually. On March 24, 2009, we gave the claim a Pants on Fire ruling because the GOP's calculation was badly flawed and because the GOP used the figure even though the author of the MIT study had told them it was wrong. And in an April 1 letter to House Republicans, authors of the MIT study said that the report was being misinterpreted; by their count, estimates hover closer to $340 per family.

Congress has its own estimate: A 15 percent cut in carbon emissions would cost the average household about $1,600, according to a March 12, 2009, Congressional Budget Office testimony.

It is worth noting that the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the  Chronicle  nearly a year and a half ago. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. Furthermore, revenue from auctioned permits will help consumers pay for increased energy prices, according to Obama's first budget.

Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would ""necessarily skyrocket,"" and because Pence got Obama's words just right, we give Pence a True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ffafdf4-5637-4e52-8ff3-7d5f0ecab7f6",[<zip object at 0x0000028097030A00>],/factchecks/2009/jun/11/mike-pence/pence-claims-obama-said-energy-costs-will-skyrocke/
"['National', 'Bankruptcy', 'Health Care', 'Chris Dodd']","
Medical bankruptcy study not so clear-cut
","Sen. Chris Dodd wrote about the need for health reform in an op-ed published in a Connecticut newspaper. ""Health care costs are rising faster than our economy is growing, crushing family budgets and businesses alike,"" Dodd wrote. ""This week, we learned that 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies were caused by medical problems,"" he added. Dodd correctly cites a number from a study published in the  American Journal of Medicine.  The report states without reservation, ""Using a conservative definition, 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies in 2007 were medical."" But that's not the end of the story. We first looked at this issue back in 2007, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton used 2001 data from the same authors to claim that half of bankruptcies had medical causes. The authors include David Himmelstein of Harvard Medical School and Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School. In our article about Clinton's claim, we noted that only 28.3 percent of bankruptcies were attributed to illness or injury alone. That number grew to 46.2 percent when researchers asked about additional factors such as unpaid medical bills, lost income due to illness, or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills. In the most recent data, questions were asked slightly differently. But 29 percent of respondents attributed their bankruptcy to medical bills from illness or injury. Asked another way, 32.1 percent said a medical problem suffered by themselves or their spouse caused the bankruptcy. The number rose to 62 percent when people were asked if medical-related issues such as unpaid medical bills, lost income due to illness, or the mortgage of a home to pay medical bills contributed to their bankruptcy. Between 2001 and 2007, Congress overhauled the rules for bankruptcy, making the process more complicated. This drove down the number of overall bankruptcy filings. So the absolute numbers of medical bankruptcies is lower as well. The study doesn't give absolute numbers, so we did the math for you, using the studies' percentages and data from the American Bankruptcy Institute. In 2001, consumer filings were 1.45 million, so medical bankruptcies would have been 670,837 cases. In 2007, consumer bankruptcies were 822,590, so medical bankruptcies would have been 510,828. The authors say that the legislation didn't affect their findings: ""New restrictions fall equally on medical and nonmedical bankruptcies, with no preferences for medical debts or sick debtors."" That's true, but it's also true that the legislation created a sharp decline in bankruptcy filings. It seems to us that it's possible the legislation deterred bankruptcy so that only people who were really desperate for relief from their debts would file. This could conceivably drive up the proportion of people who filed due to unexpected illness. So we wonder if the 62 percent number is higher because fewer people filed. (For more detail on this issue, check out the economics blogger  Megan McCardle of The Atlantic  , who has criticized the most recent study.) We should also note that the study appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, but two of the authors belong to the group Physicians for a National Health Program, a group that advocates for a universal, single-payer health program. Finally, we feel another study is worth mentioning that complicates the definition of medical bankruptcies. Ning Zhu of the University of California, Davis, has a 2008 draft study analyzing bankruptcies filed in Delaware in 2003. He found that overspending on household expenditures such as houses and automobiles contributed significantly to bankruptcy filings. His data show that the overspending made people more likely to file for bankruptcy after an illness. That may sound like a ""no duh"" conclusion, but it raises questions about medical bankruptcies and how they are defined. If people overspend so much that they need everything to go right to meet their financial obligations, and then they get sick, should those bankruptcies properly be categorized as medical bankruptcies? We're not suggesting there's an easy answer here, but it does make the category of ""medical bankruptcy"" a good bit more complicated. The statistic that we think is most reliable is the percentage of people who say medical bills were the reason for their bankruptcy, and that number is 29 percent. The 2007 study uses a broader definition to conclude that 62.1 percent of all bankruptcies have medical-related causes. Dodd is citing that number correctly. But we find that percentage questionable because it reflects a broad definition of medical issues that contribute to bankruptcy. We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D8F840>],/factchecks/2009/jun/11/chris-dodd/medical-bankruptcy-study-not-clear-cut/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says government has so far turned a profit on money used to stabilize banks
","
Admit it: When the federal government decided last fall to spend hundreds of billions to stabilize banks through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, you thought the money was as good as gone.
 
Not so, President Barack Obama said at the White House on June 9, 2009.
 
""Several financial institutions are set to pay back $68 billion to taxpayers,"" he said. ""And while we know that we will not escape the worst financial crisis in decades without some losses to taxpayers, it's worth noting that in the first round of repayments from these companies the government has actually turned a profit.""
 
A quick summary of how we got to this point:
 
As part of the TARP, the government invested about $200 billion in 600 banks across the country, essentially buying up preferred stock.
 
A lot of banks now want out. The government money came with strings, including restrictions on executive compensation. Plus, there was a stigma attached to participating in the government program.
 
On June 9, the Treasury Department announced that 10 of the largest financial institutions that participated in the Capital Purchase Program (through TARP) have been approved to repay $68 billion. Yes, they had to be approved to repay the money. The companies had to prove they no longer needed the money, because the government doesn't want them begging for more down the road.
 
To date, those 10 companies have paid dividends on their preferred stock to the Treasury totaling about $1.8 billion, the Treasury announced. Overall, dividend payments from all of the 600 bank participants has come to about $4.5 billion so far. That's commensurate with the 5 percent (annualized) dividend return that was part of the terms of the program.
 
Now, the government borrowed the money it invested in the banks, and so dividends from the preferred stock are offset by interest the government has had to pay on its loans. But that interest rate has been lower than the 5 percent dividend rate. So when the companies repay the loans, it will result in some profit to the government, banking analysts told us.
 
There's another potential profit center. As part of the deal with banks, the federal government received warrants to buy stock at a future date (with the hope that as the economy improved and bank stock value rose, the government could share in the bounty). According to the Treasury announcement on June 9, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase those warrants at fair market value. Experts believe that could fetch the government several billion dollars. That's in addition to the dividends.
 
David John, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that while it's accurate to say the government is turning a profit on these specific transactions, it was so costly to create the TARP that ""you can't say the overall program is a moneymaker.""
 
And, John said, the 10 financial institutions that will be repaying the Treasury are among the strongest. It remains to be seen how the others will fare, he said.
 
""It's way too soon to judge the entire program,"" John said. ""I'd be surprised if it ends up anything better than break-even.""
 
Still, the public too often tagged TARP as a bailout, said John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.
 
""It's as if people thought money was handed out to banks,"" Hall said. ""It wasn't. And it drove us nuts. The government has turned a profit. It made money plus some.""
 
Bank analyst Bert Ely said while the government may end up losing money on investments in some financial firms, it's likely the entirety of the bank portion of the TARP will ultimately turn a profit.
 
The 5 percent paid in dividends on preferred stock purchased by the Treasury will certainly outpace the interest rate on money borrowed to finance the program, he said. And the warrants could also prove profitable.
 
""People think the government gave banks money,"" Ely said. ""They made investments in banks.""
 
As for Obama's claim, he is careful to note that the overall program could still cost taxpayers money, but he is correct to say the government turned a profit on the first round of repayments. We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Religion', 'Stimulus', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Stimulus bill won't change status of Sunday school
","In a fundraising e-mail, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says that President Barack Obama is anti-Christian. ""In fact, buried inside Obama's trillion-dollar stimulus package is anti-Christian legislation that will stop churches from using public schools for meeting on Sundays, as well as Boy Scouts and student Bible study groups,"" Gingrich wrote. The e-mail is part of Gingrich's fundraising efforts for an organization called Renewing American Leadership, which will ""bring moral leadership back to our nation."" We've looked before at a similar claim that the stimulus had an  antireligion clause  . It's based on the part of the bill that provides $3.5 billion for public and private colleges and universities to modernize, renovate or repair facilities. The bill says money may not be used for buildings that are ""used for sectarian instruction or religious worship or a school or department of divinity; or in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission."" Back in February, before the stimulus had passed, we checked out a claim from Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina that the language would stop students from having prayer groups or Bible studies in their dorms. We found that it wouldn't. The courts have been clear that religious groups are entitled to the same equal access to public facilities as any other group. While someone might conceivably file a lawsuit against prayer groups or Bible studies in dorms, those lawsuits would fail, according to all the experts we consulted. Howard Simon of the ACLU said it was preposterous to claim that the ACLU would sue if students in a dorm want to share their faith or organize a Bible study, even if that dorm was renovated with federal funds. ""On what basis would there be a lawsuit? There is a First Amendment in our country. People have a constitutional right to state their faith."" Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the language in the stimulus plan amounts to little more than boilerplate for federal legislation, similar to language used for decades in the Higher Education Facilities Act. It is simply designed, he said, to ensure that federal money isn't used to build churches and other religious facilities. But that doesn't mean religious groups can't use university facilities. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that religious groups have as much right to equal access to public facilities as anyone else. For example, in 2001, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children, which had been barred from using a public school for weekly afterschool meetings. Back when the stimulus was still being debated, Robert Alt, deputy director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that the language in the stimulus bill was written too broadly. Yes, he said, the Supreme Court has made clear what the law is on all this, so why add the language at all? The provision, as written, ""would seem to permit a legal challenge"" to all sorts of religious activity on college campuses in buildings renovated with federal funds, he said. Given the Supreme Court's decisions, though, wouldn't those challenges fail? ""The Supreme Court precedent is perfectly clear,"" Alt said. ""I think they would lose."" The new aspect of Gingrich's claim is that the stimulus language would affect church groups that meet in public schools, and that the Boy Scouts would be considered an excluded religious group. Rick Tyler, founding director of Renewing American Leadership and a spokesman for Gingrich, said in an e-mail that these concerns were based on the same provision that DeMint was concerned about. But we find that's not plausible because the stimulus clause refers specifically to money for higher education, not elementary and secondary schools as Gingrich's comment about ""public schools"" suggests. And Gingrich's claim is ridiculously false because court rulings have consistently said that religious groups have the same equal access rights for the public schools. ""The law is fairly settled,"" said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation. Her group opposes allowing church groups to meet in public schools, but it is legal, she said. She pointed to two cases that allow churches to use public school facilities just like everyone else: the 2001 Good News Club case we mentioned previously and a 1991 case called  Lamb’s Chapel vs. Center Moriches Union Free School District   .  The stimulus bill uses ""boilerplate language,"" she said. ""That's not going to override two Supreme Court cases."" We found little support for DeMint's claim back in February that the provision would mean that students couldn't meet in dorm rooms for Bible study. Gingrich's claim is even more ridiculous to suggest the Boy Scouts would be among those banned from public schools. In short, we haven't seen anything that supports Gingrich's claim that the stimulus will stop church groups from meeting at public schools, nor Boy Scouts or Bible study groups. In fact, the clause on religion does not even apply to public schools. Inasmuch as this one seems aimed at unnecessarily inflaming the conservative Christian base, we'd like to retort with some flames of our own.
