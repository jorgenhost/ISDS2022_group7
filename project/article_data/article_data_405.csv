Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke falsely claims he hasn't talked about confiscating guns
","Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke is not talking about confiscating Americans’ guns  — except for when he is talking about it. On Oct. 16 on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe,"" co-host Joe Scarborough opened an interview with the former Texas congressman by saying:  ""Tell us about your plan on the confiscation of guns which, obviously, many believe is unconstitutional, also very concerned that it plays right into the hands of Republican candidates.""  O’Rourke replied:  ""To be clear, I’m not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns. But I do think that, for those weapons of war  — AR-15s, AK-47s — these were designed and sold to the militaries of the world to kill people on a battlefield and there are more than 16 million of them in America. And we’ve seen the devastating effect that they can have in Dayton, Ohio, or El Paso, Texas, or Odessa, not too far from where I live. Those must be bought back or else each of them are an instrument potentially of terror in this country."" In reality, O’Rourke’s answer isn’t clear at all. We’ll help you sort out the mental gymnastics. In both the El Paso and the Dayton mass shootings, assault-style weapons, legal in both states, were used. Each weapon was semiautomatic — the gunmen could fire as quickly as they could pull the trigger — and carried enough ammunition to potentially kill dozens of people in minutes.  The El Paso shooter used a semi-automatic Kalashnikov-style rifle (also known as an AK-47-style rifle), which typically uses a magazine that has 30 rounds. The Dayton shooter used an AR-15-style pistol, modified to act as a rifle, with a drum magazine that can hold up to 100 rounds. At least two times previously, O’Rourke was asked whether he would support confiscation of guns he calls weapons of war. He said yes. Sept. 12 Democratic presidential debate Co-host David Muir: ""Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country. You've gone further. You've said, quote, ‘Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.’ You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?"" O’Rourke: ""I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. ...When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland (Texas), there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."" Sept. 18 CNN’s ""Cuomo Prime Time Host Chris Cuomo: ""All right, so let's state the proposition. Are you, in fact, in favor of gun confiscation? O'Rourke: ""Yes, when it comes to AR-15s and AK-47s, weapons designed for use on a military battlefield. ...So, when it comes to those weapons, Chris, the answer is yes. But when it comes to firearms used for hunting or self-defense, the answer is no."" On the same day as the ""Morning Joe"" interview, CNN ""New Day"" host Alysin Camerota asked O’Rourke: ""How do you plan to get assault weapons away from people who don’t want to give them up?"" O’Rourke replied: ""It’s pretty simple. As with any law in this country, we would expect our fellow Americans to follow the law."" Later, Camerota pushed back by saying mass shooters would not follow such a law. Then she said of O’Rourke’s proposal: ""It sounds like confiscation.""  O’Rourke replied: ""No, I’m not suggesting that. And I think that’s why people use the word confiscation, because it scares people. What I’m talking about is a mandatory buyback, where Americans who own an AR-15 or an AK-47 will sell that weapon back to the government.  O’Rourke made similar comments on ""Morning Joe."" Scarborough asked what the federal government would do if owners of AR-15s and AK-47s refused to sell. O’Rourke said: ""Just as in any law that is not followed or flagrantly abused, there have to be consequences or else there is no respect for the law. So, in that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be potentially used against somebody else."" (Update: We’ve added some additional context from O’Rourke’s statement after initially publishing this fact-check.)  Asked later in the interview about going door to door to take conventional handguns, O’Rourke said they aren’t as lethal as assault-style weapons and there is a legitimate use of handguns for protection in a home. O’Rourke’s campaign website says he is calling for ""a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons and a voluntary buyback program for handguns,"" and that ""individuals who fail to participate in the mandatory buyback of assault weapons will be fined."" ""Beto has been clear that he is talking about a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, which is not confiscation,"" his campaign told us. O’Rourke’s argument that his plan isn’t confiscation ultimately rests on the fact that the government would buy the guns away from its owner. But that’s misleading. Gun owners wouldn’t have a say in the matter, and just because they’d be compensated, some likely wouldn’t see the trade in terms of equal value. Owners would be required to sell, and if they didn’t, what happens next is murky. O’Rourke says people might be fined, and that they might be somehow compelled to turn their weapons in through the buy-back program. As you game out scenarios how this might play out, they all lead to something that most people would consider confiscation. Clearly, many gun owners who legally purchased and own weapons that the government would take would view that as confiscation, even if they were paid for the guns. ""It is unreasonable to call what Mr. O’Rourke is proposing anything other than confiscation,"" gun law expert George Mocsary, a law professor at the University of Wyoming, told PolitiFact. ""Imagine the situation when an owner of one of the weapons refuses to sell. He or she is issued a fine. The owner still has the weapon, however. Does paying the fine mean that he or she can now keep the weapon and it is perfectly legal?  Certainly not,"" Mocsary said. ""There is no scenario under which the owner of one of the designated weapons gets to keep it. That is confiscation."" O’Rourke said: ""To be clear, I’m not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns."" O’Rourke has said ""yes"" and ""hell, yes"" when asked about confiscating assault-style weapons. And his mandatory buyback proposes taking those weapons from people, even if it involves a purchase. We rate O’Rourke’s claim that he is ""not talking about confiscating anybody’s guns"" as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C4B9C0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/21/beto-orourke/despite-his-claim-presidential-candidate-beto-orou/
"['Poverty', 'Illinois', 'Mark Batinick']","
No, 30% of the nation’s poor don’t reside in California
","In the thick of tax policy debates, Illinois politicians often point to other states to make their case. And this year has been no exception in Illinois’ most pitched policy battle — the debate over whether to replace Illinois’ current flat-rate income tax with a graduated system in which taxpayers with more income would pay higher rates. We’ve already fact-checked several claims from Illinois politicians — including Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is spearheading the push — about how states with graduated tax systems are functioning. Last week, we heard a new one. It was a striking criticism of California, a graduated-tax state, from a suburban Republican lawmaker opposed to Pritzker’s plan. During a conversation about the graduated income tax on a WCPT-AM talk show, a caller mentioned California in a positive light. In response, GOP state Rep. Mark Batinick of Plainfield, cautioned against using the state as a model for policy in Illinois. ""The people being hurt in California — I think it has 30% or a third of the country’s people living at or below the poverty level,"" Batinick said. While California’s poverty rate ranks among the nation’s highest, federal data show the state is far from being home to a third of the nation’s poor. The federal government measures poverty several different ways. For comparing poverty figures nationally, the U.S. Census Bureau recommends using data from the Current Population Survey, its official source for national poverty estimates. The survey contradicts Batinick’s claim. California’s share of those in the U.S. living below the poverty line is just over 12%, according to the latest data. That mirrors its share of the nation’s population overall. The Census also releases a supplemental poverty measure, which accounts for cost-of-living — including taxes, housing, medical costs and non-cash benefits people can put toward their basic needs. Its most recent release gives California a larger share of those living in poverty nationwide, but still falls well below what Batinick said. Here, the math works out to just below 17%. Researchers say the supplemental measure does a better job at capturing poverty, but it’s still not perfect — including for California, where housing costs are high. Zach Parolin, a research scientist at the Center on Poverty & Social Policy at Columbia University, suggested looking at ""food insecurity"" — a separate federal ranking measured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — to add to the picture of economic hardship in California. When comparing by state how accessible food is for members of households to live active and healthy lives, California performs better than the national average. California’s graduated income tax starts with a rate of 1% for those making the least and then increases by marginal rates before topping out at 13.3% for earnings over $1 million, according to the Tax Foundation. Pritzker's plan — approved by the Democratic-controlled General Assembly earlier this year — would tax those making less than $250,000 at the state’s current rate of 4.95%. Rates would go up on earnings above that amount. The highest rate calls for a 7.99% tax on the entire income of single filers who make more than $750,000 and joint filers who earn more than $1 million. The law won’t go into effect unless voters in November 2020 approve a constitutional amendment to permit graduated rates. When we asked Batinick about the connection he was trying to draw, he told us he was underscoring his general point that California-style policies are not a panacea to the challenges facing Illinois. As for the evidence behind his specific claim about poverty? Batinick acknowledged he was mistaken and said he should have referred to welfare recipients and not people below the poverty line. Referencing a 2018 federal report that noted Californians make up 38% of families receiving benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, Batinick said he does not look at California as ""a state that I’m supposed to model."" But that’s not what Batinick said on-air, where he referred specifically to the poverty line. And some experts we contacted expressed caution about drawing conclusions on poverty in California based on a single program, in part because the money that goes into TANF makes up a relatively small share of government spending in the universe of programs meant to assist people with low incomes. Batinick said California is home to ""30% or a third of the country’s people living at or below the poverty level."" Federal poverty measures show that figure is significantly overblown — a point Batinick conceded. Instead, he said he meant to reference the state’s share of welfare recipients and cited a federal report that noted more than a third of TANF recipients reside in California. However, that particular federal program is far from the largest or only form of assistance the government provides to low-income individuals to help them with their basic needs. What’s more, it refers to something different than what Batinick originally said. We rate his claim False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Income', 'Mick Mulvaney']","
Mulvaney wrong that Donald Trump won't profit from choosing Trump resort to host G-7
","The trips that President Donald Trump has made as president to resorts he owns have raised questions about whether he has improperly enriched himself or violated the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits high-level U.S. officials from accepting gifts or benefits from foreign governments. So, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was ready when he opened an Oct. 17 news conference by speaking about the annual Group of Seven summit. It had just been announced that the president decided the G-7 gathering of world leaders in June 2020 will be held at Trump National Doral, a 643-room golf resort outside Miami that advertises it as being ""infused with the Trump standard of excellence."" ""Again, anticipating your questions, how is this not an emoluments violation, is the president going to profit from this?"" Mulvaney said. ""I think the president has pretty much made it very clear since he’s got here that he doesn’t profit from being here, he has no interest in profit from being here; that’s one of the reasons that he’s not taken a salary since he’s been here, he’s given that salary to charity, will not be profiting here."" At the very least, Trump can expect to profit from future business that will be generated at Doral as a result of hosting an exclusive, three-day summit that will get worldwide media coverage. Since Trump took office, several foreign countries, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Philippines, have hosted national holiday celebrations at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. We found that the Saudi government spent $270,000 at the hotel between October 2016, the month before Trump’s election, and March 2017 alone. Trump’s more than 100 trips as president to properties he owns, such as Doral, the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., and resorts in Los Angeles and Scotland, have brought those businesses at least $1.6 million in revenue, but probably much more, the Washington Post reported in June 2019. The revenue comes from federal officials and others who pay to stay where Trump stays. The White House and Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back up Mulvaney’s claim that Trump wouldn’t be profiting from the G-7 summit. But Mulvaney did elaborate on his claim during the news conference. Doral ""is doing this at cost,"" Mulvaney said. ""As a result, it’s actually dramatically cheaper for us to do it at Doral compared to the other final sites that we had."" Asked by a reporter about the summit being a ""huge branding opportunity"" for Doral, Mulvaney downplayed the notion by noting Trump’s visits as president to Trump resorts.  ""Donald Trump’s brand is probably strong enough as it is and doesn’t need any more help on that,"" Mulvaney said. ""It’s the most recognizable name in the English language and probably around the world right now. So, that has nothing to do"" with Doral being chosen for the summit.  Trump has backed off day-to-day control of his businesses, but he’s still an owner. And, despite Mulvaney’s statement about the Trump brand, business at Doral is down. Profits have dropped 69% in three years, though Doral still provides Trump more revenue than any other hotel or golf club, according to the Post. The G-7 is an event unlike any other and is held in the United States only every eight years. The summit, for discussing a broad range of issues, rotates among sites chosen by the seven member countries, as well as by the European Union. It will draw seven foreign leaders, of France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, along with Trump. Plus, it will attract hundreds of diplomats, journalists and security personnel to Doral during one of its slowest months of the year for the resort — and attract worldwide attention. And even if somehow the event would be structured so that Doral would only break even on room bookings, that doesn’t take into account other spending by guests while on the property. ""Filling the resort during the summer — the off-season in Florida — even ‘at cost,’ reduces overhead and contributes to the corporate bottom line,"" said Steven Schooner, professor of government procurement law at George Washington University. ""But, far more importantly, think of it as no-cost advertising or promotion investment. Having a resort property fill TV screens and newspaper pages with images of world leaders is the kind of publicity that's nearly impossible to put a price on."" The publicity surrounding such an event ""incredibly valuable to a resort's owner,"" said David Berins, co-founder and chairman emeritus of the International Society of Hospitality Consultants and a 53-year hotel industry veteran. ""The Trump Organization will not only benefit from the publicity in the form of future bookings,"" Berins said, ""but you can be sure that the resort will be chock-a-block with high-paying reporters, photographers, television crews and others who are billed separately from the event invoice not only during the summit but for many days before and after."" ""And, what does 'at cost' mean?"" Berins added. ""Will there be an allocation of the payroll for the accountants, the greenskeepers, the plumbers and painters, the electricity and water, or does it just mean the direct costs of the meet itself like tent rentals, food and beverage, and audio-visual equipment?  Will the costs of painting, replacing carpeting, and making everything look new and shiny be included?"" Mulvaney said Trump ""will not be profiting"" from the G-7 summit meeting to be held at Trump’s Doral resort. The acting White House chief of staff says the Miami-area resort will host the gathering ""at cost."" But the White House did not explain how that would work. Moreover, the summit is a one-of-a-kind event, attracting seven world leaders, hundreds of diplomats, journalists and other guests, and worldwide publicity. Even at cost, it fills the hotel during Florida’s slow season and guests would be doing other spending on the property even if the rooms were rented at break-even prices. Mulvaney’s statement is inaccurate. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DF6FC0>],/factchecks/2019/oct/18/mick-mulvaney/mulvaney-wrong-donald-trump-wont-profit-g7/

Eric Trump’s false claim that the Trump family ‘got out of all international business’
","Eric Trump, President Donald Trump’s second son, falsely claimed the Trump family children ""got out of all international business"" after their father took office. ""The difference between us and Hunter (Biden) is when my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business,"" he told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in response to a question about the younger Biden’s ABC interview.   The claim is the latest in the Trump team’s attacks against Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 contender. Facing an impeachment inquiry, the president has repeatedly charged, without evidence, that the elder Biden forced out Ukraine’s lead prosecutor to protect Hunter, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian company that was once under investigation.  But as they accuse Hunter Biden of riding his family name to a fortune in Ukraine, the Trump children have put almost no stops to their own overseas business dealings, we found.  Multiple news outlets and government accountability groups have documented international business dealings Eric Trump and his siblings have conducted since Donald Trump took office. In some cases, the Trump children themselves have celebrated their activities overseas. Before his inauguration, Donald Trump announced that he would be retaining ownership of the Trump Organization but transferring day-to-day control to his oldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr.  The move followed a post-election promise Trump made on Twitter, when he pledged that ""no new deals will be done during my term(s) in office."" He elaborated on that promise in a white paper detailing ethics rules the Trump Organization had agreed to observe.  The white paper said the Trump Organization would function like an ""asset-management company,"" pursuing no new foreign deals and donating all profits from foreign officials’ use of Trump properties to the U.S. Treasury. (In February, the company said it turned over $191,538 to cover foreign profits from 2018.) But Trump continues to make money from existing licensing and property deals sprawled across more than 20 countries, according to an analysis of Trump's foreign business interests from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group tracking money in politics. The Trump campaign pointed to an article in The Hill and otherwise directed our inquiry to the Trump Organization, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. As a number of news outlets have reported, the Trump Organization has continued conducting business abroad. ""Eric Trump’s claim that ‘we got out of all international business’ is clearly and demonstrably false,"" said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government watchdog that tracks Trump’s conflicts of interest. ""Both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have repeatedly traveled internationally to conduct business."" In September, a local council in Scotland voted to let the company build 550 homes and a second golf course as an expansion of a Trump-owned golf course in the area. Eric Trump described the construction as ""a new phase of development"" in a celebratory tweet.  Congratulations to our extraordinary @TrumpScotland team! Minutes ago, we received full & total approval for a new phase of development to include 500 homes, 50 cottages, sports center, retail & more. We also received approval to build a 2nd golf course! Very proud of them! pic.twitter.com/odVxomGdmf Also recently, the Trump Organization received approval to build 53 houses and a new ballroom at its seaside golf course in Ireland, according to the Washington Post.  In addition to managing existing properties and licensures, the Trump brothers have built on deals that were already in the works or inked before Trump became president, in some cases going back and giving new life to old projects that had previously seemed abandoned. ""Some Trump-branded foreign projects have only been made public after Trump’s election and others have significantly expanded,"" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics. ""Projects that appeared to be long-forgotten or dormant were also revisited after Trump's election."" In 2017, for example, Eric Trump went to the Dominican Republic to revive a deal from 2007. Trump Organization lawyers argued then that the deal was never dead and therefore did not count as the type of new foreign deal the company had promised to avoid. But according to the Associated Press, no new projects there had ""been built or announced in a decade."" In 2018, Donald Trump Jr. traveled to sell condos at high-rises in India, where the Trump Organization has licensed its name to five projects on deals signed before the election. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2017 that promotional materials for one of those projects said buyers could be associated with ""celebrity & POTUS Donald Trump’s Trump Organisation,"" a move the Trump Organization blamed on a broker. In August, Trump Jr. flew to Indonesia to promote two Trump-branded resorts that have yet to be built. Bookbinder noted that in an internal presentation, the Indonesian company building those properties said the Trump international portfolio had an ""aggressive global expansion underway,"" with ""numerous projects in the pipeline."" The Trump Organization has been similarly involved in projects in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay, said Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog group. Amey pointed to articles in Politico, the Daily Beast and the Washington Post that described how providing Secret Service protection for the Trump brothers on their business trips has cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. ""Let's not forget that each year President Trump lists numerous international ventures in his financial disclosure records,"" Amey said, adding that Eric Trump’s claim was ""incorrect."" The brothers have also sold off many Trump real estate holdings, according to Forbes. In January 2018, they offloaded a piece of land in the Dominican Republic for $3.2 million, a move Forbes called ""the clearest violation of their father’s pledge to do no new foreign deals."" Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who both serve advisory roles in the White House, have also benefited from foreign business ties since Trump took office. Ivanka Trump kept her international fashion business running for 18 months after her father was elected. Amid trade talks with China last year, she received a number of trademarks from the country related to a variety of her fashion products. She added more this year, as well. ""Certainly, filing for trademarks in an international country would count as international business,"" said Jessica Tillipman, assistant dean and a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School. Kushner remains a partial owner of his family’s own real estate company, but he has divested some assets to a trust controlled by his mother, according to the New York Times. Last year, his company made a roughly $1 billion bailout deal with Brookfield Asset Management, which is partly owned by the government of Qatar, to save a failing New York property.  Eric Trump said, ""When my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business."" The Trump Organization said it would not make new foreign deals during Donald Trump’s presidency. But the Trump brothers have traveled across the globe, managing properties and taking action on deals that they say were signed or under works before Trump took office. Regardless of whether these moves should be considered new foreign deals, it’s ridiculous to claim the Trump family children stopped all international business after their father’s election.

DNC off on Trump, Wisconsin manufacturing jobs
","If there’s one thing President Donald Trump can’t get enough of, it’s reminding the American people about the economy.  And nearly three years into his presidency, it seems like his favorite topic is jobs.  In 2016, Trump ran on promises to create millions of jobs and bring back work to traditional American blue-collar industries such as steel, manufacturing and coal mining.  But the Democratic National Committee says the opposite has happened with manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- two states Trump narrowly carried over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. ""Trump promised to bring manufacturing jobs back to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- that hasn’t happened,"" the DNC claimed in a Sept. 20, 2019 post on the ""War Room"" section of its website. ""Instead, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year.""  Are they right? Let’s dig into the numbers. The DNC ""War Room"" is a rapid response operation that writes quick statements based on opposition research against Trump and GOP campaigns. When asked to provide backup, Daniel Wessel, the deputy War Room director, essentially repeated the claim from the site and pointed us to a Sept. 20, 2019 Bloomberg news report about the loss of factory jobs. The article noted Wisconsin and Pennsylvania led the nation, but took the same one-year approach from August 2018 to August 2019. Using raw numbers, the two states did indeed have the biggest loss of manufacturing jobs from August 2018 to August 2019, according to a state employment survey released by the Labor Department. Wisconsin lost about 5,200 seasonally adjusted jobs, while Pennsylvania lost around 7,700. The Wisconsin State Journal reported in an Oct. 10, 2019, article that Wisconsin’s manufacturing job loss was the largest year-over-year decline since the last recession.  Case closed? Not exactly. First, on a percentage basis, other states had larger losses.  Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Maryland all lost a larger share of manufacturing jobs from August 2018 to August 2019. (Though, we should note, those states combined have fewer manufacturing jobs than either Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.) More importantly, in arguing Trump is not fulfilling his promise as it relates to manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the DNC is using a narrow set of numbers -- a single year’s worth. But the president has been in office for nearly three years. So, the DNC went cherry-picking and, not surprisingly, found a cherry. The longer-range jobs picture is more complex. Consider: The government’s latest jobs report showed 2,000 manufacturing jobs were lost nationally in September 2019, compared to 18,000 jobs added in September 2018.  Meanwhile, for all of 2018, there was an average increase of about 22,000 jobs per month. Through the first nine months of 2019, the increase has been about 5,000 jobs per month.  In short, there’s been an uptick of manufacturing jobs under Trump -- an increase of about 373,000 jobs -- despite the current slowdown. All told, Wisconsin has about 472,000 manufacturing jobs while Pennsylvania has about 562,000. From January 2017, when Trump took office, until August 2019, Wisconsin went from about 465,000 manufacturing jobs to 472,000 -- an increase of 1.5%. Pennsylvania had about 561,000 manufacturing jobs when Trump took office. As of August 2019, the state sat at slightly over 562,000 jobs, a 0.2% increase.  So both states have actually seen an increases in these jobs, albeit modest ones. Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University, said manufacturing jobs have been in decline over the Midwest for most of the past year due to the ongoing trade war with China. ""The trade war is both directly contributing to this by increasing the costs of production and by causing supply chain disruptions which reduce demand for exported goods,"" Hicks said.  Hicks said that leads to factory job losses. Sometimes, where you end up depends on where you begin. Consider Barack Obama’s tenure, when manufacturing jobs faced an ebb and flow largely due to the turbulent economy. When Obama took office in January 2009, the nation had 12.6 million manufacturing jobs. This was in the midst of the Great Recession, which led to a low point of 11.5 million manufacturing jobs -- a loss of some 900,000 -- roughly a year later, in February 2010. So, if you measured just that window, you’d get a worse picture than if you looked at Obama’s full term. But from February 2010 until Obama left office in January 2017, there was an increase of more than 900,000 manufacturing jobs, hitting a total of 12.4 million. It was an overall loss, as PolitiFact National has noted, of about 192,000 manufacturing jobs. But much smaller than if you pulled out a single year.  The DNC claims Trump is breaking a campaign pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania since the two states ""have lost the most manufacturing jobs in the past year."" We found data from the Labor Department showing Wisconsin and Pennsylvania lost the most jobs over the last year compared to the rest of the country, at least in raw numbers.  But they weren’t the worst on a percentage basis. And the two states have seen a modest uptick in manufacturing jobs since Trump took office. So it’s not accurate to use that cherry-picked data as evidence Trump has broken his promise on growing manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That’s what we rate this claim.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097707D00>],/factchecks/2019/oct/18/democratic-national-committee/dnc-trump-manufacturing-jobs/

How many Americans are killed and injured by guns every month?
","Former state Sen. Richard Ojeda, D-W.Va., recently lamented the toll of gun-related violence in the United States. ""I’m loving watching these GOP Senators and members of Congress saying the same old stuff concerning gun violence and listening to them get their asses handed to them by citizens that are tired of seeing 75-100 folks killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence,"" Ojeda tweeted on Aug. 20.  I’m loving watching these GOP Senators and members of Congress saying the same old stuff concerning gun violence and listening to them get their asses handed to them by citizens that are tired of seeing 75-100 folks killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence. Is the number that large? When we reached out to Ojeda, he said we should look at the federal statistics and ""just do the research.""  We did, and we found that his numbers were actually an understatement.  The official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides the number of gun-related deaths nationally. The most recent year for which data is available is 2017. Here are the figures: Homicides: 14,542 deaths by guns Suicides: 23,854 deaths by guns Other: 1,377 deaths by guns Total deaths by guns: 39,773 That works out to 3,314 total gun-related deaths nationally per month, and 1,212 gun-related homicides per month. Both figures are much higher than Ojeda’s estimate of 75 to 100 per month.  However, Ojeda’s figures would have been in the ballpark if he had been talking about gun-related deaths per day. There are about 109 gun-related deaths per day, about 40 of which are homicides and 65 of which are suicides. We also checked to see if the numbers work for firearm deaths in West Virginia alone. They don’t -- in this case, the number is too small. West Virginia saw 348 total deaths from guns in 2017, which works out to 29 per month, or close to one a day. What about injuries? The CDC has data on that as well.  In 2015, the most recent year available, there were 84,997 non-fatal injuries by guns nationally. That works out to 7,083 per month, a number well above the 200 Ojeda cited. Here, too, the data fits better if it’s calculated on a per-day basis. There were about 233 non-fatal injuries per day. That’s not far off from the number Ojeda offered. All told, though, his numbers are far off from what he said in the tweet. Our ruling Ojeda tweeted that ""75-100 folks (are) killed a month and over 200 wounded by senseless gun violence."" In fact, Ojeda understated the number of deaths and injuries from guns. His numbers are roughly right for gun deaths and injuries per day, rather than per month.  We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097123080>],/factchecks/2019/oct/17/richard-ojeda/how-many-americans-are-killed-and-injured-guns-eve/

How much does the city of Austin spend, per homeless person?
","Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has the city of Austin in his sights. The Republican governor has threatened state action if the Austin City Council does not take steps to address its decision to lift a ban on camping in public places that is aimed at homeless people. In one of several tweets criticizing the city, Abbott suggested that local leaders are not directing available resources appropriately. ""The City of Austin is dedicating more than $20,000 PER HOMELESS PERSON in Austin,"" Abbott wrote in a tweet. ""The problem isn't resources. It's prioritization. It's inaction & word salad on an urgent public health & safety issue. Haven For Hope in San Antonio works. Lawlessness is never the answer."" Haven for Hope is a shelter-like program in San Antonio that operates using private and government funding. In its latest budget, the city of San Antonio allocated more than $500,000 for the program. Abbott repeated his estimate about Austin in an interview on Austin television station KXAN. ""The city of Austin is tapping into their taxpayers for more than $20,000 per homeless person,"" Abbott said. ""If they can’t get this problem fixed by spending $20,000 or more per homeless person, the problem is not the homeless. The problem is a lack of leadership in Austin, Texas."" We had to ask: Is Abbott’s estimate accurate? Sort of. While it is true that the city has allocated significant funding toward addressing homelessness, a large chunk of the funding is aimed at preventing homelessness, rather than going to programs to support individuals who are currently homeless. Austin budget looks at future programs Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the governor’s statement was based on the city’s current homeless population and its recently adopted budget. ""The current Austin homeless population is 2,255 according to ECHO,"" Wittman said in an email, referencing the non-profit Ending Community Homelessness Coalition. ""The current Austin budget calls for $62.7 million to be spent on homelessness initiatives. This breaks down to $27,804.88 per homeless person."" The Ending Community Homelessness Coalition data Wittman pointed to came from the 2019 Point in Time Count, a count of an area’s homeless population, as required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. This year’s survey shows that there were 2,255 homeless people in Austin. Of those, 1,169 were sheltered and 1,086 were unsheltered. Austin's homeless population has remained relatively steady over the past nine years, fluctuating from a high of 2,362 in 2011 to a low of 1,832 in 2015. Wittman also shared links to news articles discussing Austin's proposed budget, including one from KXAN breaking down the dollars for homelessness. ""Another report from KXAN says the city is spending $37,000 per homeless person,"" Wittman said in his email. The article explored the city’s budget proposal and included a calculation for how much money officials were planning to spend per homeless person during the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Wittman got the figure from the article right, but left out a key detail. ""If you just look at the totals, it would appear the city is planning to spend $37,000 per homeless person,"" the article reads. ""However, most of this budget isn’t going to individuals but instead to programs aimed at keeping people off the street."" Looking at the city  The Austin City Council voted in September to approve a $4.2 billion budget, which included $62.7 million for programs aimed at homelessness, plus an additional $500,000 for crisis services and ""encampment cleanups."" The funding is divided into three categories: housing displacement prevention, crisis mitigation and re-empowerment, according to a city budget document. The budget allocates roughly $20.4 million for housing displacement prevention, which includes homelessness prevention services and emergency relocation services for people at risk of being displaced from their homes. Funding under this umbrella goes toward keeping people in their houses, as opposed to services aiding individuals currently experiencing homelessness. The budget also spends $23.9 million for ""crisis mitigation,"" which includes support for emergency shelters, mental health and substance use disorder treatment and outreach teams that identify and assist homeless people ""before they reach a state of crisis."" The final $18.4 million is earmarked for creating and maintaining affordable housing and for contracting with local organizations to develop strategies for ending homelessness in the city. Only one of the three budget categories goes directly to services for people currently experiencing homelessness: the $23.9 million for ""crisis mitigation."" That would be roughly $10,000 per homeless person. Our ruling Abbott said, ""The City of Austin is dedicating more than $20,000 PER HOMELESS PERSON in Austin."" The math behind Abbott’s claim checks out for the overall budget for homeless initiatives — $62.7 million — and there are an estimated 2,255 homeless people in the city. Divided evenly, that’s $27,804 per homeless person. But a large chunk of the $62.7 million is going toward programs to prevent homelessness and toward affordable housing, not directly to people experiencing homelessness. Abbott's claim needs more context. We rate this claim Half True.

Rand Paul’s claim about taxes went over poorly on The View, but it was pretty accurate
","Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., drew a backlash from the audience of ABC’s ""The View"" when he argued that lower-income Americans get off pretty easy under the U.S. tax system. Richer Americans, he said, carry most of the freight. ""We’ve taken the poor off of the rolls. They don’t pay income tax any more. Most people below $50,000 don’t pay any income tax,"" Paul said during the Oct. 11 episode. ""The top 1 percent in our country pay 40%."" At that point, the audience began to object, and cohost Sunny Hostin told Paul, ""Our audience says that’s not true."" But Paul doubled down. ""The IRS statistics say the top 1% in our country pay 40% of the income tax,"" he said. We looked into it and found the senator was largely correct. When we reached out to Paul’s office, they said he was referring to the most recent projections for 2019 by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official arbiter of tax analysis for Congress.  For the federal income tax, the committee found that every income group below $50,000 paid a negative average share of the income burden. That means that, on the whole, families in these income groups got deductions and credits that reduced their federal income tax liability below zero. Meanwhile, the same analysis provided a snapshot of the tax burden shouldered by the top 1.2 percent of tax filers, those earning at least $500,000. This elite group collectively footed 51.5% of the nation’s individual income tax bill. That’s a larger share than what Paul said. So if you look at the federal income tax, Paul’s comment on the view is on target. Individual taxes aren’t the only ones Americans pay.  If you factor in other federal taxes, including payroll and excise taxes, the numbers change. The same Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found that those earning less than $50,000 paid 4.3% of all federal taxes. That’s still a relatively light burden, since these taxpayers earned 13% of all income generated. As for Americans earning more than $500,000, their share of the tax burden declines to 30.7% once you add in these other federal taxes. A few other analyses are broadly in line with the joint committee’s data and what Paul said. An annual analysis by the IRS found that in 2017, the top 1% paid 38.5% of federal income taxes. And taxpayers earning under $50,000 paid 5.98 percent of income taxes. (Not nothing, as Paul said, but not nearly as much.) Meanwhile, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated the breakdown for all federal taxes in 2019. The center found that those earning up to about $50,000 in income collectively paid about 4.2% of all federal taxes, while the top 1% paid about 27 percent of all federal taxes. These are averages, and individual tax burdens can vary. ""The results depend on the specific situations faced by taxpayers, such as whether or not they have children,"" said Mark Mazur, the Tax Policy Center’s director. Paul said that ""most people below $50,000 don’t pay any income tax. The top 1 percent in our country pay 40%."" Because he limited his comments to the federal income tax, Paul’s numbers are broadly accurate, and they even underplay the tax burden on the top 1%. The picture shifts once you include other types of federal taxation. Those below $50,000 still pay a small share of the full federal tax burden, but the share paid by the top 1% falls to about 30%. So Paul’s statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0E3740>],/factchecks/2019/oct/17/rand-paul/fact-checking-rand-pauls-appearance-view/

After attacks by Turkey, Trump falsely claims Kurds in Syria are much safer now
","On the day Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sought international support for his country’s battle against the Kurds and warned Kurdish fighters to withdraw from the Syrian border ""this very night,"" President Donald Trump claimed the Kurds are actually in a safer position now. Telling reporters that Erdogan would be meeting in Turkey the next day with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as American officials continue to press Turkey for a ceasefire, Trump said: ""We have a lot of great people over there; we'll see. In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm's way, as they shouldn't be as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us. And the Kurds are much safer right now. But the Kurds know how to fight."" After saying ""they’re not angels,"" Trump added: ""Syria is protecting the Kurds."" The White House and his campaign did not respond to our requests for information to support his claim. But while it is true that the Kurds have forged a new alliance with Syria, that occurred only because the U.S. withdrawal from the region that Trump ordered opened the door to Turkey's attacks on the Kurds. ""This statement is totally disconnected from reality given the long-standing, deep and intensely abiding enmity between Turkey and the Kurds and the entire purpose of the Turkish military offensive, which is to forcibly clear the border of Kurds and Kurdish forces,"" Bruce Hoffman, senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations, told PolitiFact. Here’s a timeline of recent events: Oct. 5  — Turkey threatens incursion: Erdogan announces the completion of preparations for a military incursion into northeast Syria. Oct. 6  — Trump announces withdrawal: Trump announces after a call with Erdogan that the United States would withdraw from the ""immediate area"" into which Turkish troops were expected to advance. The White House denies that Trump offered Turkey a ""green light"" to slaughter U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. Oct. 7  — Kurds fear massacre: Kurdish leaders condemn Trump’s decision ""to allow Turkish forces to invade Northeast Syria,"" saying: ""The Turkish military has been occupying the predominantly-Kurdish city of Afrin, Syria, since early 2018. Their military and militias have committed grave atrocities and human rights abuses there. We do not want a repeat of the invasion and occupation of Afrin."" Oct. 9  — Turkish incursion begins: Turkish forces begin a ground offensive under the cover of airstrikes and artillery shelling.  Oct. 10  — 150 Kurds killed: Turkey announces it has killed 150 Kurdish fighters. Oct. 12  — Nearly 200,000 displaced: The Syrian Kurdish-led administration in northeastern Syria says that 191,069 people have been displaced as a result of Turkish military operations. Oct. 13  — Kurds embrace Syria: The Kurdish fighters announce a new alliance with the government of Syria. Oct. 16  — Kurds further threatened: Erdogan calls for Kurdish fighters battling his troops in northeastern Syria to lay down their weapons and withdraw from the border area ""this very night."" Erdogan also requests international support for his country’s battle against Kurdish fighters, whom he considers terrorists, and says Turkey would not stop fighting until it had established a planned ""safe zone"" in Syria roughly 20 miles deep. Missouri State University Kurdish expert and history professor Djene Rhys Bajalan said the Kurds’ new agreement with Syria’s Assad regime, which is backed by Russia, limits the areas under attack by Turkish forces.  But the Syrian government ""does not have a strong record on respecting Kurdish rights and the dire military position means they will have very little leverage in negotiations to maintain the autonomy of northeastern Syria,"" he said. And ""compared with the situation prior to the U.S. pullout, the Kurds certainly are not safer."" Will Todman, associate fellow in the Middle East program and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, offered a similar view. ""It is certainly true that the Kurds were in great danger after the U.S. withdrawal and before forming an agreement with the regime, which the Russians mediated. Now that Russia is acting as their security guarantor, their position is more secure and they are better able to repel the Turkish-led offensive,"" Todman said.  ""But the Kurds are certainly not safer under the control of the Assad regime and Russia in comparison to when the United States had a presence. Regime forces are overstretched, there is significant local opposition to the return of regime forces which has led to unrest, and ISIS has already seized on the situation to conduct new attacks in the area."" Another Missouri State expert on Kurdish politics, political scientist David Romano, was more emphatic. The Kurds ""have not faced such an existential threat ever before,"" Romano told PolitiFact. ""They remain at risk of ethnic cleansing and genocide by Turkey."" Trump said: ""The Kurds are much safer right now."" In the days since Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Syrian border with Turkey, Turkey has attacked the area, killing scores of Kurds and displacing thousands more. And the Turkish president, who views the Kurds as terrorists, has vowed not to heed calls for a ceasefire.

Tom Steyer claimed ‘90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years.’ Is he right?
","San Francisco hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer is perhaps best known for his TV ads calling for President Trump’s impeachment.  At his first debate appearance as a Democratic presidential candidate last night in Ohio, Steyer repeated his call to remove what he termed ""the criminal in the White House.""  But he also railed against income inequality, leading fellow Democratic contender Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar to quip: ""... no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires."" Steyer’s claim that caught our attention was that the vast majority of Americans haven’t received a raise for decades. ""I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations,"" Steyer promised. ""But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years."" Was his claim about raises accurate? We set out on a fact check.  PolitiFact’s analysis We turned to PolitiFact’s analysis in April of a similar claim made by Democratic presidential contender and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. We’ll place a rating on Steyer’s claim based on what PolitiFact found.  ""Since 1973, the income of the bottom 90 percent, so pretty much all of us, didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit,"" Buttigieg claimed.  PolitiFact investigated whether income levels for most people -- adjusted for inflation, which economists consider a necessity for such comparisons -- haven’t increased since 1973. It found that ""income levels have actually risen beyond inflation during that period,"" but the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent hews pretty closely to what Buttigieg said.  It rated the mayor’s claim Half True, meaning it is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. CBO data shows income growth In its fact check, PolitiFact reviewed data from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, covering 1979 to 2015, most of the period in question. The figures CBO used were adjusted for inflation and federal taxes, but not for state and local taxes. They showed income growth for people in four different economic ranges: the lowest 20 percent of the income distribution, the middle 60 percent, the 81st percentile to the 99th percentile, and the top 1 percent. They didn’t mirror Buttigieg’s precise parameters, but economists said they are useful for showing whether the mayor was broadly right or not, PolitiFact reported.  Here’s a chart showing the CBO data:  The top 1 percent, in red, has the most unique and most impressive growth. The other income groups show positive but much slower growth, after adjusting for inflation. This undercuts Buttigieg’s assertion that for most people, income ""didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit,"" since the 1970s, PolitiFact said.  Other data supports the claims by Buttigieg and Steyer. Inflation-adjusted figures from the Economic Policy Institute, for example, show clear wage stagnation for the bottom 60 percent of the income scale. The rate did go up for the 70 and 80 percent levels, which means the 90 percent figure would be a bit exaggerated. PolitiFact also cited the World Inequality Database. It shows the bottom 50 percent and the next 40 percent -- essentially the 90 percent that Buttigieg cited -- have taken declining shares of the nation’s income since 1973. By contrast, both the top 10 percent and the top 1 percent have seen their shares grow. When we asked Steyer’s campaign for evidence supporting his claim, it pointed to an August report by the Pew Research Center. It found today’s real average wage, defined as the wage after accounting for inflation, has ""had some ups and downs,"" but ""has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago. And what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest-paid tier of workers."" Our ruling Tom Steyer claimed at the Democratic presidential debate in Ohio that, ""People haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years."" PolitiFact in April fact-checked a similar claim by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg: ""Since 1973, the income of the bottom 90 percent, so pretty much all of us, didn’t budge, or even retreated a little bit."" It found that income for every group, as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office, has actually increased beyond the rate of inflation since the 1970s. However, another measurement -- the share of income taken by the bottom 90 percent -- has indeed declined since 1973. It rated the mayor’s claim Half True.  We agreed with PolitiFact’s assessment and rated Steyer’s claim Half True, as well.

No, you’re not an ‘active, live walking virus’ for 2 weeks following a flu shot
","Flu season isn’t quite here yet, but myths about the vaccine are already starting to spread on social media like a, well, virus. A Facebook post, shared on Oct. 12, claims that for the two weeks after you receive a flu shot you’re an ""active, live walking virus:"" ""Folks who get flu shots please have some respect and courtesy and stay home for minimal [sic] of 2 weeks while you are an active live walking virus. Also don’t hug others and give kisses and please immediately tell others you were vaccinated so they don’t come close to you."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This is a common myth. So common, in fact, that a 2015 study published in Vaccine found that 43% of the public believed that getting the flu vaccine can give you the flu.  But the shot does not contain an active virus and an inactivated virus cannot transmit infection. The myth is at the top of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s ""Misconceptions about Seasonal Flu and Flu Vaccines"" list. The organization says: ""No, flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) flu viruses that have been ‘inactivated’ (killed) and that therefore are not infectious, or b) using only a single gene from a flu virus (as opposed to the full virus) in order to produce an immune response without causing infection. This is the case for recombinant influenza vaccines."" Another CDC flu fact sheet also notes that while the nasal spray flu vaccine does contain a live virus, ""the viruses are changed so that they cannot give you the flu."" (More about this ""change"" below.) Harvard Medical School tackled the superstition in a breakdown of flu myths and says that since it takes around two weeks to get protection from the vaccine, people who get sick before then wrongly assume the shot gave them the flu. ""The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus that can't transmit infection. So people who get sick after receiving a flu vaccination were going to get sick anyway. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine. But people assume that because they got sick after getting the vaccine, the flu shot caused their illness."" William Schaffner, a professor and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, also confirmed to PolitiFact that the claim is a myth. ""The injectable flu vaccine is composed of selected parts of the influenza virus and cannot re-assemble itself into the complete virus in the human body. Thus, it is impossible for the flu vaccine to cause influenza,"" Schaffner wrote in an email. ""The nasal spray influenza vaccine is a ‘tamed’ flu virus. It can multiply in the nose where it stimulates the body to provide protection, but it is biologically incapable of multiplying down in the lungs or anywhere else in the body. It also cannot cause the person who has received the vaccine to experience influenza."" Besides contracting the flu within the window before the vaccine takes effect, people may also experience other side effects such as pain, redness or swelling near the injection site; headache, fever, nausea and sore muscles. ""After receiving the injectable vaccine everyone experiences a sore arm for a few hours. In very few persons this can last a day. Some also have a bit of swelling or redness at the injection site,"" Schaffner wrote. ""Only 1% - 2% of persons experience a slight fever that can last a day or so. The nasal spray vaccine can be associated with a runny nose or a scratchy throat for a day or two. These brief symptoms are just minor reactions to the vaccine.""

Fact-checking Andrew Yang on history of universal basic income
","Giving every American adult $1,000 a month may sound like a gimmick or too good to be true, but Andrew Yang says it’s a ""deeply American idea"" dating back centuries. ""Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen’s dividend. Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968,"" Yang told Iowa voters on Sept. 21. ""A thousand economists endorsed it. It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971."" Yang, an entrepreneur seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has made similar claims on Twitter and while debating fellow Democrats. Yang’s Freedom Dividend plan is a form of universal basic income, guaranteeing $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen over 18 years old, without having to pass a test or meet a work requirement. PolitiFact decided to look into the history of universal basic income, particularly Yang’s reference to Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King, Jr., and 1970s legislation. We found that his comparisons are broadly correct, but not precise. Paine wrote that Earth in its ""natural uncultivated state"" was the common property of the human race. He believed that cultivation and private land ownership deprived non-landowners of their ""natural inheritance.""  Paine suggested a national fund to compensate individuals for that loss, whether they were rich or poor. He proposed a one-time payment of 15 pounds to every person when they turned 21 years old; and that every person aged 50, and all others who arrived at that age, be paid 10 pounds annually for the rest of their lives. Paine’s proposal in the 1790s pamphlet Agrarian Justice was in some ways an early version of the Social Security program and has an element of universal basic income, said Harvey J. Kaye, a democracy and justice studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. But it wasn’t the same thing. Also, Paine’s plan wasn't published at the founding of the United States in 1776 but about two decades later, inspired by the French Revolution, said Gary Berton, coordinator for the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College and secretary of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association. Paine also never used the term ""citizen's dividend"" in relation to his proposal (he called it ""the plan""), Berton said. It is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, ""Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?"" But he wasn’t explicitly advocating for it on the day he was killed. King wrote that past approaches to fighting poverty (particularly housing programs, education, and family counseling) were not coordinated, developed at different rates, and were indirect approaches to solving poverty.  ""I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,"" King wrote. Yang is on solid footing in claiming that King sought a form of guaranteed income, even if King is not well known for that position, said Doug E. Thompson, a history professor and director of the Spencer B. King Jr. Center for Southern Studies at Mercer University.            King was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. He was there to prepare for a march on behalf of sanitation workers who were striking and advocating for better working conditions and better pay. King saw the strike as a good way to highlight the need for his Poor People’s Campaign, Thompson said. ""Guaranteed income was not on the table in Memphis as much as the plight of folks who worked hard in the U.S. but could not overcome the wealth gaps that kept poor people in cycles of poverty,"" Thompson said. ""It would have been an outgrowth of Memphis, but not its central focus."" The House in 1970 and 1971 passed bills that ""were as close as the U.S. has come to passing something resembling a universal basic income,"" said Brian Steensland, professor and chair of sociology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.  The New York Times in April 1970 reported that the Democrat-led House voted 243-155 for President Richard Nixon’s revision of the welfare system, establishing ""for the first time the principle that the government should guarantee every family a minimum annual income, even if one or more of its members is working."" The proposal included a work requirement. In June 1971, the House again voted 288-132 for an omnibus bill that included a proposal to guarantee families an annual income. While there was wide interest in the 1960s and early 1970s for a ""guaranteed annual income,"" the specifics of what the term meant, the proposals, and related discourse changed over time. ""Nixon’s plan was more ‘conservative’ than many of the available guaranteed annual income plans at the time, and his rhetoric was more conservative than the plans themselves,"" Steensland said. ""His rhetoric was very work-oriented. Nixon constantly referenced moving people from the ‘welfare rolls’ to the ‘payrolls,’ though in fact many of the recipients would have received income from both sources."" Another key point about the Nixon plan: It was based on a negative income tax model, meaning the total amount distributed would have depended on recipients’ income level. Universal basic income proposals, like Yang’s, seek to give everyone a flat amount, regardless of how much money they make. Yang said about universal basic income, ""Thomas Paine was for it at our founding.... Martin Luther King, champion in the ‘60s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans… It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971."" Paine supported a one-time payment to all individuals when they reached 21 and a version of today’s Social Security program. King advocated for a guaranteed minimum income. The House passed something close to universal basic income once in 1970 and once in 1971, not twice in 1971. Overall, Yang’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971CA740>],/factchecks/2019/oct/16/andrew-yang/fact-checking-andrew-yang-history-universal-basic-/

Kennedy Library Foundation website. Researchers at the JFK Presidential Library told PolitiFact they haven’t come across the quote in Kennedy’s papers or addresses, either. ""We've never found any evidence in the archives here that John F. Kennedy said or wrote this statement,"" Stacey Chandler, a reference archivist with the library, wrote in an email. ""We do, however, have archival evidence that the article that featured the quotation was the subject of some concern in the administration, based on a National Security Council meeting about Vietnam that took place the same day the article was published."" Chandler pointed us to an Oct. 2, 1963, article by Scripps-Howard staff writer Richard Starnes, who was reporting from Saigon, Vietnam, at the time.  The article, ""‘Arrogant’ CIA Disobeys Orders in Viet Nam,"" was published in the Washington Daily News. The following passage appears about halfway through the article: ""Other American agencies here are incredibly bitter about the CIA. 'If the United States ever experiences a 'Seven Days in May' it will come from the CIA, and not the Pentagon,' one U.S. official commented caustically."" ""Seven Days in May"" is a fictional book, published in 1962, of a military attempt to overthrow the U.S. government. Starnes adds later in the article that a ""very high American official here, a man who has spent much of his life in the service of democracy, likened the CIA's growth to a malignancy, and added he was not sure even the White House could control it any longer."" But he doesn’t name that official and indicates that several anonymous sources provided quotes like that of the ""U.S. official"" to whom the coup comment is attributed.  A New York Times article about Starnes’ report was published the following day. In it, reporter Arthur Krock wrote about Starnes’ article and combines some of the quotes into one paragraph:  ""Among the views attributed to United States officials on the scene, including one described as a 'very high American official...who has spent much of his life in service of democracy...are the following: The CIA's growth was 'likened to a malignancy; which the 'very high official was not sure even the White House could control...any longer.' 'If the United States ever experiences [an attempt at a coup to overthrow the Government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon.' The agency 'represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone.'"" This passage puts the ""very high American official"" in close proximity to the quotation in question, and may be the reason people started to attach the words to Kennedy.  ""In the archives here, we do have evidence that John F. Kennedy was aware of the Starnes piece,"" Chandler said. She said Kennedy mentioned it in the Oct. 2, 1963, National Security Council meeting, according to the meeting summary (located on page 27 of the scanned document here): ""The President then asked what we should say about the news story attacking CIA which appeared in today's Washington Daily News. He read a draft paragraph for inclusion in the public statement but rejected it as being too fluffy. He felt no one would believe a statement saying that there were no differences of view among the various US agencies represented in Saigon. He thought that we should say now we had a positive policy endorsed by the National Security Council and that such policy would be carried out by all concerned."" A Facebook post claims President John F. Kennedy once said ""If the United States ever experienced [a coup to overthrow the government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon."" But there is no evidence that proves JFK said the statement. A news article from October 1963 quoting an anonymous ""U.S. official"" appears to be the original source for the quotation. In the years since, people have assumed that person was Kennedy, but JFK scholars have not made that explicit leap. We rate this False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809773F640>],/factchecks/2019/oct/16/facebook-posts/no-evidence-jfk-said-any-us-coup-would-come-cia-no/

Is Paul Ryan right about how many Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction?
","In national politics, it seems as if everything is up for grabs these days. There’s the presidential election, with an open seat at stake. Control of Congress is in the balance. And there is a critical vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Appearing Feb. 22, 2016 on Megyn Kelly’s Fox News show, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), said the problem is head-butting between the Republican-controlled Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama. ""We have this liberal president and conservative congress"" Ryan said, punching his fists together. ""It’s not working."" ""So you don’t think anything can get done unless it’s one party rule?"" Kelly asked. ""Look at the path we are on,"" Ryan replied. ""70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path."" To be sure, in a politically divided country, Republicans may think we are on the wrong path because of what Democrats are doing, and vice versa. But that still seems like a high percentage of Americans thinking the country is headed in the wrong direction. Is Ryan right? Digging in When we asked for backup, Ryan’s team pointed to the most recent Associated Press poll before Ryan’s appearance the show, conducted between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. The AP-GfK poll is conducted online using a nationally representative sample of American adults recruited to take surveys. While the poll was conducted online, participants were found through address-based sampling to include people who do not have internet access. The question about the country’s direction is asked first on the AP poll. This means previous questions don’t influence the response. Of the Americans polled in February, 68 percent said things in this country are generally heading in the wrong direction. That’s just under Ryan’s 70 percent figure. The number was actually down from 74 percent in the previous poll, taken in December 2015. And for some time people have thought the country is headed in the wrong direction. For the last two years, 60 percent or more of those polled by AP-GfK have said the country is heading in the wrong direction. Here’s a look at those numbers. Date of poll Wrong direction percentage Feb. 11-15, 2016 68 Dec. 3-7, 2015 74 Oct. 15-19, 2015 63 July 9-13, 2015 64 April 23-27, 2015 62 Jan. 29 - Feb. 2, 2015 60 Dec. 4-8, 2014 66 July 24-28, 2014 72 May 16-19, 2014 62 Interestingly, the bleak outlook from respondents for the country doesn’t seem to affect the outlook for their own families. In the same poll, 76 percent of respondents said things for their family were generally headed in the right direction. But Ryan’s staff cited a single poll. The right direction-wrong direction is a common one in polling, so for comparison we took a look at Huffington Post Pollster. The feature compiles the reliable polls and tracks that data. Pollster’s Feb. 17, 2016 analysis found 64 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. The data shows that percentage has been hovering around 64 percent since October of 2015 and hasn’t risen above 65 percent since 2012. By this measure, the only time 70 percent of Americans said the country was on the wrong track was in October 2011.  
Our rating Ryan said ""70 percent of Americans believe that we are on the wrong path."" His team backed up this statement with reliable poll results from the Associated Press. But many other polls reported a lower number, closer to 60 percent. What’s more, the percent of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track has hovered above 60 percent for the last three years. This statement is accurate but needs additional information or context. That’s our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EBFAC0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/22/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-about-how-many-americans-think-cou/

Gubernatorial candidate exaggerates Missouri tax brackets
","Republican gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens said the Missouri tax code is too complicated. In a Thursday GOP primary debate in Columbia, Greitens offered figures to back his claim: ""We have 10 different tax brackets, and if you’re making $9,000, you’re already in the top tax bracket."" That sounded a little low for the top bracket, so we asked Greitens’ campaign for evidence. His staff referred us to the Missouri Department of Revenue’s 2015 Tax Chart Missouri Department of Revenue's 2015 Tax Chart  The chart actually shows 11 different tax brackets, but that aside, at first glance, it seems to back up Greitens’ claim. The top bracket is $9,000 and higher. However, there’s a catch. Greitens said people making $9,000 or more would fall in the top bracket. In fact, this chart applies not to how much a person earns but to that individual’s taxable earnings — after any deductions. Taxable income vs. gross income Taxable income is gross income less all personal exemptions and deductions. The Department of Revenue allows the following standard deductions for Missouri taxpayers. Standard deductions for Missouri taxpayers  The chart shows a single filer can claim a standard deduction of $6,300. Therefore, if that person makes $9,000, as Greitens’ said, then he or she would only have a taxable income of $2,700 — even with no other exemptions. When we refer back to the department’s tax bracket chart, we can see such an individual would fit into the state’s fourth tax bracket instead of the highest tax bracket. All things being equal, a single filer would need to make at least $15,300 before he or she would face the highest tax rate. Married people filing jointly, heads of household and surviving spouses could make more than $15,300 and still not be in the top bracket. Our ruling Greitens said, ""We have 10 different tax brackets, and if you’re making $9,000, you’re already in the top tax bracket."" The plain meaning of ""making $9,000"" is that’s how much a person earns. However, the Missouri tax brackets aren’t based on gross income but on income after deductions and exemptions. Those reduce a person’s taxable income, which is the basis of the chart Greitens had in mind. A person making $9,000 would fall in the fourth tax bracket, closer to the bottom, and certainly not at the top. Most people would understand Greitens to be talking about gross income, and in this case, his statement falls far short of the mark. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F89DC0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/22/eric-greitens/gubernatorial-candidate-exaggerates-missouri-tax-b/

Rep. Joe Pitts says 120 Americans die daily from overdoses, exceeding deaths from guns
","In a recent Medium post, Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country. ""According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day,"" Pitts wrote. ""Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms."" We wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look. The CDC calculates overdose deaths from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together. In 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses.  That same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine.   The agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths. Then, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That’s close enough for us. We should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent. So how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms? According to CDC, there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions. So in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts’ second claim correct. Our ruling Pitts said that ""according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms."" Pitts is very close on the first part, and he’s correct on the second.

"['Education', 'State Budget', 'North Carolina', 'Roy Cooper']","
Cooper says North Carolina's education spending per student hasn't bounced back since the recession
","Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has won the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, unveiled his education plan March 8. Education is a large chunk of the state budget, and it’s a hot topic for both Republicans and Democrats. Cooper’s plan lays out eight basic goals, and it slams McCrory and the Republican-led General Assembly for cutting taxes rather than putting more money into public schools. The Great Recession began in December 2007 and forced states to slash budgets. North Carolina cut many areas, including K-12 education, and Cooper says funding still hasn’t bounced back. ""North Carolina spends $855 less per student than it did before the Great Recession, and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation,"" Cooper’s plan reads. The question of whether higher per-pupil spending generates better academic results is another debate entirely. For now, we’ll just focus on the numbers. So does Cooper ace this math problem? Or will his former teachers want to dock him points for his statement? It turns out that like many claims about education funding, it’s complicated – especially the part about ""$855 less."" One of the country’s lowest spending levels First, the easy part. Does North Carolina spend less per student than most states? The National Education Association, a teacher’s union that has been tracking all sorts of public school funding data for 70 years, says yes. It reported North Carolina’s per-pupil spending was $8,615 in 2007 (compared with a national average of $9,663). It was $8,867 in 2008 (national average $10,259), and $8,632 in 2014 (national average $11,355). Those numbers show North Carolina has been falling further behind the national average. NEA’s 2015-16 report isn’t out yet, but in 2014-15 it ranked North Carolina 46th out of 51, counting all the states and Washington, D.C., in per-pupil expenditure. That backs up Cooper’s claim that ""we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation."" A U.S. Census Bureau report on 2013 per-pupil funding also ranks North Carolina as one of the lowest states. However, the Census hasn’t released more up-to-date numbers. Face value versus inflation However, those NEA numbers show North Carolina’s per-pupil spending is actually higher than it was in 2007 and only slightly lower than in 2008, certainly not $855 lower. So what about Cooper’s claim that North Carolina spends $855 less per student than before the recession? First let’s define two terms: real dollars and nominal dollars. Nominal value refers to a number’s face value. Real value is the inflation-adjusted figure. Cooper appears at first glance to reference nominal dollars. In that case, he would be wrong. But even though he didn’t mention inflation, the numbers Cooper cited did account for it. And that’s important, because inflation has risen by about 10 percent since the recession began, according to the federal government’s CPI Inflation Calculator. For example, if you made $40,000 in 2008 and didn’t make at least $44,034.14 in 2015, you’re facing the same type of hurt that Cooper is talking about here – not a cut per se, but a loss of purchasing power nonetheless. Cooper’s campaign pointed us to the source of his claim, a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that did find an inflation-adjusted drop of $855 per student since the recession. But that report was from October 2014 – about 17 months ago. There’s an updated report from this January which shows that in the past year, North Carolina has been moving closer to pre-recession numbers. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said North Carolina’s increase from 2014 to 2015 was the fifth-largest in the country in terms of percent change. Other numbers and sources Unsatisfied with the report from 2014, we looked at some more recent numbers. It turns out that depending on whether you count total funding or just state funding, Cooper’s claim – though based on outdated numbers – is still right in the middle of the range. Using state numbers from the Department of Public Instruction and combined state, federal and local numbers from the National Education Association, we adjusted the 2008 numbers for inflation. Then we compared it with the most recent available data, which was 2015 for the state and 2014 for all sources combined. The combined per-pupil spending is down $1,118. State spending by itself is down $481. So Cooper’s claim of ""$855 less"" is right in the middle of that range. Our ruling Cooper is right that North Carolina is one of the states that spends the least per student. When citing the actual amount he used a report that, while not inaccurate, was outdated. And more context and transparency would’ve been helpful. But Cooper is still right in the general sense that North Carolina’s public schools have less purchasing power than before the recession, and that almost every other state spends more money on education per student than North Carolina. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A471D80>],/factchecks/2016/mar/21/roy-cooper/cooper-says-north-carolinas-education-spending-stu/

Club for Growth claim ignores key points of Donald Trump's stand on healthcare coverage
","Club For Growth is trying to make it appear that Donald Trump is in favor of more government-run health care. In a television ad attacking the billionaire Republican, the conservative Washington-based anti-tax group features a female announcer stating, ""Some people think government-run, taxpayer-paid health care is a disaster, and some don't."" The commercial cuts to Democrat Hillary Clinton promising ""we will have quality affordable healthcare for every American,"" and then to CBS News anchor Scott Pelley questioning Trump by declaring, ""Universal healthcare,"" and Trump responding, ""I'm going to take care of everybody."" There's a quick cut back to Pelley asking, ""Who pays for it?"" and Trump responding, ""The government's going to pay for it."" The announcer continues, ""Ask Donald Trump why he sides with Hillary Clinton and why he wants more government healthcare."" For this fact check, we will try to look at whether Club For Growth was accurately depicting Trump's stand. In the Republican debates, Trump has repeatedly called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Obamacare is not government-run health care. It is, however, a system of private insurance plans where the government sets minimum standards for those plans, helps people compare plans and sign up for a plan through a ""marketplace,"" subsidizes some of the cost for low-income people, and penalizes people who don't purchase a plan. Trump has consistently characterized that system as ""a disaster."" So why is Club for Growth saying that Trump wants more government healthcare? First, we checked to see if the group accurately portrayed what Trump said. We located the Pelley interview and found the group had taken his points out of context. The interview aired on 60 Minutes on Sept. 27. As always, Trump attacks the act. ""What's your plan for Obamacare?"" Pelley asks. ""Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced,"" says Trump. ""Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up 45, 50, 55 percent."" (A claim with cherry-picked data that PolitiFact later ruled to be Half True.) Pelley asks, ""How do you fix it?"" ""There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered,"" says Trump. ""This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, 'No, no, the lower 25 percent that can't afford private.' But —"" At this point, Pelley seems to interrupt. ""Universal health care?"" he asks. ""I am going to take care of everybody,"" Trump says. ""I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now."" Pelley: ""The uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?"" Trump: ""They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what, if this is probably —"" Pelley: ""Make a deal? Who pays for it?"" ""The government's gonna pay for it,"" Trump says. ""But we're going to save so much money on the other side."" Yet in the next breath, the candidate seems to talk about people buying their own plans, a key point Club for Growth has left out. ""But for the most part, it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything,"" he says. We note that some of the goals Trump is talking about are very similar to the goals of Obamacare, which was an attempt to get everyone covered, let private plans provide the coverage, let the private plans compete for customers and let people have their own doctors. (That last element wasn't fulfilled for some people who found they could not, despite President Barack Obama's vow, keep their old health plan and, by extension, may have been forced to use a different physician. In addition, although he told Pelley, ""Everybody's got to be covered,"" the healthcare plan on his website calls for eliminating the Obamacare penalty for not purchasing insurance. ""No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to,"" it says. Trump has also expressed support for other ideas that go beyond the ACA, such as letting insurers market the same plans across state lines, letting taxpayers deduct health insurance premiums the way businesses do, expanding the use of Health Savings Accounts so any member of a family can tap into it without penalty and make them inheritable, and allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices, a change in federal law that, he says, would save about $300 billion a year. But none of these proposals constitute more government-run, government-paid healthcare, and Trump has said he opposes a single-payer system. We contacted both Club for Growth and the Trump campaign about the ad and Trump's plans, but we didn't get a response. Our ruling Club for Growth says Trump promises ""to take care of everybody (through government-run healthcare and) the government's going to pay for it."" It's clear from Trump's website and some of his public comments that he wants a market-based approach to healthcare, not a system run by the government, which makes the Club for Growth ad wrong. Because Trump wants a program to cover the poor — ""the lower 25 percent that can't afford private"" insurance — doesn't mean, as the ad contends, that ""he wants more government healthcare."" After all, the poor already get health coverage under Medicaid, which is jointly funded by the states and the federal government.

"['NBC', 'Campaign Finance', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Hillary Clinton says her campaign 'depends on small donations for the majority of our support'
","Following victories in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Illinois, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton thanked her supporters — especially those who have given small amounts of money to her campaign. ""Keep contributing at hillaryclinton.com. Please, please join the 950,000 supporters who already have contributed, most less than $100, because our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support,"" Clinton said. We wondered whether it's accurate to say that her campaign ""depends on small donations for the majority of our support."" This is a surprisingly tricky question to answer. Under Federal Election Commission rules, campaigns must register the personal data of donors who give $200 or more. (That includes name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.) That $200 amount can be in the form of one donation of at least $200, or in a series of donations that collectively equal at least $200. However, if a donor gives an amount less than $200, the campaign is not required to disclose the donor's name. Such donations are often called ""small-dollar contributions"" or ""unitemized donations."" Candidates like to play up their small-dollar donations because they are a sign of grass-roots strength. For instance, the Bernie Sanders campaign often talks up its large small-donor base and small average donations. And in fact, of all the 2016 candidates, Sanders has done the best in this regard: Through Jan. 31, Sanders raised $67 million from small donors, or a whopping 70 percent of all the money he took in from individuals, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign finance data. Clinton, for her part, raised a little under $22 million from small donors over the same period, or 17 percent of her total fundraising haul from individuals. That percentage rose a bit with the release of donations through Feb. 29 — Clinton has now raised more than $28 million from small donors, or 19 percent of her individual donations. (Among the remaining Republicans, Ted Cruz had the highest small-donation percentage with 42 percent. Donald Trump had 22 percent and John Kasich had 11 percent, though both Trump and Kasich have taken in much smaller amounts overall from small donors.) So, compared with Sanders, Clinton has raised a smaller dollar total from small donors, and a smaller percentage of her individual contributions have come from from small donors. In other words, if she wants to emphasize the strength of her grassroots support, she needs to find different statistics to highlight. Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said that more than 50 percent of the money the campaign has raised in February and March has come from what they call ""online grassroots donations."" This is a continuation of a pattern the campaign originally noted in a Washington Post article in mid February. And when the campaign released its campaign-finance data through Feb. 29, it reported that the average donation in February was about $50, and that 98 percent of donations were smaller than $250. These do sound like strong statistics to bolster the campaign's grassroots cred — but it also highlights a mismatch between what the campaign says and what fact-checkers can verify. Put simply, once the debate turns to the number of donors and the scope of online donations, reporters simply have to trust that the campaigns are being honest. Consider the number Clinton cited — that she has 950,000 individual contributors. (That's about what the Sanders campaign said he had in January 2016, when it said it had just passed the 1 million donor mark.) Figures such as these come from the campaigns' internal databases and are not filtered through the federal disclosure system, where they can be analyzed by independent groups. And no campaign has thus far let fact-checkers dig into their donor lists. So just knowing the amount of money raised from small donors won't tell you how many people gave. ""A lump-sum unitemized receipt of $100,000 could be 100,000 donors, 5,000 donors, or any number in between — your guess is as good as mine,"" said Kenneth A. Gross, an elections and campaign-finance expert at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics, agreed. ""It's impossible for us to check claims about things like how many donors have given to a candidate and what the average amount per donor is,"" she said. This means we're left with the federal disclosure data, which produces weaker support for Clinton's statement. If one defines ""the majority of our support"" as dollars, then Clinton is wrong — small donations accounted for 17 percent of all of her individual donations, which is well short of a majority. In fact, the Campaign Finance Institute calculated that a clear majority of the funds Clinton had raised through Jan. 31 from individuals came from donors giving $2,700 — the legal maximum that anyone can give. On the other hand, the campaign could be right if they define ""the majority of our support"" as the number of donors. But this calculation isn't transparent to outside analysis. ""Whenever a politician makes a claim about their average contribution or total number of donors, it's impossible to independently verify,"" said Michael Beckel, a reporter with the Center for Public Integrity. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Our campaign depends on small donations for the majority of our support."" The campaign's best evidence for this isn't independently verifiable. Otherwise, Clinton is wrong — small donors accounted for only 17 percent of the dollar amount her campaign has collected from individuals through Jan. 31, and 19 percent of the dollar amount collected through Feb. 29.

Rep. Kip Kendrick half right on voter ID statement
","What documents should voters have to show to make it to the polls? The question continues to spark debate in state legislatures across the country, with new voter ID legislation coming to the forefront in a number of states. The Missouri legislature is discussing measures that would narrow the acceptable forms of voter ID to non-expired photo identification issued by the state or federal government. The proposed legislation would exclude currently acceptable forms of voter identification like student IDs, out-of-state driver’s licenses, or bank statements and utility bills. State Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, recently weighed in on the legislation’s potential for disenfranchising voters, saying ""requiring photo ID would keep about 200,000 Missourians from voting."" That number caught our attention. We decided to dig into the details of the proposed legislation, and take a closer look at just how many Missouri voters would be affected by photo ID requirements. Numbers from the Secretary of State Kendrick said he got his estimate of those who would be kept from voting — ""more than 200,000"" — from Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander. A report from Kander’s office corroborates Kendrick’s statement, showing 220,000 people potentially disenfranchised. According to the Secretary of State’s office, that number came from comparing the list of registered voters in Missouri to the Department of Revenue’s accounting of those without driver’s licenses (about 150,000 people) and those with expired driver’s licenses (about 70,000). Those numbers are at best a rough approximation. Marvin Overby, political science professor at MU, said he can think of two factors that would make the Secretary of State’s estimate too high. ""A number of people who don’t have driver’s licenses do have photo identification, it’s just in a non-driver’s license form,"" Overby said. ""And those in prison or on parole or probation can’t vote, regardless of their ID status."" Numbers from the proposed legislation An even higher estimate of Missourians without non-expired photo identification — almost 400,000 people — actually is cited in the proposed legislation’s fiscal note. The note sets aside up to $10.7 million to cover costs associated with providing new photo IDs. That’s because unless the House Budget and Senate Appropriations committees allocate the necessary funding to provide photo ID at no charge for those currently without, the state would be barred from implementing the new requirements. Kendrick’s source, Secretary of State Jason Kander’s report, doesn’t take this information into account. Kander’s report is two years old and refers to an older bill that did not require the state to bear the cost of providing supporting documentation necessary for photo ID — theoretically making the requirement of photo ID a poll tax. But the current proposed legislation does hold the state responsible for providing birth certificates or other necessary documents free of charge for photo ID. In theory, this would reduce the chances that any new ID requirements might disenfranchise voters currently lacking photo identification. The cost of photo ID The $10.7 million suggested in the proposed legislation’s fiscal note would cover other costs as well as providing supporting documentation for IDs, like manufacturing and postage for new photo IDs. It also includes funding for an updated DMV website; new hires in the Department of Revenue, the Department of Health and Senior Service, and the Bureau of Vital records; and pre-election TV, radio, and print ads to let voters know of the change in ID requirements. But it doesn’t mention any plans for in-person help for Missouri residents unfamiliar with navigating a bureaucracy — a lack of familiarity that could easily be a symptom of not needing to procure a photo ID in the past. And for some, even a photo ID supplied for no charge isn’t free. Missouri League of Women Voters President Elaine Blodgett said the costs associated with the new IDs go beyond creating a new document. ""There’s an undue burden on women, who might have to get their birth certificates and marriage certificates and divorce certificates in order to get photo ID, if they’ve changed their names,"" she said. ""Also, simply getting to all the offices needed can be nearly impossible for some of our disabled or elderly voters."" Kendrick told Politifact Missouri that older adults may have issues tracking down birth certificates because states don’t necessarily have the same standards for maintaining birth records. He also added a time qualifier to his earlier statement and said ""if voter photo ID was in place right now, over 200,000 registered MO voters would not be able to vote."" In addition, even with the plan outlined in the bill’s fiscal note, some voters may still remain unaware of the new requirements. If voters came to the polls without the correct ID, they could cast provisional ballots; but in the 2012 presidential election, fewer than 3 in 10 provisional ballots were counted because many voters did not return to verify their address or identity after casting a provisional ballot.  Our ruling While requiring a photo ID could be expensive and might affect or inconvenience between 220,000 and 400,000 Missourians, it wouldn’t necessarily keep them from voting. Unlike past bills, the legislation currently proposed does address the cost of supplying supporting documentation necessary for obtaining photo ID, making it difficult to say it would financially ""keep people from voting."" No one knows exactly how many Missourians would be affected by new photo ID requirements — but there is consensus that the number who would need new photo IDs is in the hundreds of thousands. We rate Kendrick’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096882480>],/factchecks/2016/mar/21/kip-kendrick/rep-kip-kendrick-half-right-voter-id-statement/

Donald Trump incorrectly says Virginia winery is the largest on East Coast
","Donald Trump is no stranger to superlatives. During a news conference after his victories in the Michigan and Mississippi primaries in early March, the billionaire presidential candidate burnished his business credentials by pointing to an array of products that bear his name, including bottles of Virginia-made wine from Trump Winery, just south of Charlottesville. ""It’s the largest winery on the East Coast,"" Trump said. The Republican frontrunner added that he owns the winery ""100 percent."" Trump did purchase the 1,300-acre vineyard in 2011 where the winery is based and turned over the management to his son, Eric. A legal disclaimer on the winery website says the GOP presidential candidate doesn’t own the winery. The venture is a limited liability corporation, and its owners are not a matter of public record. That point aside, let’s move to the focus of this Truth-O-Meter: Is the winery really the largest on the East Coast, as Trump claimed? We emailed his campaign three times seeking backup for the statement but didn’t hear back. So we began our own investigation. First, we contacted the Virginia Wine Board, a panel created by the Virginia General Assembly to promote state wineries and vineyards. Annette Boyd, the board’s director, said Trump Winery has planted 200 acres of vines. By that measure, called ""acres under vine,"" Boyd said Trump Winery has the largest vineyard in Virginia. The Trump Winery website, citing the same 200-acre figure, also says it’s the largest vineyard in the state. It additionally claims that it’s the largest ""vinifera vineyard"" on the East Coast, referring to a species of grape. But the website never goes as far as Donald Trump did in making an unconditional claim that the winery is the largest on the East Coast. He’s made that statement a number of times. Several wine industry analysts told us that when calculating a winery’s size, the best measure is not the acreage of vines that have been planted - it’s the volume of wine produced. By that standard, wine experts told us there’s no way Trump Winery is the biggest on the East Coast. ""That’s not correct,"" Michael Kaiser, spokesman for the National Association of American Wineries, told us about Trump’s claim. In fact, by that measure Trump Winery is not even the largest in Virginia. The Trump Winery produces about 36,000 cases of wine each year, according to Boyd. The top producers in the state are the Williamsburg Winery and Chateau Morrisette in Floyd County -- each making about 60,000 cases a year, Boyd said. Barboursville Winery in Orange County, meanwhile, makes about 37,000 cases a year, Boyd said. It’s not hard to find wineries along the East Coast that make even more. Duplin Winery in Rose Hill, N.C., produces about 390,000 cases of sweet wine a year, Dave Fussell Jr., Duplin’s president, told us in an email. Duplin, on its website, claims to be the ""largest winery in the South."" Its grapes come from more than 1,000 acres, the vast majority from farmers who grow them off-site. The Biltmore Winery in Asheville, N.C., says on its website that it produces about 150,000 cases of wine a year. Lastly, we wondered whether there are wineries on the East Coast that have more grapes than Trump Winery’s 200 acres of vines. The answer is yes. The Wagner Vineyards Estate Winery in the Finger Lakes region of New York says it cultivates 250 acres of grapes (and makes 50,000 cases of wine a year). The vineyard manager at Pindar Vineyards on New York’s Long Island said in a November 2015 interview that its vineyard has more than 300 acres of grapes. Pindar says it makes 70,000 cases of wine a year. Our ruling Trump said that Trump Winery is the ""largest winery on the East Coast."" It’s not, regardless of whether you measure it by acreage of vines or the production of wine. We rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970B4340>],/factchecks/2016/mar/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-virginia-winery-largest-east-coa/

JoAnne Kloppenburg wrongly claims outside group spent $100 million to aid her Supreme Court opponent
","Ads from so-called ""dark money"" groups are cropping up in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Under existing campaign finance rules, the groups don’t have to disclose who is giving them money or how they are spending it. But the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, among other organizations, tries to put a number on spending by the dark money groups, based in part on measuring their activity, such as how many TV ads they purchase. So, just how much was spent in the primary? This jaw-dropping quote was posted on the website for challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg, an appeals court judge taking on Justice Rebecca Bradley: ""In the primary election, a right-wing group spent more than $100,000,000 to support Rebecca Bradley."" You read those zeros right -- that’s $100 million. The Kloppenburg web site went on to warn:  ""The very conservative Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (WMC) group has pledged to support (Bradley) as well."" Yikes. When we asked Kloppenburg campaign spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken about the claim, she said it was a typo. ""They spent more than $1 million,"" she said. ""I corrected it."" She later added: ""No one visiting our website has previously brought this obvious typo to our attention, no doubt because they knew that even Rebecca Bradley supporters couldn't spend $100 million on a February primary."" So, the write-down aside, where does the estimate come from? And what group is Kloppenburg talking about? The Democracy Campaign’s web site includes an article in its Hijacking Campaign 2016 section  that highlights spending by the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform, which it describes as a ""Madison-based conservative issue ad group formed late last year."" The group bought television time in the Madison, Green Bay, La Crosse, Eau Claire and Milwaukee markets for an ad that  it said ""dubbed Bradley, who is one of the court's five conservative judges, an independent jurist who has earned the support of numerous members of the law enforcement community."" The group also ran radio ads in support of Bradley. The Democracy Campaign estimates the group’s pre-primary spending as running between $750,000 and $1 million. More ads sponsored by the group that criticize Kloppenburg have begun to air as the April 5, 2016 general election approaches. Our rating Kloppenburg said that a conservative group spent $100 million in ads supporting her opponent in the primary election. The claim was 100 times off-base.

"['National', 'Congress', 'Harry Reid']","
Harry Reid says unlike the GOP, Senate Democrats never held up a Supreme Court nomination
","NBC Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd said there’s a degree of hypocrisy to the Democrats’ assertion that the Republicans have a constitutional duty to have hearings and vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. Senate Republicans have declared that they will not even hold hearings on Obama’s pick, Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has argued that Republicans’ behavior is a dereliction of the Senate’s constitutional duty to ""advise and consent"" the president on his nominee. But on Meet the Press, Todd presented Reid with a clip from 2005, in which Reid said, ""Nowhere in that document (the Constitution) does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote."" Todd, who also asked Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to explain his own clash with past positions, asked Reid what changed. ""You have to look at what has happened,"" Reid replied. ""We have never held up a Supreme Court nomination. Since 1900 in a lame-duck session, there have been six that have all been approved.""  Reid’s claim that the Democrats ""have never held up a Supreme Court nomination"" gave Todd and us pause, so we decided to put it on the Truth-O-Meter. Reid has a point that the degree of opposition to Garland is unprecedented, but Democrats have offered their fair share of strong opposition to Republican presidents’ nominees in recent history. They started it! Since the 1960s, the Senate has held a hearing for nearly every Supreme Court nominee, the exception being Harriet Miers, a 2005 George W. Bush nominee who faced opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike. So when McConnell vowed, within hours of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, not to even consider the yet-to-be-named replacement, it was an unprecedented degree of opposition. And, no, there’s no tradition of not nominating a justice during a presidential election year. It’s generally accepted, though, that the modern political battle over Supreme Court seats started with Democratic opposition to Robert Bork, a Ronald Reagan nominee, in 1987, Reid's first year in the Senate. Democrats launched a massive public assault on Bork’s conservative judicial philosophy and record. Bork did face a hearing and a Senate vote, which he lost, but his confirmation process made the rules of the game more contentious. ""The rules have been changed for the battle over this particular seat on the court,"" an internal Reagan administration memo read, according to Roll Call. ""Maybe they have been changed for all time. We must convince the nomination handlers that the opposition has invented the tank, and we have to get out of the trenches and take the offensive."" More recently, several Senate Democrats — including Reid and then-Sen. Obama — attempted a filibuster against conservative Bush nominee Samuel Alito. The filibuster, though, was largely symbolic, as not enough senators participated to actually delay or block the vote, which resulted in Alito’s confirmation. Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said comparing Democratic opposition to Republican nominees with the current Republican tactics amounted to a false equivalence. Referring to the Alito filibuster, Jentleson said, ""No lay person could possibly consider this to be on the same planet as what Republicans are doing to Garland."" In his interview with Reid, Todd mentioned Democratic opposition to Bush nominee Miguel Estrada, who was up for a position on the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, Senate Democrats garnered enough votes to block Estrada's confirmation. Because Estrada was up for a federal appeals judge position, not one on the Supreme Court, this incident doesn't affect this fact-check. Before we rule, we wanted to note a slight error in the second part of Reid’s statement that ""since 1900 in a lame-duck session, there have been six (nominees) that have all been approved."" We have found in a previous fact-check that since the early 1900s, there have been six Supreme Court nominees in election years, and all were confirmed. However, only one was clearly a ""lame-duck"" nominee, meaning the president making the nomination was no question on the way out (Reagan). The others were nominated by presidents running for re-election to serve another term (Herbert Hoover, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, who nominated two people in 1916). Our ruling Reid said Senate Democrats ""have never held up a Supreme Court nomination."" Reid steps a little too far in saying Democrats ""have never held up"" a nomination. They were chiefly responsible for Bork’s failed nomination, a turning point in the political nature of Supreme Court nominations, and they at least symbolically attempted to hold up Alito’s confirmation in 2005. However, we can't find a time when a Democratic Senate refused to hear a Republican president's nominee. Even if they were opposed, they allowed the nominee to come to a comfirmation vote.  We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097895340>],/factchecks/2016/mar/20/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-unlike-gop-senate-democrats-never-/
"['National', 'Elections', 'John Kasich']","
John Kasich calls out Donald Trump's '$1.8 billion worth of free media'
","Part of the reason billionaire Donald Trump is enjoying such a lead in the GOP presidential primary is because he hasn’t had to pay much to get his message on the airwaves, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said. Kasich told Chuck Todd on NBC’s Meet the Press that with a less-crowded field, voters are starting to hear his message and platform. But he said Trump had the market cornered on media coverage without spending a dime. ""Guess what? In the grassroots, people are getting it,"" Kasich said in a pre-taped interview for the March 20, 2016, show. ""Now, they didn't get it because, frankly you put me on the tube a lot, but Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion worth of free media. I got, like, none. Okay?"" We know it feels like it’s all Trump, all the time on TV (and in print and on the radio and the Internet) these days. But could it possibly be that Trump has gotten billions in equivalent media coverage and Kasich has gotten almost none? Let’s go to the tape! Media mentions Kasich’s campaign confirmed to PolitiFact that he was referring to analysis by mediaQuant, a Portland, Ore.,- based media firm that in part tracks political coverage. The metrics were highlighted in a March 15 story by the New York Times that pointed out mediaQuant said Trump topped all presidential candidates with $1.898 billion worth of ""earned media"" coverage over the last 12 months. Earned media is coverage that candidates don’t have to pay for, such as newspaper and magazine stories, social media posts, and TV broadcasts. That’s different than paid media, which are mostly those campaign ads that blanket markets in an attempt to sway voters, and cost campaigns or super PACS or special interest groups. MediaQuant tracks these mentions and then assigns a dollar value to them depending on the outlet and the quality of the coverage. That includes weighing whether coverage was positive, negative or neutral. Trump scored about 79 percent positive coverage, which is a big difference than, say, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 40 percent positive coverage. When it comes to Trump, even bad press seems to be good press. ""Negative coverage can keep a candidate from expanding his or her coalition, but it rarely affects the core backers -- especially when the support is intense, as it is for Trump,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. The company didn’t respond to PolitiFact by our deadline, but mediaQuant chief analytics officer Paul Senatori told the New York Times that Trump ""has no weakness in any of the media segments."" We checked mediaQuant’s figures for ourselves and found the billionaire does lead other candidates on every measured type of coverage, including more than $436 million worth of coverage in February alone. Kasich has not suffered from literally no coverage, but it’s close to nothing by comparison. In the same measurements, mediaQuant said Kasich has received about $37.7 million in coverage over the last year. As the GOP field has winnowed, he’s moved up from 14th on mediaQuant’s coverage rankings in January to eighth in February. (On the Democratic side, mediaQuant said Hillary Clinton has gotten $746 million in earned media, while challenger Bernie Sanders got $321 million.) These figures contrast heavily to the paid coverage both Trump and Kasich have bought. The two candidates have spent $10 million and $14 million, respectively, over roughly the same time frame, the Times noted. We will point out that there doesn’t seem to be any other group that breaks down media coverage in the way mediaQuant does. George Washington University senior fellow Kalev Leetaru follows TV mentions on his 2016 Campaign Television Tracker, but doesn’t measure other media or assign a dollar value. (Leetaru also follows online mentions in a separate 2016 Online News Candidate Tracker, but we'll focus on the TV component.) The Campaign Television Tracker showed Trump received 46.6 percent of all TV mentions of Republican candidates in 2015-16. That far outpaced Kasich, who garnered 3.9 percent. The discrepancy between coverage of Trump and his rivals is out of the ordinary, experts in political campaigns and advertisements told us. While Trump first garnered attention because he was a novelty, like Ross Perot in his 1992 independent run, media outlets continued to cover Trump as his campaign gained traction. That has allowed him to self-promote and share his own message in ways normally reserved for campaign ads, they said. ""I have never seen a candidate get as much earned media/free media as Trump. It isn't even close,"" political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said in an email. ""I have been stunned at the amount of time Trump receives. They do telephone interviews. They cover entire speeches. He seems to be everywhere. It is very unusual."" Our ruling Kasich said, ""Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion worth of free media. I got, like, none."" The Ohio governor was referring to an analysis by mediaQuant, which measured so-called earned media coverage of presidential candidates and assigned a dollar value to them. Trump has gotten almost $1.9 billion in the past 12 months, while Kasich has only $37.7 million, according to mediaQuant. That's a ratio of 50 to 1. No other media firms seem to perform this analytical function, but experts told us it does look like Trump is far and away getting more coverage than his GOP rivals. Kasich is exaggerating that he doesn’t get any coverage, but his approximation stands, especially when compared with Trump. We rate this statement Mostly True.

R.I. incarceration rates low; prisons not overcrowded
","In the midst of a General Assembly hearing Feb. 23, Richard Ferruccio, the former president of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, took a minute to defend himself and the state’s prisons. When discussing House Bill 7420, which would raise penalties for residents who tamper with cellphone and radio towers, Rep. Edith Ajello voiced concerns. Ajello said she felt the new penalties were ""extreme.""  Why raise the sentence to up to 10 years in prison when the facilities are already overcrowded? she asked. Ferruccio shot back. ""We do not have an overcrowding problem. As a matter of fact, Rhode Island has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country,"" Ferruccio said. ""It is not the doom and gloom""  that people think. Ferruccio’s sources — a Wikipedia page, an article from Governing Magazine, which cited data from the Bureau of Justice, and a WorldAtlas.com article — all backed up this part of his claim. Rhode Island has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. We also did our own research. The National Institute of Corrections, an agency housed within the U.S. Department of Justice, reports the incarceration rates in each state every year. Their most recent report from 2014 says Rhode Island has a rate of about 55 percent less than average with 178 people incarcerated per every 100,000. It is the second lowest, with Maine reporting 153 per every 100,000. The national average is 392 per 100,000.  (However, the NCIC numbers also showed us that the Ocean State has a probation rate that is 91 percent higher than the national average, second only to Georgia.) Now, for the second part. Are the state’s prisons overcrowded? No, Ferruccio said, sending us an email claiming that the prisons are just 76-percent full. J.R. Ventura, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said that figure was off by less than 1 percent, mainly because Ferruccio failed to include female inmates. On average there are 136 women a day in the prisons. Including women, there were 3,060 inmates were in Rhode Island’s prisons on March 15, or 76.7-percent of capacity. Those rates have been falling in recent years from 83.6 percent in 2013 to 80.6 percent in 2014. Other state prison systems are operating way above capacity. In Colorado, prisons are at 115 percent of capacity. In Louisiana,  the average is 119 percent, according the federal government. But these are averages and in Rhode Island the medium and maximum-security units run  at about 93 percent capacity. So, is that ""crowded""? ""Absolutely no, we are not overcrowded,"" Ventura said. ""There’s a lot of people in the Max and Medium facilities, but we are not overcrowded."" Overcrowding was a significant problem in the state in the 1970s and a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the crowding was unconstitutional.  In a settlement called the Palmigiano agreement, the state agreed to limits for each facility. As long as the numbers don’t exceed those limits, the prisons are not overcrowded, Ventura said. ""Our numbers have remained steady and far below capacity since 2008. We are able to manage our daily operations safely and effectively."" he said. OUR RULING: Ferruccio said Rhode Island has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the country. His numbers were spot on. Except for Maine, Rhode Island has the lowest incarceration rate. However, the state also has a very high probation rate, which he did not mention.   He also said the prisons do not have an overcrowding problem. He is correct. The Department of Corrections confirmed that the prisons are not ""crowded"" by the Palmigiano standards.

"['Supreme Court', 'Virginia', 'Mark Herring']","
Herring says all Supreme Court nominees back to 1875 got a confirmation hearing
","Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring recently joined an effort to convince U.S. Senate leaders this year to fill the U.S. Supreme Court seat opened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. President Barack Obama on March 16 nominated U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland for the seat. This follows weeks of vows by Senate Republicans not to hold confirmation hearings for any Obama nominee and their insistence that filling the high court seat be left to the new president in January. Herring signed a March 10 letter with the Democratic attorneys general of 17 other states - plus those of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico - telling Senate leaders from both parties they have a constitutional responsibility to act on Obama’s nominee. They said the refusal of Senate Republicans to consider a nominee this year breaks long tradition and that ""every nominee since 1875 has received a confirmation hearing."" We wondered whether that statement spanning the past 141 years is correct. Michael Kelly, director of communications for Herring, said the claim is based on information from the White House website, which says ""since 1875, every nominee has received a hearing or a vote."" That wording is a bit different than the claim in the attorneys general letter, that every nominee since the mid-1870s received a ""confirmation hearing."" We spoke with four experts on Supreme Court history, and they all took issue with the statement in the letter. The first confirmation hearing wasn’t held until 1873, according to a 2016 article published by Paul Collins Jr., a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, and Lori Ringhand, a professor and associate dean at the University of Georgia School of Law. But that was a closed-door session probing a narrow issue of whether chief justice nominee George Williams misused Department of Justice funds for personal expenses, the professors wrote. For the next 40 years, the Judiciary Committee discussed and voted on three dozen potential justices without hearing testimony from the nominees or anybody else, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report. And unlike today, those sessions were held behind closed doors. The Judiciary Committee didn’t hold its first public hearing on a Supreme Court nominee until 1916. The nominee and future justice, Louis Brandeis, wasn’t required to show up, and he didn’t. When it comes to an open forum in which a nominee testifies before the committee - the way it’s done today - that didn’t happen until 1925. That year, Harlan Stone became the first nominee to testify publicly before the Judiciary Committee. He was called to address concerns by some senators about his financial connections. Stone handled the questions with aplomb and served 21 years on the court - the last five as chief justice. For the next 30 years, the committee usually, but not always, held public hearings. There was no custom of having the nominee appear before the panel, according to Henry Abraham, a retired University of Virginia government professor who wrote the book ""Justices and Presidents: A Political History of Appointments to the Supreme Court."" That changed after the confirmation of Chief Justice Earl Warren, a three-term Republican governor of California, in March 1954. Two months later, the high court unanimously handed down the Brown v. Board of Education decision that required the integration of public schools. Outraged Southern senators resolved that future nominees would not be given an easy confirmation path, according to Abraham and several other Supreme Court experts we contacted. The next nominee was John Harlan II, a Republican from New York who Southern Democrats denounced as an ""ultra-liberal"" dedicated to eroding the Constitution by ""judicial fiat."" In February 1955, the Judiciary Committee held two days of closed-door hearings on the nomination and then opened the proceeding to the public for Harlan’s testimony. A month later, the Senate confirmed Harlan on a 71-11 vote. Thus was born what experts say is the modern tradition of the committee holding a public hearing that includes testimony by the nominee. There have been two footnote exceptions since 1955, according to a 2009 study by the Congressional Research Service: In June 2005, President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. The nomination was withdrawn without a public hearing that September, when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died. Bush then nominated Roberts to be chief justice and, after public hearings, he was confirmed. In October 2005, Bush nominated Harriet Miers for O’Connor’s seat. Miers, a close adviser to Bush, was criticized heavily for not having judicial experience. Several weeks later, Bush withdrew her nomination before a public hearing was held. Our ruling Herring and fellow attorneys general wrote that ""every (U.S. Supreme Court) nominee since 1875 has received a confirmation hearing."" The claim hits a recent roadblock with the 2005 nominations of Roberts and Miers, although we note their names were withdrawn before a formal hearing could be held. But going even further back, from the 1870s to mid-1910s, there’s no record of three dozen Supreme Court prospects getting any formal hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Instead, the panel met behind closed doors to discuss and vote on nominees. In the context of modern-day nomination hearings, which nowadays entail dissecting a potential high court jurist’s background and qualifications in formal appearances in public, that process didn’t start in earnest until the 1950s. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0E3B40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/20/mark-herring/herring-says-all-supreme-court-nominees-back-1875-/

NHGOP chairwoman says lame duck presidents don't nominate Supreme Court justices
","The ongoing partisan feud over President Obama’s Supreme Court nomination Merrick Garland made its way to New Hampshire, where U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte says the next president should select a justice instead.   State Republican chairwoman Jennifer Horn echoed Ayotte’s sentiment and issued a statement criticizing Obama’s move. ""Republicans have repeatedly stated that the American people deserve a voice in the process of selecting the next Supreme Court Justice, and I wholeheartedly agree,"" Horn wrote. ""For more than eighty years, there has not been a nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice in a presidential election year. This is simply not the time to break with decades of bipartisan practice."" We were struck by Horn’s assertion that more than eight decades had passed since a president and U.S. Senate found themselves in this situation. We decided to take a look. It turns out that an almost identical statement was made by presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on the Feb. 14, 2016, edition of Meet the Press. There, he told host Chuck Todd that """"It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don't do this in an election year."" As PolitiFact reported at the time, that’s largely true -- but not because of ""tradition"" (Cruz’s words) or ""bipartisan practice"" (Horn’s words). Instead, it’s because it’s simply rare for this combination of circumstances to occur. ""This is entirely a matter of circumstance,"" Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist, told us in February. ""Certainly not a norm or tradition by presidents refraining from nominating in a presidential election year or by senators refusing to consider such nominations."" When asked for background on Horn’s comment, state GOP spokesman Ross Berry pointed to Benjamin Cardoza, who was nominated to the court by President Herbert Hoover on Feb 15, 1932, and confirmed by the Senate on Feb 24. But there’s a more recent case. That came during the election year of 1940, when President Franklin Roosevelt picked Frank Murphy for the court. The nomination was Jan. 4, 1940, and the Senate approved him through a voice vote on Jan. 16. That’s 76 years ago, not ""more than 80 years,"" as Horn said. In 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower put William Brennan on the court through a recess appointment. Brennan was confirmed by the full Senate the next year. President Lyndon Johnson attempted to select a justice during the presidential election year of 1968, but both of his picks were turned aside. And most recently, the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy on Feb. 3, 1988 -- but President Reagan nominated him on Nov. 30, 1987. This thumbnail sketch of the last eight decades clarifies both Cruz’s and Horn’s statements. First, it hasn’t been ""more than 80 years"" since a nomination and confirmation came in an election year. Roosevelt’s nomination of Murphy was 76 years ago. Also, there simply haven’t been many cases of seats on the court coming open during election years. Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution, a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, said that was likely a matter of choice by the justices themselves. ""Justices rarely leave active service in an election year, because they know, at least in the modern era of contentious confirmation battles, that their colleagues will be short staffed because of the unlikelihood of an election-year confirmation of a successor,"" Wheeler told us in February. ""Justices in the modern era rarely die in office."" What’s more, it’s important to note that in each case in which a Supreme Court seat came open during an election year, the president at the time nominated a candidate for the seat. To say Obama would be breaking from practice by nominating a justice isn’t accurate. Our ruling New Hampshire Republican chairwoman Jennifer Horn said that ""For more than eighty years, there has not been a nomination and confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice in a presidential election year."" The time elapsed is actually 76 years, but Horn’s statement is otherwise accurate. Her following sentence, that this means there are ""decades of bipartisan practice"" of not filling seats, is more dubious. Few such positions have come open during that time and when they have, presidents have pushed forward with nominees. On balance, we rate her statement Half True",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0E3C80>],/factchecks/2016/mar/18/jennifer-horn/nhgop-chairwoman-says-lame-duck-presidents-dont-no/

NHGOP says superdelegates have the power to wipe out the results of the NH Democratic primary
","After Bernie Sanders’s 22-point victory in New Hampshire in February, his supporters were understandably excited. The Vermont senator was on the road to the nomination, they hoped, racking up most of the state’s delegates. But Sanders’s victory was perhaps less meaningful than it appeared. Thanks to the Democratic Party’s superdelegate system, 712 elected officials and party bigwigs also get a vote at the party convention. That’s some 15 percent of all 4,763 delegates who ultimately pick the nominee, according to CBS News. Unlike pledged delegates, who are selected in the primary, these so-called superdelegates are allowed to back whichever candidate they want. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a party stalwart, has racked up an overwhelming number of endorsements from these superdelegates. A Washington Post story predicted she could ultimately win up to 90 percent of their votes. Even though Sanders won overwhelmingly in New Hampshire, his supporters were baffled and angry to find out that his 15-9 delegate count could actually become 15-17 by convention time, after the state’s eight superdelegates are factored in. Ever ready to needle the opposition party, the New Hampshire Republican Party leaped into the fray, launching an online petition Feb. 15 asking Democratic officials to honor the results of the primary. ""Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists,"" the petition reads, citing some of the big-name superdelegates. ""This means that Governor Hassan, Senator Shaheen, the senator’s husband William Shaheen and Congresswoman Kuster are going to cancel out the votes of 40,000 Granite State Democrats."" Could one superdelegate vote actually be worth 10,000 ballots cast in the primary? We decided to check it out. It’s important to note that the phrase ""grassroots activists"" in the statement is imprecise. The rest of the paragraph suggests that it’s being used as a synonym for Democratic voters, but it’s a stretch to call every voter an activist. When we reached out to the state Republican party, spokesman Ryan Williams confirmed ""grassroots activists"" and ""voters"" were used interchangeably in this case. And in a statement sent from New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn about the same time, she correctly used the term voters, and not activists. The actual math involved is simple enough. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner’s office tallies the total number of votes cast on each side of the primary. On Feb. 9, 2016, his office recorded 254,776 votes on the Democratic side. According to reporting from the Monitor, the state Democratic Party has 24 base delegates to award in the primary. Since he won 60 percent of the vote, Bernie Sanders was awarded 15 delegates, and Hillary Clinton was awarded 9. Simple enough. Enter the superdelegates. There are eight in the state. As the GOP correctly noted, they include Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her husband, Billy Shaheen; U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster; and Gov. Maggie Hassan. Six of those superdelegates backed Clinton before the primary (sitting out were state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark and party Chairman Ray Buckley). Even after the primary, Fuller Clark and Buckley wouldn’t say who they stood behind, but it’s tradition for the state’s superdelegates to endorse the same candidate. According to a list from the party, the state’s two other superdelegates are Kathleen Sullivan and Joanne Dowdell. So the equation goes like this: Divide the 24 base delegates into the 254,776 ballots cast. Given the total number of voters, each delegate was selected by 10,616 voters. Each Democratic superdelegate, therefore, has an equal weight to more than 10,000 voters. But the superdelegates don’t live in a vacuum. As Buckley told the Monitor, superdelegates are free to change their votes at any time. Since the role was originated in the 1980s, they have never overturned the national consensus for one candidate or another, according to Bloomberg View columnist Jonathan Bernstein. There was concern in 2008, for example, that superdelegates supporting Clinton would tip the balance against then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. But as Obama racked up primary wins and amassed delegates, he picked up uncommitted and defecting superdelegates. Sullivan, former chairwoman of the state Democratic Party , wrote a column for the Monitor in which she described how the state’s delegation voted in 2008: ""At the convention, every superdelegate who had supported Hillary Clinton voted for Barack Obama. It is a New Hampshire tradition: The delegation supports the nominee unanimously."" In other words, while many party insiders support Clinton, if Sanders pulls out a come-from-behind win, it’s unlikely that superdelegates would be willing -- or able -- to block him. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that ""Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists."" For starters, ""grassroots activists"" are not the same as voters, which needed to be clarified. But strictly looking at the numerical breakdown of voters in the Democratic primary and the number of delegates, the math works out.    We rate the the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971D76C0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/18/new-hampshire-republican-party/nhgop-says-superdelegates-have-power-wipe-out-resu/

Bill O'Reilly wrongly says Merrick Garland voted to ban citizens from having guns in DC
","Even if Republican senators agree to consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, his record on gun rights alone will stop his confirmation, says Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. On his show March 16, O’Reilly acknowledged that Obama’s pick — Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit— is ""not some crazy left-wing bomb thrower."" ""But he voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens, and the Supreme Court of course said no, that is unconstitutional,"" O’Reilly added. ""But he voted to keep the guns away. Just that vote, and you must know this, alienates most in the Republican Party, so they never would vote to confirm him."" A few conservative groups and figures have already attacked Garland for his position on guns since his nomination. We’re putting O’Reilly’s specific claim that Garland voted ""to keep guns away from private citizens"" on the Truth-O-Meter. D.C. gun ban O’Reilly’s statement refers to a landmark case on gun rights, District of Columbia vs. Heller. In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washington’s gun regulations — essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home — were unconstitutional. This ruling was significant because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self defense. Up until Heller, the widespread understanding of the Second Amendment was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it appeared in the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit, where Garland has been a judge since 1997, as Parker vs. District of Columbia. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of three D.C. Circuit judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on O’Reilly’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didn’t vote on this case at all. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case, not just the panel of three. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who was in favor of rehearing the case. It’s not fair to conclude that Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider the case, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual rights, filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court asking them to send Heller back to the lower courts for consideration, noted Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School. ""Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,"" Winkler said. ""Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment."" We should also note another case, which some critics say indicates that Garland has a left-leaning opinion of the Second Amendment. In 2000, he joined the majority opinion in a 2-1 finding that the FBI could hold on to gun purchase records for six months for auditing purposes, to make sure the instant background check systems worked. The National Rifle Association called the six-month record retention an ""illegal national registration of gun owners,"" while the court found that it was a common-sense auditing system, not a national firearm registry, according to news reports from the time. Our ruling O’Reilly said Merrick Garland ""voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens."" Garland never heard the case about Washington gun laws from the bench, and so he never voted on it. He voted in favor of reconsidering the case, but it’s impossible to extrapolate from that vote his position on the merits of the case. We rate O’Reilly’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809678DBC0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/18/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-wrongly-says-merrick-garland-voted-ba/
"['Negative Campaigning', 'Pennsylvania', 'Brian Sims']","

Brian Sims: ""Right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat""
","Brian Sims has held Philadelphia’s 182nd District House seat since 2012, earning a reputation as a progressive in an area featuring a wide area of Center City. This year in the primary he will face Democratic candidates Louis Lanni, Marni Snyder and Ben Waxman. On Saturday, Sims’ camp sent a fundraising email to his supporters addressed from him in which he said, ""I never expected to have this big of a target on my back. The right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat so they can push their anti-choice and anti-equality agenda through our State House."" Though Sims has competition from Democrats in the primary, he does not have any from Republicans. No Republicans are on the ballot, according to the City Commissioners Office. And because no candidates are running as Republicans in the primary, no candidates can run as Republicans in the general election. None of the Democrats Sims is facing appear to be ""right-wing extremists."" Like Sims, Lanni is openly gay. He’s run as a Republican in the past, unsuccessfully, but has stated the importance of a hate crimes statute for Pennsylvania and describes himself as a moderate on his campaign’s official Facebook page. Waxman and Snyder have also promoted progressive issues, such as gay rights, increased education funding, school reform, women’s rights and criminal justice reform.    ""I don’t think any of us are right-wing extremists,"" Snyder said. Snyder, who described Sims’ email as ""extremely poorly worded,"" said she received a call from Sims the day the email went out while she was out ""knocking on doors"" in the district. ""He called my cell phone and said, ‘I want you to know that this email went out and was terribly worded,’"" she said. Waxman also said Sims called him to apologize after sending the email. Lanni could not be reached for comment.        Both Snyder and Waxman said they were not bothered by the email, citing their concerns for the district and their respective campaigns.  
   Sims followed up his fundraising email the same day with another email saying he was ""sincerely sorry for offending my challengers for the State House."" He said in the email, ""when I wrote about the right-wing extremists and their anti-choice, anti-equality agenda, I was referring to the Donald Trumps and Koch brothers of the world, not the Democrats running for my State House seat."" Dan Siegel, a lead consultant on Sims’ campaign, said the original email was meant to capture the same meaning as the clarification email but was worded poorly.   ""It read another way to people,"" he said. Joe DeFelice, chairman of the Philadelphia Republican City Committee, called Sims’ actions ""political puffing."" ""The people at the other end of his emails probably don't know what his district looks like,"" DeFelice said. ""It's normal campaign rhetoric but frankly disingenuous in this point.""   Our ruling  Democratic State Rep. Brian Sims sent a fundraising email to his supporters notifying them of an attack on his seat: ""The right-wing extremists are trying to take this seat so they can push their anti-choice and anti-equality agenda through our State House."" But no Republicans are running for his seat, and it’s too late for any to enter the race as Republicans. The three Democrats running against him are not ""right-wing extremists."" The clarification email sent the same day apologized for the word choices but doesn’t undo the statement that had been prepared, written and sent to followers, asking them for a donation.     We rate the statement Pants On Fire.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B8B40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/18/brian-sims/are-right-wing-extremists-running-brian-sims-house/
