Clinton has changed on NAFTA
","In Ohio, where union workers are a major presence and the manufacturing economy is hurting, Sen. Barack Obama attacked Sen. Hillary Clinton for her position on the North American Free Trade Agreement, called NAFTA. ""Yesterday, Sen. Clinton also said I'm wrong to point out that she once supported NAFTA,"" Obama said. ""But the fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president. A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, 'I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York state and America.' "" The Clinton campaign says Obama is wrong, that Clinton was critical of NAFTA ""long before she started running for president."" We looked into Clinton's past remarks on NAFTA and concluded that she has changed her tune, from once speaking favorably about it to now saying the agreement needs ""fixing."" The agreement goes back to the 1992 presidential campaign when Bill Clinton ran against incumbent President George H.W. Bush. On Aug. 12 of that year, Bush finished negotiating NAFTA with Mexico and Canada. During the campaign, Bill Clinton said he would support NAFTA if elected, but would demand supplemental agreements to protect worker rights, the environment and sudden import surges. After Clinton won the presidency, his administration negotiated the side agreements and made NAFTA one of its top priorities. Vice President Al Gore memorably debated Ross Perot about NAFTA on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Congress approved the agreements, and it was hailed as a major political victory for the new president. As first lady, Hillary Clinton publicly supported her husband's position. In 1996, in a visit with unionized garment workers, she said the words Obama now quotes. ""I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade. I think NAFTA is proving its worth,"" said Clinton, according to an Associated Press report. Clinton wrote positively of her husband's efforts on NAFTA in her memoir ""Living History,"" published in 2003: ""Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization. Although unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal."" During a 2004 teleconference on funding cuts for job training, Clinton was asked whether NAFTA should be revisited. She replied, ""I think that we have to enforce the trade rules that are inherent"" in NAFTA. ""I think on balance NAFTA has been good for New York and America, but I also think that there are a number of areas where we're not dealt with in an upfront way in dealing with our friend to the north, Canada, which seems to be able to come up with a number of rationales for keeping New York agricultural products out of Canada,"" she said. Today, Clinton's campaign Web site says plainly, ""NAFTA was negotiated more than 14 years ago, and Hillary believes it has not lived up to its promises."" At a debate hosted by CNN in November 2007, Clinton said, ""NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout."" We should note that Clinton biographer Sally Bedell Smith has said that as first lady, Clinton opposed NAFTA privately but supported it publicly because it was important to her husband politically. However, this is not a point Clinton made in her own autobiography, where she wrote in favor of NAFTA. Now, there's the issue of whether Clinton changed her mind because she was running for president. Clinton surrogates say she made remarks against NAFTA as early as March 2000 when she was running for Senate in New York. We could not confirm those remarks independently. But, as we've noted, she made pro-NAFTA remarks as late as 2003 (her autobiography) and 2004 (a teleconference). We won't say Clinton was a huge cheerleader for NAFTA, but she did speak favorably of it. And now she says it needs to be fixed. Was running for president the cause of this switch, or was it a gradual change of thinking? It's hard to say; the balance of evidence does not point to a harsh pivot point. But when we balance her previous statements against her more recent statements, we find that she has changed her sentiments when she speaks about NAFTA. We rate Obama's charge True.  ",/factchecks/2008/feb/25/barack-obama/clinton-has-changed-on-nafta/

She never said ""boon""
","
For weeks, Sen. Barack Obama has been quoting Sen. Hillary Clinton as saying that the North American Free Trade Agreement had been a ""boon"" to the U.S. economy.
 
He used the phrase in a recent mailing to voters in Ohio (the headline said

Hillary Clinton believed NAFTA was 'a boon' to our economy""),

and he used it in a Jan. 21, 2008, debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
 
""I know that Hillary on occasion has said — just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy,"" Obama said. ""I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal.""
 
We addressed

the controversy over the ""boon""

when he made the remark in the debate (we said it was False), but we're addressing it again now because it has become an issue in the Ohio primary, and the source of the phrase —

Newsday

— has recently said the word did not come from Clinton.
 
Obama's charge is designed to stoke suspicions among liberals and labor leaders that Clinton is in the thrall of big-business Democrats who served in her husband's administration, such as former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, chairman of Citigroup Inc., and ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, her top economic adviser.
 
Indeed, Sen. Clinton energetically promoted NAFTA in the past, thanking corporations for furthering its goals during an address to the 1998 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and adding, ""It is certainly clear that we have not by any means finished the job that has begun.""
 
But Obama is wrong that Clinton said NAFTA was a ""boon.""
 
The Obama campaign got that phrase from an issues summary in the Sept. 11, 2006, edition of

Newsday

in which the Long Island newspaper, in its own words, stated that Clinton believed the trade agreement to be a boon to the economy. The paper also pointed out that Clinton voted against the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in 2005 because of concerns that it would drive jobs overseas.
 
But

Newsday

recently published

a blog posting

written by reporter Dan Janison that said, ""The word was our characterization of how we best understood her position on NAFTA, based on a review of past stories and her public statements.""
 
But Janison wrote that the newspaper does not have ""a direct quote indicating her campaign told us she thought it was good for the economy at that time."" However, the Clinton campaign did not complain when the item was published.
 
But now that it's become an issue in the campaign,

Newsday

says it is not fair to attribute the word to Clinton.
 
""Obama's use of the citation in this way does strike us as misleading,"" Janison wrote. ""The quote marks make it look as if Hillary said 'boon,' not us. It's an example of the kind of slim reeds campaigns use to try to win an office.""
 
PolitiFact might be inclined to give Obama a Barely True ruling for this one, but since he has consistently used the word with no evidence — even going so far as to say she said it ""just last year,"" we find the statement False.

Experts rate Dem plans about the same
","Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton hashed out more details on their health care plans at a debate in Austin, Texas, on Feb. 21, 2008, arguing about coverage and costs.
 
We've looked at coverage claims before. You can check out our evaluations of Clinton's charge that Obama's plan will leave out 15 million people

here

, or Barack Obama's claim that his plan is universal

here

.
 
In Austin, Obama brought up the issue of costs, saying, ""As has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs.""
 
Both Obama and Hillary Clinton seek to reduce costs by emphasizing preventative care for chronic illnesses; better use of information technology for records and billing; and new research on cost and clinical effectiveness. Each campaign estimates savings for their plan starting at approximately $120 billion per year.
 
Bill Clinton's former labor secretary is Robert Reich, who has defended Obama's health plan publicly several times, in particular against criticism from

The New York Times

columnist Paul Krugman, who has written that Hillary Clinton has the superior plan because of its individual mandate.
 
We reviewed Reich's public comments, though, and couldn't find any instances of him saying that Obama's plan cuts costs

more

than anyone else's. If anything, Reich has emphasized that all the Democratic plans will cover more people, and the candidates shouldn't squabble over which plan is better.
 
""The major Democratic plans would spend nearly an identical amount of money helping low- and middle-income families because they rely on the same source of general revenue, derived from allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire,"" Reich wrote on his blog. ""Given the myriad ways universal health insurance might otherwise be organized -- single payer, employer mandate, health-insurance vouchers, tax credits -- this Democratic consensus is striking. It also highlights the abject failure of Republicans to come up with any coherent plan.""
 
We started looking for other examples of independent experts who said Obama's plan would contain costs more and found no clear-cut consensus. Our friends at Factcheck.org checked Obama's health care claims, including what Robert Reich said; see their analysis

here

.
 
Even Obama's own experts say putting a cost-savings number on proposed health care reforms can be difficult. Obama asked three Harvard researchers to evaluate how much money his plan would save. They said his measures could conservatively save $120 billion and probably as much as $200 billion. But their findings also stated:
 
""In sum, each of the measures in the Obama plan has proponents who believe that those reforms will save substantial amounts of money. However, there is no consensus in the research community about how much each element will save, or how much could be saved if these elements were effectively implemented in combination.""
 
Obama clearly believes his plan will reduce costs significantly, and we see no reason to disagree with that. But will it save even more than Hillary Clinton's plan? We find little conclusive evidence of that, nor do we find independent experts willing to argue that case decisively. So we find his claim False.

Yes, a costly addiction
","
Senator Barack Obama may be well known for his verbal acumen, but it also turns out the Illinois Democrat is pretty good at math.
 
At a debate in Austin Thursday night, the Democratic frontrunner reiterated a statement he has used numerous times on the campaign trail: ""We send a billion dollars to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.""
 
To get that figure requires some simple multiplication: barrels of oil imports per day times the cost of barrel of oil equals how much U.S. spends daily purchasing oil abroad. So we dusted off our multiplication tables and checked Obama's math.
 
According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. imported 10,102,000 barrels per day of oil during the week ending Feb. 15. The average world price for a barrel of oil that same week was $89.91. That means energy firms spent $908 million on foreign oil daily in mid-February.
 
Obama's campaign said they used $100 for the price of a barrel of oil, a record reached Feb. 19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 
That number has since dropped a bit – to $98.86 as of Friday afternoon. Redoing the math, what we spend abroad comes awfully close to the billion-dollar figure Obama quotes. It's 998.2 million.
 
We'll allow him to round up. Obama gets a gold star in math, and we find his statement True.

They like him in Texas
","At the Democratic debate in Austin, Texas on Feb. 21, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama responded to criticism that he was little more than a good speaker by saying that he had broad support from voters and newspapers.
 
He said he has received many endorsements, ""including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas.""
 
He's right. We checked and found he has been endorsed in the primary race against Sen. Hillary Clinton by the seven largest newspapers in Texas. Here are samples of what they said:
 

Houston Chronicle:

""Obama vows to reach out to independents and Republicans with a message of inclusion and cooperation. He offers a historic opportunity to elevate national political dialogue to a higher ground. Those who insist on vitriol and obstructionism would be marginalized.""
 

Dallas Morning News:

""Americans are tired of divisive, hard-edged politics. Democrats would inspire a refreshingly new approach by choosing Mr. Obama as their 2008 candidate.""
 

Austin American-Statesman:

""His optimism, unifying vision and ability to inspire are the kind of healing balm the country needs at this moment in history.""
 

San Antonio Express-News:

""America needs a president that tries to create unity out of diversity, marshalling all the forces — red, blue or purple — that make this country great.
Sen. Barack Obama is the Democratic candidate that offers the best chance to reach that lofty objective.""
 

Fort Worth Star-Telegram:

""Obama might be shorter on detail, but he is by far longer on inspirational spirit, charisma and an ability to energize previously unengaged Americans in the voting process, particularly the usually unengaged up-and-coming generations on whose shoulders America's future rests.""
 

Corpus Christi Caller-Times:

""The Editorial Board endorses Sen. Barack Obama because it believes that he offers the kind of inspirational leadership the country is hungry for.""

""A weary America, tired of the status quo, fed up with business as usual, is longing for a positive change — and Barack Obama is that change.""

Up? Yes, but maybe not ""skyrocketing""
","
In the Democratic debate in Austin, Texas on Feb. 22, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama, pleaded for more civility in the immigration debate, because it is encouraging hate crimes against Hispanics.
 
""Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly,"" Obama said. ""Oftentimes it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate, as it's been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable.""
 
Indeed, the South Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, reached that same conclusion in an Intelligence Report in late 2007.
 
The report, titled ""Immigration Backlash"" cited FBI statistics that showed a 35 percent increase in hate crimes against Hispanics between 2003 and 2006.
 
Hateful and false propaganda, once limited to white supremacy groups and border state extremists, has made its way into the mouths of political pundits, radio talk show hosts and even some politicians, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Report for the Southern Poverty Law Center.
 
According to the report: ""While their dehumanizing rhetoric typically stops short of openly sanctioning bloodshed, much of it implicitly encourages or even endorses violence by characterizing immigrants from Mexico and Central America as 'invaders,' 'criminal aliens' and 'cockroaches.'""
 
The findings and conclusions of that study are echoed by a report from the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the U.S. That report also cited FBI statistics for hate crimes against Hispanics between 2003 and 2006.
 
According to the FBI numbers, the number of anti-Hispanic hate crimes rose from 426 in 2003 to 576 in 2006, the year the immigration issues came to the forefront of the national debate.
 
But are the numbers reliable and significant enough to suggest a trend?
 
Potok allows that the statistics have limitations. For one, the numbers are relatively small. Potok notes, however, that National Crime Victimization surveys suggest the hate crimes in the annual crime report are about 20 to 30 times lower than the actual number of hate crimes actually committed, but which go largely unreported.
 
He also argues that while the numbers are small, the large percentage change between the years represents a significant trend.
 
It should be noted, however, that if one tracks the FBI's hate crime statistics prior to 2003, the trend of rising violence due to heated rhetoric becomes less clear. For example, the FBI reports 597 anti-Hispanic hate crimes in 2001 and 557 in 2000 - about the same as the 2006 numbers.
 
Regardless of the numbers, many Hispanic organization leaders like Angela Kelley, director of the Immigration Policy Center in Washington, say Obama is dead-on based on what they are hearing from members.
 
In a 2006 national survey of Latinos conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, more than half (54%) said they believe the debate has increased discrimination.
 
""Within the community, there is an overwhelming feeling that this is an unmistakable trend,"" said Cecilia Munoz, senior vice president of policy for the National Council of La Raza.
 
Before the immigration issue blew up in 2006, her organization would occasionally get hate mail. Now, she said, they get hate mail every day, some of them with threats. At their annual conference, they now provide security training to members of Hispanic advocacy groups.
 
""For the first time, our affiliates are getting hate mail and threats,"" she said. ""There's just no doubt that what Sen. Obama said reflects what people are feeling in the community.""
 
Obama's campaign did not respond to Politifact's request to explain where he got his numbers. As noted, when you look at the historical trend over the last 10 years, the numbers roller-coaster, so it's hard to say, based on those numbers, whether anti-Hispanic hate crimes have actually spiked due to the immigration debate. It's also true that the relatively small number of reported incidents makes even a few additional ones look like a dramatic increase, in terms of percentage.
 
But the numbers steadily rose from 2003 to 2006 and Obama's comment fairly and accurately reflects two reports that reached that conclusion. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

Flag was there, but Obama wasn't waving it
","
Barack Obama has been subjected to chain e-mail attacks that falsely claim he is a Muslim, that he refused to put his hand on his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance and of taking an oath of office with a Koran. He’s even been accused of being anti-American for not wearing an American flag pin.
 
Here’s the latest chapter: The Barack Obama Revolucion.
 
This one originates with a local Fox 26 story in Houston. The camera follows two Obama volunteers whooping it up as they enter a new campaign office. The reporter talks about the importance of the Hispanic vote in Houston. Though it went unmentioned, many viewers had a moment of “Wait, is that a....?” Yep, a large Cuban flag with the image of Che Guevara on it can be seen prominently hanging behind the desk of one of the volunteers.
 
Ernesto “Che” Guevara was a Latin American guerrilla leader and Marxist revolutionary, a major figure in the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro in the late 1950s. Although hailed in some leftist circles as a legendary icon of rebellion, the Argentine-born doctor is also reviled by many Cubans for ruthlessly ordering the execution of more than 150 prisoners in Cuba without a fair trial.
 
Not surprisingly, it didn’t take long for the Fox video to make the rounds on the Internet. More than 70,000 people viewed the video on YouTube. Many blogs picked up the story and ran with it under headlines such as “Barack Obama Loves Che Guevara” at

this site

and “Barack Obama is a Che Fan” at

this one.

And the photos have been widely spread via chain e-mails that suggest Obama supports Che Guevara.
 
On Feb. 11, Orlando Sanchez, a native of Cuba and treasurer of Houston’s Harris County weighed in: “I was outraged to see an image of Che arrogantly displayed over the Cuban flag hanging in the Houston offices of the Obama for President.”
 
Sanchez, a Republican, is the first Cuban-American elected countywide in Harris County, which boasts the largest concentration of Latinos in Texas. He requested, ""on behalf of all Cuban Americans"" that Obama demand the flag's removal.
 
After the whole thing blew up on the Internet, Fox 26 in Houston went back and interviewed the woman who had the flag hanging behind her desk.
 
Her name is Maria Isabel and on an Obama Web page she describes herself as a precinct captain for Barack Obama in Houston. When asked about the flag, Isabel said, “It’s a distraction. I don’t have time to talk about the Cuban flag.”
 
Isabel, who said she was born in Cuba, cut off the interview when the reporter asked if she wanted to apologize for the flag.
 
“Apologize for what? I think it is a waste of time and it (the interview) is taking too much of my time.” On Feb. 12, the Obama campaign sought to put the issue to rest.
 
“This is a volunteer office that is not in any way controlled by the Obama campaign,” a statement from the campaign reads. “We were disappointed to see this picture because it is both offensive to many Cuban-Americans -- and Americans of all backgrounds -- and because it does not reflect Senator Obama’s views. Barack Obama has been very clear in putting forward a Cuba policy that is based on one principle: freedom for the Cuban people.”
 
A disclaimer now appears below the Web site with the Fox 26 video of the women opening the office. “The office featured in this video is funded by volunteers of the Barack Obama Campaign and is not an official headquarters for his campaign.”
 
Nick Shapiro, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said he has heard that the flag was taken down. “But honestly, it’s not our office,” he said on Feb. 21, 2008. “It is not an official campaign office. She is a volunteer precinct captain. Her views do not reflect the views of the campaign.”
 
The question is whether or not it's accurate to say “Obama Loves Che Guevara,” or any of the many variations of that theme now floating around the Internet, based upon this one decoration in this one office put up by this one volunteer. We say no. We say Pants on Fire.

A distortion of what Obama said
","At a media availability in Columbus, Ohio, on Feb. 20, 2008, Sen. John McCain took a claim that President Bush made a week earlier and cranked it up a notch, saying that Sen. Barack Obama wants to bomb Pakistan.
 
It's an extreme charge because Pakistan has been a key ally to the United States. We find McCain's remark seriously distorts what Obama actually said.
 
Here's the exchange from the media availability:
 
QUESTION: Senator McCain, last night in your speech you talked about Barack Obama saying that he once suggested invading our ally, Pakistan.
 
MCCAIN: I said bombing. My statement was bombing. I don't know if you received a text, but my statement that I made at my speech was that he suggested bombing Pakistan without their permission.
 
QUESTION: Regardless, if you go back and look at Barack Obama's (inaudible) what he's saying is not going after Pakistan, but going after al Qaeda targets within Pakistan. And as you know...
 
MCCAIN: That's still bombing Pakistan.
 
QUESTION: But there are some people even inside the Bush administration who think that going unilaterally and not, sort of, being at the mercy of Musharraf may not be the worst idea.
 
MCCAIN: Well, the best idea is to not broadcast what you're going to do. That's naive. The first thing that you do is you make your plans and you carry out your operations as necessary for America's national security interest. You don't broadcast that you are going to bomb a country that is a sovereign nation and that you are dependent on the good will of the people of that country to help you in the war -- in the struggle against Taliban and the sanctuaries which they hold.
 
McCain's remarks echo a comment made by President Bush in an interview Feb. 17 on

Fox News Sunday

after he was was asked what he thought of Sen. Barack Obama.
""I certainly don't know what he believes in,"" Bush said. ""The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he's going to attack Pakistan and embrace (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, which — I think I commented that in a press conference when I was asked about it.""
 
Bush and McCain are referring to a speech that Obama gave in August 2007 at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He spoke about the problem of terrorists at large within Pakistan. He said he would continue to provide military aid to Pakistan as long as the authorities there work to close terrorist training camps and prevent the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks in Afghanistan.
 
Then Obama added:
 
""I understand that (Pakistan) President Musharraf has his own challenges. But let me make this clear. There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans. They are plotting to strike again. It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will.""
 
The transcript of his speech makes it clear that Obama is talking about targeting terrorists within the country regardless of whether he has the permission of the Pakistani government.
 
We recognize that McCain is making a larger point questioning the wisdom of Obama telegraphing our future military plans and we are not addressing whether that is a good idea. But it is a serious distortion to say Obama wants to ""attack Pakistan,"" as President Bush did, and an even more serious one that he supports ""bombing Pakistan,"" as McCain did. (Indeed, all Obama said was that he would ""act."")
 
For the U.S. to bomb Pakistan would essentially be no different from the U.S. bombing Mexico or Great Britain, two other allies.
 
The charge from Bush and McCain is especially unusual in the light of

a Feb. 19 article

in the

Washington Post

that revealed missiles from a CIA-operated Predator aircraft recently killed a key al Qaeda commander in the Pakistani town of Mir Ali. The U.S. government did not have permission from the Pakistan government for the attack, the article said.
 
A week ago, we rated Bush's statement, which included a mischaracterization of Obama's position on Ahmadinejad, as

False.

But McCain has ratcheted up the rhetoric, saying

bombing

instead of just

attacking

and adding that Obama wants to ""bomb a country that is a sovereign nation.""
 
That's not just wrong. That's Pants-on-Fire wrong.

Cherry-picked quotes distort McCain's comments
","A video released last week by the Democratic National Committee uses a series of public statements from John McCain in an attempt to suggest that he flip-flopped on whether the Iraq War would be easy.
 
The video begins with an Aug. 2006 press conference in Columbus Ohio, aired on CNN, in which McCain states: ""...It grieves me so much that we had not told the American people how tough and difficult this task would be. And it has contributed enormously to the frustration that Americans feel today because they were led to believe that this would be some kind of day at the beach.""
 
Then comes a clip of McCain from a Sept. 24, 2002 episode of Larry King Live on CNN: ""And I believe that the success will be fairly easy.""
 
And this one: ""I believe we can win an overwhelming victory in a very short period of time."" That one comes from a CNN Late Edition appearance five days later on Sept. 29, 2002.
 
A press release from the Democratic National Committee that accompanies the video states that ""in the run up to the war, John McCain parroted the Bush administration's misleading rhetoric. Just like President Bush, McCain said the war would be easy and that we'd be greeted as liberators. Only in the throes of the presidential campaign did he try to have it both ways by complaining that the American people 'were led to believe this could be some kind of day at the beach.' John McCain never admits that, just like President Bush, he said victory would be easy.""
 
The DNC quotes aren't taken out of context, but they don't quite capture McCain's full point of view on the struggle in Iraq.
McCain's campaign did not respond to PolitiFact, but as luck would have it, Tim Russert raised this very issue with McCain in a Jan. 10, 2007 interview on MSNBC.
 
Russert: ""Go back, Senator, to 2002 -- the administration saying we'd be greeted as liberators, John McCain saying that you thought success would be fairly easy.""
 
McCain: ""Well, it was easy. It was easy. I said we -- a military operation would be easy. It was easy. We were greeted as liberators. Look at the films when we rolled into Baghdad. And then there was a period of time where we allowed looting, when the whole country literally evolved into chaos. I went over there. I saw what was happening. I came back, and I made a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations and said exactly, tragically, what was going to happen unless we got control of the situation. It was easy, by the way.""
 
Russert: ""But certainly securing the peace and instilling a democracy in Iraq has been far more challenging --""
 
McCain: ""Absolutely. Just as I said it would be.""
 
Russert: ""But not nearly as much as the administration had suggested to the American people?""
 
McCain: ""Well, the mistake and failure...it's well-documented of what happened. We went in there, we won an easy military victory. They did greet us as liberators. The recent testimony of Saddam Hussein's own words indicate what kind of brutality they were subjected to. And then all of a sudden the looting started, understandably. We didn't have control of Anbar province. We didn't have control -- eventually, there was a steady deterioration which led us to the terrible situation that we are in today. And all along, it was because we did not have the classic counterinsurgency strategy which is clear, hold and build. We cleared and would leave. As I've said in other hearings, we were playing a game of Whack-a-Mole.""
 
McCain has been a consistently strong supporter of the war. But at the same time, he has often been a critic of the way the war effort has been carried out by the Bush administration.
 
As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency. (see Politifact ""McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq"" and ""One man sacrificed for his country…"")
 
Yes, McCain predicted it would be an easy war and that Americans would be greeted by the Iraqis as liberators. And yes, neither has proven true over the long run. But Hussein's regime was toppled relatively quickly and McCain advocated early on that the U.S. needed more troops and resources to prevent just such an entrenched insurgency as has come to pass. And so, in that context, we rate the DNC's comment just Half True.

By our count, Obama, who is 14 years younger than Clinton, has about one year running a voter-registration project, three years as a community organizer, four as a full-time attorney handling voting rights, employment and housing cases, and 12 years in the Illinois Senate and U.S. Senate. That's a total of 20 years in public policy matters. So the difference between Clinton and Obama is really 15 years.
 
We rate her claim False.

Many years of politics and advocacy
","Sen. Hillary Clinton often boasts that she has a long resume — 35 years long, to be precise.
 
""I have 35 years' experience making change,"" she said in a TV ad in December 2007, and has repeated the phrase, or variations of it, many times since.
 
Several PolitiFact readers asked us to explore the 35-year claim, which Clinton uses to distinguish herself from Barack Obama, her younger (and less experienced) rival. To examine the claim, we interviewed two authors of Clinton books, Sally Bedell Smith and Suzanne Goldenberg, and we examined bios from Clinton's campaign Web site, her Senate office, the White House and the Encyclopedia of Arkansas.
 
In simple terms, any experience counts as experience, but it's clear from the context of Clinton's remarks that she's speaking about public policy experience, so that's how we have focused our examination. We'll start with the math.
 
Clinton is 60, so if we assume that her 35 years were consecutive, they would have begun in 1973 when she graduated from Yale Law School at age 25. That year she joined the Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group for children.
 
But her math was way off when she claimed the difference between her and Obama is ""35 years of experience,"" which we addressed with

this item.

 
Her career can be divided into four parts: her first years after law school, her work at the Rose Law Firm and as first lady of Arkansas, her time as first lady in the White House and her seven years in the U.S. Senate. There's little question that her time in the Senate can be considered political experience, so we'll focus on the other three.
 
After law school, Clinton worked briefly for the Children's Defense Fund and then joined the House Judiciary Committee to work on the impeachment of President Nixon. She then taught law in Arkansas for three years (while running a legal aid clinic) before she joined the Rose Law Firm, a prominent corporate firm in Little Rock.
 
Although she has not always drawn a paycheck for her political work, it's clear from her resume that public service, particularly involving the welfare of children, has been a major focus for her career and outside activities.
 
As first lady of Arkansas, she was active in several groups involving education, child welfare and poverty. In 1977, President Carter appointed her to the board of directors for the Legal Services Corporation, a federal agency that provided legal aid to the poor. She was co-founder of Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and she served as president and a member of the group's board of directors until 1984. She also chaired an advisory committee on rural health, served on a task force on infant mortality and chaired an Arkansas education task force. She chaired the Children's Defense Fund board from 1986 through 1992.
 
This work occurred while she was practicing corporate law at the Rose Law Firm.
 
Goldenberg, author of

Madam President: Is America Ready to Send Hillary Clinton to the White House?

, said Clinton couldn't work full-time in politics or on children's issues because she needed a well-paying job to compensate for her husband's modest salary as governor. (Arkansas ranks near the bottom of the states for gubernatorial pay.)
 
""Hillary Clinton was the breadwinner — and that was an important role,"" said Goldenberg.
 
Sally Bedell Smith, author of

For Love of Politics: Bill and Hillary Clinton: The White House Years

, said Clinton has sometimes exaggerated her involvement with political causes, especially for her Arkansas years. ""I think she certainly has, over time, been involved in children's issues at various intervals. But the fact is she was not employed in the nonprofit sector. She was a corporate lawyer.""
 
Clinton also had parental responsibilities. Her daughter Chelsea was born in 1980, after Clinton had been at the law firm for four years.
 
""Like many women, her life was a juggling act,"" Goldenberg said. ""She had her family, her full-time job and she had these other activities that really were on the side.""
 
Her legal work gave her entree into the corporate world: She served on the boards of Wal-Mart, the yogurt chain TCBY and the French building materials company Lafarge.
 
After her husband was elected president in 1992, Clinton left the Rose Law Firm and became first lady. By most accounts, she was one of the more active first ladies in U.S. history. In contrast to some predecessors (Mamie Eisenhower once described her duties as ""Ike runs the country. I turn the pork chops""), Clinton became especially involved in public policy.
 
She chaired the White House task force that made an unsuccessful proposal to provide universal health care and she played a key role in creating a children's health care program. Soon after the legislation passed, the

New York Times

reported, ""Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support.""
 
As first lady, she advised her husband on Cabinet appointments and senior White House staff positions, Smith said. Clinton also was active on welfare reform and foreign policy issues.
 
""Her activism was quite unprecedented,"" said Smith.
 
Smith said if she'd been given a title that matched her role, it would have been special counsel to the president.
 
And so we find Clinton's resume and accomplishments generally support her claims of 35 years of political experience.
 
There are a few periods during her Arkansas years when she had less time for public service because she was busy with corporate law and her duties as a new mother. But an examination of her resume and interviews with her biographers show she had a wide range of political and public service roles over those 35 years.
 
Her claim to be ""an agent of change"" for that time is a flourish of campaign rhetoric (she was trying to match Obama's claim to the word change), but we find it's reasonable because, to be an advocate for any group or cause often means to seek change. We find her claim to be Mostly True.

She's no red
","In the heyday of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, associating with a known communist was grounds for intense suspicion and scrutiny. That was the early 1950s.
 
A line in a widely circulated chain e-mail, from an article written by former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris, seems like old times.
 
""Hillary interned with Bob Treuhaft, the head of the California Communist Party,"" Morris wrote. ""She met Bob when he represented the (Black) Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.""
 
It sounds outlandish, but there's a little something to it.
 
While at Yale Law School, Hillary Clinton did spend the summer of 1971 interning as a law clerk at the firm Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein.
 
""A small law firm in Oakland, California,"" Clinton succinctly refers to it in her autobiography. By all accounts it was a fairly radical left-wing law firm, known for taking on discrimination and social injustice cases.
 
But senior partner Treuhaft was not ""head of the California Communist Party"" as Morris claimed in his article. It is true that Treuhaft was once an active member of the American Communist Party. Investigated and harassed by McCarthyites in 1950s, Treuhaft was listed by the House Un-American Activities Committee as one of the most dangerously subversive lawyers in the country, according to his 2001 obituary in the

Times of London.

But he became disillusioned with the party and left it in 1958, before Clinton started her internship with the firm.
 
In her book, Clinton makes only passing reference to her responsibilities at the firm, stating, ""I spent most of my time working for Mal Burnstein researching, writing legal motions and briefs for a child custody case.""
 
Burnstein, who was never a communist, is retired now. Reached at his home in California, Burnstein recalled that Clinton was one of the firm's better summer interns: smart and a hard worker.
 
""She wasn't political at all, that I remember,"" Burnstein said. ""The only politics that were discernible were probably liberal politics. ... She came to us because of the civil rights cases we did, the things we did with racial equity and other civil rights things. That was her interest.""
 
It irks Burnstein that some want to attack Clinton for her association with the firm, even though he doesn't support her run for president.
 
""I think she did something that was relatively noble and altruistic when she was a young woman,"" Burnstein said.
 
Burnstein couldn't recall what specific cases Clinton worked on, but at the time, he said, he had cases where landlords refused to rent to black people, and one in which a group of doctors took umbrage with being asked to sign a ""loyalty oath"" attesting that they were not communists. But they also did a lot of landlord-tenant, workers' comp, family law and personal injury cases.
 
""We did poor people's law,"" Burnstein said.
 
So why hasn't Clinton talked much about it?
 
""I think you can figure out why,"" Burnstein said.
 
In addition to Treuhaft's former association with the Communist Party, another partner in the firm, Doris Walker, was, and still is, an active member.
 
""It was who they were,"" Burnstein said. ""It didn't really have a lot to do with the way we practiced law.""
Clinton must have known about those associations, he said. ""It's not like it was a secret.""
 
Clinton's campaign did not respond to

Times

inquiries.
 
Walker, now retired, said she figured someone would try to make political hay out of it eventually. Reached at home in California, she said she ""must be the only living Communist Party member of my generation.""
 
""It was sort of a left-wing firm,"" Walker said, but most of the lawyers were not communists. To dredge it up now, she said, amounts to little more than red-baiting.
 
In his biography of Clinton, former Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein states that at Treuhaft's firm, ""she would be working for one of the most important radical law practices on the West Coast, celebrated for its defense of constitutional rights, civil liberties and leftist causes."" Bernstein quotes Treuhaft as saying, ""The reason she came to us, the only reason I could think of because none of us knew her, was because we were a so-called Movement law firm at the time.""
 
It doesn't say so in Morris' article, but in his 2004 book,

Rewriting History,

— an acerbic rebuttal to Hillary Clinton's autobiography,

Living History

— Morris notes that, for the record, he doesn't think Clinton is a Communist and that he doesn't mean to imply that because she worked at the law firm she was.
 
No, no, of course not.
 
""But the fact that she chose this job out of all the summer jobs that might have been available, traveling 3,000 miles for it, tells something about her orientation at the time,"" Morris wrote. ""Just as the fact that she does not describe the firm's work or reputation says something about her today.""
 
There's not only no evidence Clinton was a communist sympathizer, Morris doesn't have his facts right (at least not in the version in the FrontPageMag.com article that made its way into a chain e-mail). Treuhaft was not head of the California Communist Party, nor was he a member when Clinton worked for his law firm. But she did intern for Treuhaft's firm. And he was, at one time, a member of the American Communist Party. So we rate the claim Barely True.

She did not ""help"" the Black Panthers
","
Hillary Clinton and the Black Panthers. It makes for quite the unlikely image.
 
But according to a chain e-mail that originated with an Internet article by Dick Morris, the former Clinton adviser turned foe, Hillary Rodham was a student radical at Yale Law School who dedicated herself to helping violent Black Panthers on trial for murder.
 
""Hillary's main extracurricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent,"" Morris wrote. ""She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.""
 
Often repeated on the Internet, the claim turns out to be largely embellished, but they are not without a grain of truth.
 
Here's the history.
 
In 1970, eight Black Panthers, including national chairman Bobby Seale, were brought to trial in New Haven, Conn., on charges of murdering a fellow member, Alex Rackley, who was suspected of being a police informant. He was not a federal agent.
 
The trial consumed the Yale campus, and many Yale students rallied in support of the black defendants, or at least for their right to a fair trial.
 
In her autobiography, Clinton said in reference to the Black Panthers that ""J. Edgar Hoover's FBI infiltrated dissident groups and, in some cases, broke the law in order to disrupt them. Law enforcement sometimes failed to distinguish between constitutionally protected, legitimate opposition and criminal behavior.""
 
She does not mention any personal involvement, except to relate that she participated in a bucket brigade to help put out a fire that broke out at the International Law Library just prior to a May Day rally.
 
Clinton played a ""minor"" role in the doings that year, said Paul Bass, a journalist who spent years researching the Black Panther case for a book he co-authored called

Murder in the Model City.

She co-chaired a committee whose main role was to prevent violence at the May Day demonstration, Bass said. They made arrangements for medical care should any demonstrators get hurt.
 
Friends recalled that Clinton took a moderate tone, Bass said.
 
The committee also vowed to offer legal advice to demonstrators who got arrested and to monitor the trial for any civil rights abuses.
 
If that monitoring ever happened, said two sources at the trial interviewed by the

St. Petersburg Times

, one thing is certain: Clinton was not an every-day trial watcher, as Morris claimed. Nor did she ""help"" the defense.
 
David Rosen, who was less than a year out of Yale Law School, was a junior member of the defense team for Seale.
 
""I can't say she was never in court,"" Rosen said. ""But she was not there every day. In fact, I don't even remember seeing her there at all.""
 
""I know she didn't do any work for the defense team,"" Rosen said. ""I was on the defense team, and she didn't do anything for us.""
 
According to Carl Bernstein's biography

A Woman in Charge,

Clinton was among the student-observers from professor Tom Emerson's civil liberties class who attended the trial daily ""to report possible abuses by the government, discuss them in class, write papers about them and prepare summaries for the American Civil Liberties Union.""
 
That last part is news to Mike Avery, who was hired by the ACLU as a staff lawyer to work on the Black Panther case, to keep tabs on any civil rights violations that came up at trial. He doesn't remember the ACLU receiving summaries from any student group, and he specifically does not remember Clinton being a regular at the trial.
 
""To my knowledge, she didn't have any involvement at all,"" said Avery, now a law professor at Suffolk Law School in Boston. ""I didn't see Hillary Rodham anywhere around the place, and I would have known.""
 
People involved in the case, even peripherally, all knew each other, he said. They socialized together. ""She was not in that crowd,"" he said, ""by no stretch of the imagination.""
 
Nevertheless, the distorted versions from Morris and others have been picked up on thousands of Web pages, and widely circulated via chain e-mail. They also have been echoed by conservative political commentators like Sean Hannity.
 
""What the right has done is just a travesty,"" said Bass, who added that he is no fan of Clinton. ""She wasn't any kind of student leader on this. I couldn't find a person who saw her anywhere. The attempt to use this incident to claim Clinton was an apologist for violence is really insidious.""
 
Clinton's campaign did not respond to inquiries from the

Times.

 
Even if Clinton helped to observe the trial as part of a law class, that's different than ""helping"" the Panthers, who were on trial. And the claim that Clinton went to court every day to monitor the trial is, according to witnesses, just not so. Morris appears to have taken a minor involvement by Clinton and spun it into a much more prominent and controversial role. We rate his claim False.

Connie Mack said Bill Nelson voted to raise taxes 150 times
","
In the contest between Bill Nelson and Connie Mack for U.S. Senate, Nelson brought up Mack’s past work promoting Hooters and his altercations at bars about two decades ago.

Mack’s response? Nelson voted to raise your taxes 150 times.

Mack, a Republican congressman from Fort Myers, made the assertion in a video rebuttal to Nelson’s ad. Here’s the script:

""Sad, 40 years in politics and this is what Bill Nelson wants to talk about. Even if it were all true, and it's not, who cares. After all, Bill Nelson and I are candidates for the United States Senate and there are real differences between us. Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote for Obamacare and voted to raise our taxes 150 times - I voted against Obamacare and to cut taxes. I want to talk about what really matters - fixing our economy, creating jobs and tackling our deficit. Bill Nelson, like a typical career politician, wants to talk about Hooters and what I did as a kid. Let’s get serious: Our country is in crisis. It’s time to debate the issues that matter, not this nonsense"".

There are a lot of interesting claims in Mack’s statement. But that big number caught our eye: Has Nelson voted to raise our taxes 150 times?

We already fact-checked whether or not Mack worked as a promoter for Hooters and had a history of fighting at bars, a claim we rated Mostly True. And we’ve also picked apart a claim by a group that claimed Nelson, a Democrat, cast the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act and ruled that Mostly False.

Here, we get serious and focus on taxes.

Mack’s campaign sent us a list of what they characterized as at least 157 votes in favor of higher taxes during Nelson’s Senate career, which started in 2001. We sent the list to Nelson’s Senate office and asked if they disagreed with the characterization of any votes, and we did our own research.

Double-counting votes and other tallying tricks

About half of the votes on the list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law.

Mack’s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan.

Mack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments.

For example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson’s votes on H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. That counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- but not 15 examples.

Which brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as ""voting to raise our taxes?"" Mack’s list counts several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson’s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010.

We sent Mack’s list to a few federal budget experts including Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan public policy think tank; Joe Rosenberg, research associate at the Tax Policy Center, an independent policy analysis group that includes tax analysts who have worked in both Democratic and Republican administrations; and Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction.

We asked the experts to look over the list and give us their general thoughts. All three generally agreed that a vote against a new tax cut doesn’t equal a tax increase.

Gordon called Mack’s list ""ludicrous.""

""Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase,"" he said. ""So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue.""

Nelson supported some tax cuts

Mack’s statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Here, we will focus on the Bush tax cuts.

Nelson opposed a $1.35 trillion tax cut in 2001 because he said it didn’t do enough to reduce debt or help low- and middle-income taxpayers. He also said that as a congressman he had voted for President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cuts and that led to huge deficits.

""I don't want to see Congress make that mistake again,"" Nelson said in 2001.

In 2003 on the second round of Bush tax cuts, Nelson voted against the $350 billion package on the conference report. But in 2006 and in 2010 Nelson, supported extending the tax cuts.

This year, he went along with Obama’s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million.

""His favored position, and one he still holds, is to let the Bush cuts expire on those making more than $1 million,"" said his Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin.

Nelson called for other tax cuts at times. During his first Senate term he bucked his party in favor of repealing the estate tax and in 2007 he sponsored an amendment to reduce the tax on large cigars.

Some of Nelson’s votes cited by Mack would only affect certain businesses -- for example he voted in favor of repealing exemptions for oil and gas companies in 2010. He took many votes in favor of eliminating corporate tax breaks to pay for projects such as port security.

Mack’s spokesman told us that the largest tax increase Nelson voted for was ""Obamacare."" The health care law did raise taxes on the wealthy and health insurance companies. (Read about those provisions in a fact-check we did on a claim by Rush Limbaugh.)

Our ruling

Mack said Nelson ""voted to raise our taxes 150 times.""

Mack jacks up the number by counting non-binding resolutions, which account for about half of those votes. He also counts duplicative votes on the same bill. And, he counts a vote against a tax cut as a vote for a tax increase, even though it’s not the same thing.

Finally, Mack’s statement fails to acknowledge that there have been times that Nelson voted in favor of tax cuts or extending tax cuts. He recently supported extending tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000.

The overall message here is misleading. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/20/connie-mack/connie-mack-bill-nelson-voted-taxes-150-times/

Ryan says candidates for Congress can’t remove themselves from the ballot
","
Thousands of voters in southern Wisconsin will see something unusual and historic when they cast their November 2012 ballots: Paul Ryan’s name in stereo.

The Janesville Republican will appear on the ballot for re-election to his congressional seat. And he’ll also appear as the GOP vice presidential candidate.

Ryan discussed this oddity Aug. 12, 2012, on ""60 Minutes"" -- his first TV interview after being picked by Mitt Romney as his running mate.

CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer asked Ryan: ""Now I understand you're also gonna run for reelection in your congressional seat. Are you kind of hedging your bets here?""

""No, I'm already on the ballot,"" Ryan responded. ""You can't even go off the ballot. So I've already filed. Our filing deadline was in June. I'm already on the ballot, so it has nothing to do with that.""

That comment raised a few eyebrows: Is Ryan really requiredto be on the ballot twice?

In short, yes.

That’s due to a quirk in state law and the timing of Ryan’s pick, according to Reid Magney, spokesman for the state Government Accountability Board, which runs elections.

State law generally prohibits a candidate to appear on the same ballot for two partisan offices. But there is one exception: If he’s running for president or vice president.

That so-called ""favorite son"" law was passed in the late 1960s.

On the timing question: Ryan, who is seeking an eighth term in the U.S. House, had until June 1, 2012, to submit his name for re-election to the 1st Congressional District seat. He did so.

The Government Accountability Board met June 8, 2012, and approved his and other names for the fall ballot. (Indeed, that included the Aug. 14, 2012, primary election, three days after his VP pick. Ryan’s name was listed even though he was unopposed for the GOP nod.)

In November, Ryan faces Democrat Rob Zerban of Kenosha.

There’s only one way for a candidate to get his name off the ballot after the accountability board has acted -- and it takes, well, a pretty extreme step.

The candidate would have to die.

Even then, the death would have to happen before the ballot was printed, Magney said. Ballots are printed about 50 days before an election and they don’t get reprinted because of a death.

Our rating

Ryan said since he’s already on the ballot for re-election to Congress he could not get his name removed. Indeed, at this stage, death is the only way off the House ballot.

Chris Christie blasts Jon Corzine for giving away 14 percent raises and saying, ‘I will fight to get you a great contract’ at a union rally
","
Nearly 3,000 miles from Trenton, Gov. Chris Christie couldn’t pass up an opportunity to knock his predecessor, Jon Corzine.

The Republican governor appeared Aug. 9 at a campaign event in Bellevue, Wash., for GOP gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna. Christie told the crowd public-sector union workers should pay their fair share toward pension and health benefits, and then criticized Corzine for giving away raises.

""My predecessor's first negotiation with the public-sector unions, he gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years and he stood on the front steps of the Capitol at a public-sector union rally and said, 'I will fight to get you a great contract,’"" said Christie, according to a video posted on YouTube.

Corzine, a Democrat, did approve contracts providing 13 percent in raises over a four-year period for state workers. Corzine also spoke at a union rally where he vowed to ""fight"" for public employees, according to several news reports.

But Christie’s criticism that Corzine ""gave away"" those raises ignores the fact that the contracts included a number of union concessions.

First, let’s explain the events leading up to that union rally.

For the first budget of his tenure, Corzine in 2006 proposed increasing the sales tax to help cover a budget shortfall. The governor also called for increasing the contribution to the state’s pension system. 
But instead of the tax hike, some Democratic legislators called for state worker unions to accept salary or fringe benefit givebacks. Another proposal was scaling back the proposed pension payment.

On June 19, 2006, thousands of public employees rallied outside the Statehouse to show support for Corzine’s plan. According to several news reports, the governor made comments at the union rally similar to those cited by Christie.

Star-Ledger columnist Paul Mulshine and Gannett New Jersey columnist Bob Ingle both quoted Corzine as saying, ""We're gonna fight for a fair contract."" The New York Times quoted the governor as saying, ""I will fight for you."" 
The final budget included the sales tax increase and a smaller pension contribution.

Now, we’ll address the raises mentioned by Christie. 
Eight months after that union rally, the Corzine administration reached a deal with the largest state workers union for a new four-year agreement. Two other unions later agreed to similar deals. Those contracts, which went into effect in July 2007, provided a total of 13 percent in raises for each union.

However, by claiming Corzine ""gave away"" those raises, Christie failed to mention a number of union concessions built into the contracts.

For example, union workers agreed for the first time to contribute 1.5 percent of their salaries each year toward the cost of health benefits. The contracts also increased employees’ annual pension contributions by 0.5 percent.

In response to our findings, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in part:

""For goodness sake, the fix was in for that fight, and Jon Corzine was taking a ‘fall’ in the first round. Who was representing the taxpayers? Where was the adversarial collective bargaining relationship? And, finally, how many people do any of us know got those kinds of raises in those years? It was a ‘giveaway’ in the fullest sense, and that’s exactly what Governor Christie was saying.""

Our ruling

At a campaign event in Bellevue, Wash., Christie said Corzine ""gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years and he stood on the front steps of the Capitol at a public-sector union rally and said, 'I will fight to get you a great contract.’""

Corzine did authorize four-year contracts with a total of 13 percent in raises, and vowed to ""fight"" for public employees at a union rally. But Christie’s criticism ignores how the contracts included certain union concessions.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

Memphis schools president says Shelby County funding for schools has not increased over the past six years
","
As the brouhaha over schools continues in the state’s largest county, funding issues have stayed secondary to the crucial legal questions involving whether Memphis can successfully force real countywide schools consolidation with its suburban Shelby County neighbors.

But Martavius Jones, the former Memphis City Schools board president who helped lead the surrender of the system’s charter last year, gave a preview of funding rhetoric likely to grow louder as the July 1, 2013, deadline for completing merger grows near. Given that more than 16 percent of the state’s education money goes to schools in Memphis and Shelby County, how the issue plays out could have a ripple effect on systems across the state.

A private financial planner and executive committee member of the county’s schools merger Transition Planning Commission (TPC), Jones appeared on a Fox 13 News morning show to discuss the legal fight between the city and suburbs.

After giving his view that the suburbs were following an unconstitutional path toward splitting the county into essentially seven school districts, Jones said the planning commission’s had created a blueprint for a ""world class"" unified school district. However, he added, ""the funding issue is quite an obstacle.""

""From a standpoint of the county government,"" Jones said, ""neither school system has received an increase in funding over the past six years.""

Jones backed up his assertion in an email to us: ""By the time the districts are merged in 2013, it would have been six years since there was an increase in funding from the county.""

In terms of their overall budgets, we knew that MCS, still in existence for one final school year, and the for now still suburban-only Shelby County Schools had seen slight increases in overall expenditures.

In Tennessee, although a large chunk of the most counties’ operating budgets goes toward school operations, the majority of funding for schools comes from the state. So it’s possible that school budgets grew even while local contributions remained flat. And a look at budgets for the county confirms that, every year since the 2008 fiscal year, the county has allocated the same number of property-tax dollars to the county’s schools -- $361,288,000.

That big number has been apportioned to the county’s two school districts (MCS and SCS) according to enrollment, or what is known as Average Daily Attendance, with the current split about 68 percent for the city and 32 percent for the suburbs. Enrollment numbers fluctuate somewhat each year, so that a marginal fraction of funds seesaw back and forth between MCS and SCS.

Mike Ritz, budget chairman for the county commission and its chairman beginning next month, has some real quarrels with how Jones and other school officials frame the funding argument, but he says: ""He’s absolutely right -- since I was elected we’ve stopped paying extra money.""

What irks Ritz is what he calls ""complaining"" by schools officials that the county is not providing more money, because he believes it distracts from the fact that MCS and SCS have seen big increases in money from the state. Some recent changes in the state’s funding formula have increased state funding for larger school districts like those in Shelby, Davidson, Hamilton and Knox County.

""Quite frankly, they’ve had a humongous increase in funds available,"" Ritz said. ""That’s why I keep telling the commissioners that we don’t need to worry about (increasing funding) when the state continues to do it for them.""

We’ll leave that statement aside for a potential future PolitiFact, although public-school advocates have a ready rejoinder. They point out that even while the county has stopped increasing school funding, revenues for county government have been steadily increased. Property tax revenue in 2008 was $675.1 million but is projected at $714.0 million for 2013 -- a 5.6 percent increase. So education funding as a percentage of the county budget has actually dropped.

Another point Ritz could have made (but didn't) -- enrollment has been dropping slightly in both systems. From 2008-09 to 2011-12, the combined ""weighted"" ADA for MCS and SCS did show a 3-percent drop, so that $361,288,000 in county funds got spread over slightly smaller systems. School officials like to point out, however, that education costs, like healthcare costs, escalate rapidly, though for the purposes of this item we'll point out that overall inflation from 2008 to 2012 was about 6.3 percent.

Expect this debate to continue -- the schools merger Transition Planning Commission’s plan shows a hole in the 2012-13 budget of $68 million, which happens to be equivalent to the funds that Memphis has been contributing in recent years to MCS. But Memphis’s funding, which had been required by courts based on the state’s maintenance-of-effort law, will go away for next fiscal year because MCS will be completely dissolved and its operations transferred to the county by July 1, 2013.

The TPC has recommended lobbying the city, the state and the county to provide money to patch that funding hole -- the city and state have each strongly indicated that will not happen. Jones knows that as well as anyone, and the county commission can expect to feel even more pressure going forward to increase school funding and fill the the budget hole for the new district.

Our ruling

 Ritz may well have a point -- schools officials do bemoan the static local funding even while receiving increases from its chief funding source, the state. But Jones is right -- because the county has not increased schools funding since the 2008 fiscal year, this 2013 fiscal year marks a sixth straight year the county has declined to increase its funding of schools.

Paul Sadler says Ted Cruz is unknown to vast majority of Texans
","
The night that Ted Cruz won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, the Democrats’ nominee characterized Cruz as an inexperienced man of mystery.

In his July 31, 2012, statement, former state Rep. Paul Sadler, who also won a runoff that night, said: ""Because of low turnout and outside money, a loud angry mob inside the Republican Party... nominated Ted Cruz who is untested, untried and unknown to the vast majority of Texans.""

Cruz, an attorney and the state’s former solicitor general, is making his first run for office. Voters can judge how tested and tried he is. 
Is it accurate to say he's widely unknown?

By telephone, Sadler said he was trying to underscore Cruz’s lack of a legislative voting record and his belief that ""we don’t know how he’ll react in the legislative process."" Cruz, he said, is unknown in that way.

""If that’s not said properly, I’ll concede that,"" Sadler said.

An alternative read of Sadler’s statement is that he was saying that Cruz is unknown, in all ways, to most Texans.

According to poll results, in contrast, Cruz’s name recognition grew in the months leading to his runoff against the previously front-running hopeful, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. In the run-up, those candidates and outside groups spent more than $35 million, according to a pre-runoff Texas Tribune analysis posted July 30, 2012.

Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning North Carolina firm, and the University of Texas/Texas Tribune each conducted relevant polls of voters.

In an April 2012 poll of 591 Texas voters, most of them Republican, Cruz had 41 percent name recognition, Public Policy Polling spokesman Tom Jensen told us by email.

Poll respondents were asked if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Cruz. Some 19 percent said favorable, 22 percent said unfavorable and 59 percent had no opinion. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.

So, a majority of voters may have then been unaware of Cruz, though a poll taken the next month, before Cruz finished second to Dewhurst in the May 29, 2012, primary, suggests Cruz’s profile was on the rise.  

In the May 2012 UT/Texas Tribune poll of 800 randomly selected registered voters, each respondent was asked ""whether you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of Ted Cruz."" Some 58 percent of the respondents, who were not just Republicans, had an opinion, while 42 percent said they did not know enough to have an opinion. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. (In the poll, 36 percent of respondents had an opinion of Sadler, 63 percent said they did not know enough about him to have one.)

UT professor Daron Shaw, who helped conduct the poll, told us by email that he is unaware of empirical evidence supporting Sadler’s claim.

Cruz became especially well known among active Republicans, later polls indicate.

An Ohio pollster, Fritz Wenzel, polled 600 likely Texas Republican runoff voters on behalf of Citizens United, a group backing Cruz. Wenzel told us by telephone that 93 percent of the respondents in the July 2012 poll had an opinion of Cruz, while 7 percent did not know enough to have one. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.98 percentage points.

Wenzel said it makes sense that likely GOP runoff voters are the most likely to know Cruz. ""The people least likely to know him are Democratic and independent voters, and we did not sample them,"" he said.

Still, Wenzel called Sadler’s claim ""badly overblown. (Cruz) is clearly known to most Republican voters and that is a universe that comprises at least close to, if not more than, half the Texas electorate. Republicans have not lost a statewide race since 1994.

Also in July, Public Policy Polling polled 665 likely Republican runoff voters; 85 percent had an opinion of Cruz with 53 percent favorable, 32 percent unfavorable. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

Broadly, PPP spokesman Jensen said, he imagines the current share of Texans familiar with Cruz falls between 41 and 85 percent -- ""in the 60s,"" he said, ""but I don’t know for sure.""

Our ruling

Sadler said Cruz is unknown to the vast majority of Texans. He told us this was a reference to Cruz’s lack of a legislative record, not his name recognition.

We’ll grant that intention, though Sadler’s claim did not read that way to us. The facts are that Cruz is widely known among Republican voters and may be known by around 60 percent of all voters.

This claim has an element of truth -- Cruz’s lack of a legislative record. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/20/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-ted-cruz-unknown-vast-majority-te/

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker gave raises to working prison inmates but not to prison employees, union leader says
","
Wisconsin state employees union leader Marty Beil is no fan of Gov. Scott Walker. And his criticism has not relented since Walker survived an historic recall election in June 2012.

Beil took aim at Walker on July 19, 2012 in an interview with John ""Sly"" Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host on WTDY AM-FM in Madison.

Walker ""raises the pay of inmates,"" Beil complained, ""but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.""

In 2011, Walker curbed state employees’ collective bargaining powers and cut their take-home pay by forcing them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance. He also put tighter restrictions on overtime for corrections workers.

But has the Republican governor increased the pay of inmates who work in prisons, yet not given raises to the officers who work there?

Beil's evidence

Beil is executive director of the Madison-based Council 24 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, which represents corrections officers and a variety of other state employees.

Asked for evidence to back his claim, he forwarded to us a May 2012 email from Lizzie Tegels, warden of the New Lisbon Correctional Institution, a 500-cell, medium-security prison 80 miles northwest of Madison.

It says the prison would no longer pay a lower wage to inmates during their first 60 days of work. Paying new inmate workers a few pennies per hour less during their probationary period costs more -- in staff time to adjust pay rates -- than if the inmates received the regular wage, the email said.

So, this isn’t giving any working inmates a pay raise. Rather, inmates new to working would get a higher starting wage than they would have previously, but only during their first two months on the job.

Beil told us the change wasn't occurring only at New Lisbon, but suggested we contact the Department of Corrections for details.

Since Beil's claim was aimed at Walker, we contacted the governor's office, as well as the Department of Corrections. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and DOC spokeswoman Linda Eggert confirmed that corrections employees have not received a general raise since Walker took office in January 2011.

Indeed, lawmakers in November 2011 imposed a two-year pay freeze on state employees, although merit raises can be given.

So, the second part of Beil’s claim, that corrections workers haven’t gotten any raises under Walker, is correct. 
DOC response 
As for inmate pay, the governor’s spokesman provided a response written by the office of Corrections Secretary Gary Hamblin.

According to the memo:

Wisconsin prisons can pay working inmates a lower wage during their probation period, but most don't; neither does Badger State Industries, which oversees the manufacturing of license plates and other goods made by inmates.

Eliminating the lower pay rate at New Lisbon means that current and future workers now start at the regular pay grade. That ranges from 9 to 42 cents an hour (and 1 to 20 cents through Badger State Industries). About 1,000 inmates work at New Lisbon, with about 20 to 25 on probationary status at any given time.

Eggert said DOC surveyed all prisons after we contacted her and found that none had given inmates any raises or eliminated lower probationary rates like New Lisbon did.

So, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job.

Our rating

Beil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, ""but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions."" Neither group, however, has received a pay raise.

The pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers.

Since Beil’s statement has only an element of truth, and leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/19/marty-beil/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-gave-raises-working-pri/

House Democrats support “gutting” Medicare by more than $700 billion to pay for a “big-government healthcare takeover,” Republicans claim
","
Republicans are once again attacking Congressional Democrats on Medicare spending cuts, using a line of attack that has been roundly discredited.

In a series of news releases dealing with the national health care reform law, the National Republican Congressional Committee on Aug. 14 claimed 37 House Democrats are ""willing to jeopardize seniors’ access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare"" to pay for a ""big-government healthcare takeover.""

Those Democrats include New Jersey Reps. Rush Holt, Frank Pallone and Bill Pascrell, all of whom voted for the reform in March 2010. They’re also up for reelection this November against GOP challengers.

PolitiFact National recently issued a Mostly False to presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney for claiming President Barack Obama ""robbed"" Medicare of $716 billion to pay for the reform.

By attacking the congressmen, the committee makes the same mistake as Romney, but then goes one step further in rehashing that myth about the reform being a government takeover.

First, we’ll talk about the reduction in Medicare spending.

Over the last couple of years, Republicans have frequently criticized the reform for cutting $500 billion from Medicare. U.S. Reps. Jon Runyan and Scott Garrett have each received Mostly False rulings for repeating that claim.

But the reform does not cut $500 billion from the current Medicare budget. Instead, the reform aims to slow the program’s future spending growth.

So, that $500 billion has represented the reduction in spending increases during the 2012-2021 period, according to a 2011 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

In its latest estimate released last month, the budget office said the reform would reduce future Medicare spending by $716 billion between 2013 and 2022. The $741 billion figure cited by the committee includes that Medicare spending and money for other federal programs.

Most of those Medicare savings come from reducing annual increases in payments to certain health care providers. The reduction in Medicare spending helps offset other costs created by the reform.

But the committee is wrong to claim Democrats support ""gutting"" Medicare. Program spending will still increase under the reform, but just at a slower pace.

Now, we’ll address whether the reform represents a ""big-government healthcare takeover.""

That claim has been debunked numerous times and was ultimately named PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. PolitiFact New Jersey issued a Pants on Fire to Gov. Chris Christie for repeating the line in October 2011.

The reform does impose more government regulations on individuals, employers and private insurance companies. For instance, people must purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty, with some exemptions. Also, insurers can sell coverage through new insurance exchanges as long as they meet certain federal standards.

But the reform does not create a new public health insurance plan, and it doesn’t eliminate the private health insurance industry. In fact, more people will become enrolled in private insurance plans under the reform, according to budget office projections.

In response to our findings, the committee didn’t back down from its original claims.

""Democrats stole from seniors’ Medicare benefits to pay for their government takeover of healthcare,"" NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said in an e-mail. ""Their addiction to government spending sprees has crossed the line by threatening seniors’ access to healthcare, and New Jersey families will stop this reckless behavior this November.""

Our ruling

In news releases, the committee claimed Holt, Pallone and Pascrell are ""willing to jeopardize seniors’ access to coverage by gutting $741 billion from Medicare"" to pay for a ""big-government healthcare takeover.""

The health care reform is projected to reduce future Medicare spending by more than $700 billion between 2013 and 2022, but program spending will still increase. That increase will just be smaller than without the reform.

The ""healthcare takeover"" claim remains bogus, because the private health insurance industry remains intact under the reform and stands to gain more enrollees.

There’s only one ruling for such heated and misleading claims: Pants on Fire!

U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a $525-billion tax hike on the middle class
","
Did U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who characterizes himself as a champion of the middle class, vote for a $525-billion tax increase on that group?

That's one assertion in a television ad by Republican challenger Barry Hinckley.

After raising an allegation about insider trading, which Whitehouse has strongly denied, the commercial says ""Whitehouse voted to raise taxes on middle-class families."" The phrase ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class"" flashes on the screen.

The commercial offers no further information about what Hinckley is talking about, so we asked the Hinckley campaign for its backup.

Campaign manager Patrick Sweeney said the ad refers to the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan often known as Obamacare, which Whitehouse supported. PolitiFact has examined similar claims, including one in which Hinckley declared that the law will ""add trillions of dollars in debt,"" a claim we ruled False.

The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation, designed to expand health coverage, will generate $525 billion in revenue. A lower estimate by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation predicted it will bring in more than $437.8 billion. Sweeney said the ad is using the CBO estimate.

But there are a few significant facts the ad doesn't mention.

First, that's not money raised over one year. It's over 10 years, from 2010 through 2019 for legislation that is being gradually phased in. In 2019, annual revenue is expected to have risen to $88.2 billion.

Second, most of the money won't be coming from the middle class, as the ad states.

For example, a huge chunk of the revenue, $210 billion of the $437.8 billion in the Joint Committee estimate, comes from both a higher Medicare payroll tax to be paid by individuals earning more than $200,000 a year ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) and from a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income if your income is already high.

Those take effect in 2013 and are taxes that middle class families will not see.

Other taxes aren't geared to the middle class either, although all taxpayers may have to foot the bill indirectly as the extra costs are factored into the goods and services they buy.

They include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers (which will raise an estimated $27 billion); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion); and a fee on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion).

In addition, there's the excise tax on indoor tanning services (expected to raise $2.7 billion) and the stricter limit on deducting medical expenses on tax returns, which is expected to raise $15.2 billion. Both will have a more direct effect on the well-tanned or very-ill middle class.

One other element of the law that will affect the middle class is the provision of Obamacare known as the individual mandate. It requires people to pay an annual penalty if they don't buy health insurance. It takes effect in 2014, starting off at a minimum of $95 for an individual and rising to $695 per year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that controversial provision by characterizing it as a tax, not a penalty.

Is this a tax/penalty on the middle class?

The CBO, the source used by the Hinckley campaign, has estimated that by 2016, 55 percent of the money collected via the individual mandate will come from people with incomes in the top 20 percent, which is a family of four making roughly $120,000 or more.

So less than half the money will be coming from middle class Americans.

How much money is involved?

About $4 billion in 2016. The amount coming from the middle class and lower class: roughly $1.8 billion.

To put that in perspective, $1.8 billion is 3 percent of the $57 billion or so Obamacare will be raising from everyone in 2016.

Our ruling

Barry Hinckley said Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class.""

The ad doesn't say that it's really talking about Obamacare, and that the money is designed to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured, many of whom are in the middle class.

It also doesn't point out that the $525 billion is spread out over 10 years, through 2019. Most of it doesn't come from the middle class.  

And of the $4 billion the government expects to collect each year from people who choose not to purchase health insurance, less than half will come from the middle class.

The claim in the Hinckley ad is so ridiculously off base, we rate it Pants on Fire!

Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern says Gov. John Kasich has power to force school board president to step aside
","
Re-posting an item from a friend on Facebook led to calls for the resignation of the president of the Ohio Board of Education, Debe Terhar.
Terhar, a Republican from Cincinnati, re-posted a photograph of Hitler with a caption reading: ""Never forget what this tyrant said: ‘To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens.’ — Adolf Hitler.""

The Columbus Dispatch, reporting the story, said the item originated ""with the Facebook page of Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which features a variety of anti-Obama, pro-gun posts and pictures.""

After the story appeared, Terhar removed the material, and then closed her Facebook page. She issued a statement saying she was not comparing President Obama to Hitler, had not researched the posted material and had made no comment on it.

A little research might have saved a lot of trouble.

Our friends at the myth-busting site Snopes.com could not find any source documenting the purported Hitler quote. Neither could Salon.com, which pointed us to a 2004 paper by University of Chicago law professor Bernard Harcourt. He found the quote ""is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered."" (Harcourt further noted that the Weimar government immediately before Hitler’s had tougher gun laws than the Nazi regime.)

Terhar, who is married to Ohio Rep. Lou Terhar, said in a statement that she regretted ""the consequences of carelessly sharing"" the posted material and would be ""more selective in my use of social media in the future.""

Gov. John Kasich said he saw no need for further action.

""It was clearly a mistake, and she says it was a mistake,"" he told the Dispatch from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. ""I’m glad that she’s come out and said she’s sorry about it, that it’s a mistake, and she’s not going to do it again.""

Ohio Democrats led calls for Terhar to resign. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern went further in a statement.

""In absence of a full, formal apology from Terhar,"" Redfern said, ""Kasich has a duty to remove his hand-picked state school board president from office.""

A subsequent email from Redfern that solicited letters to Kasich and the school board demanding Terhar's resignation carried the subject line, ""Tell Kasich: Fire Terhar!""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered if Kasich had the power to do that. We called Redfern's office.

A party spokesman, Jerid Kurtz, told us that Redfern understands Kasich has no direct formal power to remove Terhar, but Kasich does have a bully pulpit as the state's most visible and arguably most powerful public figure. The governor should issue a statement of no confidence, rather than his initial ""no comment,"" and can pressure Terhar to resign as president, Kurtz said for Redfern.

Kurtz noted that Kasich showed power over the board two years ago by forcing out Superintendent Deborah Delisle, who resigned, citing pressure from the governor’s office.

The state superintendent serves at the discretion of the board. Delisle said in a letter to board members that Kasich’s administration had informed her that a majority of the board would replace her if she did not step down. The same day, Terhar was elected board president by fellow board members with Kasich’s support, reversing the outcome of a vote two months earlier.

Using that example, one would conclude that if Kasich wanted Terhar gone from the president’s chair, he has the influence to make it happen.

Removing her from the board altogether would be a different matter.

The board is made up of 19 members. Eleven are elected on a district basis, and eight are appointed by the governor.

Terhar, self-described as ""an early participant in the Tea Party,"" is an elected member from Cincinnati representing Hamilton and Warren counties. She started her four-year term on Jan. 1, 2011, was elected board president in March 2011 and re-elected unanimously by the board to the post last month.

Her seat on the board is not among the positions subject to removal at the pleasure of the governor under the Ohio Revised Code.

Under the code and the state constitution, in fact, Ohio lacks any provision for the recall of state officials.

So what's the verdict here?

Terhar posted a bogus quotation and false history. Whether there should be consequences is a matter of opinion that we can't rate. That includes calls for her resignation.

Redfern's statement that Kasich ""has a duty to remove"" her, however, means that Kasich has the power to do so.

The Democratic Party spokesman, explaining Redfern’s remarks, said the call for Terhar’s resignation or removal extended only to her position as school board president, not as a board member. That’s an important distinction.

He acknowledged that Kasich does not have statutory control over the Board of Education, but he accurately cited Kasich’s forcing out of a state school superintendent as a demonstration of the governor’s power over the board.

We rate Redfern’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/feb/07/chris-redfern/ohio-democratic-party-chairman-chris-redfern-says-/

Women's group says Paul Ryan would ""outlaw in vitro fertilization”
","
While Paul Ryan’s views on fiscal policy and Medicare have dominated news coverage of his being picked as Mitt Romney’s running mate, liberal critics of the GOP ticket are also trying to portray Ryan as an extreme conservative.

One example is a five-point graphic released by UltraViolet, a group that seeks to ""expand women's rights and combat sexism."" The group was co-founded by Nita Chaudhary, the former national campaigns and organizing director at MoveOn.org Political Action, and Shaunna Thomas, the former executive director of the P Street Project, the lobbying arm of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

The graphic’s final claim is that Ryan would ""outlaw in vitro fertilization -- seriously. That same bill that outlaws some forms of birth control could also make in vitro fertilization illegal. Can't have kids naturally? Too bad.""

We wondered whether it was accurate to say that Paul Ryan would ""outlaw in vitro fertilization.""

The Sanctity of Human Life Act

In footnotes, the group cites the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which Ryan co-sponsored but which remains stalled in the House. (UltraViolet did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)

The bill, which is only three pages long, says that ""the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, and is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person; and the life of each human being begins with fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent, irrespective of sex, health, function or disability, defect, stage of biological development, or condition of dependency, at which time every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood.""

It goes on to say that ""Congress, each State, the District of Columbia, and all United States territories have the authority to protect the lives of all human beings residing in its respective jurisdictions.""

And it defines ""human"" and ‘""human being"" to include ""each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, beginning with the earliest stage of development, created by the process of fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent.""

We see two issues with the group’s claim that the bill Ryan co-sponsored would ""outlaw in vitro fertilization.""

First, the bill doesn’t specifically outlaw vitro fertilization -- in fact, it doesn’t even mention the procedure by name. Rather, any impact the law could have would be an indirect consequence of provisions that are primarily aimed at stopping abortion. Second, the bill wouldn’t necessarily affect in vitro fertilization by itself. The bill empowers states to enact legislation that protects human life from conception, but it doesn’t appear to force them to do so.

We’ll look at these two issues in order.

Medical questions

Even though the Sanctity of Human Life Act doesn’t specifically address in vitro fertilization, experts we interviewed said the law, if passed, could lead to severe restrictions on its practice.

In vitro fertilization was pioneered in the 1970s and is commonly used by some of the estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of couples who want to have a child but are having trouble getting pregnant. Typically, a number of eggs are fertilized to increase the likelihood of pregnancy, and only some may be transferred to the woman’s uterus. If unused fertilized eggs remain after the procedure is complete, doctors usually freeze the remaining embryos.

According to RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, the law would call into question the legality of these practices: ""If microscopic fertilized eggs/embryos are full humans, anything that puts an embryo at risk could be a criminal violation, even if its goal is the undeniable social good of helping someone have a baby."" For instance, the group asks, if a frozen embryo in a clinic doesn’t thaw successfully, would that put the practitioner at risk of prosecution?

""At a minimum, (the bill) would force changes in the practice of reproductive medicine (e.g., limitations on the number of eggs that may be fertilized) that are not in patients’ best interests and constitute inferior medical practice,"" RESOLVE said.

That’s why such groups as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, the American Academy of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys and all oppose ""personhood"" measures. So does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which says personhood laws ""would have wide-reaching harmful implications for the practice of medicine and on women's access to contraception, fertility treatments, pregnancy termination, and other essential medical procedures.""

Even if the bill doesn’t outlaw in vitro fertilization procedures directly, opponents say it could have a chilling effect on the profession. The mere introduction of criminal penalties into common and, according to the industry, essential practices could be enough to push some practitioners to quit rather than risk prosecution.

Bioethicists agreed that the bill, if it became law, would pose serious challenges for the procedure.

""If this law passed, it would not outlaw IVF, but it would make it next to impossible to do,"" said Arthur Caplan, who heads the division of medical ethics in the department of population health at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. ""It would not allow any destruction of embryos, and since nearly all IVF depends on the overproduction of embryos the law would drastically alter how IVF is done, raising the cost of doing it and hugely decreasing the success rate.""

I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, agreed. By his reading, a reproductive technology process that involved ""the destruction of a human species member after fertilization can be criminalized and treated equivalent to killing an already-born human being,"" Cohen said.

Legal questions

But while it’s clear that the traditional practice of in vitro fertilization could be severely affected if the bill became law, it’s too strong to say, as UltraViolet did, that the bill would ""outlaw in vitro fertilization.""

Outlawing the creation of embryos, the necessary first step, ""isn’t part of the bill,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.

Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, agreed. ""I could see this leading to prohibitions on destroying unwanted embryos created for the purpose of IVF, but I’m not sure why that would ban the practice entirely,"" Roosevelt said.

Another crucial point that UltraViolet’s graphic glosses over is that the bill would allow states to criminalize certain practices used with embryos, but it doesn’t appear to force them to do so.

Gualberto Garcia Jones, a lawyer and director of Personhood USA, which promotes ""personhood"" legislation, said that ""as a proponent of zero tolerance of abortion, I know that if this bill passed, we would have our work cut out in state legislatures to pass implementing legislation to deal with cases such as the destruction of embryonic human beings etc. Personhood USA fully supports reforming and regulating the in vitro industry. Unfortunately this bill doesn’t do that -- it’s a declaration, not a regulation.""

The most far-reaching possibility suggested by any of our legal experts was that the federal law might tie the hands of states in passing laws on embryo destruction, or put existing laws at risk. ""This looks to me as though Congress is defining personhood to begin at conception, regardless of what the states want to say, so it's forcing that characterization on them, and then their laws will have to be consistent with that definition,"" Roosevelt said.

Still, that interpretation is speculative and would probably have to be litigated in the courts. Meanwhile, it’s not even clear that the bill would pass judicial muster if it can be passed -- something it hasn’t come close to doing so far. Roosevelt said he thinks the law is ""probably not"" constitutional.

UltraViolet has a point that the bill Ryan backed could significantly alter the way in vitro fertilization is practiced. However, the group exaggerates when it says the bill in question would ""outlaw in vitro fertilization."" The bill doesn’t outlaw the procedure directly -- whatever impact it has would likely require action by states, which many states may be unwilling to undertake. And while the bill likely outlaws specific practices that have historically been considered important for practicing in vitro fertilization, it would not ban the procedure itself.

Texas legislator says Barack Obama says we're our brother's keeper while Kenyan relatives live in poverty
","
State Rep. Bill Zedler lofted a double-sided claim about Barack Obama the day the Democratic president raised money by stumping in Texas.

The Arlington Republican said in a July 17, 2012, Twitter post: ""While Obama preaches ‘we are our brother’s keeper,’ his brother & aunt live in real poverty in Kenya.""

Obama often says Americans should care for one another. He said in his weekly radio address of Nov. 24, 2011: ""This sense of mutual responsibility – the idea that I am my brother’s keeper; that I am my sister’s keeper – has always been a part of what makes our country special."" He revisited that sentiment in his radio address of Dec. 24, 2011 and in a Feb. 2, 2012, speech at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, a Feb. 28, 2012, address to the United Auto Workers and a March 30, 2012, campaign speech in Burlington, Vt.

And are the president’s brother and aunt impoverished in Kenya, as Zedler says?

Obama has no Kenyan brothers. But by email, Zedler told us he relied on an excerpt of an interview of Obama’s Kenyan half-brother, George Obama, by Dinesh D’Souza, a former policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan and author of a 2010 book, ""The Roots of Obama’s Rage."" George and Barack Obama had the same father.

Zedler said he learned of the aunt’s conditions from a Fox News report featuring D’Souza. On July 17, 2012,  D’Souza told Fox News host Sean Hannity that George Obama is living in ""third-world poverty... And Obama won’t lift a finger to help him,"" according to a transcript of the appearance we obtained via the Nexis database. D’Souza also told Hannity that Obama has an aunt, his late father’s sister, ""who as we speak is selling coal on the streets of Kenya for a couple dollars a day.""

A sizable share of Kenyans live in poverty. According to the Kenya section of the CIA’s ""World Factbook,"" 50 percent of the nation’s residents lived below the poverty line as of 2000. As of 2005, according to the World Bank, the share of Kenyans living under the nation’s poverty line was 46 percent.

For this article, we hunted for evidence that Obama’s half-brother and aunt live in poverty and that President Obama has not helped either one.

By email, D’Souza told us he was referring to Hawa Auma Obama, whose brother was the president’s father. D’Souza said his information originated in a 2011 book by reporter Sally H.Jacobs, ""The Other Barack,"" a biography of Obama’s father.

Jacobs writes in the book that Hawa Auma, a widow, lives in a Kenyan village where she ""spends most of her days sitting at the edge of the dirt road next to a pile of charcoal stubs that she sells"" for about 40 cents per 2-kilogram tin. The aunt delights in a set of glasses that then-Sen. Obama gave her; he also gave her about $140 when he visited in 2006, Jacobs writes. ""She wonders aloud if he will pay to get her teeth fixed,"" she writes.

D’Souza’s videotaped interview of George Obama, placed on YouTube July 10, 2012, is described by the Hollywood Reporter as folding into a soon-to-be released movie featuring D’Souza, ""2016: Obama’s America.""

In the interview, D’Souza tells George Obama that he had seen articles on CNN and elsewhere in the 2008 election year suggesting Barack Obama had not ""done anything to help you.""

""I think he has a family of his own,"" George Obama replies. ""He is supposed to help his family.""

D’Souza: ""...Don’t you think you’re part of his family?""

Obama: ""Yeah, I’m part of his family. But I’m over it. I can help myself.""

D’Souza: ""...Well, let me put it a different way. Recently, President Obama spoke and he was quoting from the famous story, of Cain and Abel, that we are our brother’s keeper.""

D’Souza asked George Obama: ""Now my point is, you are his brother. Has he been your keeper?""

Obama: ""Go ask him. He’s got other issues to deal with.""

D’Souza: ""Well, he’s taking care of the world, but don’t you start at home?""

Obama: ""Yeah, he’s taking care of the world. So he’s taking care of me. I’m part of the world."" Obama then agreed the president doesn’t have to help him directly.

D’Souza told the Hollywood Reporter that he met George Obama at a Nairobi hotel and they spent about 12 hours together. D’Souza is also quoted saying George Obama ""lives in rubble on a few dollars a day while his powerful, multi-millionaire brother doesn't lift a finger to help him."" By email, D’Souza told us that George Obama told him he lives on around $10 a month.

In D’Souza’s 2010 book on the president, he writes that he read a 2008 London Telegraph news article on George Obama which showed him standing outside a ramshackle hut on Nairobi’s outskirts.

That Aug. 20, 2008, Telegraph article actually summarizes an article in the Italian edition of Vanity Fair magazine, which said that George Obama, then 26, had met his American half-brother twice -- once when he was a youngster and again in 2006 when Barack Obama visited Nairobi.

In his 2010 book, ""Homeland,"" George Obama wrote that he was nervous about the 2006 visit with his half-brother, who was then a U.S. senator. ""I was the kid from the slum, the Obama son who had been a gangster and served time,"" he wrote, adding that they greeted each other and shook hands toward the end of a family gathering. He wrote, too, that the pair lacked time for a conversation stretching to issues in the ""ghetto"" that he and others were trying to address. In the book, he said he briefly saw his half-brother again at a Nairobi hotel and the senator said he would call to chat longer, but no call came.

As Obama won the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, George Obama said he agreed to be interviewed by a European journalist -- evidently the one who wrote the article for the Italian Vanity Fair.

The Vanity Fair article, as recapped by the Telegraph, quoted George Obama as saying: ""No-one knows who I am. I live here on less than a dollar a month."" An accompanying photo is captioned: ""George Hussein Onyango Obama, Sen. Barack Obama's long lost brother, was tracked down living in a hut on the outskirts of Nairobi.""

George Obama wrote in his book that he was photographed standing in the gateway of his late aunt’s home. He added: ""No one could live on a dollar a day, let alone on three and a half cents a day, not even a Nairobi ghetto-dweller like me."" He lives in a slum, Obama conceded, but did not resent that or feel his brother should do something about his situation. ""No way,"" George Obama wrote.

In the book, Obama further wrote that he later told a CNN reporter, David McKenzie: ""I was brought up well; I live well even now."" He said he did a similar interview with the London Times; an Aug. 22, 2008, article is available to paying readers on the Times’ website.

D’Souza’s book says a 2008 CNN report -- perhaps the one mentioned in his interview of George Obama -- confirmed the Telegraph’s account.

That’s not entirely so. The Oct. 22, 2008, CNN report describes George Obama as angered by the Italian Vanity Fair article.  ""I was brought up well. I live well even now,"" CNN reported Obama as saying. ""The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges.""

So, while George Obama lives in a slum, there are no indications he has been waiting for his half-brother to bail him out.

For another observer’s take, we asked Washington Post journalist David Maraniss, who travelled to Kenya while researching his 2012 book on Barack Obama’s roots, about Zedler’s claim.

Maraniss replied that the president has many Kenyan relatives with ""varying economic circumstances."" He said he did not visit George Obama.

Separately, we emailed the White House about Zedler’s claim, drawing no reply.

Our ruling

President Obama, who often refers to being our brother’s keepers, has a half-brother, George Obama, living in a Nairobi slum and, as of 2011, a Kenyan aunt who sold charcoal by the road.

The president gave the aunt some money in 2006, according to Jacobs’ account. There appears to be no sign of his otherwise helping his aunt or half-brother.

Finally, Zedler's statement implies the president is not addressing distant family needs. That’s at least slightly misleading in that the half-brother has said he doesn’t expect such aid. Notably, too, there appear to be no signs of the president revealing that he is or is not privately pitching in.

"['Oregon', 'Kate Brown']","
Is Oregon's secretary of state a three-for-one steal?
","
Oregon’s Secretary of State Kate Brown likes to talk about saving money. The last time we checked out something she said, she was touting the savings her audit division had dug up.

More recently, she talked about what a steal Oregon’s secretary of state position is, noting that it’s basically three jobs in one.

""Our neighbor to the north, the state of Washington, they elect a lieutenant governor, a secretary of state and a state auditor,"" Brown said in a May television interview. ""I basically do all three of those jobs for less than the price of one of them.""

This wasn’t the first time we’d heard Brown say something along these lines, so we thought it was worth checking out.

To be sure, Brown’s position as secretary of state is unique. She’s the only secretary of state in the nation who oversees an audit division -- we got that verified by Leslie Reynolds, the executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State. (Her source was the 2010 Book of the States, which we also double checked.)

Oregon is also one of five states that don’t have a lieutenant governor -- and one of three in which the secretary of state is next in line in case of a vacancy.

We also did a quick salary check to see if Brown has her numbers right, and it seems she does, according to public documents from both states.

Excluding benefits and such, Brown makes $72,000 a year as Oregon’s secretary of state. Meanwhile, Washington pays its state auditor $116,950 a year, its lieutenant governor $110,831 and its secretary of state $119,222.

Now that all seemed fair, but we wondered whether Brown really picks up all the slack for those two missing positions. That’s a little less clear.

Let’s start with the lieutenant governor position. We called up Brian Dirks, the spokesman for Washington’s Lt. Gov. Brad Owen. Dirks said the office only has two constitutional duties: Filling in for the governor in her absence and serving as president of the state senate.

In Oregon, Brown is responsible for the first, but not the second. Sen. Peter Courtney is the president of Oregon’s Senate -- he has been for nearly a decade. Dirks also noted that Owen sits on 15 to 20 different committees, including the state finance committee, and focuses on both international relations and economic development. Those sorts of things are not part of Brown’s job.

Next up was the state auditor. We made a call to Mindy Chambers, the spokeswoman for Washington State Auditor Brian Sonntag, who explained that the state auditor doesn’t actually do much auditing himself. Instead, he ""sets the overall tone for the office."" He also assigns special projects, speaks publicly on behalf of the auditing office and works on open-government issues.

In Oregon, Brown does oversee the audit division and she’s responsible for selecting its director -- currently Gary Blackmer -- but beyond that she doesn’t have much of a role.

Blackmer seems to us to be the better foil for Washington’s Sonntag. Like Sonntag, he doesn’t actually perform audits, but he does put together a list of proposed audits. Blackmer also keeps track of what’s happening with the given audits moving through the division. His day is filled with meetings, budget discussions, editing duties and several other responsibilities. He also pulls in double what Brown makes a year -- and more than any of the Washington officials.

To be fair, Blackmer runs his list of proposed audits by Brown for her approval. She also says she selected him specifically because he ""understood my vision for the office."" Specifically, Oregon had a strong fiscal auditing history before Brown was elected, so she made it a point to have Blackmer beef up the performance audit side.

So, when Brown said she’s a threefer, essentially doing in one role what Washington elects three people to do, she’s technically correct. She selects the chief auditor, she is typically seen as the de facto lieutenant governor and, of course, she is Oregon’s secretary of state.

But once you drill down to specific duties, that statement is less accurate. You’ll find that she doesn’t exactly do in Oregon what the lieutenant governor does in Washington, other than potentially filling in for the governor. You’ll also note that the state audit director has a much more hands-on supervisory role than does Brown.

In terms of the finances, the savings are also dubious. If you don’t count what our Senate president makes -- less than $40,000 a year -- Brown and Blackmer come at a cost of $216,000 to the state. Washington pays out $345,000 for its three officials. That’s not exactly a one-for-three deal.

Brown says she uses the threefer pitch mostly as a way to indicate that Oregon has a lean state government. ""I think it's fair to say the three for one is not an apples to apples comparison,"" she said. ""I think it's particularly compelling in that it sort of lets Oregonians know what a lean sort of operating machine Oregon state government is when you compare us to other states.""

We think her general gist is accurate, Oregon gets by with fewer elected officials. But the statement that she does three jobs for the price of one ignores some critical facts that would give a different impression.

Kinky Friedman says Texas is 1st in business climate, 49th in education
","
Still got your ""Kinky for Governor: How Hard Could It Be?"" t-shirt? Humorist, author and singer Kinky Friedman told the Dallas Morning News he’s considering another run.

In an Aug. 1, 2012, commentary, Morning News political writer Wayne Slater quoted Friedman as saying that Gov. Rick ""Perry has created a state that’s first in business climate and 49th in education. What’s wrong with that picture?""

Friedman ran for governor as an independent in 2006 and for Texas agriculture commissioner as a Democrat in 2010. This time, he told Slater, he’d go after Perry’s job as a Democrat and with a more serious approach.

By email, we interviewed Friedman spokesman Cleve Hattersley, who worked on the 2006 gubernatorial campaign.

Hattersley said Friedman was referring to a recent ""business climate"" ranking from CNBC and state education spending rankings from the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers’ union. He sent us an NEA report plus a Huffington Post news story and an education professor’s blog analysis with more numbers, and noted, ""Kinky has no campaign staff and no fact-checking apparatus, so he was speaking somewhat anecdotally … His numbers may have been a bit off.""

The rationale for evaluating Texas education based on spending, Hattersley said, is ""that spending affects education on every level, and does so far into the future. Everything from teachers to textbooks is affected.""

We set out to check Friedman’s measures and give context with other rankings. We set aside the Perry part of the claim; PolitiFact has found many times that governors don’t merit sole credit or blame for the state of a state.

As to business climate, the picture’s pretty clear. Texas is tops: 
On education, Hattersley pointed us to five tables in the NEA’s December 2011 report on education spending in 2008-09. The five rankings he cited are based on varied ways to calculate per-student spending from state, local and federal sources combined. Texas averages 41st on those five lists, Hattersley (correctly) noted.

The Oct. 10, 2011, Huffington Post news story Hattersley sent us cited a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (which analyzed data from the National Center for Education Statistics). Looking at state budgets only, the report ranked Texas 3rd in percentage cuts of education spending and 7th in dollars cut. Flipping the rankings to make comparison easier, Texas would have been 47th and 43rd on lists ranking states by the smallest cuts in state funding.

The blog post Hattersley cited is an Oct. 4, 2010, entry on the personal blog of Rutgers University Graduate School of Education professor Bruce Baker. Texas averaged 43rd on the post’s five bar charts analyzing 2007-08 state and local spending per student.

We checked some other measures as well: 
Because Friedman’s claim referred to ""education"" rather than specifying ""education spending,"" we looked up a few student performance measures as well.
 
Texas placed between 12th and 39th on these lists and was near national SAT averages: 

We also looked at ""adequate yearly progress,"" a measure that’s been in the news recently as data for the 2011-12 school year emerges. States are required by the federal No Child Left Behind Act to assess such progress, but each state sets its own standards and benchmarks.

An Aug. 8, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story said the Texas Education Agency reported 44.2 percent of schools met the state’s ""adequate yearly progress"" standards.

How does that compare with other states? We found 2011 state-by-state percentages calculated by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center on Education Policy, though deputy director Diane Stark Rentner warned us not to use them for a ""ranking,"" noting again that each state sets its own standards. Recklessly we plunged ahead, using the center’s collection of data for 2011 (when TEA reported 66 percent of Texas schools hit the mark) to generate our own statistically silly list, on which Texas placed 11th. But again: This compares oranges to apples.

Hattersley acknowledged that the backup he provided doesn’t substantiate Friedman’s claim on Texas education. But according to the Morning News interview, we can expect better-researched positions if The Other Man in Black launches a fresh gubernatorial bid.

Would a more serious campaign mean no more ""He Ain’t Kinky, He’s My Governor"" stickers? ""The discussions to which I have been privy are quite serious,"" Hattersley told us, ""but good slogans have always been players in political campaigns.""

Our ruling

Friedman nailed the state’s No. 1 business ranking. But his claim that Texas is 49th in education lacks supporting evidence. That said, Texas usually lands in the bottom half of the states, according to education spending and student achievement measures.

Austin group says Austin is the biggest U.S. city lacking City Council members elected from geographic districts
","
A handout making the case for electing Austin City Council members from small-scale districts rather than continuing to elect each one citywide says: ""Geographic representation brings government and people together.""

We don’t know how to check that. But our attention was drawn to the next bullet point on the leaflet paid for by Austinites for Geographic Representation: ""Austin is the largest city in the U.S. or Texas with no geographic representation.""

Once we sorted out what that means, we wondered if it was so.

Austin’s council consists of the mayor and six members, each one elected citywide. But Austin voters on Nov. 6, 2012, will be offered two plans that would change how council members are elected. One, put on the ballot by the council, would lead to eight members elected from districts with the mayor and two members elected citywide, according to an Aug. 7, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article, The other proposal, which made the ballot after Austinites for Geographic Representation collected more than 20,000 petition signatures, would result in 10 district-elected representatives with the mayor chosen by citywide vote.

According to the story, a district plan must get more than half the vote to pass. If both plans clear that hurdle, the one with the most votes would take effect.

We asked the group for backup on the leaflet claim, and volunteer Art Olbert told us that he earlier checked how city councils are elected in the bigger cities by looking up each city government online. At our request, Olbert replicated his work by starting from a U.S. Census breakdown of the nation’s most populous cities showing that as of July 2011, Austin ranked 13th, with 820,611 residents. Olbert shortly sent us his chart indicating that in the cities bigger than Austin, including three Texas cities, at least some council members are elected from geographic districts.

We confirmed that analysis by visiting his cited sites or similar ones.

Upshot: The larger-than-Austin U.S. cities of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis all elect all or some council members from districts. (In Texas, too, Fort Worth and El Paso elect council members from single-member districts.)

Eight of the other cities elect council members solely from districts, while the other cities -- Houston, Philadelphia, Jacksonville and Indianapolis -- elect most members from districts, choosing a few at large. Our detailed counts are posted here.

Each of the dozen U.S. cities bigger than Austin has a city council with members elected from geographic districts -- and eight solely elect members from districts.

ACLU says Rick Scott ""won't tell"" 13,000 ex-felons that they can vote
","
Florida has faced heat for how it handles restoring the rights of felons -- an issue with partisan and racial undertones. A disproportionate number of felons are black and blacks lean Democratic. Who has a right to vote is a pressing concern a few months before the Nov. 6 presidential election.  

The ACLU of Florida sent an email to supporters Aug. 3 sounding alarm bells and suggesting that thousands of ex-felons have been disenfranchised due to ""suppression tactics"" by the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott. The headline of the email stated: ""13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won’t tell them.""

Here is part of the body of the email:

""... Because of a public records request we sent last week, we discovered thousands of rights restoration notifications sitting in storage in Tallahassee having never reached their intended recipients. As a result, there are over 13,000 Floridians who have regained the right to vote, but haven't registered to vote because they may not know that they can.""

The email later continued, saying that Scott ""won't even help the Parole Commission inform citizens that their voting rights have been restored. There were no public announcements from the governor's office to let people know these letters existed, and no effort to allocate enough resources to help the underfunded Parole Commission. These critical documents are simply gathering dust.""

There are a lot of claims in that email but the one we wanted to check was the headline: Are there 13,000 Floridians able to vote but Scott won’t tell them?

Restoration of rights changes under Crist

In 2007, then-Gov. Charlie Crist said that the civil rights restoration process was too cumbersome, and he led the effort to allow non-violent criminals to get their rights restored without hearings if they completed their sentences and paid restitution if required.

The change meant that 80 percent of ex-felons were eligible to get their rights restored without applying. (Felons lose their voting privileges in Florida.) Starting in April 2007, the Florida Parole Commission sent about 89,300 ex-felons certificates telling them their voting rights had been restored.

""The last printed certificates were sent in September 2008,"" said Jane Tillman, spokeswoman for the Florida Parole Commission. ""We sent 6,000 of them. We had a pizza party late in the night stuffing and licking envelopes.""

But the parole commission didn’t always know where to send the correspondence telling ex-felons they could now vote. The commission relied on the last address the former inmates provided to the Department of Corrections, but some people had gotten out of prison years -- even decades -- ago.

About 35,000 of the certificates were returned undeliverable starting in 2007 through March 2011.

If a letter was returned with a forwarding address it was resent, Tillman said. Starting around 2011, the commission checked state drivers' license records in an effort to find updated addresses.

The state was able to track down about half of the remaining list, leaving 17,604 undeliverable by the spring of 2011. Those undeliverable certificates have been sitting in boxes at the parole commission’s office in Tallahassee. (Tillman said nearly all of them are restoration of civil rights but about 5 percent are for something different, such as pardons.)

The ACLU picked up on the 17,604 yet-to-be-delivered certificates as part of a public records request. After comparing that list of names to a statewide voter database, the group found 13,517 people who were eligible to vote still hadn’t registered. That is the genesis of their claim.

 The letter is not needed to register to vote

The certificate itself doesn’t mean an ex-felon is automatically registered to vote, and an ex-felon doesn’t need to have a letter in order to register to vote. Ex-felons whose voting rights have been restored simply have to go through the typical process of registering to vote in their home county.

In Broward County, elections registration officials don’t ask for a copy of the certificate but will accept it if the person brings it, said spokeswoman Mary Cooney said. If an ex-felon tells elections officials that he isn’t certain if his rights have been restored, county officials will check the Parole Commission Office of Executive Clemency’s website.

The Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections office provided a similar account of the steps they take to register such voters. Spokeswoman Christina White said if the clemency office website doesn’t show the applicant’s rights have been restored, her office gives the applicant the website, email and phone number for the clemency office.

We read the ACLU’s claim to Reggie Garcia, a longtime clemency attorney based in Tallahassee. Garcia argues cases before the governor, so he has a reason not to criticize Scott. But he said Crist’s initiative was well publicized and that if someone wants to become a voter, the ex-felon could make an effort to get in touch with the parole commission.

""I don’t think it's Gov. Scott’s fault that the (commission) has now tried at least two, maybe three times, that … (they) can’t reach 20 percent of the people because of passage of time, mobility, change of addresses,"" he said. Garcia also said it's not unusual for someone leaving prison to change their address multiple times within their first year of leaving prison.

It’s also possible, of course, for people on the list to be dead, to have moved out of state or simply not want to registered to vote.

An important note: The voting rules for ex-felons changed in 2011. In February 2011, newly elected Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi said it was too easy for felons to get their rights restored. One month later Bondi, Scott and the rest of the all Republican Cabinet adopted new rules making it harder for ex-felons to vote, including getting rid of any automatic restoration of rights and adding a minimum of a five-year waiting period to apply -- a process that can take years. Since then, only 175 felons have had their rights restored.

A second important note: The people who received a certificate -- or those who have one sitting in Tallahassee -- are eligible to vote under the old rules unless they lost that right because they re-offended.

Our ruling

The ACLU said in the headline of an email, ""13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor  won't tell them.""

But the state has tried to reach those potential voters using the address information at their disposal. In 2007 and 2008, the parole commission sent the ex-felons a certificate based on the last address they provided to the state Department of Corrections. When about 35,000 letters were returned undeliverable, the commission re-sent letters and cut that number in half.

Also, the ACLU is blaming Scott for an issue that seems largely beyond his control. Some of the 13,000 could have moved out of state or died. And it’s possible some of the 13,000 don’t want to register to vote.

Lastly, the certificate isn’t necessary to register to vote. Ex-felons can check to see if their rights were restored on the commission’s website, calling the commission or asking for help from their local supervisor of elections.

We rate this claim False.

"['Abortion', 'Wisconsin', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says Ryan supports banning all abortions
","
The day after Republican Mitt Romney announced Paul Ryan as his running mate, President Barack Obama’s campaign tweeted a gender-specific warning about the Wisconsin vice presidential pick.

""Make sure the women in your life know: Paul Ryan supports banning all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest.""

The @BarackObama account has 18 million followers, and the Ryan abortion comment was widely circulated through more than 6,000 re-tweets. It’s one piece of the campaign’s effort to court the vote of women.

The Obama claim has a familiar ring: his campaign ran an ad in July 2012 saying Romney ""backed a bill that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.""

PolitiFact National rated that claim Pants on Fire, because Romney had made clear he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.

But what about Ryan, the newly-minted vice presidential candidate?

The seven-term congressman has taken a consistent anti-abortion stand -- National Right to Life says he has never voted against its position in 13 years -- that has earned him 100% ratings from anti-abortion groups and 0% ratings from abortion-rights organizations.

News coverage of Ryan’s first congressional race in 1998, as well as statements he made to the National Right to Life Committee, a leading anti-abortion group, show Ryan has taken a stricter anti-abortion view than Romney.

The only anti-abortion exception Ryan favors is situations where an abortion is needed to save the life of the mother, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The National Right to Life Committee concurs, based on information the group says it collected in 1998 and 2000 from Ryan as a candidate.

So the Obama ad correctly claims that Ryan opposes abortions in cases of rape and incest.

But the tweet also says Ryan ""supports banning all abortions.""

That appears to go too far.

From his first campaigns, in 1998 and in 2000, Ryan has said he supports an exception to any abortion ban for when the life of the mother is at risk. Abortions in such cases are rare, but they do occur.

The Obama campaign argues Ryan has been inconsistent on that point, saying Ryan does not back that exemption in cases involving a procedure known as ""partial birth"" abortion. They point to a quote from Ryan in his 1998 campaign, from a Kenosha News story, that he supports an ""unqualified"" ban on late-term abortions. 
But we found strong evidence that Ryan has favored a life exception in partial-birth cases, including an Oct. 30, 1998 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. Ryan's campaign told us he favors the life exception in those cases, and the National Right to Life Committee says it believes that is his position based on its surveys over the years. 
The partial-birth abortion ban enacted in 2003 was written with a life-of-the-mother exception. Ryan voted for that law. 
As for Ryan’s current views, there is no indication they have changed. Since entering Congress, Ryan has focused on budget and fiscal issues so his views on abortion and social issues have not received much attention. 
Other evidence

There is another, more recent, piece of information to consider.

Ryan is among 64 House Republicans who co-sponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act, an anti-abortion bill that declares that human life shall be deemed to begin at fertilization, and should be protected from that point.

The legislation, which has stalled, reflects the budding movement -- endorsed by Ryan -- to enact ""personhood"" rights for the unborn.

It would weaken the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision by ""giving back the right to individual states to outlaw abortion,"" according to Gualberto Garcia Jones, legal analyst for Personhood USA.

Abortion-rights advocates say the measure would go further. It would nullify Roe v. Wade and create legal uncertainty about abortions, said Donna Crane of NARAL Pro-Choice America.

Neither side in this debate, though, claims the measure would immediately outlaw abortions. That would be up to Congress and/or individual states in subsequent legislation, if the Human Life Act holds up in the courts.

And the measure does not deal with what exceptions -- if any -- would be allowed. It leaves that up to states or Congress to decide.

Some legal observers, such as Harvard University’s I. Glenn Cohen say, that the measure’s declarations -- the right to life ""is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person"" and ""every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood"" -- can be read as hostile to the life of the mother exception.

Our conclusion

President Obama, through a campaign tweet, pegged Paul Ryan as supporting a ban on abortions, ""even in cases of rape or incest.""

Ryan does oppose those exceptions. Obama’s Twitter claim misfires in saying Ryan supports banning ""all"" abortions. He has supported an exception when a mother’s life is at stake.

That’s an important detail that is left out. We rate Obama’s claim Half True. 
Editor's Note: This item was changed on Oct. 26, 2012 to correct the record on Paul Ryan's position on exceptions to a partial-birth abortion ban. That National Right to Life Committee pointed out an inconsistency between our our original description of Ryan's position and the documentation cited in the item. After further reporting, we have changed the item to reflect that Ryan has supported an exception to the ban in cases where the life of the mother is in danger. Such an exception was written into the partial-birth abortion law passed in 2003.",/factchecks/2012/aug/17/barack-obama/obama-says-ryan-supports-banning-all-abortions/

Mitt Romney says Joe Biden once claimed coal was more dangerous than terrorists
","
Ohio looms large in this year's presidential race, but Mitt Romney staged an Aug. 14 campaign rally in one of its smallest and poorest places, the village of Beallsville.

Its population is about 400, the median household income is about $23,000, or roughly half the state average. It once gained fame for having the highest per-capita number of residents killed in the Vietnam War of any community in the country. Six men were killed, from its then-population of 475.

Beallsville is also in the heart of southeastern Ohio's Appalachian coal country.

With a group of miners serving as his backdrop, Romney accused President Obama of ""waging war on coal"" through his energy policies.

""His vice president said coal is more dangerous than terrorists,"" Romney said. ""Can you imagine that? This tells you precisely what he (Obama) actually feels and what he's done and his policies over the last three and a half years have put in place the very vision he had when he was running for office.""

Did Vice President Biden really compare coal to terrorism? PolitiFact Ohio was interested.

Romney's campaign told us that the support for Romney's claim was s 2007 interview on HBO’s ""Real Time With Bill Maher."" The video clip has been making the rounds on the Internet for years.

Maher asked Biden, who was then a candidate for the 2008 presidential nomination, what he thought ""is more likely to contribute to the death of your average American: a terrorist strike or high-fructose corn syrup and air that has too much coal in it?""

Biden responded: ""Air that has too much coal in it, corn syrup next, then a terrorist attack, but -- that is not in any way to diminish the fact that a terrorist attack is real. It is not an existential threat to bringing down the country, but it does have the capacity, still, to kill thousands of people. But hundreds of thousands of people die and their lives are shortened because of coal plants, coal-fired plants and because of corn syrup.""

Biden was not volunteering a comparison between coal-fired pollution and terrorism, nor was he speculating about ""danger."" He was answering a direct question about likely causes of death.

And, his comment about coal and air pollution was accurate.

The American Lung Association issued a report last year, ""Toxic Air,"" which documented the range of hazardous air pollutants emitted from coal-burning power plants. It called for the installation of cleanup technology as the most effective way to reduce them.

""Coal-fired power plants produce electricity for the nation’s power grid, but they also produce more hazardous air emissions than any other industrial pollution sources,"" the report said. ""Their emissions threaten the health of people who live near these plants, as well as those who live hundreds of miles away.""

The Lung Association report said, ""Particle pollution from power plants is estimated to kill approximately 13,000 people a year.""

A similar report with essentially the same conclusion was issued six months earlier for a study commissioned by the Clean Air Task Force, a national nonprofit research and advocacy organization dedicated to air quality and environmental issues.

""Fine particle pollution from existing coal plants is expected to cause nearly 13,200 deaths in 2010,"" the analysis found. ""Additional impacts include an estimated 9,700 hospitalizations and more than 20,000 heart attacks per year.""

The comprehensive study was the third commissioned by the organization, which maintains that adding pollution control technologies to power plants ""is not just good for public health; it is also good for the nation’s economy.""

Possibly because the latest study found that ""coal plant emissions of key particle-forming pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) have declined significantly over the last several years,"" its estimate of 13,200 deaths ""compares to an estimate of nearly 24,000 deaths per year from existing plants in the 2004 study.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that a proposed air-transport rule to curb sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from coal-fired power plants would save 14,000 to 36,000 lives a year and help prevent 21,000 cases of bronchitis and 23,000 heart attacks.

The lowest of those one-year estimates for the United States is larger than the 2011 worldwide total of deaths, 12,533,  that the National Counterrorism Center attributes to terrorism, which U.S. law defines as ""premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.""

According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) and its Global Terrorism Database (GTD), 2,997 people died in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  More people died in the 9/11 attacks than in all other U.S. terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2010.

Since the 9/11 attacks and through 2010, the most recent year with verified statistics in the GTD, ""the total number of individuals killed in attacks in the U.S. is 32,"" the consortium told us. ""Twenty-eight of the 32 were U.S. citizens. The nationalities of the others is unknown.

""There were no fatalities (from) 2003 to 2007,"" the year in which Biden gave his comment.
(High-fructose corn syrup is not relevant here. It was not part of Romney's statement, and it was grouped with air pollution as a single unit by the wording of Maher's question, ""terrorist strike or high-fructose corn syrup and air."")

What does this stack up to?

There is an element of truth in Romney's statement. Biden did say -- accurately -- that coal-fired air pollution is more likely to contribute to the death of an average American than is terrorism.

But Romney portrayed Biden’s remark as part of ""waging war on coal.""

Rather, PolitiFact found that Biden previously has voiced support for ""clean coal,""  calling for ""carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will allow us to use coal cleanly"" in the energy plan he released during his presidential campaign in 2007. ""Clean coal"" is not a type of coal; the phrase refers to a number of technologies, some in use and others early in the development stage, which would allow the burning of coal for energy without the harmful pollution that coal-fired power plants currently emit.

Biden's statement was made in response to a question and he was addressing health impacts of coal-fired air pollution -- not making a statement about coal or coal energy. He was not making a comparison between terrorism and coal. Yet, Romney’s comment implies that was the case and portrays Biden’s comment was as part of an administration policy against the coal industry.

Those are critical facts that Romney’s claim ignores would give the listener a different impression.

On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/aug/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-joe-biden-once-claimed-coal-was-m/
