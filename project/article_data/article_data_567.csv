Pundit: Vendors have been forced to participate in same-sex marriages under threat or even jail
","Let’s step away for a moment from the political implications of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage and fast-forward straight to the wedding day: What does it mean for those who make the white-tiered frosted wedding cake, arrange the bouquet tossed by the bride, or snap the ""I Do"" pics? Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, said on CBS’ Face the Nation a few days after the ruling that such wedding vendors have already been ""forced"" to serve same-sex couples. ""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail. I can't think of anything that's more un-American than that. ... "" Host Bob Schieffer responded: ""How is it that bakers and florists are being forced to participate in this? I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here."" Perkins replied: ""Well, we're seeing in Washington state, Colorado, and some of the other states that have these anti-discrimination statutes that are being imposed, that when a same-sex couple comes and says, ‘I want you to take pictures of my wedding,’ or ‘I want you to bake a cake.’ And they say, ‘Look, my religious convictions will not allow me participate in that,’ they're literally being sued by the government, not the individuals, and they've even been adjudicated in such places as New Mexico. So we're going to see a loss of religious freedom. There is no question about it. It's already happening."" Have there been bakers who have laid down their wire whisks and refused to bake a cake for a gay couple and hauled off to jail? A florist nervously piecing together a floral arrangement under the threat of a cop? We decided to investigate. State anti-discrimination laws used in some legal challenges In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a section of the Defense of Marriage Act that bars federal benefits for married same-sex couples, and it dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage. The Prop 8 ruling means that same-sex couples in California can now get married again, but neither ruling makes gay marriage legal in every state -- currently 12 states allow gay marriages. While same-sex marriage laws can include exemptions for religious clergy who don’t want to officiate such unions, there aren’t typically exemptions for wedding vendors. So it’s possible for gay couples to take legal action against wedding vendors who refused to serve them if there are state or local anti-discrimination laws in place that include sexual orientation. About 21 states have such, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for gay rights. (Florida isn’t one of them, although some counties or cities have such laws.) ""These nondiscrimination laws say you cannot refuse to serve a couple because of sexual orientation,"" said Sarah Warbelow, an attorney and state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign. ""If you are a photographer and a same-sex couple comes to you and says we want to employ you, the photographer for whatever event -- whether it's a marriage ceremony, commitment ceremony or whether it’s a birthday party -- the laws of those states state you cannot refuse them on basis of sexual orientation."" Each state can have their own process and penalties -- the ones we reviewed are generally heard before a civil rights or human rights commission. It’s theoretically possible a vendor who lost such a lawsuit could face jail if they refused to comply with the order, but Warbelow said, ""I’ve never heard of anyone actually going to jail."" Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado The Family Research Council directed us to multiple cases, including one particular case that they argue includes the threat of jail: Masterpiece Cakeshop. In 2012, a gay couple visited the suburban Denver shop in search of a cake for a Colorado celebration following their Massachusetts wedding. After the cake shop refused, the ACLU initiated a complaint on behalf of the two men. The Colorado attorney general’s office later filed a formal complaint which will be heard before the state’s civil rights commission in September. The owner has said, ""We would close down the bakery before we would compromise our beliefs."" The cake shop’s lawyer, Nicolle Martin, has said if the owner loses he could face up to a year in jail. In the meantime, though, the Colorado Legislature has taken action to repeal the criminal penalties for discrimination in places of public accommodations, which had included up to a year in jail and/or a $300 fine. The provision had never been used, and the repeal coincided with legislators passing a civil unions bill. We reached bill co-sponsor state Sen. Pat Steadman, D-Denver, who told us that the repeal officially goes into effect in August, and he didn’t believe that a prosecutor would use that part of the law in the last month that it remains on the books. ""A D.A. has to choose to file misdemeanor charges,"" Steadman said. ""It never happened. It never will."" However, since the Masterpiece Cakeshop incident occurred in 2012, Martin said it’s still possible that the law on the books at the time -- which did include jail -- would apply. ""I have received no assurances from the state of Colorado that no prosecution will be pursued even in light of this recent repeal,"" Martin told PolitiFact. We checked with both the Colorado attorney general and the local district attorney; no criminal charges are pending. Even if no one has been jailed so far, the threat remains, said Ken Klukowski, a senior fellow for religious liberty at the FRC. ""It is no comfort to a person of faith to cite the frequency a person is criminally prosecuted and put behind bars especially in a rapidly changing legal environment ...,"" he said. ""The threat of prosecution has a chilling effect on people's behavior."" Completed cases in Vermont and New Jersey Of the other cases related to wedding vendors cited by Perkins, only a couple have reached a conclusion. The Wildflower Inn in Vermont  told a lesbian couple in 2010 that the inn didn't host ""gay receptions"" because of the owners' ""personal feelings."" After a lawsuit, it agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, to place $20,000 in a charitable trust and to stop hosting weddings -- whether the couple is gay or straight. The director of the Vermont Human Rights Commission told PolitiFact that the inn has paid the first half of the fine and the second half is due in September. The owners didn’t face jail based on the complaint itself. However, under Vermont law, failure to pay a fine can lead to a civil contempt action. ""This is no different than any other defendant who has a judgment against him/her and refuses to pay,"" director Karen Richards told PolitiFact in an email. ""As a practical matter, most unpaid judgments do not result in contempt proceedings, nor do they result in incarceration, except in very extreme cases, such as child support cases, where the party clearly has the money and is basically thumbing its nose at the court. I am not aware of any case in Vermont that resulted in a jail time for a defendant in any type of discrimination case."" In New Jersey, the Methodist Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association refused to allow a lesbian couple to hold a ceremony at its boardwalk pavilion in 2007. The New Jersey Division on Civil Rights ruled in 2012 that the association, which gets a tax exemption, must cease and desist violating the law but did not impose a fine or other penalty. The association stopped renting out the pavilion for marriages, an attorney who represented the association during the legal battle told PolitiFact. New Jersey can impose a fine of up to $10,000 for a first offense. A provision of the law states that anyone violating an order as a result of a legal challenge could face up to a year in jail or a fine. ""However, no attorney I've spoken with here is aware of this provision ever having been used to prosecute anyone, and there are no reported cases of it,"" Lee Moore, a spokesman for the state's Department of Law and Public Safety, told PolitiFact.   Pending cases One case we reviewed received considerable publicity but ultimately went nowhere. In Oregon, a TV news station reported that Sweet Cakes by Melissa co-owner Aaron Klein allegedly told a lesbian couple that ""they were abominations to the Lord"" and refused to fill the order. Klein told the media he didn’t use that phrase, and that after the publicity he received death threats and his wedding business fell by half. The couple contacted the attorney general, who determined it would fall under the jurisdiction of the state’s Bureau of Labor and Industries. A spokesman for the bureau told PolitiFact the couple didn’t file their case with the agency, and we couldn’t find any evidence that the case was re-filed elsewhere.

New York’s human rights law includes a provision that a person can be sent to jail for up to a year if they refuse to comply with an order. But we could not find any evidence that anyone had been sent to jail. A case against the Liberty Ridge Farm, a New York wedding venue that refused to host a wedding for a lesbian couple, remains pending. Lisa Hardaway, spokeswoman for Lambda Legal in New York, said she had never heard of jail time in such a case. ""This is an extreme scare tactic by opponents of equality for LGBT folks,"" she told PolitiFact in an email. ""It's a good talking point but not real."" Other cases that remain pending are in Washington state and New Mexico, where a photographer’s case is before the state Supreme Court. Our ruling After the Supreme Court rulings about gay marriage, Perkins said, ""We're already seeing bakers and florists and photographers forced to participate in same-sex marriages under the threat of law and in some cases even jail."" We didn't find cases where people were forced to participate against their will. However, if vendors refuse service, there are consequences. There are 21 states that forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation. Vendors who refuse service there could face legal actions and fines. The ""jail"" part of Perkins’ claim is an exaggeration. We couldn’t find any evidence that a vendor had been sent to jail or that any legal authority had threatened jail time. In some states, if a business owner loses an anti-discrimination case and refuses to comply with an order, the owner could face jail, but we found no evidence of that ever happening. One state, Colorado, specifically took action to remove the threat of jail. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/08/tony-perkins/wedding-vendors-have-been-forced-participate-same-/

Senate bill says to undocumented immigrants: pay taxes but claim no public benefits
","The effort to pass a sweeping immigration law has shifted to the Republican controlled U.S. House of Representatives where it faces a much tougher challenge than it did in the Senate. Supporters say that any hope for success lies in compromise. House Republican leaders say the Senate bill falls short in significant ways, but Democrats argue that it already contains major concessions. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., a long-time advocate for immigration reform from Chicago, highlighted how much his side was willing to give up to get the Senate bill through. ""They said to immigrants, 11 million of them, they said, tell you what we're going to do: For 10 years, you pay every tax possible, but you don't get a single benefit,"" Gutierrez said on CNN’s State of the Union. Gutierrez gave some examples: Immigrants with provisional legal status would not get help paying their health insurance premiums under Obamacare, and they would get no credit for any Social Security taxes they paid during the time they worked illegally. In this fact-check, we explore the terms of the deal in the Senate bill. Are they as stark as Gutierrez presents, or is the picture more complicated? Gutierrez’s staff clarified that he was using shorthand to refer to means-tested federal benefits.That would include some of the country’s largest programs such as Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF or welfare), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or food stamps). What the Senate bill says The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act allows immigrants without documents to get permission to live and work in the country legally. The Social Security Administration expects that nearly three-fourths of the estimated 11.5 million people here will qualify for what is called Registered Provisional Immigrant, status, or RPI. A smaller number of agricultural workers would qualify for a separate program called the blue card. Neither program grants citizenship or permanent legal status, but they provide a pathway to both. Applicants would need to pay a fine, a fee, and pass a criminal background check to qualify for provisional status. The bill has a specific provision that goes to Gutierrez’s claim. For both RPI and blue card holders, it says, ""An alien who has been granted blue card (or RPI) status is not eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit"" and to be clear about what those benefits are, the bill refers to a law passed about 15 years ago. In 1996, Congress defined the public benefits that undocumented immigrants couldn’t get. That law listed ""Any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit."" Numerous agencies have interpreted this to mean Medicaid and Medicare, SNAP, energy assistance and so forth. The Senate bill also expressly blocks immigrants with temporary status from receiving any health insurance premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, individuals can use their own money to buy their insurance through the clearinghouses called exchanges. ""Rep. Gutierrez is broadly correct, but not 100 percent,"" said Leighton Ku, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University who analyzed immigrant use of public benefits in a paper for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. ""If they are poor enough and meet other eligibility criteria, for example, if they are a child or a low-income parent, RPIs may be eligible for emergency Medicaid, as are unauthorized immigrants."" The 1996 law built in some exceptions for immigrants without legal documents. In addition to Medicaid paying for emergency medical treatment, young children are eligible for reduced school lunch programs and standard immunizations. The Women, Infant and Children program, WIC, can subsidize grocery bills for young families. So for children, women who are pregnant or have recently delivered, and medical emergencies, current law allows benefits for the undocumented and the Senate bill does not change that. Lastly, on the tax side, the Senate bill says ""an alien may not file an application for registered provisional immigrant status ... unless the applicant has satisfied any applicable Federal tax liability."" In other words, these provisional residents must pay Uncle Sam. Regarding the 10 years Gutierrez mentioned, some immigrants under provisional status might be eligible for permanent resident status, a green card, sooner. If that happens, then they would gain access to public benefits in less than 10 years. However, both Social Security and Medicare require that a person or their spouse pay into the system for 10 years before they can claim any benefits. This applies to everyone, native born or not. And both programs are available only to citizens or permanent residents. People with provisional status would have Social Security and Medicare taxes deducted from their paychecks but would be ineligible to use those programs for 10 years. A dispute over benefits The U.S. Code defines public benefits, but there are some who say the list is incomplete. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors limited immigration, said the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit provide aid to lower income workers through the tax code. A working family that owes no taxes and meets other criteria can apply and receive thousands of dollars from the government. ""Gutierrez is mistaken,"" Camarota said. ""These large programs are explicitly available to those in RPI status. Low income immigrants typically work and have children, so their use rates of these two programs are very high, as it will be for RPI folks."" Immigration reform advocates agree that provisional residents would gain from the tax credits. But Tanya Broder, senior staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, counters that blocking their use of these credits would be a first for the tax code. ""Individuals granted RPI status are required to pay the same taxes and are subject to the same deductions from their income as all other taxpayers,"" Broder said. ""Denying them the ability to claim the EITC would create an unprecedented two-tiered tax system for lawfully present workers."" Regarding the accuracy of Gutierrez’s statement, he was using the federal definition of benefits, and while lawmakers could decide otherwise, we take current law as our guide. For many years, Camarota and others have noted that the children of undocumented immigrants born in the United States are deemed citizens and are eligible for benefits. Their family members could indirectly benefit. The Senate bill makes no change in that. Our ruling Gutierrez said that immigrants with provisional status would pay every tax and get no benefits. His staff said he was talking about means-tested benefits, and to a large extent, Gutierrez was in line with what the Senate immigration bill says. It requires unauthorized immigrants to pay taxes, and so long as they are in a provisional status, they would not be eligible for food, housing or medical assistance. There are exceptions under current law that would allow them to get some public benefits, but these are limited and in any event, the Senate bill does not change the status quo. A subset of immigrants, children brought to the country at a young age and agricultural workers, would be eligible for green cards in less than 10 years, but the majority, about 70 percent, would have to wait the full time.

Gabrielle Giffords says N.H. Republicans, gun owners support background checks
","
Gabrielle Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who was shot in her home district in Arizona, contends expanded background checks continue to be popular — even among Republicans and gun owners. 
Her advocacy group is now targeting states with senators who voted against a compromise bill in April that would have mandated background checks for all private gun sales, with exceptions. 
Giffords kicked off a seven-state tour the week of Independence Day with a USA Today op-ed arguing, ""there don't have to be winners and losers."" 
There’s support for a ""simple, fair solution: background checks for all potential gun buyers,"" she wrote in the piece, published July 1, 2013. 
""Expanded background checks continue to be popular with significant majorities, even in states with high percentages of gun owners and across all party affiliations. 
""For example, in New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks."" 
The New Hampshire numbers caught our eye. Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against the Senate proposal, and a sympathetic PAC launched an ad in her defense. Do Ayotte’s constituents support expanded background checks? 
What the polls say 
Giffords’ op-ed relies on polling conducted on behalf of her advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions. 
The question: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks on all gun sales including those sold on the Internet and at gun shows?"" 
Registered voters in New Hampshire who participated in the poll, done May 21-23, 2013, by progressive polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, answered the way Giffords described. 
Our general policy is to give some credence to polls paid for by an organization affiliated with the individual or group making the claim, but also to look for confirmation with polls taken independently of the organization. 
No recent New Hampshire poll we found broke out respondents in all of those categories: by party, gun ownership and ""NRA households."" 
(We’ll note, too, that the GQRR poll memo didn’t define the NRA group. In previous fact-checks we learned similar phrases may include current and former NRA members.) 
But a smattering of polls from this year generally back up pieces of her claim.

The findings for New Hampshire Democrats in the Giffords poll were generally in tune with the other polls we found. But the Republican numbers, while still a majority, were significantly lower in two New Hampshire polls than the 79 percent Giffords cited — 63 percent in a Dartmouth College poll and 56 percent in a Public Policy Polling survey. 
Meanwhile, we’re not aware of any recent independent polls of New Hampshire NRA members. Two polls we have reviewed in previous fact-checks have looked at this issue nationally. But both were conducted by groups associated to one degree or another with the pro-gun-control position — one was sponsored by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, and the other was conducted by the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, which is named for and supported financially by the founder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
However, at least one independent poll this year, by CBS News and the New York Times found that nationally, 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks. 
Meanwhile, a May report from Pew Research Center shows it’s a mistake to assume support for expanded background checks is the same as support for background check legislation. 
Support among Republicans and gun owners for expanding background checks in that national survey — in the 80 percent range — fell to around 60 percent when they were asked about the Senate bill. 
And while 79 percent of Republican gun owners favored background checks, just 43 percent wanted the Senate’s background checks legislation to pass. 
Our ruling 
Giffords, seeking common ground for gun control legislation, said ""in New Hampshire, 93 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans, 82 percent of gun owners and 60 percent of NRA households support background checks."" 
The numbers came from polling on behalf of her own advocacy group. We found some independent evidence that New Hampshire voters support expanded background checks, through the support is weaker among Republicans. 
It’s also important to note that support for background checks doesn’t translate directly to support for the Senate bill Giffords mentioned in her op-ed. Support for the bill itself commands smaller majorities, and a minority of gun-owning Republicans nationally. 
Giffords’ claim requires clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/08/gabrielle-giffords/gabrielle-giffords-says-nh-republicans-gun-owners-/

Begala says Cuccinelli ""attacked churches for helping the poor""
","""Terrifying,"" is how Democratic strategist Paul Begala describes the thought of Republican Ken Cuccinelli winning this year’s gubernatorial race. Begala sounded the alarm in a June 27 fundraising letter for the Democratic Governors Association, outlining Cuccinelli’s ""extreme positions"" against abortion, government entitlement programs and global warming research. This list was familiar until this eye-popper: ""He attacked churches for helping the poor,"" Begala wrote of Cuccinelli. We asked Begala, a frequent CNN contributor, to prove his claim. He pointed to an article in The Virginian-Pilot about a Sept. 29, 2012, keynote address that Cuccinelli gave to the Cherish Life Ministries Christian Life Summit in Ashburn, Va. A video of Cuccinelli’s speech, posted along with the story, certainly shows the attorney general heaping criticism on Catholic church leaders. ""One of my great frustrations as a Catholic, present company excepted, is how soft and weak the leadership of my church has been,"" Cuccinelli said. ""They have for decades lobbied government to do this and to do that -- all of which should be done by the church if they’re done at all in society. And so over time they have made themselves out to be nothing but the largest special interest group in America."" Begala, to support his statement that Cuccinelli ""attacked churches for helping the poor,"" zeroed in on a comment the Republican made about Catholic bishops: ""They’ve helped create a culture of dependency on government, not God,"" Cuccinelli said, lamenting that bishops were arguing churches ""shouldn’t be the primary institution in a society that is responsible for service to the poor."" But that statement doesn’t strike us as ""an attack on churches for helping the poor."" To the contrary, Cuccinelli was criticizing what he said was an effort by the church to hand off some of its charitable role to government. Cuccinelli stressed that point later in his speech: ""Two most important things in human life -- your faith in God and, as between ourselves, love -- and government can do neither, can do neither one,"" he said. ""And our churches are asking that institution -- and have for decades -- to step up and take on their role."" Cuccinelli made a similar argument in his 2013 book, ""The Last Line of Defense."" ""One reason the American people got stuck with Obamacare was due to a devolution in American thinking over time that it was the government’s job to provide health care for those who couldn’t afford it on their own,"" Cuccinelli wrote. ""But taking care of the poor is ideally the province first of families, churches and charities, not the government."" A final note: The Democratic Governors Association, for whom Begala wrote the fundraising letter, is the largest contributor to Cuccinelli’s opponent -- Democrat Terry McAuliffe. It donated $2 million to McAuliffe’s campaign on May 13, according to records compiled by Virginia Public Access Project.   Our Ruling Begala said Cuccinelli ""attacked churches for helping the poor,"" a statement that suggests the Republican opposes the charitable work done by religious organizations. But a full reading of Cuccinelli’s comments show he was saying the opposite: That  charitable work should be the responsibility of religious organizations -- not the government.

Phone call surveillance policy no mystery, congressman says
","
A Georgia congressman’s recent attempt to clarify the federal government’s powers in terms of electronic surveillance made us curious. 
U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a Republican from Coweta County, said Edward Snowden is flat-out wrong that contractors like him can eavesdrop on the phone calls of Americans whenever they want. Snowden is the former government contractor who caused an international stir by leaking National Security Agency documents about its surveillance program. 
""That is a lie,"" Westmoreland said. 
The congressman, who is a member of the House Committee on Intelligence, explained. 
""It is against the law for the NSA to record or monitor Americans’ phone calls without getting a specific FISA warrant to do so, based on compelling evidence of a connection to terrorism. Plain and simple,"" Westmoreland wrote in an op-ed that we spotted on the Peach Pundit website. 
We wondered if the congressman was accurate when he wrote that the NSA cannot legally record or monitor Americans’ telephone calls without a specific FISA warrant. 
In early June, news accounts in The Guardian and The Washington Post reported that the federal government, as part as what’s called the ""2015 program,"" had hundreds of millions of telephone records as part of its terrorism surveillance efforts. The news organizations also reported on another program used by the NSA and FBI that scours the nation's main Internet companies, extracting audio, video, photographs, emails, documents and connection logs to help analysts track a person's movements and contacts. The reports were based on leaks from Snowden, who wanted to expose the depths of the surveillance. 
FISA, which stands for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was created in 1978 to establish federal regulations for counter intelligence. A secret court of Washington, D.C.-area federal district court judges was created to hear government requests for search warrants. Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed, a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act in December. 
The amendments allow surveillance of non-U.S. citizens overseas who the government believes may be involved in terrorist activities. Section 702 of the act, first approved in 2008, allows such intelligence without a court order for each individual target. 
A February 2012 letter by Attorney General Eric Holder and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper seeking the act’s reauthorization also supports Westmoreland’s argument. 
""(T)he Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence may authorize annually, with the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), intelligence collection targeting categories of non-U.S. persons abroad, without the need for a court order for each individual target,"" the officials wrote. 
The government is required to submit updates about the program’s progress twice a year to Congress. 
Section 703 sets rules for the surveillance of U.S. citizens. The guidelines require a 90-day court order and additional 90-day renewals, if necessary. 
Section 704 of the act focuses on U.S. citizens outside the country. It, too, requires a court order to conduct surveillance. 
Emory University law school professor Charles Shanor said Westmoreland has a point. Shanor said a FISA or a probable cause warrant is necessary for surveillance. 
""You have to have authorization, even to get the log of calls made,"" said Shanor, who clerked for a federal court judge and worked for three years as the general counsel at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
Westmoreland’s spokeswoman Leslie Shedd sent us several documents to back up her boss’s claim. It included testimony from a June 18 House committee hearing that he attended. Several House members asked intelligence officials if they can listen to phone calls without a warrant. Here is one exchange between Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and U.S. Army Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the NSA’s director. 
ROGERS: ""Is -- is the NSA have the ability to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their emails under these two programs?"" 
ALEXANDER: ""No, we do not have that authority."" 
ROGERS: ""Does the technology exist at the NSA to flip a switch by some analyst to listen to Americans' phone calls or read their emails?"" 
ALEXANDER: ""No."" 
The president addressed the issue during an interview with Charlie Rose on his PBS show. 
""(I)f you’re a U.S. person, then NSA is not listening to your phone calls and it’s not targeting your emails unless it’s getting an individualized court order. That’s the existing rule,"" Obama said. 
Is it possible that the federal government has conducted surveillance on U.S. citizens overseas? Intelligence officials told Congress at the June 18 hearing that they do not include U.S. citizens. 
In order to do surveillance under Section 704, Deputy U.S. Attorney General James Cole said at the June hearing, it would require ""identifying that person; identifying the probable cause to believe that that person is involved in either terrorism or foreign intelligence activities; and indicating that we have then the request to the court to allow us to intercept their communications because we've made the showing that they're involved in terrorist or foreign intelligence activities."" 
Again, Westmoreland said it is illegal for intelligence officers to listen to the phone calls of Americans without a FISA warrant. Federal documents, congressional testimony and comments from the president support his claim. 
The rules are different if you’re not a U.S. citizen. 
Since Westmoreland specifically referenced U.S. citizens, we rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2013/jul/08/lynn-westmoreland/phone-call-surveillance-policy-no-mystery-congress/
"['New Jersey', 'State Budget', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims state spending was lower in FY2009 plan than Chris Christie's FY2014 budget
","
Chris Christie has spent months hammering home how high New Jersey’s spending was when his gubernatorial challenger Barbara Buono chaired a Senate budget panel a few years ago. 
  
Now Buono, a Democratic state senator from Metuchen, is taking her shot at spending under Christie. 
  
Buono made her move at a June 26 Senate budget hearing when she spoke against Christie’s $32.9 billion budget for fiscal year 2014. The Legislature approved the plan that afternoon and Christie signed it two days later. 
  
Buono noted in her speech that the fiscal year 2009 budget crafted on her watch, when she chaired the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations Committee, spent less than what’s been approved for fiscal year 2014. 
  
We wondered if that was true, especially since Christie has frequently criticized spending levels when Buono helmed the budget panel, particularly for fiscal year 2008. But in this case, Buono’s claim about higher spending in Christie’s just-approved budget is accurate. 
  
Let’s review the numbers. 
  
Patrick Giordano, Buono’s chief of staff, said in an e-mail that Buono’s figures were confirmed by the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. 
  
We reviewed an e-mail sent by David J. Rosen, the OLS budget and finance officer, to Giordano, and then confirmed the data separately with Rosen. 
  
The result? Spending in the fiscal year 2009 appropriations act was $32.86 billion, compared with $32.97 billion for the fiscal year 2014 spending plan, Rosen wrote to Giordano. That’s a difference of $108,491,000 – or one-third of 1 percent. 
  
So, Buono’s claim is correct: spending for the fiscal year 2014 budget is higher than fiscal year 2009. 
  
For context, let’s also look at spending under the fiscal year 2008 budget – the other spending plan that Buono helped craft during her chairmanship of the Senate budget panel. Buono referenced both budgets during her speech on the Senate floor. 
  
Former Gov. Jon Corzine had final approval of the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 budgets. 
Now let’s look at spending for every fiscal year since 2008: 
FISCAL YEAR 
TOTAL APPROPRIATIONS 
FY2008 
$33.47 billion 
FY2009 
$32.86 billion 
FY2010 
$28.99 billion 
FY2011 
$28.36 billion 
FY2012 
$29.69 billion 
FY2013 
$31.65 billion 
FY2014 
$32.97 billion 
Sources: New Jersey Office of Legislative Services Summary Of Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 2008-2014 
  
So state spending dropped from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, but state spending has increased in each of Christie’s budgets. 
  
It’s worth noting that the recession had a major impact on decreased spending from 2008 to 20009. The National Bureau of Economic Research has defined the recession as beginning in December 2007 and ending in June 2009. 
  
New Jersey Senate Republicans spokesman Ben Sparks did not respond to our request for comment. 
  
Our ruling 
  
Buono said during a speech on the Senate floor about the fiscal year 2014 budget that its spending level is higher than spending under the fiscal year 2009 budget. Buono chaired the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee when the 2009 plan was drafted and ultimately approved by Corzine. 
  
The OLS confirmed Buono’s claim, noting that spending for fiscal year 2009 was $32.86 billion, compared with $32.97 billion for fiscal year 2014. 
  
We rate Buono’s claim True.

"['Immigration', 'Wisconsin', 'Jim Sensenbrenner']","
Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says it takes 25 years to obtain citizenship legally and just 13 years for illegal immigrants under Senate bill
","
Don’t count U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin among Republicans supporting the kind of immigration reform endorsed with bipartisan backing by two-thirds of the U.S. Senate on June 27, 2013. 
The Senate’s approach, Sensenbrenner argues, would crowd out legal immigration by boosting incentives to enter America illegally through a head start on citizenship. 
How? 
""Currently, it takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally,"" Sensenbrenner wrote in The Washington Times on July 1, 2013. ""The Senate proposal, however, would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years."" 
His conclusion: ""That’s a 12-year head start granted as a reward for illegally entering the country."" 
We’ve heard senators state repeatedly that illegal immigrants would have to ""get in the back of the line"" to obtain legal status on the road to citizenship. 
So let’s examine Sensenbrenner’s claim as the spotlight moves to the Republican-held House, where the GOP may take a more piecemeal reform strategy featuring tougher enforcement on the Mexico-U.S. border. 
The current system 
To obtain citizenship, an immigrant needs to first obtain a green card and then wait either 3 or 5 years before applying for citizenship, said Madeleine Sumption of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. 
The length of the ""pathway to citizenship"" is the sum of the waiting time for whatever type of green card the person is eligible for, plus 3 to 5 years, she explained. 
The current immigration process is first-come, first-served and limits the total number of people admitted each year on family or employment visas granting permanent residency, noted another Migration Policy Institute researcher, Claire Bergeron. 
Long waiting lists have resulted. Overall, demand has exceeded supply since 1965, especially from Mexico, whose 1.3 million applicants on the waiting list made up 30 percent of the list as of November 2012. 
All told, more than 4.4 million people are ""in line"" for immigrant visas, though an unknown number of those people may already be here without authorization. 
There are also per-country caps in place. That has meant especially long waiting times not only in Mexico, but in China, India and the Philippines. 
Sensenbrenner’s claim 
It is the case, for some categories of aspiring Americans from a few countries where hundreds of thousands want to settle here, that wait times just to get in are 20 years or more. Then it’s another 3 to 5 years to obtain citizenship. 
Mexican nationals who are the adult children of U.S. citizens experience waits of 20 years before they can file for permanent-residence visas commonly known as green cards, Bergeron wrote in a March 2013 immigration primer for the institute. 
The same waits apply to Mexicans who are the adult unmarried children of lawful permanent residents of the United States. 
""The longest backlog -- for siblings of U.S. citizens coming from the Philippines -- is currently about 24 years,"" Sumption told us. ""That means that people currently getting these green cards have waited 24 years for them."" 
So for a large number of people from countries where interest in living in the United States is high, Sensenbrenner is right that waits of ""up to"" 25 years are a reality. 
When we asked Sensenbrenner’s office for backup, spokesman Ben Miller said Sensenbrenner had Mexican immigrants in mind when citing the 25-year figure, because they are the focus of much of the current debate. 
But backlogs for many other immigrants -- and some from Mexico -- are much shorter, the Migration Policy Institute study noted. 
Spouses of U.S. citizens, for example, get their green cards within about a year after applying, Sumption told us. 
And the spouses and children of lawful permanent residents from all countries typically wait 2 years before they can file for a green card. 
In countries other than Mexico and the Philippines, applicants for family-based immigrant visas typically wait 2 to 12 years before they can get a green-card application started. 
""Wait times vary dramatically depending on the applicant’s visa category and country of nationality,"" the MPI study found. 
In another part of the system -- employer-based immigration -- applicants with no more than a bachelor’s degree commonly see waiting times of 4 years or more for green cards. 
""When you add to that the fact that many have been in the country for 6 years on a temporary work visa before applying for green cards, plus a 5-year wait for citizenship, the total waiting time for these people before obtaining citizenship can be around 15 years,"" Sumption said in an email. 
Looking at the comparison 
Sensenbrenner says the Senate bill would allow the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States to obtain citizenship in 13 years. 
That’s accurate, based on multiple news accounts of the bill. 
Finally, Sensenbrenner does the math. 
He concludes that 25 minus 13 means a ""12-year head start granted as a reward for illegally entering the country."" 
In doing so, he takes the high end of the range, leaving out his previous qualifier that citizenship takes ""up to"" 25 years. 
Overall his math is on target for many applicants from Mexico and the Philippines, countries that make up 40 percent of the waiting list. But it misfires for many others. 
Notably, in addition, Sensenbrenner leaves out the fact that the Senate bill aims to bring down the waiting times. 
That is, he uses the bill’s 13-year citizenship path for illegal immigrants as part of his equation, but does not take into account the bill’s intent to drive down the long waits. 
The bill, Sumption said, provides a backlog clearance program that would issue visas to people currently waiting in line over a 7 to 9 year period. (It should be noted that one way the bill would prevent new backlogs from developing is to end future immigration visas for siblings of U.S. citizens.) 
So Sensenbrenner’s 25-year figure is weakened by his omission, at least in part. 
But, there is still a group of people who already have waited decades to get here who would see that undocumented residents are on a 13-year path, albeit one that has many hurdles. 
Our rating 
Sensenbrenner said it currently takes up to 25 years to obtain U.S. citizenship legally, but the Senate bill ""would allow immigrants who came to the United States illegally to obtain citizenship in just 13 years."" 
He’s right for a large group of would-be Americans who wait for 20 or more years to get in and then become citizens. But many others experience much shorter waits, and Sensenbrenner muddies the comparison by omitting the fact that, going forward if the Senate bill became law, wait times are expected to drop.

Rep. Joseph McNamara says the graduated license requirement for young Rhode Island drivers has saved hundreds of lives
","
Among the bills debated by the Rhode Island House on June 28, 2013, was H-5047, which would require six hours of on-the-road driver training from a Rhode Island training school before anyone would be eligible for a driver's license. 
The bill -- which would have made it tougher for schools located in adjacent Massachusetts and Connecticut communities to do business here -- was submitted at the request of an unnamed driver training school operator in Rhode Island. It passed the House on a 42-to-26 vote but never made it through the Senate. 
One supporter, Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, said he was in favor of anything that improved the quality of young Rhode Island drivers. 
""As the original author and sponsor of our state's graduated driving license, which has saved hundreds of lives since it was initiated -- the gradual implementation -- I support any legislation that improves driving safety, especially for young people,"" he said. 
Hundreds? That would be quite an accomplishment in a state where the number of highway deaths annually seldom exceeds 85. We decided to investigate. 
The graduated driving license program placed tough restrictions on teen drivers. It extended the minimum time for a learner's permit, created a limited license and gave a full license only to young drivers who remained ticket- or accident-free for one year. The legislation was passed in 1998 and took effect in January 1999. 
When we called McNamara, he said his statement was based on a comparison of teen fatalities before and immediately after the adoption. ""Initially there was a severe drop, from double to single digits,"" he said, explaining that he had extrapolated from there. 
Such a drop wouldn't be unexpected. Various studies published more than a decade ago had suggested that similar programs reduced teen crashes and fatalities among teen drivers by as much as 58 percent. 
McNamara didn't have any Rhode Island numbers handy, so we called the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. 
The best source of online data is the Fatality Analysis Reporting System of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It goes back to 1994, five years before the implementation of Rhode Island’s graduated license system. 
RIDOT broke down the numbers for us for drivers ages 16, 17 and 18 who were most likely to be affected by the graduated license program. 
In 1998, the year before that system took effect, there were 74 highway fatalities in Rhode Island. In 10 of those cases, a driver was 16 to 18 years old. The driver wasn't necessarily killed and wasn't necessarily at fault. 
The following year, with the new law in place, the total number of fatalities rose to 88 but the number of fatalities in which the drivers were ages 16-18 dropped from 10 to 4. That's six fewer. 
If the graduated license program was responsible -- a major assumption -- and the trend persisted for each subsequent year, that would be 78 lives saved through 2012, not the hundreds McNamara claimed. 
But the trend didn't continue. The number of fatalities in the young driver category started rising over the next few years. By 2002 it was 12, higher than any of the five years prior to the implementation of the law. 
During the five years before adoption, the total number of fatalities involving drivers 16-18 was 41. During the five years after adoption it was 42, essentially the same. 
However, during the five years after the graduated license system was adopted, the total number of traffic fatalities rose by 25 percent. One could argue that if the youngest drivers had been part of that trend, there should have been about 51 deaths during that five-year stretch instead of 42. 
Even under that scenario, that translates to two lives saved per year, or 28 saved since adoption of the law. That's still a far cry from hundreds. 
Our ruling 
McNamara said the Rhode Island graduated driving license law he authored ""has saved hundreds of lives."" 
To meet that standard, you would have to see at least 200 fewer deaths on the state's highways since the law took effect in 1999. 
But the data from five years before and five years after implementation -- even if viewed in the most favorable light -- show an impact that isn't even close to McNamara's claim. 
We rate it False.

Horse breeders, owners call out Florida regulators for 'phony horse racing'
","
A masked thief fanning $100 bills is the backdrop for an ad blasting ""phony horse racing."" 
You’re probably thinking, ""Phony horse racing? Huh?"" We thought it too when we recently saw the ad on our website. 
Here’s the deal: A coalition of horse breeders and owners used the phrase for races they deem improper at a rural racino west of Tallahassee. Expansion of this brand of rodeo-style racing will have dramatic consequences for the traditional quarter horse industry and other parimutuels across the state, opponents say. 
The United Florida Horsemen want state leaders to give ""phony"" horse racing the same boot they gave Internet cafes this year following a massive federal-state investigation. The group’s ad derides Florida’s loophole-laden gambling laws and chides state regulators for signing off on ""phony"" horse racing events in spite of a judge’s order. 
""Florida outlawed Internet cafes, but rubber-stamped phony horse racing,"" begins the ad. ""Gov. Scott, can you tell us why?"" 
Is the ad’s message hyperbole, or does it make a fair point? We wanted to explore. 
The backstory is years-long, bitter and complicated, especially for the uninitiated. For our purposes, the conflict really boils down to a simple question: What is Florida’s definition of a parimutuel horse race? 
The answer is crucial in determining whether a facility can offer on-site gambling, such as card rooms and slot machines, that brings in big bucks. The parimutuel industry has been in decline for decades. 
Back in fall 2011, the state’s Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering approved a license for Gretna Racing to run parimutuel barrel match races at its Gadsden County facility, even though the department had never before licensed that kind of parimutuel activity. Like falling dominos, other tracks around the state received permission to run barrel events. 
These races did not resemble a traditional race, in which quarter horse or thoroughbred horses sprint around an oval track head-to-head. In a barrel race, contestants sprint one at a time around three barrels in a clover-leaf pattern. The clock determines who wins. At Gretna, two barrel races occurred at the same time in separate enclosures, appearing like a traditional matchup. 
The horsemen found it very disturbing that Gretna Racing could offer such low-production races, deeming it a cheap way to offer poker rooms, simulcast races and, one day, slot machines. So the associations sued the department’s Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering. 
""The division had no right to allow something like parimutuel barrel racing in the state of Florida,"" Kent Stirling, executive director of Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, told us. ""You’re knocking out one of Florida’s biggest industries by letting these people run a barrel race meet."" 
After a legal challenge spanning a year and a half, an administrative law judge agreed. 
In a May 6 order, Judge John Van Laningham slammed the state division for approving licenses for Gretna with knowledge the track planned to offer barrel match races. Van Laningham stated in his scathing 85-page order that even though parimutuel barrel match racing is not explicitly banned in state law, it was not okay for the division to essentially make up its own definition of a horse race. This should have been established in an open, discussion-driven process via division rulemaking or by the Legislature, he wrote. 
The horsemen cheered, but it wasn’t the end. 
Gretna Racing attorney and co-owner Marc Dunbar and the division agreed in a consent order that Gretna would offer ""flag-drop"" races while the case on barrel racing was being appealed. In flag-drop races, at least two horses sprint side by side for at least 100 yards. A similar quarter horse event was held April 2012 at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, for which Dunbar is an attorney. 
That set off more incredulous reactions by the horse associations who consider it the latest allowance of ""phony"" racing. 
In their view, the judge determined that any quarter horse race must be something that would be approved by the American Quarter Horse Association, even if it is not involved. ""Parimutuel barrel match racing"" does not count, so parimutuel flag drop racing should not fly either, they say. 
""I don’t even know when the last time they used the drop-flag racing or whatever else it might be,"" said Trey Buck, AQHA executive director of racing. ""It’s fun for backyard fun and just goofing around, but when you’re talking about real horse racing, it needs to be done the correct way."" 
Not surprisingly, Dunbar has a very different interpretation of the judge’s final order and of what makes a horse race. 
He said the judge found Gretna’s barrel racing problematic on a technicality because racers competed in separate arenas divided by a barrier. Remove the barrier, and the judge’s issue is solved, Dunbar said. He said the horse groups also are exaggerating about flag-drop racing being new to Florida gaming. 
Scott’s press office deferred comment to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which oversees the division tasked with oversight of parimutuel wagering. A spokeswoman told us it is the division’s job to issue operating licenses, not to get facilities to report how their races will be started. One way to do that is via flag drop, she said. 
Flag-drop racing, which traditionally involved a brightly colored handkerchief dropped by a noblewoman, led to lots of complaints about false starts, said Bob Jarvis, Nova Southeastern University gambling law professor. (Remember the Seinfeld episode of Jerry ""jumping the gun"" in a race against the fastest runner in school?) 
With the invention of the starting gate, that problem was gone. That’s important to know because Laningham specifically said the definition of horse racing should be understood as the voters who adopted the modern state Constitution in 1968 understood it. By that time, it had been many years since races started with a flag drop, Jarvis said. 
""At the end of the day, I don’t think there’s any question that flag-dropping is not the kind of racing that the voters intended to approve when they made revisions of the Constitution,"" Jarvis said. ""And I don’t think it’s the kind of racing that voters in 2013 have in mind when they are talking about parimutuel racing."" 
Still, even as a liberal Democrat who voted against Scott, Jarvis said it’s unfair for the horsemen to draw a connection between the governor and ""phony racing"" permitted by the division. Part of the agency’s job is to make rulings, and it cannot be frozen as it awaits the results of the Gretna track’s appeal that could take years in court. 
Our ruling 
In an ad campaign, United Florida Horsemen contend that Florida ""rubber-stamped phony horse racing."" 
""Phony"" is a strong word that takes on a different meaning depending on whom you ask. Someone who just wants to watch horses take off? They may say the Gretna flag drop is cool. Someone from the traditional quarter horse industry may say NO WAY. 
The horsemen deployed a heaping of rhetoric in trying to get the attention of Scott and other people who just aren’t interested in horse racing. We get that, but we think an otherwise pretty accurate point about the division allowing a race track to offer offbeat, controversial parimutuel flag-drop racing is obscured by the hyperbole.

"['Abortion', 'Health Care', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says abortions are nation's second-most common surgical procedure
","
Rick Perry made his case for legislation to step up standards for Texas abortion clinics partly by saying abortions are common. ""Abortion is the second-most conducted surgical procedure in this country,"" Perry said on the July 1, 2013, edition of Bill Bennett’s ""Morning in America"" radio program. He made a similar statement the same morning on KFYO, 790 AM in Lubbock.

That claim rang a bell.

In February 2012, PolitiFact Ohio rated a stronger declaration — that abortion is the country’s ""most common surgery"" — as Pants on Fire. Many people go to the hospital for medical procedures; in 2007, almost 45 million inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in the United States. Its researchers concluded that virtually every type of surgery, when classified broadly, was far more common than abortions.

Abortions as surgeries? 
Perry’s office did not respond to our requests for backup information, while a physician who represents a national organization of specialists opposed to the Texas measure objected to describing abortion as a surgical procedure.

Dr. Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and former medical director of the Women’s Health and Breast Center in Washington state, said by telephone that abortions are ""minimally invasive"" procedures, akin to colonoscopies, and do not involve surgical cutting unlike, say, hysterectomies.  ""We call these procedures, not surgeries,"" Levy said. ""I don’t even think it’s appropriate to talk about"" abortion ""as a surgical procedure.""

The Merriam-Webster dictionary does not explicitly include ""surgery"" or ""surgical"" in its definitions of abortion: ""The termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus: a : spontaneous expulsion of a human fetus during the first 12 weeks of gestation... b : induced expulsion of a human fetus.""

Abortion counts 
Levy’s challenge aside, we looked into the frequency of abortions and various surgeries.

According to the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy analysis group, some 1.21 million U.S. abortions were performed in 2008, the latest year for which the institute has posted a tally.

Institute spokesman Rebecca Wind has noted that Guttmacher’s abortion counts take in all 50 states and are based on actively surveying abortion providers rather than pulling data from state health department reports. Wind told us that the next update, drawing on interviews being conducted this year, is to be published in early 2014.

The Guttmacher total exceeds the 825,564 abortions reported for 2008 and the 784,507 abortions reported for 2009 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the government figures are based on reports from state health departments and do not include abortions in California, Maryland and New Hampshire — three states where the reporting of abortions is apparently voluntary.

By email, Wind told us she has heard the claim that abortion is the most common surgical procedure, but she said has not seen a factual citation backing that up.

Nationally and in Texas, the number of annual abortions has declined, we confirmed for a February 2013 fact check. The Texas Department of State Health Services says ""induced terminations of pregnancy"" in the state totaled 77,592 in 2010, down from 77,850 the year before and 81,591 in 2008. Agency spokeswoman Carrie Williams told us in February 2013 that 72,470 abortions occurred in 2011 — some 5,100 fewer than the year before.

Some abortions are induced with medicine. According to ""Women’s Health Stats and Facts 2011"" published by the the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, abortions performed with medication accounted for 17 percent of all non-hospital abortions in 2008, up from 6 percent in 2001. Such abortions by pill accounted for approximately 25 percent of abortions before nine weeks’ gestation, the organization said.

Tallies of other procedures 
The same college publication says that among reproductive-age women, hysterectomy is the ""second most frequently performed major surgical procedure after cesarean delivery,"" where the fetus is delivered by cutting open the pregnant woman’s abdomen. It does not say how this prevalence compares to abortions.

Next, we looked for general breakdowns of common surgical procedures, starting from PolitiFact Ohio’s work.

In a report issued in 2008 and revised in January 2009, the CDC reported that the nation’s most common outpatient surgeries in 2006 (the latest year with compiled estimates) included endoscopy of the largest intestine (5.7 million surgeries), meaning colonoscopy; endoscopy of the small intestine (3.5 million), meaning examinations through the mouth and throat; extraction of the lens (3.1 million); injection of prosthetic lens (2.6 million); and injection of an agent into the spinal canal (2 million). Its report said the leading diagnoses included cataracts (3 million) and benign and malignant growths (3.2 million).

A CDC survey published in October 2010 estimates the number of U.S. inpatient surgical procedures in 2007 (the latest year of compiled information). CDC said about 7 million cardiovascular procedures were performed, including more than 1 million cardiac catheterizations. Among women, the centers said, cesarean sections and repair of current obstetric laceration were the most frequent obstetrical procedures performed; about 1.34 million cesarean sections were performed. Also, according to the survey, there were 5.5 million digestive system operations in hospitals that year.

PolitiFact Ohio wondered if all the identified procedures were examples of surgery or could better be considered medical procedures and not surgeries. Lisa Keder, an obstetrician and associate professor with the Ohio State University Medical Center, replied that while the term surgery isn’t strictly defined, the way that patients are billed for medical procedures reflects whether it is officially considered ""surgery."" Keder said eye operations, endoscopic polypectomies, C-sections and abortions are all coded for billing purposes as surgeries.  

Put another way, because so many people go to the hospital for medical procedures — almost 45 million U.S. inpatient procedures were done on 34.4 million people in 2007 — virtually every type of surgery on a human system when classified broadly was more common than abortions.

There were, for example, 6.94 million heart operations, but no specific procedure more than the 1.06 million cardiac catheterizations. So, if you classify surgeries in broad terms, abortions tumble much farther than No. 4 on the most common surgeries list.

Finally, ACOG’s Levy emailed us figures she said she drew from federal databases. In 2011 among Medicare beneficiaries alone, she said, there were more than 1.8 million cataract surgeries. Among all U.S. residents, she said, there were an estimated 10 million wisdom teeth extractions. ""This may be an analogous procedure to abortion — although actually more invasive — that it is typically performed in an office setting.  If we then consider all of the excision and repair of skin lesions, some of which are quite complex for cancers, again the numbers are in the millions,"" Levy wrote.

Levy said that according to the American Gastrointestinal Association, there are 14 million U.S. endoscopies a year, including 8 million to 9 million colonoscopies.

We asked Levy if abortions might possibly be the second-most common procedure for women alone, though that is not what Perry said. She said by email that abortion is a common procedure among women. But, she wrote: ""We can expect that women make up at least 50 percent of the population having colonoscopies, cataract surgery and wisdom tooth extractions, so abortion would definitely not be the second-most common surgical procedure among women."" 
Our ruling

Perry said abortions are the second-most common surgical procedure.

This claim has substantial weaknesses--starting with whether an abortion is surgery.

Bluntly, too, abortions do not appear to be more pervasive than numerous other medical procedures. Assuming 1.21 million abortions annually occur in the United States, and keeping in mind that 17 percent of these are induced by pills, the latest federal estimates for other surgical procedures indicate there are more than 2 million more eye surgeries involving the removal or replacement of the lens in the eye and there also are more surgical procedures involving the intestines or involving the extraction of wisdom teeth. Also, a procedure common among women who are giving birth -- a cesarean section -- has occurred more frequently than abortion.

This claim not only lacks a factual basis, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2013/jul/05/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-abortions-are-nations-second-most-/
"['Environment', 'Ohio', 'Energy', 'John Boehner']","
House Speaker John Boehner says almost all of Ohio’s electricity comes from coal
","
President Barack Obama, declaring that ""Americans across the country are already paying the price of inaction"" on climate change, announced sweeping measures on June 25 to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. 
He said he would use executive power to require reductions in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation’s power plants, as the centerpiece in a three-part plan that includes new federal funds to advance renewable energy technology, and spending to protect cities and states from the ravages of storms and droughts aggravated by a changing climate. 
Republicans led by House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio were quick to condemn the measures, saying they constituted government overreach that would constrict energy production and strangle the nation’s economic recovery. 
""The president’s policies are not helping the economy, they’re making it worse,"" Boehner said in a news conference. 
He said the policies would have the effect of ""increasing the cost of electricity – especially in a state like mine, in Ohio, where about 95 percent of our electricity comes from burning coal."" 
That figure caught PolitiFact Ohio's attention. We asked Boehner's staff for a source to back it up. 
They did not have a source for the figure, but Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said: ""Regardless, it’s clear the overwhelming majority of electricity in Ohio comes from the coal that the president is attacking."" 
In support of that statement, he cited a Washington Post article that looked at the question of whether Obama was waging a ""war on coal."" 
So how much of Ohio's electricity does come from coal? 
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) has a feature on its website that asks and answers the question. 
""Coal, a nonrenewable fossil fuel, is used to generate 77.87 percent of the electricity in Ohio,"" the PUCO site says. 
PUCO says about 11 percent of Ohio electricity is generated by nuclear power, about 9.1 percent is produced using natural gas and other gases, and petroleum is burned to create steam to turn the turbine blades that generate about 1.0 percent of Ohio electricity. (PUCO lists as its source the Edison Electric Institute, EEI, the association of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies.) 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration rounds the figure to 78 percent for electricity generated by coal. 
That percentage is far higher than the 42 percent of electricity generated by coal nationally, according to the EIA. 
Our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker also examined Boehner's statement. In addition to citing the figures from PUCO, they noted that the latest figures show that Ohio cut its net generation of electricity from coal by about 10 percent from 2010 to 2011. 
Fact Checker also took note of Ohio law, cited by the PUCO and Energy Information Administration, that is designed to reduce reliance on coal by requiring that at least 25 percent of all electricity sold in the state come from alternative energy sources by 2025. Half of that must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric power, geothermal and biomass. 
Boehner's overall point was correct. As his spokesman said, the vast majority of Ohio's electricity does come from coal, and the percentage is far higher than the national average. 
But the state officially is looking to reduce, not maintain, its reliance on coal, and has made progress in the effort. 
And while the percentage of electricity from coal is high, Boehner's figure of 95 percent exaggerates it by 17 percentage points. That's a significant difference.

Obama holds record for cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers, says Wasserman Schultz
","
President Barack Obama is the boss-buster in chief when it comes to going after employers who hire undocumented workers, according to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. 
""President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president,"" said Wasserman Schultz, in a June 20 interview on MSNBC. Obama ""has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president."" 
In a related fact-check, we gave Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as the Democratic National Committee chair, a Mostly True for her claim about border patrol and security. Here, we will explore if Obama holds the record for cracking down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants. 
Workplace raids vs. paperwork raids 
For some background, we turned to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies worldwide migration. Their 2013 paper about the history of immigration enforcement includes a chapter on workplace enforcement. We also found some background in a 2010 investigation from the Orange County Register. 
After multiple efforts, Congress passed the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which stated that employers couldn’t knowingly hire unauthorized workers. Employers must attest that they made a good faith effort to verify the eligibility of workers by completing an I-9 form. 
The documents are easy to counterfeit, so the federal government developed an online employer verification system in the 1990s under President Bill Clinton, and the use of it soared after 2007. That system, now known as E-Verify, is currently voluntary, though some states mandate it for certain employers. (The Corker-Hoeven amendment to the Senate immigration bill would make it mandatory.) E-Verify spending dramatically increased under President George W. Bush and Obama. 
Still, immigration rules have proved difficult to enforce. As of 2010, about 8 million unauthorized immigrants worked in the United States. 
The federal government’s worksite enforcement strategy has changed over time as well, making it difficult to compare data and declare any president the leader in cracking down on employers, experts across the political spectrum told us. 
At times, members in Congress have called for stiffer workplace enforcement. But when the reality hit home in their districts and led to complaints from business owners, politicians urged the federal government to ease up, according to border expert and University at Albany professor Rey Koslowski. That’s why border security has been more politically popular to fund than worksite enforcement. (We should note that a significant percentage of people working illegally don't cross the border; they simply overstay their visas.) 
Doris Meissner, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner Clinton, called worksite enforcement ""a bit of a third rail."" (She is one of the authors of the Migration Policy Institute paper. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is now called Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.) 
Under Bush, workplace raids on factories and meatpacking plants received much attention. But after Obama took office, the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new strategy and ditched the workplace raids, which also tended to punish employees, in favor of ""paper raids"" -- I-9 paperwork audits of employers to determine if they complied with employment eligibility verification laws. 
""ICE will focus its resources within the worksite enforcement program on the criminal prosecution of employers who knowingly hire illegal workers in order to target the root cause of illegal immigration,"" Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano said in April 2009. 
The change was dramatic: the number of I-9 audits soared from 503 in 2008 to more than 8,000 in 2009. 
Under Obama, ICE announced sanctions against major employers. That included a $1 million fine gainst Abercrombie and Fitch that grew out of an I-9 inspection in November 2008 while Bush was president, and the termination of hundreds of workers at Chipotle restaurants. 
In 2007, ICE arrested 92 employers, while in 2012 it arrested 240, according to ICE. Final orders -- rulings at the end of the case which show employers violated hiring rules -- also increased under Obama. In 2007, there were two final orders, while in 2012 there were 495. 
But Obama doesn’t hold a record on final orders against employers. The numbers of final orders hit higher numbers in the 1990s. Those 495 final orders under Obama were consistently exceeded between 1992 and 1998, with a peak 1,063 final orders in 1992, according to data from the government’s Immigration Statistics yearbook. 
Wasserman Schultz spokesman Jonathan Beeton sent us news reports showing an increase in I-9 audits and fines under Obama compared to Bush. (We were unable to obtain I-9 audit statistics from the 1990s, so we don’t know if Obama holds the record merely over Bush.) 
Still, I-9 audits aren’t the only way to measure immigration enforcement. While audits have soared under Obama, other metrics have fallen, including arrests of employees, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restricting immigration. 
That’s not a surprise, since Obama turned the focus away from the workers and toward employers. However, by ignoring the workers, ""they are choosing to cut off a line of inquiry to nail employers,"" Vaughan told PolitiFact in an interview. 
We asked Vaughan if she thinks Wasserman Schultz was correct to state that Obama holds the record on enforcement of employers. 
""It depends on which metric you choose,"" she said. ""If your metric is the number of audits, yes. If your metric is bringing cases to prosecution that seriously punish employers, to the point where I would say there would be a deterrent effect, I would strongly disagree with her statement."" 
Additionally, I-9 audits are not a complete or perfect measurement of worksite enforcement against employers who hired illegal workers, said former U.S. Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who chaired the immigration subcommittee from 1989 to 1991. Morrison now lobbies on immigration matters and has informally advised hospitals and other businesses that have faced I-9 audits. 
He described some of the I-9 audits as paperwork snafus -- for example an employer who didn’t check the right box. 
""If there are no illegals, you are more likely to be cut a break on penalties than if you hired a lot of illegals, but you get fined anyhow..."" he said. ""Trying to say who is being tougher on this aspect of enforcement I think is kind of a silly discussion, because what were people fined for? And did that help prevent unauthorized employment or not?"" 
We also interviewed Carl Hampe, an attorney at Baker McKenzie who has represented employees in immigration cases since the 1990s and was an attorney for the Senate committee that drafted the 1986 law. 
Hampe said that Wasserman Schultz’s claim ""is not inaccurate, but given the changing enforcement strategies, it’s not quite that black and white."" 
In the 1990s, INS handled a higher number of civil cases, while Bush focused on criminal investigations against employers and workers. Obama has pursued civil audits and criminal investigations against employers. 
""It’s hard to say whether Bush 43 or (Obama) is the hands-down winner,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Wasserman Schultz said that Obama has cracked down ""on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president."" 
She used the word ""employers"" and not ""employees"" here for a reason: Obama shifted away from Bush’s strategy of workplace raids and turned the focus on employers. Between 2008 and 2009, immigration audits soared from 503 to more than 8,000. But other metric tell a more nuanced story. Final orders against employers, for example, were higher in the 1990s than they are now.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says in South Florida, ""we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s""
","
Not long after President Barack Obama gave a speech outlining his plan for attacking climate change, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., appeared on Fox News to discuss the future of energy and the environment. 
""We've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s,"" said Wasserman Schultz in a June 28, 2013, interview with Tucker Carlson. ""What that means is that communities like mine in South Florida and coastal communities all across the country are facing dangerous sea-level rise, which will ultimately cause homes to be under water in just a few short years."" 
In this item, we won’t analyze her projections for future sea-level rises; such estimates are based on a variety of theoretical models and come with lots of uncertainty attached. However, we did wonder whether Wasserman Schultz was correct about past changes -- specifically, whether South Florida has ""had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s."" 
First, some background on sea-level rises. ""Sea level"" refers to the height of the ocean’s surface as measured either by a mechanical tide gauge (a method used since the 19th century) or, since the late 1990s, by satellite measurements. The kind of changes Wasserman Schultz mentioned are not short-term changes such as high tide and low tide, but rather average sea-level measurements taken over the course of many years. 
We located sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a variety of locations, including Miami Beach, Fla. Using tide gauge data from 1931 to 1981, NOAA found a change equivalent to 0.78 feet in 100 years. That's roughly nine inches since the 1920s. 
We checked with two scientists who specialize in sea-level measurements -- Gary B Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and Gary Mitchum, a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida -- and both agreed that the NOAA data was an appropriate source for Wasserman Schultz to rely on. Both scientists considered her claim to be accurate. 
We will, however, offer two notes of caution when thinking about sea-level rise. 
One complication for making these measurements is that the land-based reference point for a tide gauge is not as fixed as it would seem to the naked eye. In reality, the land itself may be rising or falling, masking changes in sea level. 
For instance, in some places, such as Alaska or Scandinavia, the land is rising because it’s still rebounding from the retreat of heavy glaciers. In other locations, the slow action of plate tectonics is pushing the land upwards. The effect of land rises can be strong: In places like Alaska, the rise in the land has been faster than the rise in sea level, meaning that sea level is actually dropping in relative terms. 
By contrast, in Louisiana, the land is sinking due to a variety of landscape changes made by humans. With sea levels rising and the land sinking, the relative change in sea level is especially dramatic. 
South Florida fits somewhere between these two extremes. But because of the variability in land rise from place to place, it’s not appropriate to assume that just because sea level has risen by nine inches in Miami Beach that it has risen by the same amount everywhere. 
The second caveat is that past changes in sea level are a whole lot clearer than future changes. 
In a 2011 paper, Mitchum estimated that sea level in South Florida would rise 32 inches by 2100, with a smaller possibility of a 40-inch rise. However, other estimates have varied, and Mitchum cautions against assigning too much certainty to long-term estimates of sea-level rise. 
Our ruling 
Wasserman Schultz said that in South Florida, ""we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s."" That essentially matches the data collected by the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration. While there is considerable uncertainty about the future course of sea-level rises, Wasserman Schultz’s estimate of the historical rise appears to be on target.

Glenn Nye claims he voted against the Wall Street bailout
","
U.S. Rep Glenn Nye portrays himself as a boldly independent Democrat who bucks his party on key issues such as health-care reform and the Wall Street bailout.

In at least four TV ads, the freshman congressman from Virginia Beach and Norfolk has stressed he voted against the bank bailout, which is formally known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

""I stood up to my party leaders and voted no on the Wall Street bailouts,"" Nye said in one ad. (To emphasize his theme, he titled the ad ""Independence."")

But there’s a big problem with his claim: Nye was not a member of Congress when TARP was approved.

The final House vote approving TARP came Oct. 3, 2008 -- 32 days before Nye was elected and 95 days before he took office.

The bill set up a $700 billion bailout fund for banks that had made bad investments. President George W. Bush quickly signed the bill to avert what many feared could be a doomsday economic collapse.

Although the TARP was intended to rescue the financial industry, the Bush administration in December 2008 broadened its reach to allow an infusion of money for U.S. auto companies.

Nye has received considerable flak for the claim. So how can he say he voted against the TARP? He cites two votes cast during his first weeks in office.

One of the votes was on Jan. 14, 2009. But when we looked into it, we learned the vote did not concern the life or death of TARP. Nye simply opposed a procedural resolution to allow debate on a bill that would impose tough new restrictions on how companies could spend TARP money.

Procedural resolutions are pretty routine and it’s clear this was not considered a significant vote. For example, we couldn’t find stories about it the following day’s editions of the New York Times or the Washington Post. The House passed the resolution largely along party lines.

Nye did buck his party leaders on that vote because they wanted the debate to proceed. He was one of only 15 Democrats who voted against their party. But we find it’s not accurate for him to characterize that as a vote ""against the bailout.""
 
The other vote he cites was January 22, 2009, on a bill to give the treasury secretary access to the second half of the $700 billion in TARP money. The law had said the second $350 billion would become available only if the administration asked for it and at least one chamber of Congress approved.

But that vote was essentially meaningless. The Senate had approved the request on Jan. 15, freeing the money to go to the Treasury.

The Republican-sponsored resolution had no impact on events; it was the equivalent of a coach challenging a referee’s call a week after the game ended. Still, Nye was among 99 who supported the GOP resolution.

So Nye says he voted against the bailout. People hearing his claim would undoubtedly think he was referring to the main vote on the TARP, but he wasn’t even elected when that vote was taken.

He cites one vote on a procedural motion that was not substantive and that the news media did not characterize as significant, and another vote that was more substantive, although the issue was moot at that point.

So there is just a small amount of truth to his claim. We find his claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/25/glenn-nye/glenn-nye-claims-he-voted-against-wall-street-bail/

Anti-Amendment 4 group cites PolitiFact in newspaper ad
","
The group opposing Amendment 4, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, placed a full page ad in the Oct. 17, 2010, Orlando Sentinel urging voters to vote no on the amendment based on information from, well, us.

The full page ad ran with the headline ""What does Amendment 4 really mean for Florida?""

Included in the ad was an allegation that listed PolitiFact as the source. The ad says Amendment 4 ""will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees."" The footnote attached to the claim points back to a PolitiFact Florida article from March 16, 2010.

We love the publicity and notoriety that comes with being quoted in a full page advertisement running in one of the state's largest newspapers.

But we love being quoted accurately more.

In this case, we weren't.

First, in case you don't know, here's some background on Amendment 4.

Amendment 4 was placed on the November ballot after Hometown Democracy was able to collect 676,811 petition signatures statewide, more than the state requirement to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal is summarized as follows on the election ballot: ""Establishes that before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, the proposed plan or amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body and notice.""

Essentially the proposal would allow voters to decide on changes to local land use plans, rather than having the decision rest in the hands of city councils, county commissions or appointed local planning agencies.

Supporters argue that the measure will give more power to local residents by allowing them to make decisions regarding development plans in their communities. Opponents argue Amendment 4 will stall existing projects and drive away prospective developers from investing money in Florida.

We've rated several claims on both sides of Amendment 4, which you can see here.

The claim we're analyzing in this case stems from a statement we examined in the spring. Back in March, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy claimed that the tiny Pinellas community of St. Pete Beach had terrible experiences with its own version of Amendment 4, resulting in ""seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate.""

We found two half truths in the statement back then.

1). We didn't agree that Amendment 4 and St. Pete Beach's version of hometown democracy were the same thing. Here's what we wrote about the comparison then:

""A group of St. Pete Beach residents, unhappy with the direction of their city government, successfully wrestled certain land use decisions out of the hands of elected leaders. The movement produced a backlash from both the government and pro-development forces, who then mounted their own political campaign to wrestle power back. The power struggle has continued for close to four years.

""That's a different storyline than what is envisioned under Amendment 4, where voters would act as a check on the decisions of local government. The amendment itself isn't designed to go around government the way the situation in St. Pete Beach played out. And it has nothing to do with citizens proposing amendments to the local comprehensive plan, like what has happened in St. Pete Beach. Now, are the same lawsuits and political maneuvering possible? Absolutely. And maybe that's enough to make the analogy valid.

""But voters should be wary in blindly believing that St. Pete Beach's experiences would be duplicated statewide should Amendment 4 pass.""

2). We didn't think St. Pete Beach's hometown democracy rule generated lawsuits that forced the city to raise its property tax rate. Declining property values, more than anything else, forced the tax rate increase in 2009. Here's what we wrote then:

""Yes, there were lawsuits, but they weren't the only costs mentioned for the city legal department (during budget talks). Yes, the city slightly raised its rate in 2009 -- although the net result still was a decrease on most homeowners because of sharply falling property values. But the discussion at a town meeting indicates that the decision was motivated by several factors, most notably the decline in property values, as well as legal fees."" 
Our ruling

Let's look at what Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy said again in its ad. Citing PolitiFact, it said Amendment 4 ""will force counties and cities across Florida to raise taxes and fees.""

Well, we can speak unequivocally about this one. PolitiFact Florida never said that what happened in St. Pete Beach's case will happen in cities and counties across Florida if Amendment 4 is approved. We never said it in any other Truth-O-Meter items either. And even ignoring that, PolitiFact Florida never said St. Pete Beach's local hometown democracy rules forced the city to raise its tax rate.

No doubt about it: Pants on Fire! (And no footnote required). 
UPDATE: Ryan Houck, a spokesman for Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, said the line in the Sentinel ad was mistakenly sourced to PolitiFact. ""Over the course of this campaign, we’ve generated literally thousands of documents containing accurate claims and citations — we’ve always prided ourselves on an attention to detail and a focus on the facts,"" he said. ""However, sometimes mistakes happen and I’m sorry to say that one has happened here."" Houck said that the ad should have referenced Florida TaxWatch as the source for the ad’s claim.",/factchecks/2010/oct/25/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/anti-amendment-4-group-cites-politifact-newspaper-/

Scott Walker wants to kick 350,000 families off BadgerCare, Greater Wisconsin Political Fund says
","
In his quest for the Republican nomination for governor, Scott Walker offered a consistent answer when asked for examples of how he would cut taxes and trim the state budget.

His answer: Start by limiting the time Wisconsinites can stay on BadgerCare Plus, the state health care program

At least, that was the answer up until a few weeks before Walker trounced Mark Neumann in the Sept. 14, 2010 primary. In a new campaign ad, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Political Fund is aiming to make Walker pay for his earlier position.

In the ad, as an iPhone replica flashes onto the screen, a narrator asks: ""Don’t you wish there was an app that told you when politicians were lying?"" Then a knockoff of PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter fills the screen, as Walker is rated on three sound bites.

(Sure, imitation is a form of flattery. But we’re in real danger of being over-flattered this election.)

""I support BadgerCare,"" Walker says in one of the three. The needle jumps to False as the narrator snarls: ""Fact, Walker favors cutting up to 350,000 families and children off health care.""

We’ll look at the 350,000 charge, not Walker’s pronouncement of support.

The Greater Wisconsin Committee made the same claim in an ad that started Sept. 2. The group is a political action committee that gets big money from organized labor, the Democratic Governors’ Association and at least $1 million from outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle’s soon-to-be defunct campaign fund.

Needless to say, the group is backing Democrat Tom Barrett as Doyle’s replacement.

So, does Scott Walker support tossing hundreds of thousands of people off BadgerCare?

The answer would have been easier -- and the group’s charge more accurate -- a few months ago.

First, a little about BadgerCare. The program, targeted to the working poor and low-income unemployed, provides health insurance coverage to children, pregnant women, parents and childless adults. Its rolls have swelled dramatically -- to 767,910 in September 2010 -- due to eligibility expansions and the fallout of the recession. Walker voted for the program when he served in the state Assembly.

After a late-August primary debate with Neumann, in which Walker reiterated his support for time limits, Walker backed off that position.

Walker told the Journal Sentinel’s Patrick Marley the next day that he had ""misspoke"" in saying he endorsed BadgerCare time limits -- he said he meant time limits on W-2, the state’s welfare-to-work program. The Journal Sentinel reported that story on page 1 on Aug. 27, 2010.

To back up its claim that ""up to 350,000 families and children"" would lose coverage, the Greater Wisconsin Committee cites a lengthy Appleton Post-Crescent interview of Walker from June 2010  -- and several other public statements. It also points to state BadgerCare data -- provided by the state to us for this item --  showing more than 350,000 individuals now on BadgerCare have stayed longer than the 24 months Walker has discussed.

That’s fine, but Walker’s position on it clearly has changed -- even if the group’s charge has not.

So, let’s dig in again.

PolitiFact Wisconsin listened to hours of Walker media interviews and concluded that over 11 months he unequivocally endorsed time limits in response to BadgerCare questions time and again. In the Appleton interview in June he suggested a 24-month limit.

But since the late August debate, Walker instead has emphasized possible tighter income rules and sounds open to dropping low-income childless adults from the program. That group was just added to the program in 2009; there are more than 50,000 enrolled.

In addition, Walker has made vague statements about getting back to the ""original intent"" of BadgerCare, which he defines as for the ""truly needy like the disabled, children from low-income families and low-income single parents."" Walker says the state’s exploding Medicaid population has put BadgerCare in a financial crisis.

The new, mushier position makes quantifying the true impact of Walker’s position very difficult.

The Greater Wisconsin Committee says the language in its ad is still supported by the facts. Of course, with the ""up to"" qualifier, that leaves an awful lot of room.

Some numbers: 

Walker objects to BadgerCare insurance being a permanent entitlement.

Does that mean he objects to people continuing in the program once they get a job? His campaign declined to be specific beyond saying Walker thinks it ought to cover the truly needy like the disabled, children from low-income families and low-income single parents.

The numbers above include a lot of children. That may not be fair, given that Walker said in the Post-Crescent interview that he wants to ""make sure kids are covered."" But it is unclear if Walker means all children currently eligible  or just those of unemployed parents.

A lot of questions and few answers.

Peacock said it best: ""I think it’s very hard to quantify how much Walker might affect BadgerCare participation – partly because his statements have either been vague or fluid, and partly because it sounds like he might reduce eligibility below the level initially recommended by Governor Thompson.""

The target may be moving, but the Truth-O-Meter has to stop somewhere.

The Greater Wisconsin Committee charges that Walker’s original position could move as many as 350,000 people -- or fewer -- off BadgerCare. Their claim rested primarily on the time limits that Walker supported for almost a year but then backed away from just days before Greater Wisconsin’s first ad in September.

Walker changed course to a muddier position, while Greater Wisconsin has continued to cite the number. It adds an important qualifier though -- ""up to"" 350,000. Walker’s new position, while unclear, still focuses on reining in BadgerCare enrollment -- whether it’s the 68,000 or some other number remains to be seen.

Barnes attacks job losses under GOP
","
Most Georgians who've spent a few hours in front of a television set this fall have inevitably seen a message from Democrat Roy Barnes that he'll put the state ""back to work"" if elected governor this fall.

The campaign of Republican Nathan Deal has scoffed at the idea. Deal noted in several television ads that the Peach State led the nation in job losses during one 12-month stretch when Barnes was governor. The Deal campaign said in one television ad that Barnes has tried to hide his record of ""historic unemployment.""

Barnes campaign aides have fired back.

""Georgia had the worst job losses in state history under GOP watch,"" the campaign said in a written response to a recent Deal television ad.

Is that true?

Barnes has attempted to make the state's unemployment troubles a major selling point of his candidacy. He served as governor from January 1999 to January 2003 and claimed Georgia created about 235,000 jobs during his tenure. Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows the number of Georgians employed during his tenure rose by 234,355 people. Georgia's unemployment rate also rose during Barnes' term, and so did the number of people unemployed.

The man who beat Barnes, Republican Sonny Perdue, also can claim more Georgians had jobs since he took office in 2003. But as with Barnes, the unemployment rate and the number of people unemployed also have increased during Perdue's two terms.

A review of unemployment data does show there have been more job losses since Perdue took charge at the state Capitol.

We looked at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics website, which has the most detailed unemployment data by state. Its data goes back to January 1976. Georgia's unemployment rate has ranged from 3.3 percent in the final months of 2000 to a high of 10.5 percent earlier this year.

The greatest increases in unemployment under the Barnes administration took place between November 2001 and May 2002, the months the national economy tumbled as a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The largest 12-month increase in unemployment took place from February 2001 to February 2002. The number of Georgians who filed for unemployment rose by 56,809 people and the unemployment rate rose from 3.4 percent to 4.8 percent during that time period, the BLS data showed. The unemployment rate never rose above 5 percent during Barnes' tenure.

The greatest increases in unemployment since Perdue was governor started in mid-2009 and continued through the middle of this year. The largest 12-month increase in unemployment took place from April 2008 to April 2009. The number of Georgians who filed for unemployment rose by 175,804 people, according to the BLS data. The unemployment rate rose during that time from 5.5 percent to 9.2 percent. The highest unemployment rate during Perdue's tenure was 10.5 percent, which was February and March 2010.

It's also worth noting that there were slightly more than 1 million Georgia residents more in 2009 than there were when Barnes left office in 2003, according to U.S. census data. The Peach State's population rose from 8.68 million residents in 2003 to 9.83 million in 2009. Presumably, there are more people who need jobs now than there were when Perdue became governor.

State and national Republican Party officials have blamed higher unemployment on the economic policies of President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Both major political parties also say the Great Recession is a big part of the equation.

Robert Ward, deputy director of the New York-based Rockefeller Institute of Government, believes governors have a ""minimal impact"" on unemployment. Ward directed us to Site Selection magazine, which does an annual review of which states are best to do business, saying that's a better measure to determine a governor's effectiveness. Georgia ranked eighth in the magazine's 2009 survey, which includes the opinions of executives on what's it like to open a business. It also includes new plants and other businesses that opened.

Perdue's spokesman, Bert Brantley, said that because of the Great Recession, it isn't fair to compare job losses during his administration to Barnes'. Brantley said housing, financial services and the travel industry have been particularly hit hard, which is not good for a state like Georgia.

""The things that Georgia is built on are the things that have been hit hardest during the recession,"" Brantley said.

Ward, the Rockefeller Institute expert, had similar concerns about comparing job losses between these two governors.

""That's not a good way to measure the difference,"" he said. ""There was a recession in [Barnes' term], but much less than this recent recession period.""

We agree. The Barnes campaign is technically right about the numbers. The current economy under Perdue is widely considered to be the worst in about 80 years.

Oregon House Democrats try to tie Julie Parrish to Sarah Palin
","
Oregon seems to have missed most of the tea party fever sweeping the country these days. There aren’t any serious political contenders in Oregon who fit the bill, anyway.

But that hasn’t stopped the Oregon House Democrats from trying to tie one local candidate to Sarah Palin and her ""rogue"" ways.

In a recent Democratic mailer, Future PAC proudly proclaims that ""Oregon isn’t grizzly country.""
On the reverse it says that Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate for House District 37, is ""one of Sarah Palin’s mama grizzlies.""

""Recently,"" it goes on, ""Julie Parrish received national attention after she was singled out by Fox News as one of Sarah Palin’s ‘Mama Grizzlies.’

""We don’t really want one of Sarah Palin’s Mama Grizzlies making decisions for us, do we?

""Don’t think so. Support a Grizzly-Free West Linn and Tualatin.""

Well, PolitiFact Oregon decided we ought to vet all of the above charges, and set to work.

First up: Is Oregon ""grizzly country""?

That all depends. If House Democrats are talking about the actual bear (we imagine they might be, as there is a fancy, cut-out image of a bear on the mailer), then they’re right. No grizzlies have been spotted in Oregon since the early 1900s.

If, however, they’re talking about ""Grizzly Bear,"" the popular indie band, they’re way off. The band played in Portland last October, and we have faith the group will return to serenade us yet again. (We recommend a quick listen to ""The Knife,"" our favorite song of theirs.)

Seriously, we might have to leave the whole ""grizzly country"" designation alone and move on to the more substantive side of the mailer.

Is Parrish really one of Palin’s mama grizzlies?

To get to the bottom of this pressing political issue, we went to a video of Parrish on Fox News and gave it a quick look.

The anchor frames the TV spot as follows: ""Well, Sarah Palin says they're like mama grizzlies, a trend of fed-up, conservative moms getting involved in politics. Many for the very first time.""

There’s then some Sarah Palin voiceover and inspiring images. At one point, Palin says ""It's kind of a mom awakening in the last year and a half.""

Then we’re back to the anchor, who says, ""And joining us are three first-time candidates and mama grizzlies.""

We got in touch with Parrish, who said she was a bit surprised about the way the TV spot unfolded. ""The focus was supposed to be moms and politics,"" she said. ""I was surprised, quite frankly, in how they intro-ed that.""

Still, you can find the video on her website, and she didn’t object on the air.

But is this video really enough to link her to Sarah Palin? We still, for all of our sleuthing, weren’t sure. So we did a little more research and found that Parrish has not received any monetary help from Palin or the out-of-state tea party groups with which the ex-vice presidential candidate is sometimes linked. Neither has Palin come to town to stump for Parrish. Heck, she hasn’t even endorsed her, as far we can tell.

So where does that leave us? The claim suggests that there is a formal connection to Palin or at the minimum some show of support. There’s no evidence of that. So we are left with simply one Fox newscaster calling Parrish a ""mama grizzly"" in that she’s a conservative mother in politics for the first time. But her connections to Sarah Palin appear to be non-existent. We rate this claim Bearly -- oops! -- Barely True.

Gov. Rick Perry says more Texans have new jobs than the population of Fort Worth
","
Republican Gov. Rick Perry frequently talks up the Texas economy, focusing in recent TV ads on the state's job gains since he took office almost 10 years ago. 
""Texas added more than 850,000 new jobs,"" Perry says in a ""New Jobs"" spot that debuted online Oct. 13. ""More Texans have new jobs today than the entire population of Fort Worth."" 
For an article published Sept. 23, we put the 850,000 number to the Truth-O-Meter, rating it True. 
On Oct. 11, Katy Bacon, spokeswoman for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, wrote us an e-mail suggesting that the jobs picture might have changed since our first pass, making the claim inaccurate. 
We put our pencils to her point, though in this article we'll be rating whether Perry's comparison of job gains to Fort Worth's population holds water. 
In an Oct. 19 news release about the ""New Jobs"" ad, the Perry campaign points to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data on state employment to show the change in the number of nonfarm jobs in Texas between January 2001, shortly after Perry became governor, and June 2010. During that time, the state experienced a net gain of 853,400 jobs. 
Of course, Texas was also growing during that time; according to projections from the Texas State Data Center, the population increased by about 4 million people between 2001 and 2010. 
Texas, the second-largest state, is among the 20 states that had net job gains during the 9.5-year span from January 2001 to June 2010. Texas ranked No. 1, followed by Arizona (132,700 jobs) and Utah (113,200 jobs). 
Yet — as White's camp nudged — June's numbers are no longer the most recent. By July 2010, Texas' net job gain had dropped to 848,000. In August, it fell even further, to 818,500, although that month's job numbers were preliminary until Friday, after Perry's ad was released. The August information makes Perry's figure off by 31,500 jobs. 
Bottom line? Perry's statement that Texas added more than 850,000 jobs is correct when considering a particular time period (that he doesn't mention in the ad): between January 2001 and June 2010. By August, that statement was no longer accurate, but that information wasn't final until after Perry's ad came out. 
Next, how do the job gains compare with the population of Cowtown, the state's fifth-largest city? For its head count, the governor's team uses a population estimate from the City of Fort Worth's website: 736,200 people as of Jan. 1, 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau's most recent estimate — for July 1, 2009 — is 727,577. 
We asked Ed Friedman, a director at Moody's Analytics who covers the Texas economy, about the validity of Perry's comparison of statewide job gains over time with Fort Worth's population in 2010. He called the comparison a reasonable way for Perry ""to give you an idea of the size of the gain."" 
Either way, the Fort Worth comparison stands up because no matter which final month is chosen, the number of Texas jobs has gone up more than the population of Fort Worth. 
We rate Perry's statement as True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/25/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-more-texans-have-new-jobs-popu/

House Republicans target state Rep. Matt Patten, trying to tie him to Cuyahoga County corruption scandal
","
There is no bigger symbol of corruption in the public mind in Northeast Ohio than indicted Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora.

The now infamous picture of Dimora being led out from his house in handcuffs by FBI agents is being used in a number of races against local Democrats, including Rep. Matt Patten. The Strongsville Democrat is locked in a tight Ohio House re-election battle against Republican Mike Dovilla.

A TV ad by the Ohio House Republican Organizational Committee attacks Patten as well as another House Democratic candidate — Kelli Perk — suggesting they are part of the corruption in Cuyahoga County. It opens by flashing the Dimora picture. In Patten’s case, the link to Dimora as well as former Cuyahoga County Auditor Frank Russo was the ""thousands in dirty cash"" from the pair that the Democrat received during a January 24, 2008, event, according to the ad. (For the record, Dimora has proclaimed his innocence while Russo has pleaded guilty to 21 corruption-related crimes.)

But were the pair really giving ""thousands"" to Patten, a relatively unknown first-time candidate for office back in January 2008? We decided to check for ourselves.

After combing through Patten’s campaign finance filings, we found a pair of contributions from the disgraced duo on that night totaling $500. The two $250 contributions were from the Friends of Frank Russo and the Dimora Boosters Committee and were reported as being received Jan. 24, 2008.

Additionally, the Dimora Boosters Club gave Patten $200 and the Friends of Frank Russo gave him $100 in July 2008. That’s a grand total of $800—and only $500 on the night spotlighted by the attack ad. (By the way, Dimora gave to eight other Democratic statehouse candidates back in 2008 while Russo gave to two.)

House Republicans argue that the ""thousands in dirty cash"" is reached if you add other contributions to Patten from persons charged in the public corruption scandal such as former Sheriff Gerald McFaul ($100), Daniel Gallagher ($100) and Ferris Kleem ($250) as well as others just mentioned in the corruption indictments. Lumped in that group are public officials implicated in the corruption scandal but not named or charged.

House Republicans also note that Russo and Dimora were two of the main sponsors of the event in January 2008 in arguing that Patten was close to the pair.

For his part, Patten acknowledges that Dimora and Russo were sponsors of the fundraiser but says that neither man actually attended the event. He says he used their names as well as County Commissioner Tim Hagan and others to attract other politicos into coming to the fundraiser. He says he has given the money from Russo and Dimora to charity.

As for the charge, the cash was ""dirty"", it should be noted that this fundraiser took place in Jan. 2008 — roughly six months before Dimora’s office was raided by the FBI and 32 months before he was indicted in federal court. Russo was similarly in the clear in January 2008 as far as anyone knew. It’s hard to see how the money was ""dirty""-- at least back in January 2008.

To sum up, it looks like House Republicans got caught with their hand in the cookie jar on this one.
  
Republicans argue that the ""thousands"" threshold comes when you count others connected to the corruption scandal, but, frankly, we aren’t buying it. The ad states very explicitly ""Russo and Dimora"" were the ones giving the ""thousands"" to Patten.

We rate the Ohio House Republican Organizational Committee’s claim to be False.

Marco Rubio fires back at Charlie Crist attacks
","
One of the most prevalent attacks against Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is that he abandoned the Republican Party and decided to run for the U.S. Senate as a no-party candidate out of political expediency and nothing more.

He heard it from both Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek in their Oct. 24, 2010, debate on CNN.

But Crist countered that his decision had more to do with a far-right shift in the Republican Party. ""The Republican Party and the right wing of that party went so far right. It's exactly why Marco Rubio stayed there (and) it's exactly the same reason that I left,"" Crist said. ""He wants to overturn -- listen to me, women watching -- overturn Roe v. Wade. He does not support stem cell research. You know, these are extreme views that I am not comfortable with.""

The line produced one of many heated exchanges between Rubio and Crist. Rubio, in his rebuttal, tried to point out Crist's hypocrisies.

""We don't need to go down the long and torturous road of the governor's change on positions and so forth. That's been well-documented,"" Rubio said. ""I mean, I do think it's curious that he attacks me for positions he held, like, six months ago, (when) he was running in the Republican primary and we were debating together on Fox News.""

We previously have analyzed Crist's flip-flopping on things like oil drilling, the federal health care bill and even a controversial education bill that Crist vetoed in 2010. But what struck us in this case was that Rubio not only accused Crist of flipping on issues, but then brazenly criticizing Rubio for positions Crist himself held not too long ago. 
Our gameplan is to start the search where Rubio suggested, a Fox News debate back on March 28, 2010. But we also think it's fair to at least examine other Crist attacks that didn't come up in the March Fox debate.

Looking back at Crist-R, circa March 2010

Much of the Fox debate, moderated by Chris Wallace, focused on Crist and Rubio arguing about Rubio's personal finances. (Some things never change).

But when it came to policy issues, the debate largely covered four topics -- jobs and the economy, Social Security, health care and immigration. What we found might actually surprise you -- Crist's statements then and now are very consistent.

Both in March and this month, he said he would support the idea of raising the eligibility age for Social Security. Then and now, he said he supported the federal stimulus program. Then there's his answers on immigration. They are nearly identical. 
He said both in March and during the October CNN debate that the country needed to first secure or seal the border and enforce the laws now on the books. Then, in both instances, he talked about a way to gain citizenship for people now living here illegally. 
""If they have the opportunity to gain citizenship, they should go to the back of the line, go through the regular process, what the law requires, in order to attain their citizenship,"" Crist said on March 28 as a Republican. 
Then on Oct. 24 as an independent: ""People should have to get in the back of the line, pay a fine if necessary, their back taxes, and be able to become productive members of the American economy. It's a compassionate way."" 
In matters of policy, the closest PolitiFact Florida could come in finding a difference between March and now comes in discussing the federal health care bill. On March 28, Crist he would vote to repeal the bill. In an Oct. 6 ABC debate, Crist said he was against the health care bill and said it needed to be fixed (health care wasn't discussed during the CNN debate). In other cases, he said the health care bill should be repealed but be accompanied by a responsible substitute.

Meek is attacking Rubio for wanting to repeal the health care bill, but Crist isn't.

Claims about abortion, stem cell research 
Without much to go on from the Fox News debate, we turned to two attacks Crist levied against Rubio directly during the CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate -- that Rubio wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and that he opposes embryonic stem cell research. 
Did Crist once oppose stem cell research? Did Crist once want to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in America?

On embryonic stem cell research, Crist generally has been supportive of it. When he ran for governor as a Republican in 2006, Crist said he favored embryonic stem cell research. The position put him at odds with former President George W. Bush. And in May 2010, Crist vetoed state budget language banning tax dollars from being used to support human embryonic stem cell research.

Crist's record on abortion, however, is more difficult to decipher. But not necessarily on overturning Roe vs. Wade.

When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998, Crist said that he was pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. ""I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government,"" he said. In a subsequent debate, he said he would not support a constitutional amendment banning abortion -- essentially overturning Roe vs. Wade.

In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist said he was pro-life. But he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade. ""I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians, and I think it's very important to respect the medical profession,"" said Crist, whose father is a doctor.

In the 2010 Republican U.S. Senate primary, Crist said he would support ""pro-life"" legislation like tax credits and subsidies for parents who adopt. He didn't answer questions about Roe vs. Wade.

So Crist is attacking Rubio on both stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, but there is no evidence his position has changed on those issues since the spring.

Gay adoption 
Rubio has used this line about Crist attacking him before. During an ABC News debate earlier in October, Crist chastised Republicans like Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint for telling people ""who they should love and who they shouldn't."" In that context, Crist said he supported a court's decision to lift a ban in the state on gay couples adopting a child. 
That prompted Rubio to respond. ""I think it’s always funny to listen to the Governor attack me for positions he himself held just six months ago, when he was trying to be the biggest conservative in the world and win the Republican primary."" 
Crist's accusation meets our definition of an attack.

And it turns out Crist himself in the past has supported the gay adoption ban.

That's our definition of a flip.

Back in 2006, when he running for governor as a Republican, Crist said that ""my position is the traditional family is the best to adopt."" The comments came after earlier comments suggested he might support lifting the ban and allegations from Republicans like former state Rep. Dennis Baxley that he supported gay adoptions.

And then on one day in July 2009, he told reporters two different things. When one group of reporters asked if he would support legislation to change the law, he said, ""I'd have to think about it."" Later in the day, he said he supported the ban. ""I think Florida has it right right now,"" he said.

In February 2010, just eight months ago, Crist's office confirmed to the Orlando Sentinel that he supported the ban.

Crist defends the differing positions by saying he was simply enforcing the laws on the books of the state. That's a weak argument. Laws change all the time. At the behest of leaders.

Rubio's response

To add to its case, the Rubio campaign sent us back to that Fox News debate, and the discussion of Social Security. One of the criticisms Crist consistently has made against Rubio, and a claim that PolitiFact has analyzed, is that Rubio wants to cut Social Security benefits.

Crist said during the Fox debate that he would not raise the retirement age or change cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries and proposed one of the ways to help keep Social Security solvent is to cut waste and fraud. But the moderator didn't think eliminating waste and fraud was a practical solution and pressed further.

""Don't you actually have to make some benefit changes if you're going to deal with this debt issue?"" Fox's Wallace asked.

""Well, I think you might have to make some,"" Crist answered. ""But I think what you want to do first is get the waste and the fraud out.""

Crist clearly was against raising the retirement age and against benefit adjustments based on his answers. When he was pressed about the effectiveness of his plan to fix Social Security, he said some benefits changes might be needed. But then quickly said his plan — get the waste and fraud out — could work. We think it's a stretch to use an answer he was pressed into giving as evidence of a flip-flop.

Rubio's campaign also noted that Crist went from being a proud Republican to essentially attacking much of the Republican Party for a far-right ideological shift. We won't disagree with that. But we're focusing on policy issues here.

Our ruling

Make no mistake: Crist is ripe for attacks about flip-flopping. We've already pretty much written a book about it, noting that his position on oil drilling has shifted, as has his position on the federal health care bill. He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee.

But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago.

There, the case is much more difficult to make.

When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs. Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio.

But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme.

The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue. In that case, Crist's flip-flopping helps his argument.

Overall, we think Rubio's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that give a different impression. So we rate this claim Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-fires-back-charlie-crist-attacks/

Kendrick Meek said tax cuts for the wealthy would cost the middle-class $6,000 a year
","
In the three-way race for the U.S. Senate in Florida, both Republican Marco Rubio and independent candidate Charlie Crist favor extending the current tax rates for the wealthiest Americans. Democrat Kendrick Meek, on the other hand, favors President Barack Obama's plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.

After Rubio defended the tax cuts, Meek made the case that raising taxes on the wealthy reduces government debt, and that actually helps the middle class.

""Middle-class families throughout America have to pay $6,000 per year to pay for the tax cut that he's talking about,"" Meek said. ""That's before the finance charge from China, Japan, or India. I think it's important that we look at leveling with the people of this state, not just the cake-and-ice-cream, deregulation, everyone-should-get-a-tax-cut kind of way. If we are going to govern, we must govern in a responsible way, because we are putting our children in a position that no other nation's children will be in as it relates to paying back this debt.""

We were interested in fact-checking Meek's statement that ""Middle-class families throughout America have to pay $6,000 per year to pay for"" tax cuts for the wealthy.

A little background about tax cuts: In 2001, President George W. Bush promoted tax cuts as a way to return money to citizens because the federal government was running a surplus. In 2003, Bush promoted the extension of some of those tax cuts as a necessary economic stimulus after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. But Bush lacked the votes in Congress to permanently change the tax code, so the laws that passed stipulated that the new, lower tax rates would expire in 2010. That means the rates for everyone will automatically go up in 2011 unless Congress takes action.

President Obama campaigned on a platform to renew tax cuts for the middle class and to let tax cuts expire for individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples who make more than $250,000. Meek, currently a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, supports that plan. The Obama administration has released detailed budget estimates showing that higher tax rates on the wealthy will generate $678.3 billion over 10 years.

Obama's proposal raises the income rates on the top brackets from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent. But he also proposes a few other provisions affecting high earners, such as increasing their dividends taxes and capping tax exemptions. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center crunched the numbers on the proposals in Obama's 2011 budget and found the following:
  

Getting back to Meek's statement, Meek said that tax cuts for the wealthy would ""cost"" middle-class taxpayers $6,000 each. We should note that keeping the lower tax rates in place doesn't technically ""cost"" the government anything. Rather, it's money that the government doesn't collect. Given the current fiscal imbalances, though, any reduction in tax revenues without cutting spending puts the country more into debt.

Meek said he wasn't counting interest on the debt, and that it would cost middle-class taxpayers $6,000 per year. We know that over 10 years, the tax increase for the wealthy totals $678.3 billion, so $6,000 per taxpayer per year means there are ... (hold on a minute, we're punching the numbers into our calculator) ... 11.3 million middle-class taxpayers -- a laughably small number.

There are about 157 million taxpayers in total, so using this math, Meek's middle class would be disturbingly small -- less than 10 percent of all taxpayers. Democrats like to say that the middle class is shrinking, but we don't think even Meek would suggest it's less than 10 percent. We suspected Meek meant $6,000 per family over 10 years.

And in fact, when we ran our analysis by the Meek campaign, they admitted he misspoke, that he meant to say over 10 years. They used a 2007 Census estimate of 116 million households in the United States.

In rating our item, we should note that some Republicans object to saying that tax cuts ""cost"" anything. It's not spending, they say, it's money that belongs to the people. Still, if the country is deficit-spending, it's foregone revenue that will have to be made up for some way. But this philosophical debate is a side note to our fact check because Meek said the tax cuts for the wealthy would cost middle-class families ""$6,000 per year."" That number is way off, by at least a factor of 10. Meek's campaign admitted he flubbed it. We rate Meek's statement False. ",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-said-tax-cuts-wealthy-would-cost-mid/

Charlie Crist claims Florida Legislature was first to reject investment in companies with Iran ties
","
While ""divestment"" isn’t nearly as sexy as ""war on terror,"" that’s how Florida Gov. Charlie Crist chimed in on foreign policy at a U.S. Senate debate on Oct. 24, 2010.

As talk turned international, Crist touted Florida’s strong ties with Israel and advocated ""keeping an eye"" on Iran. Then he pointed to a rare opportunity he had as a domestic leader to take an international stand:

""I am very proud, as governor of Florida, that we signed the first divestment act, as it relates to Iran, divesting any investments in companies that would invest in Iran, because we support Israel so strongly here in this state and this country.""

We wanted to check the record. Was Florida really first?

We had to crank the way-back machine to 2007 for this one.

In May that year, Crist’s office encouraged other governors to ""follow Florida’s lead in Iran and Sudan divestiture."" ""As demonstrated by the end of apartheid in South Africa, when a light shines to expose oppression and extremism, the days of injustice are numbered,"" he said.

Florida was the only state at that point to have moved Iran divestment legislation through the state House and Senate.

In June, Crist signed the ""Protecting Florida’s Investments Act."" Among other things, it instructed the State Board of Administration to shed holdings with companies that did business in Sudan and Iran.

News coverage at the time noted Florida was looking to ""lead the charge"" and confirmed that the state sought to cut ties with 57 companies doing energy-related work in Sudan and Iran.

""At least two other states have also passed laws requiring divestiture of stocks tied to Sudan, but Florida is the first state to target both countries,"" the St. Petersburg Times reported in September 2007.

Bills yanking state pension funds from countries suspected of engaging in genocide or sponsored terror became so popular, the National Conference of State Legislatures kept a list.

But it wasn’t until October 2007 that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a related bill, prohibiting the state’s pension funds from investing in companies doing business in Iran. It had already done the same with Sudan in 2006, before Florida — but that wasn’t Crist’s claim.

He said Florida signed the first divestment act concerning companies doing business with Iran. Media reports and official pronouncements support Crist’s story. We rate his claim True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-claims-florida-legislature-was-first/

Charlie Crist says Marco Rubio has said people who don't agree with him ""ought to leave the country""
","
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, an independent candidate for U.S. Senate, defends his departure from the Republican Party by criticizing the ""extreme views"" held by the GOP’s right wing — and by extension his Republican rival, Marco Rubio.

So on Oct. 24, 2010, in their fifth debate of the campaign, Crist strove to paint Rubio as a rigid idealogue who wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade and didn’t support stem cell research. Then he turned it up a notch, saying Rubio had said that folks who didn’t agree with him ought to leave the country.

""You know, these are extreme views that I am not comfortable with,"" Crist said. ""(Rubio) took it to a point so much so that (he) said that, you know, people who essentially don't agree with him, ought to leave the country, like Keith Olbermann.""

Could it be true?

Crist campaign spokesman Danny Kanner pointed us to a Palm Beach Post story from March 2010 about a Rubio campaign stop in West Palm Beach. The story ended this way:
  
Rubio also said he was against amnesty for immigrants, believing legal immigration will never work if illegal immigrants are granted amnesty. 
Then, he closed the speech with a thought he said originated from Glenn Beck, FOX News' popular conservative talk show host. 
  
""There are millions of people in America that hate our country, so why can't we just do a trade?"" Rubio said. ""We'll send you Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo and Keith Olbermann, and you can send us people that actually love this country and want to help us build it."" 

The story prompted this impassioned response from the MSNBC host: ""You have inadvertently revealed that you don't see those with other viewpoints as merely disagreeing with you. You have inadvertently revealed  that you dismiss them as not loving this country.""

Sunday morning, Rubio’s campaign didn’t flinch.

Spokesman Alex Burgos offered this quick response from his BlackBerry after the debate: ""It's true what Marco said, and we appreciate the governor bringing it up.""

Group in favor of amending class sizes says there are 825,000 empty seats
","
Parents fed up with overcrowded classrooms helped pass an amendment in 2002 to limit class sizes in Florida. Now that school districts face the full effects this year of that amendment, the Legislature put another amendment on the ballot to ask if voters want to change the first one.

This ballot issue is Amendment 8, which would tweak the rules to allow class sizes to be measured based on school averages rather than on classroom caps -- though there are also caps in terms of how many students assigned per teacher.  To pass, the amendment needs 60 percent of the vote. Supporters of the amendment say the 2002 rules are too rigid and expensive to implement. According to the Florida Department of Education, districts have spent about $15.8 billion through the 2009-2010 school year on class size implementation statewide and are on track to spend an additional $2.9 billion for the 2010-2011 school year.

But opponents say it's crucial to limit class sizes as the previous amendment intended. In a related Truth-O-Meter, we examined a claim from the opponents about the maximum number of students allowed in each class. We rated that claim Half True.

As part of the argument in favor of changing the rules, the Yes on 8 group points out that there are hundreds of thousands of empty student stations statewide, meaning desks -- raising the question of why districts should need to make changes to limit class sizes. The group states on its website as of Oct. 20, 2010, ""New class size caps in 2010 are forcing school districts to tax and spend huge sums to construct additional classrooms - even though there currently are 825,000 student stations sitting empty across Florida in every district and at every grade level.""

We wanted to check, are there 825,000 empty student stations in every district and at every grade level? 
First, some background. The 2002 amendment was intended to limit classrooms to 18 students per teacher in kindergarten through third grade, 22 for fourth through eighth grade, and 25 for high school classes. The rules apply to core courses, and don't include some courses such as gym or band. The amendment was phased in over time -- last year schools could go over the limit as long as they met average class sizes for the school. This school year was the first time that districts must meet the caps in each classroom.

The Florida Department of Education has a handy website that explains how the rules would change if voters approve the constitutional amendment on Nov. 2, 2010. The new rules state that the maximum class size would be calculated based on a schoolwide average in core classes:

• 18 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;
• 22 students in grades 4 through 8;
• 25 students in grades 9 through 12.

Also, the new rules would set the maximum number of students assigned to each teacher while not exceeding the schoolwide average:

• 21 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;
• 27 students in grades 4 through 8;
• 30 students in grades 9 through 12.

Now back to the group's claim.

We asked the Yes on 8 group if they actually meant 825,000 student stations in total across the state of Florida rather than the way they wrote it as ""in every district and at every grade level.""

""Yes, we are talking about a total statewide number, not in every district,'' said Yes on 8 spokesman Ryan Banfill in an e-mail.

The Yes group sent us a chart on Oct. 18 showing there were 845,044 additional student stations in kindergarten through 12th grade across Florida -- note that is about 20,000 higher than the group claimed on its website. The group said it obtained the chart from the Florida House of Representatives K-12 Appropriations Committee, which obtained it from the Florida Department of Education Office of Educational Facilities. Thomas Butler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, confirms that the data came from the state DOE. He said that even though the chart states July 1 in the corner, the data was from September 2010 and is the most current available number of additional student stations statewide.

All 67 districts showed additional student stations in the category of K-12. However, when broken down by age level, three districts had negative additional student stations -- overcrowding -- in either the K-3 range or 9-12 grades. We asked Banfill why the group listed 825,000 on its website but relied on data that showed 845,044. He said 825,000 was the figure from the state in February at the time when Republican lawmakers were pushing for the change. We found a Feb. 2 blog item in The Buzz from the St. Petersburg Times that cited the 825,000 figure.

We asked the Florida Department of Education directly to provide information showing the number of additional student stations statewide. Butler sent us a link to a chart, dated June 30, 2010. That chart didn't state the number of additional student stations, but Butler said we could calculate it ourselves by subtracting the Capital Outlay Full Time Equivalent (full time equivalent student that needs facility space) line from the Total Student Station line to get 812,604. Note that is about 32,440 less than the September data but it's also not exactly the same data: the September data was for K-12 schools that must meet class size while the June data, Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH), includes schools that don't have to meet class size requirements such as the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind and adult education classes.

But the number of additional student stations statewide isn't the full story. Just because there are empty seats somewhere in the district -- or even in a particular child's school -- doesn't mean there aren't some classrooms that are overcrowded in that district. For example as of Sept. 15, Flanigan High School in Pembroke Pines, Broward County's second-largest city, was over-enrolled by 207 while Coconut Creek High School, in northern Broward, was under-enrolled by 856, according to James Kale, coordinator of educational specifications for Broward.

Nor does it mean that students in the crowded schools could be transferred easily to the open seats to balance the classes and meet the size requirements. A district could face significant transportation and salary costs, not to mention parental blowback, if students were moved to new schools just to hit the average.

So how does the Yes on 8 group's claim stack up?

The group claimed ""There currently are 825,000 student stations sitting empty across Florida in every district and at every grade level"" based on data cited in February. We have a few quibbles with that. First, there is more recent data from September, and the number is even higher at 845,044. Second, the way the statement is written literally suggests that each school district has 825,000 empty seats. Common sense tells you that would be impossible so we think it was just poor word choice, not an intentional exaggeration.

We must note that the 825,000 figure statewide still doesn't give a true picture of class size because it implies that districts can shuffle students around as needed to meet the requirements, and common sense tells you that's difficult, too. Still, the number we're ruling on is close enough. We rate this claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/yes-8/group-favor-amending-class-sizes-says-there-are-82/

Vote NO group claims amendment will lead to classes with more than 30 students
","
A battle has erupted among parents, educators, taxpayers and politicians about how many students should be allowed in Florida classrooms.

That battle will be waged on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot when voters statewide will decide on Amendment 8, which would change the rules about class sizes that voters approved in 2002. Groups urging Floridians to vote yes or no have created catchy websites and mailers with photos of eager students, stern-looking teachers in crisp white button-down shirts and claims about what will happen to children's futures.

In a related Truth-O-Meter, we examined a claim from a group pushing for passage of Amendment 8 about the number of empty classroom seats statewide. We rated that claim as Mostly True. In this Truth-O-Meter, we will examine a claim by the group opposing passage of the amendment.

In a mailer we saw Oct. 18, 2010, the Vote NO on 8 group wrote: ""Amendment 8 dramatically increases the number of students per class by at least 20%. In fact, some classes will have over 30 students!"" The other side of the flier resembles a test question and asks ""What is the maximum number of students allowed in your classroom?"" It shows five numbers crossed out ranging from 18 to 29 and a pencil broken in half, then states the answer: ""30 or more!""

If Amendment 8 passes, will there be ""30 or more"" students in a classroom?

First, some background. The 2002 amendment was intended to limit classrooms to 18 students per teacher in kindergarten through third grade, 22 for fourth through eighth grade, and 25 for high school classes. The rules apply to core courses, and don't include some courses such as gym or band. The amendment was phased in over time -- last year schools could go over the limit as long as they met average class sizes for the school. This school year was the first time that districts must meet the caps in each classroom.

Amendment 8 would tweak the rules to allow class sizes to be measured based on school averages rather than on individual classrooms -- though there are also caps in terms of how many students can be assigned per teacher.  To pass, the amendment needs 60 percent of the vote. Supporters of the amendment say the 2002 rules are too rigid and expensive to implement. According to the Florida Department of Education, districts have spent about $15.8 billion through the 2009-2010 school year on class size implementation statewide and are on track to spend an additional $2.9 billion for the 2010-2011 school year..

But opponents say it's crucial to limit class sizes as the previous amendment intended.

The Florida Department of Education has a handy website that explains how the rules would change if voters approve the constitutional amendment. The new rules state that the maximum class size would be calculated based on a schoolwide average in core classes:

• 18 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;
• 22 students in grades 4 through 8;
• 25 students in grades 9 through 12.

Also, the new rules would set the maximum number of students assigned to each teacher while not exceeding the schoolwide average:

• 21 students in prekindergarten through grade 3;
• 27 students in grades 4 through 8;
• 30 students in grades 9 through 12.

Note that the Department of Education says that if Amendment 8 passes, the maximum number of students per classroom would be 30 -- not ""more than"" 30 -- and that figure only applies in grades 9 through 12. But it isn't as rigid as it seems.

We asked Ingrid Olsen, spokeswoman for Vote NO on 8, how the group arrived at the ""30 or more"" figure. Their conclusion is two-fold: one part has to do with those non-core classes such as physical education and band -- a simpler issue we will address first -- and the other part has to do with districts trying to ""game"" the system, Olsen says.

""The class size requirements of this subsection do not apply to extracurricular classes....,'' Olsen wrote in an e-mail ""Accordingly, a significant number of classes in all grade levels now do, and will continue to be able to exceed the maximum class size goals (i.e., it will not be unusual for those classes to vastly exceed 30 students; it occurs today).""

Thomas Butler, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Education, confirmed for us that the class size rules don't apply to non-core classes. But that's the case right now -- and will be the case whether Amendment 8 passes or fails.

Olsen also wrote:

""In their attempts to comply with the class size requirements in the absence of the required funding from the state, we are hearing about school districts gaming the system; a practice which will become more widespread if Amendment 8 were to be enacted. Doubling up classes with a primary teacher and an associate teacher, renaming core classes to resemble non-core classes and carrying ghost teacher assignments on rosters, are practices which appear to be occurring today. Amendment 8 will cause increases in those actions.""

(No -- ghost teachers aren't educators who dress in scary costumes and distribute chocolate bars for Halloween. We'll explain who they are later.)

We asked Olsen to point us to specific examples of districts taking such actions. Here are the people and sources she sent us to:

• We interviewed Beverley Dowell, who teaches 5th grade language arts and other subjects at Treasure Island Elementary in North Bay Village in Miami-Dade County. Dowell told us that she has 41 students in one of her sections -- the most she has ever had during her on- and off-again teaching career that started in 1971. Dowell said she has a paraprofessional who assists her and sometimes another teacher.

Miami-Dade school spokesman John Schuster confirmed Dowell's class size. He said she can have 41 students because the school's reading coach shares responsibilities with the teacher and a paraprofessional assists.

• From an Aug. 21, 2010, article in the Miami Herald about schools facing the class size deadline: ""For a while, some districts considered ignoring the limits and paying millions in fines, figuring that would be cheaper than corralling enough teachers to make the teacher-student ratios work. In the end, most found creative ways to comply, such as offering more Internet-based virtual classes to older students and shifting athletic directors and media specialists into the classrooms to teach.""

• Several additional news sources across the state stated that some schools are using co-teaching or associate teaching (which adds a lower-paid educator to the classroom) to allow more students in each classroom since there is more than one educator. An Aug. 22, 2010, story in the St. Petersburg Times stated: ""Some schools have moved to co-teachers, effectively doubling the number of students they can house in a classroom.""

• A letter from T. Alan Cox, principal of Lawton Chiles High School in Tallahassee, told parents as the new school year approached that ""One adjustment that was made at Chiles that will allow a core class to have more than twenty-five students is the participation of more than one teacher per class"" -- a reference to him hiring associate teachers. (The letter we saw did not have a date but it starts with ""summer is quickly coming to a close."")

And now, about those ghost teachers. Lynda Russell, a public policy advocate for the Florida Education Association who is aligned with the Vote NO side, said a ghost teacher refers to math or reading coaches who aren't assigned a classroom because they are floaters who assist students in need. Russell said coaches have been asked to sign paperwork showing they are responsible for a classroom -- though they are essentially assigned one on paper only, hence the reference to ""ghost."" We asked her for proof that this is occurring and she said she obtained an e-mail from a union official in Osceola County from a coach who raised questions about this practice. We asked for the e-mail but have not received it.

""Right now we've got this limit that is not adhered to at 25,"" Russell said. So if Amendment 8 passes, we will have a cap ""that is not adhered to at 30.""

We asked Butler, the DOE spokesman, whether districts can use co-teaching to increase those caps on numbers of students in the classroom if Amendment 8 passes. He said co-teaching is allowed and pointed us to a statute that shows several other options including virtual instruction programs or use non-traditional school calendars or hours.

If Amendment 8 passes, will there be ""30 or more!"" students in classrooms?

That depends. For starters, the class size issue is far too complicated for such a simple numerical claim without explanation on a mailer. The suggestion that there will be ""30 or more!"" students in ""your classroom"" could suggest to the average reader that school classes could hit those numbers in any classroom no matter what subject or age. While there are certain ways that could occur, it's impossible to quantify at this point how often that will happen under Amendment 8.

Yes, there will be more than 30 students in non-core classes -- but that's the case today. And the number ""30"" only applies to 9th through 12th grades -- the numbers are lower for younger children.

But as the Vote NO group points out, districts across the state are experimenting with co-teaching this year that allows them to put two educators in a room and therefore more students than the caps. If they're doing that now, they could continue that practice if Amendment 8 passes.

But all that is a lot of omitted context and clarification, so we rate this claim Half True. ",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/vote-no-8/vote-no-group-claims-amendment-will-lead-classes-m/
"['Environment', 'Recreation', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says the DNR has mismanaged the state’s deer herd and lowered the deer population
","
Scott Walker’s first deer hunting expeditions gave him a taste of the frustration that has been felt by many Wisconsin hunters: He got skunked.

Now, in his bid for governor, Walker has waded into the single most contentious state natural resources issue: the size of the state’s deer herd and how the balance is struck between the wishes of hunters, the effects of deer on the environment, the concerns of farmers and the safety of drivers.

The annual deer hunt helps drive tourism and, for many, helps define Wisconsin.

Walker, a Republican facing Democrat Tom Barrett in the Nov. 2, 2010 election, is a recent hunter, though his story may have a common ring to it.

Two years ago, on his first hunt, he saw a buck but couldn’t shoot, because he was in an area where hunters first had to kill a doe before they could shoot a buck.

Last year’s hunt was equally unsatisfying: Walker didn’t see a deer.

Walker made increasing the number of deer -- and the number of hunters -- a central part of a tourism plan he unveiled Oct. 14, 2010. In the three-page document, Walker says Gov. Jim Doyle and the state Department of Natural Resources have engaged in ""political games"" and ""put bureaucrats in Madison ahead of hunters of the state.""

The result, he argues, is a smaller herd, fewer deer taken and fewer hunters. In a news release, Walker claimed that the ""deer population has dwindled"" as a result of ""mismanagement"" by Doyle and the DNR.

That’s the statement we put in our cross hairs.

Is it true the deer population has dwindled? And, if so, is the frustration of hunter a result of political games and mismanagement in Madison?

We started with Walker, but his campaign said he was unavailable to talk to PolitiFact Wisconsin about the matter. Out hunting votes, no doubt. The campaign referred us to adviser Greg Kazmierski, a member of the Hunters Rights Coalition, a lobbying group and longtime critic of the DNR.

Kazmierski, owner of Buck Rub Outfitters Ltd. in the Town of Delafield, believes the DNR’s system of managing the deer herd -- and the hunt --  is out of whack.

His list of complaints is long: Deer population estimates, used to establish hunting targets, are ""not anywhere close to accurate""; the department itself doesn’t do enough to encourage hunting and is ""anti-hunter""; bureaucrats focus too much on other factors, such as car-deer accidents and farmers who have their crops damaged.

""We are moving in a direction that people want to give (hunting) up,"" said Kazmierski, whose business is based on hunting. ""There are too many rules and regulations.""

OK, let’s dig into the claim, starting with  the last word: ""dwindled.""

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines dwindle as ""To become steadily less: shrink."" That can apply to the deer population in the state -- which is estimated at 1.3 million -- down from about 1.8 million in 2007.

But Walker’s statement glosses over two critical factors.

First, the population is an estimate -- no one knows exactly how many deer there are. Second, the numbers are down on purpose; the smaller herd is part of a policy compromise that involves many players and in some years a vote by the Legislature.

Under state law, the DNR must establish a ""post-hunt"" deer population goal.

Once every three years, that goal is voted on and approved by state lawmakers. It is not a decision for bureaucrats or the governor alone -- as Walker suggests when he blames them for mismanagement.

Everything starts with estimates of the overall deer herd -- an inexact science, but one that the state was praised for as a national leader in a 2006 review by out of state experts.

The DNR also receives advice from various groups and sportsmen in each county, via members of the Wisconsin Conservation Congress, a statewide network that has existed for 76 years.

The prospects for hunters are far from the only consideration that plays into the target deer population. When there are large numbers of deer, farmers complain of damage to their crops. In suburban areas, deer begin to show up, wandering in cul-de-sacs and backyards. And, of course, some become part of car-deer accidents.

For instance, as the number of deer has declined, so has the number of car-deer accidents: 16,338 in 2009, down from 17,555 in 2005 and 19,914 in 2001.

But after a disappointing 2009 hunt, many hunters blamed the DNR.

The post-hunt goal for the fall 2010 hunt was set last spring at about 794,000. That compares with a post-hunt goal of about 706,000 in 2005 and a post-hunt goal of about 704,000 in 2000.

So, while Walker argues the overall population is dwindling, the post-hunt goal has actually been increasing.

This year, a special committee recommended setting the post-hunt deer population at 745,636. The agency bumped it to 794,172, after taking into account that some members of the committee -- including Kazmierski -- wanted a goal in excess of 1 million.

Let’s look at some other numbers, which also relate to Walker’s claim -- that tourism is being harmed because the number of hunters is down.

Number of Wisconsin hunters: Licensed resident deer hunters were 800,372 in 2009, according to the DNR. That’s down 1,513 from the year before. But the number is up from 2005, when it was 780,719.

Number of out-of-state hunters: Non-resident licenses were 43,998 in 2009, down 1,575 -- about 3.5 percent -- from the year before. Out of state licenses totalled 42,397 in 2005.

Total deer harvest: In 2009, the total was 329,103, down 124,377 from the year before and 134,832 less than in 2005.

With that drop, it’s no wonder many hunters are frustrated.

In 2009, there were 39 deer killed per 100 licensed hunters, compared with 56 deer per 100 hunters in 2005. However, the percentage of successful hunters is actually even lower, because many hunters bag more than one deer.

Walker’s plan calls for the governor to appoint ""white tail deer trustee"" (We think ""deer overseer"" is a bit more poetic) to advise the state on deer management.

What do others say about the issue?

-- ""The deer herd is down, but it’s not decimated. It’s down, but it’s coming back,"" said Mark Toso, president of the Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association, a group he says has 1,000 members.

Toso said Walker is ""trying to feed off of anti-DNR sentiment"" and frustration among hunters: ""A lot of deer hunters only know what they see in the woods. If they don’t see a deer, it’s the DNR’s fault.""

-- Ed Harvey, chairman of the Conservation Congress, said the group was formed precisely to ""depoliticize"" deer management. He noted: ""If something’s politicized, it’s a lobbying group.""

He said the DNR has erred in estimated deer counts in some parts of the state, leading to hunter frustration: ""The department has taken some very big strides to correct that. It will take some time.""

Asked about the deer trustee advisor, Harvey’s response was simple:  ""That’s what the Congress does.""

-- ""In my professional opinion, the statement that the deer herd has been mismanaged is wrong,"" said Tim Van Deelen, a University of Wisconsin-Madison biology professor and expert on deer populations.

He noted the 2006 audit that found the state’s approach to counting the herd more rigorous than that of other states: ""When I consider the totality of the information available, I don't think the deer herd has dwindled -- decreased somewhat, maybe, but not substantially.""

OK, let’s get out of the woods.

Walker points to ""political games"" by Doyle and the DNR, whom he blames for the state’s ""dwindling"" deer population. That view is certainly shared by many frustrated hunters. However, Walker’s statement leaves out critical information: The size of the deer herd, itself an estimate, is down by design, not by mistake.

The goals are based on a system built on input from across the state and attempt to balance the concerns of hunters against those of farmers and drivers. Indeed, it has been successful in helping reduce the number of car-deer accidents. What’s more, in response to pressure from hunters, the 2010 population goal was increased.

We rate Walker’s statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-dnr-has-mismanaged-states-deer-h/
"['Social Security', 'Texas', 'Bill Flores']","
Bill Flores says he has consistently opposed raising the retirement age
","
In France, the president’s push to raise the age at which residents qualify for retirement benefits incited violent protests. In Texas, a Republican candidate speculated about trying something similar here and protested his own remarks. 
Bill Flores of Bryan, the Republican challenger to ninth-term U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, said in an Oct. 12 TV interview that he didn't oppose raising the age at which seniors can receive Social Security checks to 70. ""I'd have to look at what the actual economics are,"" Flores told WFAA-TV in Dallas. ""I'm not philosophically opposed to raising the retirement age... I accept the fact that I may have to raise my retirement age for that."" 
Flores' comment was politically daring, though it's not out of step with talk among Washington wonks. In July, the nonpartisan Urban Institute said in a fact sheet on retirement policy that increasing Social Security's retirement age ""appears to be gaining political traction,"" noting that in June, the majority and minority leaders of the U.S. House ""expressed willingness to raise the retirement age."" On its sheet, the institute lists pros and cons to raising the retirement age. Currently, beneficiaries can receive reduced-benefit checks starting at age 62 or choose to get full benefits starting at age 66. 
In short, raising the retirement age would promote work at older ages, improve the Social Security system's solvency by shortening retirements and reducing lifetime benefits, and better target benefits to the oldest Americans, according to the institute. Among the pitfalls, a new hardship could be imposed on workers with health problems unless Congress improves other programs and raising the retirement age could strain low-skilled workers. 
Then again, Flores insisted shortly after the WFAA interview that he didn't mean what he said. Before the news clip aired on Oct. 17, Flores asked the station to not run it. According to an Oct. 15 news story posted on WFAA, Flores said he had a ""headache"" during the interview and ""misspoke."" 
Also Oct. 15, Flores issued this statement, according to WFAA: ""Voters should be assured that I absolutely do not support raising the retirement age for Social Security."" 
Three days later, according to WFAA, Flores was interviewed on College Station's WTAW-AM, saying: ""I am philosophically opposed to raising the retirement age. I misspoke and said I was not philosophically opposed."" 
In his own interview, aired by WFAA Oct. 17, Edwards said: ""I would not vote to raise the retirement age to 70 because there are just too many Americans that work hard all their lives and just simply physically couldn't work until they are 70."" 
Edwards subsequently lampooned Flores for backpedaling. In an Oct. 22 press release about the candidates' upcoming debates, Edwards spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said: ""After claiming that a 'headache' caused Mr. Flores to say he is 'not philosophically opposed' to raising the Social Security retirement age to 70, we wonder if any ailments will sway his position at these upcoming debates."" 
The same day, the Waco Tribune-Herald added fuel to the fire with a news story based on conservative radio host Shane Warner of Waco publicizing an April interview he had with Flores. In the interview, the audio of which Warner excerpted on his blog Oct. 19, Flores seems to agree that changing the retirement age should be considered. 
Said Warner: ""And how do we do that, what specifically, I mean, do we raise the retirement age? Do we start cutting benefits? What do we do?"" 
Flores: ""I think almost everything has to be on the table... You've got to look at a way to grow the economy higher so that you have more tax revenues going into the system, you've got to look at different retirement ages that are based on today's lifespan, and you've also got to look at how we grow the Social Security trust fund itself."" 
When we followed up with the Flores campaign, spokesman Matt Mackowiak sent a statement from Flores: ""I am against raising the retirement age. I have been consistent in saying we have to grow our economy and create more jobs to fill Social Security's $16 trillion unfunded liability."" Mackowiak told us that he doesn't think the April radio clip ""disproves that."" 
In a statement following the WFAA interview from the Flores campaign that Warner posted on his blog, Flores said: ""I have consistently opposed raising the retirement age for Social Security."" 
On the blog, Warner counters: ""That's not true. He told me in the spring that changing the retirement age should be an option that's on the table to improve the system. Many Republicans talk tough about fiscal responsibility until the stuff starts to hit the fan."" 
Our finding? Flores now says he firmly opposes raising the retirement age and has done so consistently. But twice he has said he's open to looking at raising it. 
Grab the aspirin. This is a Full Flop on the Flip-O-Meter. 
We have updated this story to correct the Social Security retirement age that Megan Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Rep. Chet Edwards, said Bill Flores said he is 'not philosophically opposed' to raising it to. Jacobs said that Flores said he 'is not philosophically opposed' to raising it to 70, not 80.",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/bill-flores/bill-flores-says-he-has-consistently-opposed-raisi/

Florida House candidate Lizbeth Benacquisto accused of 105 election law violations
","
It seems like every other ad on television is a campaign attack. It must be election season.   
One advertisement that caught our attention was a claim by District 27 state Senate candidate Kevin Rader against his Republican opponent Lizbeth Benacquisto.  
Rader beat Democratic opponent Pete Burkert by about 1,000 votes in the Aug. 24, 2010, primary election. Rader and Benacquisto are vying for the seat vacated by Dave Aronberg, who lost the Democratic primary for attorney general in August. The district runs from Republican-heavy Lee County through rural Glades and Hendry counties and into Democratic-heavy Palm Beach County.  
During a recent television ad, Rader attacks Benacquisto for 105 Florida election law violations. The advertisement, which features a picture of Benacquisto and mathematical symbols and equations, includes this:  
""Let’s do the math on Lizbeth Benacquisto. She broke election law 105 times, hiding special interest contributors. She claims she’s a tax cutter, but on city council, she repeatedly raised taxes and fees, totaling a 52 percent tax increase. One hundred five ethics violations; 52 percent tax increase. We can’t afford Lizbeth Benacquisto, or believe her.""  
That seems like a large number of violations, so we wanted to put Rader’s claim to the Truth-O-Meter test.  
The source for the ad is a Palm Beach Post article published April 9, 2006, and written by Dwayne Robinson.  
The article focuses on Wellington village council members and their myriad mistakes in campaign record filings during the March 14, 2006, municipal election in Palm Beach County. Benacquisto was elected vice mayor with more than 56 percent of the vote over challengers Julio Galvez and Jean Lexima.  
The Rader ad focuses on an allegation against Benacquisto that in more than 105 instances, her reports excluded the occupations of donors giving more than $100 to her campaign. The article states many of those donors ""were developers, builders, Big Sugar and other special interests.""  
Florida law requires each report to contain the full name, address and occupation of anyone who has made a contribution, along with amount and date of such contribution. 
Mercedes Kelly, then Benacquisto’s campaign treasurer, told the Post she started including contributors’ occupations at the beginning of the campaign, but trailed off as the money came in. She admitted to being overwhelmed and said she would be filing an addendum with the complete information. 
According to 2006 campaign finance reports, Benacquisto filed addendums, writing by hand each person’s occupation for two filing periods, January through mid February and mid February through March. There were indeed builders and farmers, but also housewives, retirees and veterinarians.  
This was a situation where the same error was made 105 times, not 105 different types of errors. Still, Benacquisto had 108 contributors for 2006, so missing occupations on 105 of them meant nearly all her donors were not listed correctly. 
For a third filing period, in 2005 but part of the same election cycle, no addendum was filed. In that 2005 period, occupations weren’t listed for 53 of the 78 contributors.  
The 2006 article points out that during a 2002 village election, Benacquisto had no election law errors and fully reported donors’ occupations. Since the municipal election was four years ago and the omissions were publicized, we were curious how Benacquisto was doing this time. We looked at her filings for the 2010 Senate race. We found that of 673 contributions to Benacquisto so far this year, 150 times the occupation isn’t listed, according to information on the Florida Division of Elections website.  
In fairness, we’ll note that in Rader’s last report, for the period of Sept. 25 through Oct. 8, he also fails to list occupation 14 times among the 104 donors, according to the state Division of Elections website. 
Florida Election Commission Clerk Patsy Rushing said on Oct. 21 that no complaints have been filed against Benacquisto in this race.  
We’ll leave it up to you to determine whether there’s intent to leave off contributors’ names or just sloppiness by the campaign.  
But as for the truth of the matter, we rate Rader’s claim that Benacquisto ""broke election law 105 times"" as True.",/factchecks/2010/oct/24/kevin-rader/florida-house-candidate-lizabeth-benaquist-accused/

Cicilline says Loughlin voted to let people accused of domestic violence keep their guns
","
The new spate of political ads that have flooded the airwaves seem better suited to Halloween than the Election Day that follows it.

With haunting music and ominous narration, they sound more like ads for horror movies than political commercials.  

One example is a radio advertisement from David Cicilline's campaign that begins with the narrator's somber warning: ""State Representative John Loughlin is running for Congress.""

A worried-sounding woman chimes in: ""I heard his ideas are really out there.""

""How extreme is he?"" asks a second elderly voice, full of alarm.

""So extreme that John Loughlin voted to let people accused of domestic violence keep their guns.""

Pause.

""Doesn't he know how dangerous that is?"" a third frightened voice wants to know.

We here at PolitiFact aren't easily spooked; we just like to know the truth. So we tuned out the dramatic flourish and got to work checking out the claim.

The vote Cicilline's ad talks about was on a 2005 bill in the Rhode Island General Assembly -- now a law -- that allows judges to require those subject to permanent domestic violence restraining orders to surrender their firearms.

Rhode Island was the 41st state to enact this law, as part of a push by domestic violence advocates to protect victims.

After multiple amendments that carved out exemptions for police officers and active duty military personnel to keep their service weapons while on duty, the Rhode Island bill made it to the floor in June 2005.

Once there, it underwent several more changes, one of them spearheaded by Loughlin, a representative from Tiverton,  who successfully advocated to exempt on-duty National Guard members from the provision as well.

The House bill passed in a 46-20 vote on June 22, 2005, with Loughlin voting no. The Senate approved the same legislation days later and the bill was signed into law in early July.

The problem with the Cicilline advertisement's claim is that it incorrectly says the bill applies to those ""accused of domestic violence."" A restraining order is actually a civil document that can be obtained without accusing the subject of a specific crime.

""It may be to prevent something from happening,"" explained Deb DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""[The victim] may have been threatened or in fear of abuse, but no crime has been committed.""

Nowhere does the 2005 bill suggest one must be accused of a crime to have the statute apply.

Cicilline overstates the scope of the bill that Loughlin voted against. But he is correct to suggest that if Loughlin's side had prevailed, those subject to domestic violence restraining orders would be allowed to keep their guns.

We asked Loughlin's campaign manager to explain why he voted against the 2005 bill. Her answer:

""John is a supporter of the Second Amendment and he voted against this bill because it was too broad and he was concerned that there was no distinction made between handguns and antique collectibles or family heirlooms.""

That may be true, but it doesn't change the accuracy of Cicilline's statement. We rate it Mostly True.
