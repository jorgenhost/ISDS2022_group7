John Kasich says Democratic opposition amounted to an unprecedented smear campaign
","
Republican John Kasich, who narrowly defeated embattled Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland on Nov. 2, is still angry about the negative campaign the governor and his supporters employed trying to secure a second term.

In nearly every interview and speech following his victory, Kasich has raised the issue, complaining that he had to beat back an unprecedented effort to destroy his good name. During one event with reporters, he even called on teacher unions that backed Strickland to place full-page newspaper ads in Ohio papers apologizing to him.

Such statements raise an obvious question: Is Kasich the victim of politics gone wild — or is he just nursing thin-skin wounds?

To get at the answer, Politicfact decided to check Kasich’s statement on the matter. Addressing a group of lobbyists Nov. 4 in Columbus, Kasich offered the following evidence that his enemies were stalking him while he tried to run a simple positive campaign.

""I had 12 visits by a president, somewhere between $45 (million) and $50 million (spent against him,) 500 paid volunteers in here calling me every name in the book, former presidents, first ladies and God-knows-who-else, and we beat all of them. And if you think you’re going to stop us, you’re crazy. You will not stop us. We will beat you. And that’s not arrogance.""

He made similar remarks a day earlier to Fox News, claiming the president campaigned against him 12 times and that he and other politicians and Democratic workers ""threw the kitchen sink at me.""

Because it’s tough to quantify what constitutes the political kitchen sink these days, we’ll examine his statement to lobbyists and the specific figures he cites within it.

In the first part of the statement, Kasich clearly suggests that President Barack Obama visited Ohio a dozen times to campaign against him.

Obama has indeed visited Ohio 12 times since taking office in January 2009. But a review of Obama’s travel schedule and the text of all the speeches he made here offers a different picture.

Obama, for instance, visited Ohio on March 3, 2009, a full two months before Kasich even announced his candidacy.

And of Obama’s 12 trips, nine were made under the guise of official White House business during which he pushed specific policies – mainly health care reform and the economic stimulus bill.

Two trips this year, Oct. 17 and Oct. 31,  were made specifically to campaign for Strickland and the Democratic ticket. And on a trip made Aug. 18, Obama hosted a fund-raiser for Strickland and in a separate event pushed his economic polices.

Transcripts from Obama’s non-campaign visits show he referred to Republicans in Washington many times in arguing that his policies are better than GOP plans. But Obama never mentioned the governor’s race or Kasich.

Obama never mentioned Kasich at the Oct. 17 campaign rally before 35,000 people in Columbus, either.  He named Kasich twice at his Oct. 31 rally in Cleveland, including in this passage: ""Kasich and (U.S. Senate candidate) Rob Portman, they want to do what they’ve always done. They’re not bad guys, they just have a whole different view of how real folks live. Ladies and gentlemen, these guys want to continue to give tax breaks to companies who send their jobs to China.""

As for Kasich’s claim that his enemies spent between $45 and $50 million against him: The final accounting by the campaigns has not been made public yet. And the total expenditures of the Democratic campaign can vary widely depending on what groups are included and what parameters – campaign activities television ads vs. radio buys vs. mailers vs. voter mobilization – are applied.

Kasich says his figure includes Strickland, the Ohio Democratic Party, several union-sponsored political action committees and a union funded independent groups and that they spent $30 million on television and radio advertising alone, based on data from its media buyer. He estimates that these groups and others spent at least another $15 million on direct mail, phone banking and voter mobilization, which is harder to track.

""I have no idea how much the teachers unions spent in direct mail, but I'm looking at a 4-inch tall stack of mailers, each of them different,"" Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said in defense of estimates.

Though exact campaign totals are not yet available, Kasich’s figure is likely in the ballpark in terms of what was spent by these group.

What is fact at the moment is that Strickland’s campaign raised nearly $18.5 million through Oct. 13, according to its most recent campaign report. The Ohio Democratic Party raised nearly $9.5 million through the same date. And unions have spent millions on ads in Ohio based on earlier media reports.

Stepping back briefly, Strickland aired many television ads painting Kasich as untrustworthy because of his ties to the failed Wall Street investment firm Lehman Brothers, where Kasich worked as a managing director. Other groups, including unions, used similar themes. But advertising by Strickland and allied groups also included plenty run of the mill attacks about trade and tax issues Kasich supported or opposed when he was a member of Congress. And these ads mirrored the theme and tone of Democratic ads airing in other tight races in Ohio and around the country.

Though Kasich may be close on his spending figures, he leaves out important context: Not every dollar spent by the Ohio Democratic Party and others was used specifically for Strickland and against Kasich.

Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Seth Bringman points out that the party’s expenditures were made for voter mobilization for the entire ticket.

""The purpose of those resources was not to attack John Kasich,"" he said, pointing out that party didn’t air a single ad about Kasich or anyone else.

Kasich’s statement also leaves out the fact that his Democratic enemies didn’t spend their money in a vacuum. Kasich, the Ohio Republican Party and independent groups spent tens of millions on Kasich’s behalf.

Kasich himself raised more money than any gubernatorial candidate in history, except Strickland. He banked $16 million through Oct. 13 and also received large cover from the Republican Governors Association, which acknowledged it spent $11 million on Kasich's behalf.

The bulk of Kasich’s and the RGA’s ads described Strickland as a failure and blamed him for Ohio’s 400,000 job losses.

Former President Bill Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden each made several stops in Ohio on Strickland’s behalf. First Lady Michele Obama joined her husband during the Oct. 17 visit. And the Ohio Democratic Party had the largest paid field staff of any state party in the country. But it employed 300 workers, not 500.

So where does this leave Kasich on the Truth-O-Meter? 
  
Taken together, Kasich’s claims in his colorful speech to lobbyists offer the same dramatic flair as the campaign ads he so detests.  But he overstates some key facts and presents some other details out of context.

So while Politifact Ohio can’t tell Kasich to take a deep breath and savor his victory, we can evaluate the accuracy of his statement. We rate Kasich’s claims Half True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/15/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-democrats-targeted-his-gop-gubern/
"['Federal Budget', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Mark Warner']","
Warner says the deficit would grow by $65 billion ""if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes.”
","
Sen. Mark Warner is pitching a plan that would allow some Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled and apply the additional tax revenue toward business tax cuts and incentives to spur the economy.

Laying out his plan in an Op-Ed in the Financial Times, Warner notes that a Republican-Democrat compromise is being considered by the Obama administration that would temporarily extend all the tax breaks for two more years.   

""However, this latter approach has problems beyond the $65bn that would be added to the deficit if we keep the cuts for people on the highest incomes,"" Warner writes. ""In Washington such ‘temporary’ benefits also have a strange way of becoming permanent.""

Since Warner’s own plan hinges on reapplying the $65 billion in additional tax revenue that would come from allowing the tax breaks for the wealthy to expire, we thought it prudent to check the figure.

Asked for the source, Warner’s communication director Kevin Hall pointed to estimates by the U.S. Treasury.

Those projections show that allowing the cuts to expire along with adjustments to the capital gains and dividends would amount to $74.4 billion over two years.

Here’s why we mention that factor: If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire as scheduled, the top tax rate on long-term capital gains would rise from 15 percent to 20 percent. Dividends, which are currently taxed at 15 percent, would be taxed at the same rates as ordinary income with a top rate of 39.9 percent.

But if we look exclusively at allowing the Bush cuts to expire, it’s $62.5 billion for the two years.

Hall said Warner excludes the capital gains and dividends change because they might not be enacted, ""and capital gains isn’t really what people talk about when they say ‘income taxes.’""

Gerald Prante, senior economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, disagreed on that point. He also  suggested looking at more recent figures from the Office of Management and Budget, noting that the Treasury numbers are based upon estimates that have since been revised.

The OMB figures show that allowing the cuts for the wealthy to expire would generate more than $66 billion in tax revenue over two years. But that’s including the adjustment to the capital gains.

Without it, the two-year total is closer to $57 billion.

Its worth noting, however, that the numbers from both sources look at the revenue to be gained from repealing the tax cuts permanently as opposed to eliminating them after a two-year extension.

""If there was only a two-year extension, the cost may not be $66 billion as [the] Joint Committee on Taxation/Treasury would assume tax planning that could change the costs, moving income between years,"" noted Prante. ""But overall, Warner's claim is fine...the $65 billion figure is not an exaggeration.""

So, if we use the Treasury’s numbers, and look exclusively at the tax revenue raised by the two years worth of repealed cuts for the wealthy, then Warner is very close.

Using the more recent OMB figures, he’d be nearer  by including the capital gains adjustment, but is still in the neighborhood.

Accepting that pinpointing a number using evolving projections is not an exact science, we find Warner’s claim to be Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2010/nov/14/mark-warner/warner-says-deficit-would-grow-65-billion-if-we-ke/

State Democratic Party says Scott Walker’s campaign chair killed the release of a damaging report before the election
","
It’s a rare day when the internal workings of the Greater Milwaukee Committee, a powerful and decidedly private civic organization, become the stuff of campaign attack fodder.

And post-campaign attack fodder.

But that’s exactly what happened in connection with a long-awaited report from the group, which has been looking into ways to rescue financially troubled Milwaukee County. In September, the group decided to wait until after the Nov. 2 election to release the report.

The catch: Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker was running as a Republican for governor. And his campaign chairman, Michael Grebe, is chairman of the GMC board.

Ultimately, word got out about the report -- which is actually just a set of not-yet-released recommendations, including that the county is in such dire shape state lawmakers should OK legislation allowing it to declare bankruptcy. That was courtesy of the Oct. 9, 2010 No Quarter column, written by Dan Bice, in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

The report drew fireworks in the campaign.

And now in the transition: When Walker named Grebe as a co-chair of his transition team on Nov. 5, 2010,  the state Democratic Party fired off a biting two paragraph news release with the headline: ""Walker rewards his ‘Cleaner.’""

The release claimed ""Grebe killed the release of a damaging report on Walker’s record in the days leading up to the election."" It went on to quote party chairman Mike Tate saying Walker had driven the county to the point of bankruptcy and Grebe ""did a good job keeping a report that detailed these facts from the public.""

That’s a lot of punch to pack into two paragraphs.

But is it true?

Much as in a courtroom, we believe the burden of proof lies with the person making the statement -- in this case the state Democratic Party.

Their news release included a link to Bice’s column.

PolitiFact Wisconsin asked if there was anything else, but the party did not respond.

So we’ll start with the column, but we won’t stop there.

In the piece, Grebe said it was Julia Taylor, who is president of the GMC and reports to the board, who recommended delaying the release of the report. Grebe agreed, then presented the idea to the full board -- a 32-member group composed of business, labor and civic leaders with ties to both parties -- and the board agreed.

That meeting was Sept. 8, six days before Walker won the GOP nomination.

Grebe repeated this account to PolitiFact Wisconsin, saying it was a group decision. Taylor supported this account. So did Sheldon Lubar, who headed the group’s task force on county government.

Taylor and Grebe told us they didn’t want the report to get ground up in election partisanship and therefore become irrelevant. They said they also wanted to review what other states have done in similar circumstances. Lubar said the recommendations were not final and needed more vetting by groups in the community.

So, it is clear Grebe played a role in the report’s delay.

But did he singlehandedly kill it for partisan gain as the Democrats allege?

Grebe was deeply involved in the election, beyond just the fancy title of Walker campaign chairman. As president and chief executive officer of the Milwaukee-based Bradley Foundation, Grebe personally gave a total of $50,000 to the Republican Governors Association in the past year -- a group behind a major anti-Barrett TV campaign.

After the No Quarter column came out, Grebe didn’t hesitate to mix the two jobs -- he responded to criticism of Walker by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, the Democratic nominee, and defended Walker’s record on fiscal issues.

Grebe told us he did not think it was necessary to recuse himself from discussion on that item: ""I'm still the chairman of the organization. I did the right thing to bring it to the board.""

But getting at whether Grebe personally pushed for the decision -- and whether his motive would have been protecting Walker -- is difficult given the private nature of the group.

We talked to various members of the group, including some considered more sympathetic to Democrats. None provided any evidence that Grebe pushed the delay -- and none said there was dissent over the decision to delay.

One preferred a mid-campaign release but was not asked for an opinion. Some would not talk on the record, with one citing fear of retribution within the group.

Lubar told us more work was needed on the recommendations, but by other accounts the proposals -- initially expected by summer -- were pretty far along by the Sept. 8 meeting. One board member, union leader Candice Owley, said she sent her comments on the recommendations to the board for that meeting.

And H. Carl Mueller, a public relations executive and member of the group’s board and its county task force, was starting in mid-September to line up a newspaper story on the bankruptcy recommendation. His firm does work for the board.

Mueller told us he was just laying the groundwork for a post-election story on the recommendations (which still have not been formally finalized or released). Mueller said he got no marching orders from Grebe.

Lubar, who gave $10,000 to Walker’s campaign and $5,000 to Barrett’s campaign, said the document  leaked to Bice was a list of options, not a final set of recommendations, and that Grebe was ""not a player"" in determining them and had not suggested a timetable for release.

""Grebe had zero to do with it,"" Lubar said.

That’s a very different statement than the Democrats’ claim.

So, where does that leave us?

With no direct evidence, the state Democrats allege Walker rewarded Grebe for burying a damaging report. As Greater Milwaukee Committee chairman, Grebe had the means, motive and opportunity to delay the report -- but in trying to connect the dots, Democrats ignore the most important one: evidence he actually did it. The column they cite raises that as a possibility, but does not state it as fact. Indeed, the column -- and our reporting -- includes people who say the opposite, that it was a group decision, albeit one Grebe acknowledges supporting.

If the party or others produce a smoking gun, we would revisit our determination. But we’re left with the facts in evidence and find the statement Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/14/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/state-democratic-party-says-scott-walkers-campaign/

Rick Perry says Social Security is a Ponzi scheme
","
One of the most talked-about comments from the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s claim that Social Security is a ""Ponzi scheme."" At the Sept. 12, 2011, GOP debate in Tampa, Perry toned down his rhetoric somewhat -- but didn’t disown the phrase that caused such a stir. 
The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme became fodder for sparring between Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- the two candidates many observers consider the frontrunners for the nomination. 

Romney and his camp argued that the comparison of the retirement-security program for older Americans to an insidious financial fraud raised questions about Perry’s commitment to the program, which remains popular among Americans, and particularly older Americans who are statistically likelier to vote.

Here’s the original quote and context from the Sept. 7 debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif.:

""People who are on Social Security today, men and women who are receiving those benefits today, are individuals at my age that are in line pretty quick to get them, they don't need to worry about anything. But I think the Republican candidates are talking about ways to transition this program, and it is a monstrous lie. It is a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old today, you're paying into a program that's going to be there. Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids, and it's not right.""

Perry didn’t explicitly back away from the term, but he has sought to reframe the issue in a less polarizing fashion. In an op-ed in USA Today titled, ""Rick Perry: I am going to be honest with the American people,"" Perry didn’t mention the phrase ""Ponzi scheme,"" but he reiterated his concerns about Social Security’s financial outlook using less controversial language.

""Our elected leaders must have the strength to speak frankly about entitlement reform if we are to right our nation's financial course and get the USA working again,"" he said, adding, ""We must have the guts to talk about its financial condition if we are to fix Social Security and make it financially viable for generations to come.""

During the Sept. 12 CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Perry why he had changed his tone in the op-ed.

Perry maintained the cooler tone but didn’t back away from the terminology. ""Well, first off, the people who are on Social Security today need to understand something,"" he said. ""Slam-dunk guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place for those. Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there.

""But the idea that we have not had the courage to stand up and look Americans in the face, young mid-career professionals or kids that are my children's age and look them in the eye and said, listen, this is a broken system. It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long
before me. But no one's had the courage to stand up and say, here is how we're going to reform it.

""We're going to transform it for those in those mid-career ages, but we're going to fix it so that our young Americans that are going out into the workforce today will know without a doubt that there were some people who came along that didn't lie to them, that didn't try to go around the edges and told them the truth.""

As Perry noted, he was hardly the first person to compare Social Security to a Ponzi scheme; it has popped up frequently as an analogy among conservatives for many years. And in the wake of Perry’s comment, conservatives have gleefully dug up examples of liberals writing similar comparisons. A Sept. 12 article in the conservative National Review Online by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, detailed Ponzi comparisons made by a half-dozen left-of-center columnists, including William Raspberry, Max Frankel and Michael Kinsley.

Still, Perry’s use of the comparison in the midst of a heated Republican primary campaign has attracted far more public and media attention than previous mentions -- and the fact many commentators have made this case doesn’t mean the comparison is justified. So we thought it would be worth recapping the evidence we’ve found for and against the idea that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.

*****

So what is a Ponzi scheme? PolitiFact Texas looked at this question when researching the issue for a fact-check of Perry’s Ponzi-related comments from November 2010, when he was touring to promote his book, Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington.

According to an online post by the Social Security Administration, the term originates with Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware his ""profits"" consisted of money paid in by other investors.

""The reason that this is a scheme and not an investment strategy is that the geometric progression it depends on is unsustainable,"" the government post says. ""You must continually get more and more new people into the system to pay off the promises to the earlier members.""

In contrast, the administration says, Social Security is more like a ""pay-as-you-go"" system transferring payroll tax payments by American workers to American retirees. Its web post closes: ""The first modern social insurance program began in Germany in 1889 and has been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days.""

When PolitiFact Texas asked Perry for back-up on his Ponzi scheme description, his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said that ""this year, Social Security is expected to pay out more in benefits than it collects in taxes. Americans today are being forced to pay for a program that they will no longer see any benefit from or return on their investment as it currently stands, similar to a Ponzi scheme.""

So how valid is the comparison?

Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University journalism professor who has written a book on Ponzi, noted three critical dissimilarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme, which by definition is both fraudulent and unsustainable.

""First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled,"" Zuckoff wrote in a January 2009 article in Fortune. ""...Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns.""

Second, he wrote, ""A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted. That's when the last people to participate are out of luck; the music stops and there's nowhere to sit. It's true that Social Security faces a huge burden — and a significant, long-term financing problem — in light of retiring Baby Boomers. … But Social Security can be, and has been, tweaked and modified to reflect changes in the size of the taxpaying workforce and the number of beneficiaries. It would take great political will, but the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing.""

Third, Zuckoff wrote, ""Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme... At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see ""Social"") resolved to create a safety net (see ""Security"") in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers. By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones.That might rankle, but it's not fraud... None of this is to suggest that Social Security is a perfect system or that there aren't sizeable problems facing the incoming administration and Congress. But it's not a Ponzi scheme. And Ponzi himself, who died in a hospital charity ward with only enough money for his burial, would never have recognized it as his own.""

We agree with Zuckoff’s interpretation. We rated Perry's November 2010 comparison of Social Security and Ponzi schemes False, and we stand by that ruling. The comparison still deserves a rating of False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/13/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-social-security-ponzi-scheme/
"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Taxes', 'Lincoln Chafee']","
Chafee quotes 'experts' as saying a sales tax increase would be less harmful to economic growth than higher property taxes
","
Lincoln Chafee's plan to impose a 1-percent sales tax on currently exempt items was clearly the most controversial proposal of his 2010 campaign. During his first news conference as governor-elect, Chafee was asked about the prospect of having the General Assembly pass it.

""I'm open to better ideas, but I am going to be a fierce protector of the property tax,"" he said. ""I do firmly believe, as the experts have said, that that's the most harmful to economic growth and that's what we want in the state, economic growth. And the sales tax is least harmful to economic growth. While no tax is good, let that sink in. We want economic growth. Let's go with the one that's least harmful.""

Chafee had made a similar assertion 10 months earlier when he announced his run for governor and proposed the tax.

We were curious whether tax experts really believed that a sales tax increase imposed by the state is less harmful to economic recovery than a property tax hike, which can be forced on municipalities if the state cuts aid to cities and towns.

Our first stop was to the Chafee transition team, which gave us a PowerPoint presentation made in September at a Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council forum for the gubernatorial candidates. The author is Joseph Henchman, director of state projects at The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues.

Henchman's data included some interesting information, such as the fact Rhode Island gets significantly more state and local revenue from property taxes and less from the sales tax than the national average.

But the presentation says nothing about which type of tax is more harmful or beneficial to economical growth. Neither did a Wall Street Journal editorial on taxes that the Chafee team supplied to us. So we asked for other, more relevant information.

Meanwhile, we did our own poking around.

The Tax Foundation ranks states based on their business-friendly tax climate. Their latest index, based on data as of July 1, 2010, has Rhode Island 42nd, up from 44th the previous year. (The higher the number, the worse it is for business.) If a company is thinking of starting or relocating here, the fact that we're in the bottom 10 could influence that decision.

That ranking is influenced by how much various items are taxed. In addition, the foundation gives more emphasis to the sales tax (where Rhode Island ranks well, at 14th) than corporate taxes (where we rank 37th) or property taxes (where we rank 47th) when it does its ranking.

""A lot of businesses take the index as a first step"" in deciding where to go or expand, said Kail Padgitt, a staff economist at the foundation.

So because it emphasizes the sales tax more than the property tax, Rhode Island's overall ranking when it comes to the business tax climate would be disproportionately harmed if we increase the sales tax.

Padgitt referred us to a study by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international agency founded to help its 33 member countries find the best economic policies.

The OECD's 2008 study of tax structures and economic growth says that when taxation is necessary, a stronger reliance on property taxes is the best method for encouraging an economy to grow, followed by consumption taxes, such as sales taxes. High corporate taxes, it concluded, were the worst when it came to increasing the gross domestic product (GDP).

""Comparing only consumption taxes and property taxes, both of which seem superior to income taxes, it is property taxes, and particularly recurrent taxes on immovable property, that appear to be associated with the highest levels of GDP per capita,"" the report says.

So this organization disagrees with Chafee.

On the other hand, Wendy Schiller, professor of political science and public policy at Brown University, said she could see how high property taxes would be a big factor in stifling economic growth in Rhode Island, especially in communities like Providence, where the taxes are used to finance schools that are regarded as inferior.

""Over the long haul, it really deters the kind of people with innovative ideas for new businesses and professionals who may want to work in Boston but want to live somewhere else,"" she said. ""They're going to live and spend money here, but not if they have to pay for private school.""

Kim Rueben, a public finance economist at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., said Chafee's assertion is ""way too strong"" and overly simplistic. ""Whether raising taxes actually impacts your ability to attract businesses has a lot to do with what you actually spend those revenues on,"" she said. For example, financing a good network of roads or building a top-notch educational system ""are things that businesses value and leads to positive economic activity.""

When we finally heard back from the Chafee team, spokesman Mike Trainor sent us directly to Henchman, the Tax Foundation official who made the September presentation.

When we asked Henchman about Chafee's statement, he told us, ""It's difficult to make a broad claim like that. It depends pretty much on circumstances.""

But what about the OECD's conclusion that property taxes hurt economic growth least and the foundation's own emphasis on giving states lower rankings if their sales tax is high? Henchman said that advice works on a large scale. But when it comes to an individual state, things can be different.

He said Rhode Island has one of the better sales tax systems, yet ""the property tax, by contrast, is one of the worst in the country. It's very high, very complex.""

Henchman said he would recommend doing whatever could be done to relieve the property tax burden. A good way to do that would be to take the sales tax and smooth out its selective nature, which he said creates ""distortions"" in a system by taxing different items at different levels.

He recommends getting rid of complicated tax systems that require extra administrative costs and systems that favor certain industries, activities or products. It can get silly to place a high tax on prepared foods and no tax on groceries.

""The argument often made is that it's less regressive to exempt groceries, but poor people buy prepared food and rich people buy groceries,"" he said.

In the end, there is no consensus from the experts. An international report disagrees with Chafee, one expert says such ranking is too simplistic and another gave qualified support.

And even when the Chafee team found someone to support the assertion that property taxes are the most harmful to economic growth, it was with the caveat that the strategy is specific to Rhode Island's current circumstances.

But that's a distinction the governor-elect didn't make.

As a result, we rate Chafee's statement as Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/14/lincoln-chafee/chafee-quotes-experts-saying-sales-tax-increase-wo/
"['Alcohol', 'Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Richard Saslaw']","
Richard Saslaw says $65 million from ABC privitazation wouldn't even cover an overpass at Tysons Corner
","
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Richard Saslaw hasn’t hidden his opposition to ABC privatization, scoffing at predictions that auctioning off retail liquor licenses will generate major money for state roads.

After his first plan for total privatization stalled, Gov. Bob McDonnell is now exploring turning over only the the retail operation to the private sector.

According to a Washington Post report, Saslaw recently told the Alexandria City Council that if auctioning off the retail licenses generated $300 million (close to the original plan’s estimate), Northern Virginia could see between $60 million to $65 million.

That’s ""not even an overpass in Tysons Corner,"" Saslaw reportedly said.

Well, $65 million is more than couple cups of coffee, so we wondered if his claim was true.

PolitiFact Virginia attempted unsuccessfully to reach Saslaw. Because we don’t know if he had a particular overpass in mind, we took a broad look at the cost of building one in Northern Virginia.

Let’s start with the basics. Based on the cost of construction alone, Saslaw’s claim runs into trouble.

Kendal Walus, the state bridge engineer with the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the most recent estimates to build a bridge in Virginia is $237 per square foot. Of the 65 bridges built last year, the average square footage was 22,400.

That would make the cost for the average overpass about $5.3 million. But that figure doesn’t include the various other costs involved like engineering and land acquisition. And those vary.

""There could be quite a bit of range depending on how complex the bridges are,"" said Eric Teitelman, chief of the projects and operations division of the Fairfax County Department of Transportation. ""Of course, land cost can be a wild card in this whole thing. Tysons is a pretty expensive real estate area.""  

Teitelman estimated the average cost of an overpass in Northern Virginia at between $35 million to $40 million excluding land acquisition, but said it could soar as high as $100 million with a high elevation flyover.

""If you are talking just an overpass, not an interchange, $65 million should cover the construction cost,"" added John D. Lynch, an engineer with VDOT. ""However, a lot depends on impacts of the new bridge.  If significant right of way and/or utility impacts are realized, or impacts to existing businesses, these costs would escalate quickly.""

To get a better sense of normal costs, including land acquisition, we looked at a few projects underway and coming up in Northern Virginia.

An interchange getting underway at Fairfax County Parkway and Fair Lakes Parkway, for example, is estimated to cost $69.5 million. But that includes two overpasses and three miles worth of road widening. So, if we cut that in half, a single overpass and some of the widening work would be close to $35 million.  

In nearby Manassas, a four-lane overpass underway at Route 28 and Wellington Road is estimated to cost $44 million. Plans to replace the Washington Boulevard Bridge over Columbia Pike in Arlington -- part of the Pentagon Roadway Network -- is estimated to cost just under $60 million.   

Summary

Saslaw says that if Northern Virginia were to receive $60 million to $65 million it wouldn’t be enough to cover the cost of an overpass in Tysons Corner.

Based on the officials we spoke with, it’s possible that a major interchange in Tysons Corner could cost that much or more, especially when the cost of land acquisition is included. But our interviews and most of the examples cited by the officials indicate that Saslaw’s estimate is on the high end.

So we find his claim Barely True. ",/factchecks/2010/nov/14/richard-saslaw/richard-saslaw-says-65-million-abc-privitazation-w/
"['Oregon', 'Education', 'Portland Community College']","
 Portland Community College tries to put enrollment numbers in context, says it serves more students than the entire Oregon University System
","

It’s that time of the year again, when universities and colleges start to release their fall headcount numbers. Normally PolitiFact Oregon would leave this stuff to the education reporters -- except that one figure in the article Portland Community College wrote about its enrollment caught us by surprise.

After noting the total student headcount for this fall -- 41,409 -- PCC went on to say that annually, it serves ""more than 93,800 students ... (more than all of the state’s universities combined).""

It was that last note that gave us pause. Could one community college really be serving more people than the entire state university system? We decided to find out.

First, we went back to Portland Community College and asked for more specific numbers. Laura Massey, the college’s director of institutional analysis, said that for the 2009-2010 academic year, Portland Community College served roughly 93,799 students. So the news release had that number right.

Next we went to the Oregon University System to check out their numbers. Bob Kieran, the assistant vice chancellor of institutional research and planning, told us that, for the same time period, the state-run universities served 122,883 students.

It’s clear that, with these numbers, the statement in the PCC release doesn’t hold up.

Before we issued a verdict, though, we decided to look at the numbers one other way. Overall student headcount can be a little misleading in that it counts every student, no matter the amount of time they actually spend on campus. Say you decide to take a single photography course for leisure, well, you’re counted the same as a student going to school full time in pursuit of a degree.

Luckily, Oregon community colleges and universities are also required to report ""full-time equivalent"" numbers. That means they combine part-time students and count them as one full-time student. One full-time equivalent is equal to a student being fully enrolled for the fall, winter and spring terms of a given year.

According to Massey, for the 2009-2010 school year, Portland Community College counted 31,395 full-time equivalents. Kieran says the entire Oregon University System counted 80,944.

Again, the numbers don’t support the PCC claim. (That, of course, doesn’t diminish the fact that Portland Community College serves an awful lot of students each year.)

James Hill, the man who wrote the enrollment numbers article, said that ""it’s always been that case"" that PCC served more students annually. He said he would review his numbers and thanked us for pointing out the discrepancy.

Seeing as how neither the total headcount or full time equivalent figures back PCC up, we find this claim False.

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'History', 'Taxes', 'George W. Bush']","
Former President George W. Bush defends his fiscal record
","
During the tour to promote his presidential memoir, Decision Points, George W. Bush defended his fiscal record in an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today Show. 
In the interview, Bush said that the ratio of the deficit to gross domestic product during his time in office ""was lower than Ronald Reagan's by half. Lower than my dad's. And only [worse than] Bill Clinton among modern presidents. ... My debt to GDP was the lowest or one of the lowest of modern presidents. My taxes to GDP was the lowest and my spending to GDP"" was too. 
We thought it would be worthwhile to see if Bush was correct. So we turned to a historical table from the Office of Management and Budget that shows tax receipts, spending and the deficit as a percentage of GDP -- essentially, as a percentage of the nation's economy as a whole.

The challenge is figuring exactly how to compare recent presidents.

Let's start with the deficit. The most obvious way to do it is to add up all of the annual percentages for a president and divide by the number of years served, to produce an average.

Calculating it this way -- and beginning our list of ""modern"" presidents with President Dwight Eisenhower -- we came up with the following order: Eisenhower (deficits averaged 0.53 percent of GDP), Clinton (0.76 percent of GDP), Richard Nixon (0.93 percent), Lyndon Johnson (1.1 percent), George W. Bush (2.0 percent), Jimmy Carter (2.4 percent), George H.W. Bush (3.98 percent), Reagan (4.23 percent). (We excluded John F. Kennedy and Gerald Ford because of their short tenures.)

You can do the same with spending and tax receipts.

For spending as a percent of GDP, the ranking from low to high is Eisenhower (18.1 percent of GDP), Johnson (18.7 percent), Nixon (19.2 percent), George W. Bush (19.6 percent), Clinton (19.8), Carter (20.8), George H.W. Bush (21.9), and Reagan (22.4).

For tax receipts as a percentage of GDP, the ranking from low to high is Eisenhower (17.5 percent of GDP), Johnson and George W. Bush (tied at 17.6 percent), George H.W. Bush (17.9 percent), Reagan (18.2 percent), Nixon (18.3 percent), Carter (18.4 percent) and Clinton (19 percent).

Whether Bush is correct depends heavily on which presidents you consider ""modern."" If you only go back to Reagan -- the earliest president that Bush himself cited by name in the interview -- then Bush is basically correct. Only Clinton did better when measured by deficit as a percentage of GDP, while no president dating back to Reagan scored better on spending or tax receipts as a percentage of GDP.

By contrast, if you go back to Eisenhower -- the first fully post-World War II president -- Bush is in the middle of the pack on the deficit and on spending, and he's near the top on tax receipts.

But there's another way to look at the deficit -- to compare a president's first deficit as a percentage of GDP to their last. This shows what direction the deficit went during their tenures.

And on this one, George W. Bush does the worst of any president dating back to Eisenhower.

The younger Bush went from a 1.3 percent surplus to a 3.2 percent deficit, a decline of 4.5 percentage points. The best was Clinton, who moved the deficit from a 3.9 percent deficit to a 2.4 percent surplus -- a positive change of 6.3 percentage points. The other presidents all had changes up or down that were roughly two percentage points or smaller.

This suggests that Bush's fiscal record wasn't so sterling if you use a different measure than the one he did. But to analyze the accuracy of his statement, we'll stick closely to the words he used. George W. Bush is correct that he outperformed his father, Reagan and (mostly) Clinton. So if you consider those the ""modern"" presidents, he's essentially right. If you broaden the ""modern presidents"" to include those serving in the entire post-World War II period, Bush is about average. While we wouldn't have chosen to define the ""modern presidents"" to include just the four that Bush mentioned by name, we'll give him some deference in framing the question. So we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/13/george-w-bush/former-president-george-w-bush-defends-his-fiscal-/
"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Bob McDonnell says Virginia has gained 60,000 jobs since he became governor
","
It’s all about jobs, Gov. Bob McDonnell says.

During an Election Day interview, MSNBC  host Joe Scarborough hailed McDonnell as the ""Elvis"" of the job creation message that moved voters this fall. ""You started this in 2009 before anyone got this,"" Scarborough told the governor, referring to McDonnell’s pledge to create jobs during his successful campaign last year.

McDonnell replied that since taking office in January, ""we’ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs"" in Virginia.

We had two questions about McDonnell’s statement: Is his number right; and how much credit does the governor deserve for any upswing in Virginia employment since he took office?

We first checked the claim of ""about 60,000 net new jobs."" Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, said the number came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Our next call went to the office of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who heads McDonnell’s jobs team. Randy Marcus, Bolling’s chief of staff, compiles the job-creation figures for the administration. Marcus said he takes the most current BLS monthly figure for non-farm jobs in Virginia. Then he subtracts the number of non-farm jobs in Virginia in February, McDonnell’s first full month in office. The remainder is what the administration considers to be Virginia’s net job gain under McDonnell. It includes full and part-time jobs in the public and private sectors.

We ran the computation, based on the latest BLS numbers that had been posted more than a week before McDonnell’s appearance on MSNBC. Here’s our result:

Virginia Workers, Sept. 2010        3,637,200
Virginia Workers, Feb. 2010         3,581,800
Net job gain under McDonnell            55,400

The governor’s claim of creating about 60,000 new jobs was a tad inflated, but certainly in the ballpark.

In July, McDonnell claimed 71,500 new Virginia jobs had been created since he took office. We checked those numbers and found them dead on. Much of the job loss since then was caused by the layoff of federal census workers and the slowing of construction.

McDonnell also said on MSNBC that only Texas has gained more jobs than Virginia since February. He’s right, according to BLS statistics. Texas has added 128,800 jobs since February.

Virginia has experienced a 1.55 percent increase in jobs since February. That ranks sixth. The District of Columbia leads everyone with 2.38 percent growth.

Now, let’s look at McDonnell’s statement ""we’ve"" created about 60,000 jobs. It suggests the new slots are the result of his administration’s actions.

""It’s not unique to the Governor, but it bothers me how all politicians take credit for creating jobs,"" said John Knapp, senior economist for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia. ""Barack Obama is not president of the economy and Bob McDonnell is not governor of the economy. Of course, what they do can have a marginal affect on things, but there are many other elements involved in creating jobs.""

Knapp added that state policies affect job creation development over the long run. ""But as year or two out, new state policies are not going to have a major impact on the economy.""

During recent decades, an array of prominent publications have consistently rated Virginia in the top handful of business-friendly states, noting the Commonwealth’s low tax rates,  and laws barring compulsory union membership.

Johnson said it is not McDonnell’s intention to claim credit for all new jobs under his watch. ""It’s a cumulative effort,"" she said. ""It’s the private sector that creates jobs; government can merely help set a conducive climate.""

Johnson said that when McDonnell said ""we’ve"" created about 60,000 net new jobs, ""he was referring to Virginia.""

It’s noteworthy that this February -- the month McDonnell uses as the starting benchmark for his administration’s job efforts -- Virginia’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, the highest in 28 years. The unemployment rate in September dipped to 6.8 percent, ranking Virginia as the eighth lowest state.

The national unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in February and 9.6 percent in September.

The vast majority of new Virginia jobs since February fell into one of three broad categories: leisure and hospitality; professional and business services; or trade, transportation and utilities.

McDonnell, a Republican, has been praised by legislators from both political parties for aggressively recruiting new businesses.  Over the first nine months of his administration -- starting in February, as the governor prefers -- the state has announced 186 business development deals promising 12,249 new jobs, according to statistics kept by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.

In comparison, the state announced  213 development deals promising 11,656 new jobs during the final nine months of Gov. Tim Kaine’s term, ending in January.

It’s impossible to know how many how many of the jobs promised in state economic development announcements actually translate into employment gains recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many of the jobs are speculative and depend on construction and expansion of plants before people are hired.

So let’s review.

It’s clear the governor wants credit for the new jobs created in Virginia since February. But many factors beyond a governor’s purview influence employment figures and Virginia has benefited a strong business climate for decades. Some of the jobs filled since McDonnell took office were no doubt spawned by economic developments deals announced Kaine. It’s impossible to assign full credit to anyone.

Regardless of credit, have ""about 60,000 net new jobs"" been created in Virginia since February? It depends how you measure ""about."" The correct number at  the time was 55,400. The governor was a little bit off, but he wasn’t blowing smoke.

For that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/17/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-has-gained-60000-jobs-/

Rick Scott pays campaign workers with gift cards, not cash, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow claims
","Rick Scott poured $73 million of his own money into his successful campaign for governor.

Yet he wouldn't even pay his campaign workers in cash, says MSNBC liberal commentator Rachel Maddow. On her Nov. 10, 2010, show, Maddow said Scott inexplicably paid his campaign workers in American Express gift cards. Maddow made the claim in a rhetorical game of true or false, which you can watch here.

""The Republican who was just elected governor of the great state of Florida paid his campaign staffers, not with money, but with American Express gift cards for some reason. Is that true or false?"" Maddow asked.

""That is, ding, true. A young man named Mark Givens(sic), who said he found a job through the Rick Scott for governor campaign through a listing on Craigslist, has told local WTSP news station that he did not find out until after he had already worked for Rick Scott's campaign that Rick Scott's campaign would not pay him in, you know, money."" We wanted to check Maddow's claim with our own Truth-O-Meter game -- True or Pants on Fire! (Or somewhere in between).

Maddow said her source was WTSP, Tampa Bay's CBS affiliate, which ran a Nov. 8, 2010, report claiming that a Scott campaign worker named Mark Dongivin was paid in gift cards and not cash. Dongivin told the TV affiliate he worked on the Scott get-out-the-vote campaign off and on for about a month, walking neighborhoods and making phone calls. But when it was time to get paid, he was told there would be no checks.

""We can't give you a check, we're gonna give you gift cards,"" Dongivin said his supervisor told him. Dongivin said he wasn't the only Scott campaign worker to be paid in gift cards and not a check or cash.

The TV report went on to cite an unnamed spokesperson, something we won't do at PolitiFact Florida, who acknowledged some campaign workers were paid in gift cards, and that anyone who had a problem with the arrangement could return the cards for a check.

That's the background. Now for the details.

In the Republican primary, the Scott campaign used its own campaign account to pay for its staff. But after the primary, payroll responsibilities switched to the Republican Party of Florida. It's standard practice, in part because the party can receive larger campaign contributions than an individual candidate.

Scott spokesman Brian Burgess directed us to the party to answer questions about how staffers were paid. They 'fessed up. ""Like many other campaigns, gift cards were distributed to short-term Scott field staff almost exclusively for the final 72-hour field efforts,"" Republican Party of Florida spokesman Dan Conston said. ""It's a simpler and quicker way of compensating short-term help.""

Conston said a Scott campaign representative and someone from the party would approve the spending, but did not say who. Neither Conston nor Burgess said how many temporary campaign workers were paid in gift cards. Full-time staffers were paid by check, Conston said. Two other notes from Conston: He said the gift cards were only used in the last week of the campaign, and that because of service fees, the campaign actually paid above face value.

In Dongivin's case, he was a temporary worker hired to drive out voters on Election Day. Typically, it's a responsibility many people might associate with a volunteer -- and many campaigns use volunteers in the same way. Dongivin was paid $178 on Oct. 15, according to Republican Party of Florida campaign finance records. He also likely received a second payment on Oct. 31, 2010 -- though those records are not yet public.

We reached out to more than 20 people across the state who worked with the Scott campaign to see how they were paid. Most didn't respond to our messages, but those that did say they were paid in checks, just like every other employee they knew.

Michael Fluno worked out of the Tampa office of Scott's campaign until shortly after the primary and said he was always paid in checks. While Fluno was working on the campaign, he said, he ""knows, for a fact, that no one was paid with any kind of gift card.""

Same goes for Dean Palecheck, of Orlando, who worked on the campaign during both the primary and general election.

When asked how he was paid, Palecheck said: ""Paid by check, like any normal employee there.""

What's interesting here is that it's not new for campaigns to use gift cards to pay part-time, temporary workers. In fact, President Barack Obama's campaign did the same thing in 2008. A TV station in Indianapolis reported that last-minute workers for Obama's 2008 campaign were paid $30 Visa gift cards for three-hour shifts of work. The temporary workers complained to the TV station that they were not being paid fairly.

Which brings us back to Maddow. On her nationally televised cable program, the liberal commentator picked up on a local TV news report and claimed Scott ""paid his campaign staffers, not with money, but with American Express gift cards."" While she's right that Dongivin, and other temporary workers, were paid with gift cards and not cash, we think her comments are a bit misleading to the average viewer. First, we think many people might think Maddow was referring to all campaign workers, but traditional campaign staffers -- the people working day in and day out on the campaign -- were paid by check, like any normal job. A Republican Party official said it was simply an easier, more efficient and quicker way to pay people.  And second, it's not that unusual. In 2008, Obama did the same thing. Playing it up in Scott's case takes it out of context, so we rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/12/rachel-maddow/rick-scott-pays-campaign-workers-gift-cards-not-ca/

Anti-tax group says the lone Ohio incumbent to break tax pledge was soundly defeated
","
Americans for Tax Reform is becoming a force to be reckoned with in American politics. 
The anti-tax group, headed by conservative Grover Norquist, came up with a simple anti-tax pledge that became a must-sign for Republicans across the country running for Congress.

The pledge says that the signer will ""oppose and vote against any and all efforts to raise taxes"" and it was signed by those running from all kinds of offices from local races right on up to gubernatorial races across America.

In Ohio, the pledge was signed by GOP Congressional candidates galore as well as trio of Republicans who won statewide office on Nov. 2 -- Secretary of State-elect Jon Husted, State Auditor-elect David Yost and Gov.-elect John Kasich.

It was also signed by at least 22 Republicans who will be in the Ohio House, including the incoming House Speaker Bill Batchelder, a Medina Republican who comes into power after flipping at least a dozen seats (two seats still have automatic recounts on the way) to gain a 58-person majority in the 99-member chamber.

Hoping to trumpet the success of anti-tax candidates, Americans for Tax Reform put out a news release congratulating Kasich and Batchelder for their Election Day success.

In the release, they attempt to underscore the consequences for those who violate the pledge.

""It is a commitment voters take very seriously: The only incumbent in Ohio to break his Pledge and vote for Ted Strickland's income tax hike was defeated soundly on Tuesday.""

Because the pledge appears to be growing in popularity with the conservatives running all branches of state government, PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at this claim.

The incumbent the anti-tax group is referring to is the only House Democratic candidate to sign the pledge Rep. Dan Dodd of Hebron. And Dodd most assuredly did vote for Strickland's plan to push back the final year of a planned income tax cut -- what the anti-tax group and Republicans across Ohio say amounts to a tax hike.

However, it's a little stretch to say he was beaten ""soundly,"" as Dodd lost by about 3.8 percent in his run against Republican Bill Hayes. Libertarian candidate Chad Ricketts polled a surprising 10 percent in the race to finish third. Dodd trailed Hayes by about 1,500 votes in a race with more than 42,000 votes cast.

What the Americans for Tax Reform doesn't tell you is that the anti-tax pledge was no guarantee of success in Ohio legislative races. In fact, more than 60 percent of the Ohio legislative candidates who took the pledge lost their races. To be fair, many were third-party candidates or Republicans running in overwhelmingly Democratic districts.

To sum up: Americans for Tax Reform claimed the only incumbent to break the group's no-new taxes pledge was defeated ""soundly"" on Nov. 2. And while it's true that Hebron Democratic Rep. Dan Dodd was the only one to break the pledge, he lost by less than 4 percentage points. We find that to be less than ""soundly.""

As a result, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/12/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-lone-ohio-incumbent-break-tax-/

Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy says Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest income disparity in the country
","
Where in America is the gap largest between the haves and have-nots?

Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy says it’s right here, in southeastern Wisconsin.

At a Nov. 5, 2010, Common Council meeting, the chairman of the council’s Finance & Personnel committee said he fears there will be cuts in shared revenue that the state gives to cities. If there are, Murphy said, he hoped they would adhere to the shared revenue formula, which takes into account the higher level of poverty in Milwaukee versus cities such as Mequon.

Then Murphy declared:

""Mequon and Milwaukee have the highest disparity of income in the country.""

Mequon is well known to be one of Milwaukee’s most well-to-do neighbors. And for years Milwaukee has ranked among the nation’s most impoverished cities -- a ranking reconfirmed by U.S. Census data released in September.

But in a nation filled with poor cities and wealthy suburbs, is the largest chasm really between Milwaukee and Mequon?    

Murphy, a 21-year alderman not known for hyperbole, cited U.S. census figures to back up his statement: Based on the most recent data, 31.9 percent of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000 and 1.9 percent of Mequon families did.

That’s a gap of 30 percentage points.

When asked about his statement by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Murphy said: ""I can’t imagine there’s anywhere in the country that beats that.""

Not the strongest start when it comes to research methodology.

""If I’m wrong,"" Murphy added, ""I’ll be happy.""

OK. Let’s find out.

Murphy told us he was referring to big cities and suburbs that share a border. That’s an unconventional way to look at it -- for instance, it includes Mequon, in Ozaukee County, but not River Hills in Milwaukee County. But we’ll start there.

For the numbers, Murphy used 2009 figures for Milwaukee and 2006-2008 numbers for Mequon -- cities its size are not updated as frequently as Milwaukee.

We can make a better comparison -- between Milwaukee and Mequon, and between other U.S. cities and their suburbs -- by using 2006-2008 census figures for all of them.

Those figures show 27.5 percent of Milwaukee families had incomes of less than $25,000. That means the gap between Milwaukee and Mequon was 25.6 percentage points.

That’s our marker, as we look at other communities.

We didn’t look at every major U.S. city and its suburbs. But with just a few checks -- focusing on cities near Milwaukee on the income scale -- we found two city-suburb combinations that had larger income gaps. 
There may well be others with a greater disparity, but we stopped there.

Meanwhile, what about other suburbs in the Milwaukee area -- those that don’t necessarily share a border with Milwaukee?

For communities with a population under 20,000, the most recent figures for families with an income of less than $25,000 are from the 2000 census. Using those numbers, we looked at each community in Milwaukee, Ozaukee and Waukesha counties. 
In Milwaukee, 31.9 percent of families earned less than $25,000 and in Mequon the figure was 3.7 percent. 
But the gap was even larger between Milwaukee and six other suburbs, all in Waukesha County: Chenequa (3.3 percent), North Prairie (3.2 percent), Town of Delafield (3.2 percent), Wales (3 percent), Genesee (2.8 percent) and Merton (2.7 percent).  
Of course, Murphy was making a national comparison. And the approach he used was just one way of looking at income disparity in a region. 
In an October 2010 study, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researcher Lois Quinn looked at 55 metropolitan areas and what percentage of the poor residents in each -- those with income below the federal poverty level -- lived in the major city. For Milwaukee, 73.2 percent of the area’s poor residents were in the city.

In contrast, Lincoln, Neb., was home to 94 percent of that metro area’s poor. Several others, based on the data available, also had higher percentages.

Using a different measure, median income, a 2010 study by the Brookings Institution also cited Milwaukee as among the metro areas with high city-suburb income disparity -- but again not the highest.

In Milwaukee, Cleveland and Detroit, the gap in median income between the city and its suburbs reached nearly $30,000 in 2008, the study said. But the gap reached $40,000 between two Connecticut cities -- Hartford and Bridgeport -- and their suburbs.  
To be sure, the city’s poverty rate is among the highest in the nation -- a stubborn statistic that has defied efforts by policymakers and politicians to change it. But in neither measure was the city’s disparity gap at the top. 
OK, enough numbers. What do they show us?

In making a point about how state shared revenue should be distributed to cities, Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy said the largest income disparity in the country is between Milwaukee and Mequon. While comprehensive studies have ranked Milwaukee near the top in income disparity, Murphy went too far in lining Milwaukee up against neighboring Mequon.

With just a little checking, we found two city-suburb combinations that have a larger disparity. Murphy said he’d be happy if proven wrong, since that would mean Milwaukee doesn’t have the worst income disparity.

"['Oregon', 'State Budget', 'Allen Alley']","
Allen Alley says Oregon’s budget has increased by nearly 50 percent in four years
","
Just days after the 2010 election -- and before some races had even been called -- Allen Alley, an Oregon politico who most recently sought the Republican nomination for governor, assailed the state’s runaway spending.

In a post on his website, Alley examined government spending data and concluded that ""the State of Oregon Biennial Budget has grown from $41 billion in 2005-07 to $61 billion in 2009-11 - a more than 49% increase in just 4 years.""

That’s a pretty hefty margin in a short amount of time, so PoltiFact Oregon decided to investigate.

We double-checked Alley’s numbers with the state’s Budget and Management Division, a nonpartisan governmental office.

According to Brian DeForest, the deputy administrator of the division, Alley’s numbers were right on. For the 2005-2007 biennium, Oregon’s total funds budget was about $40.8 billion. For 2009-2011, the number is projected to be somewhere around $61.3 billion.

When you use those two numbers to calculate the percent increase, you find Alley actually underestimated. The total funds budget increased by about 50.2 percent over those four years.

But, as with most budget-related issues, there’s more than one way to look at these numbers.

That big $61.3 billion number is the total state spending -- it includes federal money and a large number of user-related fees that include everything from gas taxes to physician license fees to college tuition. This number, depending on what you’re analyzing, can be a bit misleading for three reasons: 1) The user fees don’t represent a tax burden for all Oregonians; you only pay the gas tax if you drive and you only pay tuition if you’re taking courses. 2) Many of the federal funds included in this sum can’t be avoided. The federal government sets enrollment requirements and the state must comply. 3) Changes in how benefits are allocated can inflate the numbers. This recently was the case when benefits for educators across the state were centralized, whereas previously they had been doled out at the local level. No new money was spent, but it shows up as an added state expenditure.

So, while that figure does say something about the state’s spending, the conversation usually revolves around a smaller piece of that pie called the general fund -- the portion of the state’s budget that is funded primarily through state income tax. That, DeForest says, ""is where we typically have the majority of our conversations.""

A look at this piece of the budget reveals a pretty different picture. During the 2005-2007 budget period, the general fund budget was about $11.6 billion. This budget cycle (2009-2011) the general funds budget was projected to reach $13.4 billion, but that number is in the process of being revised down as state income falls. That reduction will be just shy of $1 billion says DeForest, for a general fund of somewhere near $12.5 billion.

With those numbers, the percent increase is a scant 7.75 percent when compared to the 49 percent Alley had originally cited.

It’s also worth pointing out that, no matter their desire, Oregon politicians, by law, can’t craft a budget that spends more than the state takes in. So, talk about overspending in Oregon is somewhat different from the conversation at the national level where we’ve become accustomed to running a deficit and building up a large national debt.

Anyhow, you all are probably wondering, which number is right: Alley’s 49 percent or our 7.75 percent. Both are accurate from a factual point of view. The number a given politician uses typically depends on which number will help better make his or her point.

Is the NFL getting 'massive tax breaks,' as Donald Trump said?
","President Donald Trump continued his challenge of the National Football League in a tweet, this time to push tax reform. ""Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!"" Trump tweeted. Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law! What tax breaks is the NFL receiving, and what tax law is Trump referring to? There are ways that Trump’s tweet is both right and wrong. But the bottom line is that the NFL continues to benefit from major tax breaks, especially in the construction of its stadiums. The White House first directed us to a press release by Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who is re-introducing legislation to end professional sports leagues’ tax exempt status. ""The NFL League Office has received a special tax carve-out since 1966, when the tax code first listed ‘professional football leagues’ as trade organizations,"" the statement read. ""Though individual teams are not tax-exempt, the NFL League Office is."" It’s true that in order to allow the NFL and AFL to merge in 1966, legislative maneuverings grouped professional football leagues with trade associations under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code, thus exempting them from paying taxes as not-for-profit organizations. However, amid public criticism, the NFL decided to drop the not-for-profit status in 2015 and file regular taxes. ""The owners have decided to eliminate the distraction associated with misunderstanding of the league office’s status, so the league office will in the future file returns as a taxable entity,"" Robert McNair, the chairman of the league’s finance committee, said in an April 2015 statement. The tax exemption was only applicable to the league’s administrative office anyway, rather than the 32 individual teams, or even the subsidiaries that control the NFL’s licensing, sponsorships, marketing, publicity, promotion, broadcast, merchandise and distribution. So tax law could be changed to repeal an exemption that is no longer being used by the NFL. It is, however, still in use by other sports leagues, like the NHL, PGA Tour and LPGA. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders didn’t provide any details on the tax reform Trump was calling for in a press conference, though she did acknowledge the change in the NFL’s tax status, and pointed to another tax issue affecting the NFL. ""While the NFL may have given up its tax-exempt status a few years ago, it's been well-documented that billions of taxpayer dollars continue to subsidize the construction and renovation of professional sports stadiums,"" Sanders said. ""If this industry is going to use money from American taxpayers to build the very fields they play on, is it really too much to ask that they show respect for the American flag at the beginning of the game?"" The experts we spoke with disagreed on whether to call it a subsidy, as the federal government isn’t pumping money to team owners to build stadiums. Rather, it’s not taxing the bonds issued by local governments to help build stadiums. While it might not be a subsidy, the experts agreed that it still qualified as a tax break. Cities want to have stadiums in their backyard (though the economic results aren’t too convincing), so they issue bonds to help pay for them. And thanks to the 1986 tax code reform, if a municipality finances over 90 percent of a stadium, those bonds enjoy the same tax exemption as would a public project like a road or bridge. Brookings Institution took a closer look at these numbers in a 2016 study and estimated that over a 15-year period since 2000, the federal government lost a potential tax revenue of $1.11 billion on bonds issued by local governments to finance NFL stadiums. Major League Baseball stadiums benefitted more, though, resulting in a loss of $1.41 billion. Combining football, baseball, basketball and hockey stadiums, the federal government lost $3.2 billion over the 15-year period. ""That’s a drop in the bucket for how much our federal budget over 15 years is,"" said Ted Gayer,  vice president and director of the Economic Studies program at Brookings who led the study. ""But we think it’s an egregious misuse of federal dollars."" The researchers found that sports stadium financing is costing the federal government only 25 percent, on average, of what it’s costing the local governments who are issuing the bonds, but Trump was referring to the federal tax break. Assessing Obama’s 2016 budget, which tried to repeal tax-exempt bond financing of professional sports facilities, the Office of Management and Budget estimated it would save $542 million on all sports stadiums (not just the NFL) between 2016 and 2025; but Congress didn’t approve the change. Two bipartisan bills addressing the issue have also been introduced in the House and Senate. Trump said the NFL is ""getting massive tax breaks."" Since 2015, the NFL hasn’t benefitted from a not-for-profit tax break enjoyed by many professional sports league offices. However, it does enjoy tax exemptions on municipal bonds used to build stadiums. Other sports leagues also benefit from this tax code loophole, sometimes to a greater extent.

"['National', 'Debt', 'Donald Trump']","
Donald Trump's misleading linkage between stock gains, debt reduction
","President Donald Trump raised eyebrows with comments linking stock market gains with declines in the federal debt during two appearances to tout his tax proposal in Pennsylvania. First, in an Oct. 11 speech in an airplane hangar in Harrisburg, Trump said: ""Just in the stock market alone, we have increased our economic worth by $5.2 trillion. That's right since Election Day -- $5.2 trillion. Think about that. That's a quarter of the $20 trillion that we owe. … In the last eight years of the previous administration, the debt doubled. … But since the election on Nov. 8, I've increased the value of your U.S. assets by more than the $20 trillion that we currently owe. You haven't heard those numbers."" During a subsequent interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Trump made the linkage between stock market gains and debt decreases even clearer. ""The country — we took it over and owed over 20 trillion. As you know the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up 5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say, in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt."" We decided to look into whether Trump had a point that the stock market gains on his watch effectively wiped out any of the debt incurred by his predecessor, Barack Obama. (The White House did not provide any further information to PolitiFact.) Trump is somewhat off-base with those numbers. But the bigger problem is that the stock market gains and the debt don’t have the relationship he implies. As of Oct. 12, the most expansive figure for the federal debt is almost $20.4 trillion. About $9.2 trillion of that came between the inaugurations of President Barack Obama and Trump. So that wasn’t ""more than $10 trillion,"" and it wasn’t double the cumulative debt when he took office. The increase in stock market values may also be a little high. Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, told the Financial Post that the value has risen by about $4.4 trillion since the election. However, stock market gains accrue to stockholders; the government doesn’t get any of those increases to pay for government spending or to pay down the debt unless and until the assets are sold and taxed. (Only a communist government can seize private assets to pay down the debt.) So gaining a $5 trillion boost in stock values doesn’t simply enable the country to write off that much of its $20 trillion debt. ""The president is conflating the stock market, which represents the wealth of private corporations, with the federal budget,"" said Chris Lafakis, director at Moody’s Analytics. ""There is not a direct link between the two."" The taxation of such assets is delayed until the asset is sold, which could take years. ""At best, a small share of the increase in equity value will, some day, lead to higher capital gains taxes,"" said Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. And the rates at which such assets are taxed -- capital gains rates -- are relatively low compared to other forms of income taxes. ""With a tax rate on capital gains of 15 percent, even if all the stocks that have risen were sold tomorrow, the federal government would only reap at most 15 percent of the $5 trillion in asset gain,"" said added Bruce Bartlett, who served as deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush. And some of these gains may never be taxed. That could be the case if the holdings are passed on to heirs in a modestly sized estate, or if they are held institutionally, such as by a university. Other gains may have accrued to pension funds, and taxes would only be paid when the pensions are paid out and taxed by the recipient. The actual gain to the Treasury stemming from this stock run-up ""is completely out of whack"" with what Trump suggests, Lafakis said. ""We’re talking about tens of billions, maybe even over $100 billion in extra revenues if you adopt very extreme assumptions,"" he said. ""That doesn’t even stop our debt from going up, let alone pay down a meaningful portion of it."" All of this, of course, assumes that stock values, which fluctuate minute by minute, won’t fall. Since Election Day, the Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. stocks has risen by about 19 percent -- an impressive gain. But if we put this in context, other international stock markets have done even better. Specifically, Germany’s DAX has risen by 24 percent over the same period. France’s CAC 40 and the Netherlands’ AEX indexes have both risen by 20 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index has risen by 22 percent, and both Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and South Korea’s KOSPI have risen by 24 percent. Another nuance Trump didn’t capture: The lines between debt and wealth can be complicated. About one-third of the federal debt is held by foreign entities, but much of the rest is held by Americans -- and those federal bondholders count that ""debt"" on their own ledgers as ""wealth."" Meanwhile, some fraction of the stocks that produced the equity gains Trump refers to are held by foreigners. From Obama’s inauguration through Oct. 12, 2009, the Standard & Poor’s index increased by a whopping 34 percent, outpacing Trump’s 19 percent over the same portion of his presidency. The circumstances were different, of course -- Obama started at an economic low point while Trump inherited a healthily growing economy -- but the economy went on to strengthen under Obama over the long term. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the final quarter of 2016, Americans’ net worth increased from $55 trillion to $92 trillion. (This figure encompasses stock market values, home and property values, and changes in the indebtedness of U.S. households.) That’s an increase of two-thirds over eight years, or $37 trillion in raw dollars. So under Obama, wealth increased by an amount four times as large as the increase in the federal debt. But, for the reasons we explained, the wealth gains could not be directly applied to reduce the debt. ""By President Trump's own reasoning, the Obama administration was an enormous success,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""The success has continued, so far, in the first nine months of the Trump administration."" In the meantime, some argue that the creation of certain types of debt under Obama -- the deficit-financed expenditures for the fiscal stimulus during the Great Recession, for instance -- helped produce the stock-price run-up under both Obama and Trump. ""One could argue that without the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the economy would have been far weaker in 2009, 2010 and 2011, and stock market valuations would have been lower,"" Lafakis said. ""So in that instance, increasing the debt helped the stock market."" Trump said the Obama administration ""borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. ... Maybe in a sense we’re reducing debt."" Trump seems to be signaling that the stock market gains can somehow be applied to paying down the debt. That’s not the case -- gains from a bull market accrue to stockholders, and the government doesn’t get its fractional cut until the assets are sold and taxed, if they ever are. So, whatever tax revenues from the stock-market run-up eventually flow to the government over the course of many years won’t make a dent in the debt, economists say.

Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle misleads in claim about homicides, sanctuary cities
","Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said his state won’t tolerate sanctuary cities and cited as backup a federal report, claiming it found that more than 100 murders could have been prevented if communities worked with immigration officers. ""Sanctuary city"" is a term commonly used for a jurisdiction that limits its cooperation with immigration authorities. Federal officials send requests to local jails asking them to hold individuals scheduled for release so that immigration officers can pick them up. The extent of cooperation and scope of the policies implemented vary by jurisdiction. Cagle, who is running for governor, told a local news station that the City of Decatur may be in violation of a state law prohibiting sanctuary cities. ""How are they in direct violation?"" WSB-TV’s Craig Lucie asked Cagle. (Decatur said it complies with state law and called the sanctuary city label a misunderstanding.) ""Well, they are not cooperating with (U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement), and the important feature of this is that criminal illegal aliens, it was demonstrated with a Homeland Security study, that showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security,"" Cagle said Oct. 9. President Donald Trump has claimed that sanctuary cities attract criminals and blamed their policies for the killings of Americans by immigrants in the country illegally. Given the national debate about sanctuary cities, we wondered if Cagle was right that the Department of Homeland Security had determined that 120 murders might not have happened if communities cooperated with immigration authorities. We found that DHS has not done a study on this issue. Cagle’s office pointed us to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which said that according to ICE data, ""up to 121 homicides in the U.S. could have been avoided"" between fiscal years 2010 and 2014 if ICE had deported criminal immigrants instead of releasing them back into the United States. But that letter is not about sanctuary cities’ lack of cooperation with ICE. David Lapan, spokesman for DHS, told PolitiFact that neither DHS or ICE had published a report showing that murders could have been prevented in communities if they complied with immigration authorities. ""However, there are instances where criminal aliens who were released from jails -- without allowing ICE to take custody -- who then went on to commit additional crimes, including murder,"" Lapan said. But information provided by Cagle’s office did not support the claim that 120 murders took place due to sanctuary city policies. A June 12, 2015, letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then Sen. Jeff Sessions, who chaired the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, specified that 121 criminal immigrants were charged with homicide after their release from ICE custody from fiscal years 2010 and 2014. Of the 121 individuals released by ICE: • 33 were released on a bond set by the Justice Department’s Executive Office of Immigration Review; • 24 were released because a 2001 Supreme Court case, Zadvydas vs. Davis, prevents the indefinite detention of immigrants who can’t be deported (some countries won’t take back their nationals ordered removed); • 64 were released per ICE’s discretion. The letter does not say that the homicides for which the 121 individuals were charged could have been prevented if communities or sanctuary cities had cooperated with ICE. It centered on ICE’s release of the immigrants from their custody. The senators asked DHS, the State Department and the Attorney General to identify the jurisdictions to which the 121 criminal immigrants were released. A June 16, 2015, letter sent to ICE’s assistant secretary doesn’t cite a specific number of homicides that could have been avoided, but more broadly said 121 criminals who were not deported were charged with homicides after their release from ICE custody between fiscal years 2010 and 2014. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low immigration levels, reviewed data related to the 121 criminal immigrants. ""This tally does not include aliens who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions, nor those aliens that were released by local law enforcement agencies after ICE declined to take them into custody due to Obama administration prioritization policies. This list includes only those aliens that ICE arrested and then released,"" the center reported in March 2016. Cagle’s overarching message is that homicides could have been prevented if criminal immigrants were deported, his office said. ""The safety and security of every Georgian has been, and always will be, the top priority of Lt. Gov. Cagle,"" said Bo Butler, Cagle’s chief of staff. ""The point in referencing this shocking number of murders is that Homeland Security concluded at least 121 homicides were committed by convicted criminal illegal aliens. Had deportation occurred following the previous convictions, this loss of life could have been prevented."" Cagle said that a Homeland Security study ""showed 120 murders took place that could have been prevented had communities been working with ICE and Homeland Security."" Many elements of this statement are wrong. DHS said it had not published such a report. Cagle’s office actually referred to a 2015 letter from the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing ICE data, that said up to 121 homicides could have been avoided if ICE had deported criminal immigrants. While the letter started off saying 121 homicides were preventable, the document focuses on 121 being the number of criminal immigrants who were charged with homicide after being released by ICE. Most importantly, while homicides were committed, the letter does not claim they could have been avoided had sanctuary policies not been in place. Cagle’s statement is not accurate.

Fake photo changes social message on LeBron James' t-shirt
","A viral image of National Basketball Association superstar LeBron James wearing a T-shirt about racial inequity gained lots of traction on social media, but the wording has been digitally replaced. PolitiFact first saw an image of James wearing the shirt on Oct. 9, 2017, on the Facebook page of Occupy Democrats, but the photo has spread all over the Internet. It shows the Cleveland Cavaliers player walking on a basketball court with a black T-shirt that reads, ""We march, y’all mad. We sit down, y’all mad. We speak up, y’all mad. We die, y’all silent."" The post is ubiquitous on Facebook posts from across the country. The same goes for Twitter, where one tweet that used the photo was liked 291,000 times as of this writing. This Shirt Says It All! pic.twitter.com/8OrKgIpbTz But the image is fake. James wasn’t wearing that shirt in that photo (although you can buy it from scads of online retailers). He actually was wearing a completely different tee with a message about social injustice. The photo was from warmups for James’ Dec. 8, 2014, game in Brooklyn. His teammate Kyrie Irving also wore the shirt, as did four members of the Brooklyn Nets. Here’s the unaltered photo: This Icon Sportswire photo from Dec. 8, 2014, had been altered and posted on the Internet. The players wore the shirts to pay tribute to 43-year-old Eric Garner, a black man who died while being choked by a New York police officer on Staten Island. His last words, ""I can’t breathe,"" became a slogan at protests across the country. ""I've been quoted over and over about what's going on as far as it's more of a notion to the family, more than anything. Obviously, as a society we have to do better. We have to be better for one another,"" James said in 2014. ""It doesn't matter what race you are. It's more of a shout out to the family more than anything, because they're the ones that should be getting all the energy and effort."" More recently, James chided President Donald Trump, who lashed out at the Golden State Warriors’ Stephen Curry for refusing to visit the White House with his championship team. James called Trump a ""bum""on Twitter and later added that Trump ""doesn't understand the power that he has"" as president.   The older photo of James has been altered to make it look like he was wearing something he wasn’t.

Claim about proposed Austin school bonds is silent on increased dollar costs to property taxpayers
","A handout urging voter support for a proposed $1.05 billion Austin school district bond issue on the November 2017 ballot singles out the need to repair and renovate schools averaging 40 years of age plus a desire to modernize or build 16 schools. Moreover, the handout from the Committee of Austin’s Children PAC says: ""Did you know? AISD Prop. 1 bonds will require no tax rate increase,"" a claim the group also makes on its website. Is that rate statement accurate? To rehash, the handout says the sought bonds won’t require a ""rate"" increase. It’s silent on whether district residents will pay more in taxes if the proposition passes--which struck Austin lawyer Bill Aleshire, formerly Travis County’s elected judge, as misleading. Aleshire, who brought the handout to our attention, said by email: ""No one in their right mind should believe AISD can borrow $1 billion plus interest and not have a property tax increase as a result."" When we asked, David Butts, a consultant to the PAC, told us by phone the group based its rate claim on district presentations. Butts said: ""We’ve never said that you wouldn’t pay higher taxes,"" in that barring an economic recession, escalating local property values stand to drive up how much the district reaps--without the district needing a rate bump. Property taxes are tied to assessed property values which in Austin (like other prosperous cities) lately spiral nearly every year. In this fact-check, we’ll share assumptions behind the no-hike scenario and unpack estimates of how much money the proposed bonds would likely cost homeowners in increased tax bills. It’s also worth noting the speculative quality of tax predictions. To our inquiry, Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Union, which opposes the proposition, questioned anyone’s ability to fact-check rate-related claims because, he said by phone, tax effects depend on unknowns including whether and how much total appraised property values change and if the district’s intended debt repayment schedules and interest rates bear out. ""You cannot assume it’s a sunny day every day,"" Falk said. ""It’s going to rain sometime."" Austin district’s assumptions District leaders have said that presuming total assessed property values continue to increase and also that the district repays more than half the proposed debt within a decade, the school board will be spared from considering an increase in the district’s total tax rate of $1.192 per $100 valuation--the bulk of which covers day-to-day maintenance and operations. A September 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story elaborated: ""The district points to its last bond election — $392 million approved by voters in 2013 — as an example of how it can tamp down the impact on property tax bills. Those bonds were expected to raise the tax rate by 3 cents, or about $38.40 a year to the property tax bill for a $200,000 home. ""But instead,"" the story said, ""the district, buoyed by increasing property values, lowered the tax rate by 5 cents per $100 of a home’s assessed value. Homeowners are still paying more, of course, because property values in Austin have shot up 12 percent a year, on average, for the past five years."" Tiffany Young, a district spokeswoman, emailed us the district’s August 2017 ""tax capacity analysis"" of the proposed bond costs, which included a summary of annual changes--of late 11-percent-plus annual increases--in total assessed property valuations in the district from 2008 through 2017:                    SOURCE: Document showing tax capacity analysis of proposed bond debt, Austin Independent School District, Aug. 10, 2017 (received by email from Tiffany Young, senior communication specialist, AISD, Sept. 26, 2017) That news story noted that the district’s payback plan for the proposed bond package assumes an annual increase in total assessed property values of 7 percent in the first two years and 1.5 percent for each subsequent year. ""Property values actually have a 10-year average growth rate of nearly 8 percent,"" the story said. School leaders advised that if there’s a flattening in property-value increases, the district could tap $46 million in reserves, or savings, to make up for lost revenue. Also, the story quoted Ellen Wood, who chairs the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce’s board of directors, calling district assumptions behind no tax-rate hike prediction ""conservative and appropriate."" By phone, Wood told us chamber members based that judgment on talks with the district’s chief financial officer, Nicole Conley Johnson, and a firm advising the district on the proposed issuance. To our inquiries, Conley Johnson reaffirmed the district’s conclusion that the proposed bonds can be paid off without a tax-rate hike. In fact, Conley Johnson said by phone, she expects the district to land interest rates perhaps 2 percentage points less than the 5 percent rate assumed in its modeling, a decrease that would reduce repayment costs. Noting increased assessed property valuations in recent years, Conley Johnson also said it’s reasonable to expect assessed values to surge more each year than the 1.5 percent rate assumed in the modeling past the first couple years. If the proposition fails at the polls, Conley Johnson confirmed, the school board could reduce the debt portion of the district tax rate in 2021-22 by $0.0297 per $100 valuation to $0.0833 with additional reductions doable most subsequent years through 2039-40--though that scenario depends, perhaps improbably, on no additional costs accumulating in the intervening years. If the proposition passes, Conley Johnson said, in 2022, the district will need some $35.5 million to pay incremental costs on the proposed bonds. An estimated $35.5 million would be raised by from that $0.0297 per $100 valuation in tax rate, the district projects. Worst-case scenarios? We separately asked Conley Johnson and Chris Allen of First Southwest, the firm hired by the district as financial advisers on the proposition, to lay out a worst-case scenario that might cause district officials to recommend a rate increase after all. ""You’d have to have a major economic downturn,"" Allen said by phone. ""You’d have to have the housing market plummet."" Allen, referring to the district’s assumed 7 percent increases in total assessed valuations in both 2019 and 2020, said: ""I think the 7 percent is conservative. If you look around, there are cranes everywhere. The housing"" and commercial ""market is on fire."" Conley Johnson said by email: ""We estimate that if"" total assessed valuation ""growth stayed flat for the next 8 years or there was a cumulative decline in AV of 20%, we would need to consider increasing the tax rate.  Of course."" she said, ""these events would buck historical trends of the last 10 years where there was only year that AV declined, in 2011 due to the national recession--arguably the worst in history.  Even still, there was subsequent growth thereafter and the decline was made-up after two years and growth doubled after that."" Falk, the proposition foe, questioned the assumption that the district can repay the bonds at a 5 percent interest rate past this next year. ""There’s no science--no way to know--past one year,"" Falk said. Falk called the assumed annual increases in total property valuations a ""best guess."" We also asked Charles Gilliland, a land-market expert at Texas A&M University, to evaluate the no-rate-increase claim. Gilliland said by phone the district’s post-2020 assumption that total assessed property values will increase 1.5 percent annually seems ""pretty conservative. The rest of the story is it’s not going to be a nice steady increase,"" Gilliland said. ""There are going to be ups and downs."" Generally, Gilliland said by email: ""Without exhaustive historical studies of the parameters of their model and an examination of the operating conditions of the district, I have no evidence to cast doubt on the assumptions underlying the"" district’s analysis. Costs to taxpayers Falk called the tax-rate claim by itself a ""head fake"" intended to dupe voters into overlooking that each taxpayer would be paying more dollars to cover bond repayments. He also emailed us the taxpayer group’s analysis, which provides estimated effects on property tax bills by assuming that  total assessed valuations within district boundaries won’t go up or down. Then again, the district has acknowledged that property owners will pay more in taxes to pay debt service on the bonds, if approved. A June 2017 American-Statesman news story on school board members voting to place the proposition before voters initially noted that district officials said the tax rate would remain flat at $1.192 per $100 of assessed property value, with $1.079 designated for operations and $0.113 of the rate going toward repaying debt issued to fund capital improvements. Still: ""For the owner of the district’s average taxable value home of $355,947, the school tax bills would total nearly $4,243. As properties increase in value,"" the story said, ""that same tax rate would lead to increasingly higher tax bills."" District web pages devoted to the proposition similarly indicate property owners will likely face increases in what the district bills. We initially spotted no estimates of how much more, but estimates were provided when we asked. Let’s cover those web posts, then turn to what the district gave us. Here’s a question on the district’s main FAQ section about the proposition: ""I've heard AISD say this bond will not raise my property tax rate. How is that possible?"" The 202-word reply stresses the district’s plan not to issue the sought debt all at once plus plans to draw on other funds; it doesn’t concede additional direct-to-taxpayer bond costs. We saw this question on a separate district Finance FAQ web page about the proposition: ""So does this mean that I won’t have an increase in my tax bill?"" The district’s reply opens, ""No."" That reply otherwise says higher taxes depend on the appraised value of taxable property, ""which is determined by the"" Travis Central Appraisal District, ""not AISD. An increase or decrease in taxable property value, even with no change in the tax rate, would result in an increase or decrease in the actual amount of taxes paid."" The reply goes on to note that residents who qualify for Travis County’s over-65 homestead exemption wouldn’t pay more in school taxes. Moreover, the reply continues, other governing entities levy property taxes including the city of Austin, Travis County, the Austin Community College District and the Travis County Health Care District. ""The rates for each entity are set annually by the elected or governing officials,"" the district says. ""The rate for each of the taxing entities is then applied to your home value,"" it says. We also noticed the last, 18th question on the district’s main FAQ page for the proposition: ""What's the bottom line, the one thing you want voters to know?"" The district’s reply: ""AISD needs to address facility deficiencies and is committed to creating 21st-century learning spaces for our students. We can do so without a tax rate increase."" Conley Johnson told us that in 2021-22 (the third year of the district starting to sell and repay the bond debt being presented to voters), the cost to taxpayers of the new debt would range from $29.70 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $100,000 up to $297 for the owner of a property with an assessed value of $1 million. See the district’s full chart here. According to what Conley Johnson described as the district’s worst-case modeling of the proposed bonds’ effect on taxes, the owner of an Austin homestead at the average 2017-18 assessed value ($332,103) would see the debt portion of her or his district tax bill increase from $375 in 2017-18 to $484 in 2027-28--driven by expected bumps in assessed property values. Absent the sought bonds or other approved debt, this modeling indicates, the 2027-28 costs to such a homeowner for district debt would total $250.57. An owner of a homestead at the 2017-18 median value ($262,282) would face $382.75 in district debt-tied taxes in 2027-28--up from $296 in 2017-18 and greater than the $197.89 in such taxes the homeowner would face if the district doesn’t issue additional debt. There’s more: As we made our inquiries, the district posted a document estimating each homesteading homeowner’s future tax payments to the district related to paying off the proposed bonds. Upshot: Starting in 2022, some $0.0297 per $100 valuation of the district’s tax rate would generate sufficient revenue to pay debt service on the sought bonds, the document says. The share of the district’s tax rate needed to pay that debt service will escalate in subsequent years, the document says, with that share reaching its maximum of $0.0530 per $100 valuation as of 2029. According to the document, the district estimates the dollar costs in annual taxes on the median-value homestead in the district--which in 2017 had an appraised value of $287,282--to be $77.90 in 2022 and $139.01 in 2029. At the upper end, the estimated annual dollar costs due to debt service on the proposed bonds to a homestead appraised at $1 million in 2017 is shown as $289.58 in 2022, $516.75 in 2029. Our ruling The PAC said the proposed Austin school district bonds ""will require no tax rate increase."" Missing from this claim: Individual homeowners are expected to pay more in property taxes even if the tax rate remains the same, which looks likely thanks to rising property valuations in a hot real-estate market. We rate this statement, which lacks the important clarification that only the tax rate isn’t expected to rise, Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE–The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Is Sen. Bob Corker responsible for the Iran deal, as Donald Trump claims?
","President Donald Trump escalated a war of words with Sen. Bob Corker by blaming the Tennessee Republican for the Iran nuclear deal Trump has long derided. The dustup between Trump and Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, comes as Trump weighs sending a formal criticism of the deal to Congress. Under the accord, Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The deal was signed in 2015 by the United States, Iran and other world powers — and according to Trump, Corker played an outsized role in its creation, too. ""Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal,"" Trump wrote in an Oct. 8 tweet, hours after Corker tweeted that the White House ""has become an adult day care center.""  Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done! We decided to take a closer look at Corker’s role in the brokering the agreement. Trump’s claim is contradicted by the fact Corker vocally opposed the deal that would eventually emerge from negotiations with Iran in July 2015, and urged Republican colleagues to oppose it, too. The deal ""leaves the United States vulnerable to a resurgent Iran wealthier and more able to work its will in the Middle East,"" Corker wrote in an August 2015 opinion piece in the Washington Post. ""Congress should reject this deal and send it back to the president."" Corker himself voted against the deal, though Republicans ultimately lacked the votes to reject it. When asked how Trump could say that Corker was responsible for the deal, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said a bill Corker sponsored paved the way for the Iran deal and gave it credibility. ""Sen. Corker worked with (Democratic House Leader) Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation, and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal,"" she said in an Oct. 10 press briefing, adding, ""He not only allowed the deal to happen, he gave it credibility."" The legislation Sanders was referring to is the Corker-sponsored Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. After initial resistance from President Barack Obama, the bill passed with overwhelming majorities in both chambers, and was signed into law in May 2015. Corker’s office described the law as enhancing Congress’ authority to review any nuclear agreement with Iran before allowing a president to lift congressionally-imposed sanctions. So if Corker’s law aimed to give Congress more say over the agreement, what to make of the Trump administration’s assertion that it paved the way for the deal? ""This is astonishingly wrong,"" said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar on global energy policy at Columbia University, who previously served as the lead sanctions expert for the U.S. team negotiating with Iran during the administration of President Barack Obama. ""The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act gave Congress the most direct way of killing the deal, quickly and easily."" Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, also said the Trump administration was way off the mark. ""It is ludicrous to argue that Senator Corker and Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act are responsible for delivering the nuclear deal with Iran,"" she said. ""If anything, (the law) nearly prevented the deal's implementation and undermined the agreement."" The Trump-Corker feud comes at a time when the Iran deal faces intense scrutiny. By law, the Trump administration must report to Congress on the deal every 90 days, including whether Iran is complying, and if it’s in the U.S. national security interest to continue sanctions relief. The next deadline is Oct. 15, and experts say Trump may decline to certify the deal on national security grounds. Decertifying the deal would not immediately kill it. Rather, it opens the door for Congress to quickly reimpose sanctions. Trump said, ""Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal."" Corker sponsored legislation to enhance Congress’ authority to review the Iran nuclear deal before allowing the president to lift congressionally-imposed sanctions. He also vocally opposed the deal, urged lawmakers to reject the agreement and voted against it. We don’t see how this could reasonably be construed as Corker giving the United States the Iran deal. Trump’s claim doesn’t make logical sense. We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2017/oct/12/donald-trump/sen-bob-corker-responsible-iran-deal-donald-trump-/

Fort Worth pediatrician says 1 in 10 U.S.-born babies born in Texas
","A Fort Worth pediatrician who supports continued federal backing of health insurance for children of the working poor suggested it’s an important issue in these parts because 10 percent of Americans start as Texans. In October 2017, Joyce Mauk, president of the Texas Pediatric Society, was quoted by the Austin American-Statesman as saying: ""One in 10 babies born in this country is born in Texas, and so it affects us disproportionately if access to health care is compromised for children. There is nothing good you can say about taking away access to health care for children."" At the time, Congress had failed to extend its authorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program before federal funding expired at the end of September. Without further action, about 400,000 Texas children and pregnant women were believed to be at risk of losing coverage by early 2018. We wondered about the share of U.S.-born babies birthed in Texas. By phone, Mauk told us she relied on statistics compiled from U.S. states by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that 403,618 Texas births accounted for 10 percent of 3,980,000 births nationally in 2015. We were shortly able to confirm that number, thanks to a January 2017 CDC report tabulating U.S. births. It showed 403,618 Texas births in 2015 made up 10.1 percent of 3,978,497 births nationally. Among the states, the chart shows, only California accounted for a greater share; 491,478 births there accounted for 12.4 percent of U.S. births. Next, we asked the CDC and the Texas Demographic Center, based at the University of Texas at San Antonio, about more recent data and figures giving historical perspective. By email, CDC spokesman Brian Tsai pointed us to bureau-posted 2016 birth counts by state, posted in September 2017, showing that the 406,945 births in Texas that year accounted for 10.3 percent of 3,956,112 births nationally. So, the 1-in-10 figure still holds up. In Texas, to our emailed queries, Lila Valencia of the demographic center provided a chart showing that Texas-born babies have comprised 1 in 10 U.S. births since 2008. From 1960 through 1971, the chart indicates, Texas-born babies made up 6 percent of U.S.-born babies. That share, the chart shows, was 7 percent from 1972 through 1979; 8 percent from 1980 through 1995; and 9 percent from 1996 through 2007. Of late, Valencia elaborated, ""the Texas share of births has been steadily increasing, even following drops in the number of births following the Great Recession,"" Valencia wrote, adding: ""If current total fertility rates and the child-bearing age distribution of women in each state remains the same, we would anticipate the Texas share of births to continue to increase given the younger age distribution of the state, its larger Hispanic share of the population, and its significant population growth relative to other states."" Our ruling Mauk said 1 in 10 U.S.-born babies is born in Texas. According to government tallies, that’s been so since 2008. We rate this claim True.

Gillum campaign changes website after touting false claim
","Editor's note: This fact-check was updated at 5:35 p.m. to reflect a 2015 report about the city's electric use. The update does not affect the rating. For months on his campaign website, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum took responsibility for shaving Tallahassee’s carbon footprint in his short time as mayor. ""Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent,"" a post under the environmental issues page said. We wondered how Gillum accomplished this eye-popping statistic in just three years. But if you check the website now, you won’t find that claim. The Gillum campaign rolled back the talking point after PolitiFact Florida started looking into it, replacing it with a broader talking point that still leaves some questions unanswered. There is no evidence that supported a carbon cut of 40 percent under Gillum’s watch. In reality, the city has seen an estimated reduction in carbon emissions over the course of two decades. City of Tallahassee officials collect data on carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon (in terms of weight) emitted per unit of energy consumed. The city, which provides electric service to residents, keeps track of how much electricity is produced and monitors what’s ""coming out of the smokestacks"" at power plants to figure out the carbon intensity each year, said John Powell, Tallahassee environmental services and facilities director. Under federal law, the city is required to report its findings on an annual basis. Data from the city includes the amount of carbon measured in tons and the net electric load. The net electric load, or the NEL, is the amount of energy produced plus the energy purchased off the grid and minus what the city sells to the grid for use outside of their system. The data shows that the carbon intensity has dropped around 40 percent since 1990. The decline has not been consistent, but has decreased overall. ""We’ve implemented more efficient utilities and switched to cleaner fuels over the last two and half decades,"" Powell said. ""We really have seen reduction in carbon intensity over that time."" Susan Glickman, the Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy, said there are other factors that could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions. For example, jobs in the coal industry have been declining since 1985. Because of this, a lot of utilities use more natural gas than coal, which is cleaner and cheaper. In addition, despite population gains, energy demand has gone down as appliances have become more efficient. The 2008 recession led to less energy being used. Gillum’s campaign changed the original claim on the website rather than defend it. ""You brought it to our attention and we wanted to make sure it was accurate, so we made the change when you reached out,"" said campaign spokesman Geoff Burgan said. ""We’re trying to get people the accurate information they need."" The updated post includes more nuance about the decrease in carbon intensity from initiatives Gillum has enacted as mayor since 2014. ""Over the last two decades,Tallahassee has reduced its carbon emission intensity by 40 percent, and under his leadership, has reduced the carbon footprint of electricity users in the city by 20 percent. The Mayor has worked both as Mayor and City Commissioner to implement and improve programs like free residential and commercial audits, low interest energy loans, and community outreach programs, as well (as) breaking ground on the new 120 acre solar farm that will triple the City’s solar energy capacity."" We looked for information to support the modified claim that under Gillum’s leadership, Tallahassee’s carbon footprint really decreased by 20 percent. We didn’t find much to illuminate that claim before we originally published this check. After publication (and repeated queries to Gillum’s spokespersons), the mayor’s community relations coordinator emailed PolitiFact a 2015 document that said electricity consumption in the city had dropped over a 10-year period ending in 2013, before Gillum became mayor. The statistic was included in a report about the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Clean Power Plan pushed by the Obama administration. ""For the ten year period ending in 2013, the City’s residential customers experienced an estimated 21 percent reduction in the average electricity consumption,"" reads the 2015 report commissioned by the city. That overlaps with Gillum’s time as a city commissioner from 2003-14. (Tallahassee’s city commission is made up of four commissioners and the mayor. Every year, the commissioners and the mayor select a mayor pro-tempore.) So even though the city reduced its electricity use during that time, the drop can not be credited to Gillum. Further, recent data from the city shows that electricity consumption has gone down .1 percent from 2014-16, and the amount of carbon dioxide released has actually gone up 4 percent. It’s worth noting that Gillum has supported efforts to make the city greener. The most notable example happened in May when Tallahassee leaders, including Gillum, broke ground on a 120-acre solar farm located on Tallahassee International Airport land. The solar farm is expected to be completed by November 2017 and generate 20 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 3,400 homes, or 2 percent of the city’s current capacity. A post on Gillum’s campaign website said, ""Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent."" That claim has since been removed and replaced with a series of different claims. That’s because there’s nothing to support a carbon reduction of that size in his time as mayor, or on the city commission. In reality, the cut has taken place over the course of two decades and has dropped for a variety of reasons outside of Gillum’s control. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2017/oct/12/andrew-gillum/gillum-campaign-changes-website-after-touting-fals/
"['National', 'Guns', 'Seth Moulton']","
Have background checks been ‘unequivocally’ shown to reduce gun violence?
","On the heels of the Las Vegas shooting, two military veterans-turned-congressmen waded into the debate over the country’s response to gun violence. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a former Marine, appeared with Rep. Scott Taylor, R-Va., a former Navy SEAL, on ABC’s This Week Oct. 8 to discuss issues surrounding gun control and the Second Amendment. As the conversation turned toward background checks, Taylor argued the measure doesn’t necessarily help reduce gun violence. ""Actually,"" Moulton countered, ""background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence."" We previously found that around 90 percent of Americans support background checks on every gun sale. While the belief that background checks reduce gun violence appears firmly ingrained, we found that proving the theory — especially ""unequivocally,"" which means without a doubt — is not so clear cut. Moulton’s office pointed us to research by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety that explored the relationship between background check laws and gun violence rates. Under federal law, background checks are not required for private sales. But 19 states and D.C. have laws on the books that require some sort of background check on private sales of at least some types of private guns. Everytown for Gun Safety compared the rates of gun violence in states that require background checks for private sales to states that do not. They compared the fatality rates along several categories: women shot to death by intimate partners, suicides by gun and law enforcement officers shot and killed in the line of duty. The group found that states with comprehensive background checks had a roughly 50 percent lower rate in each category:  But experts told us that while stark differences between the two groups of states is noteworthy, it should not be taken as unequivocal proof that background checks reduce gun violence. Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and gun control expert, said the comparisons do not control for all of the other variables that may differ between the two groups of states, like relative levels of gun ownership. ""No reasonable person could believe that universal background checks could, all by themselves, cut these rates of gun violence in half,"" he said. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said that without controlling for other factors, the data is insufficient for concluding a cause-and-effect relationship about background checks and a reduced gun violence. Moulton’s office also pointed us to research by Webster and several colleagues. The study looked at the effects that a Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to get a license had on subsequent homicides. Under the Connecticut law, a prospective handgun buyer had to clear an application process that included a background check to obtain a 5-year license to buy handguns (the law did not not apply to rifles and shotguns). Measures such as the Connecticut law are known in academic circles as ""permit-to-purchase laws."" Researchers found the Connecticut law was associated with a 40 percent reduction in gun homicides between 1996 and 2005. They determined this by comparing Connecticut’s homicide rates after the law went into effect to rates that would have been expected if the law was never passed, an estimate referred to as ""Synthetic Connecticut"" in the graph below (we’d note this methodology was not without some controversy). Researchers also discovered the large drop in homicides was found only in gun-related killings, not homicides caused by other means, which suggests the law was the driving force behind the reduction.  But Webster cautioned that the associated reduction in gun violence could not be attributed solely to background checks, because they were part of a larger regulatory scheme under Connecticut’s permit-to-purchase law. The law required all would-be gun buyers to apply for a permit in person with the local police before making a purchase, regardless of whether the seller was a licensed dealer or private seller. The law also raised the legal age to buy a handgun from 18 to 21 years and obliged would-be purchasers to undergo at least eight hours in a gun safety training course. It also criminalized the sale of a handgun to anyone without a license. Webster said the effects of comprehensive background checks alone couldn’t be de-coupled from the other law’s other provisions. ""Just passing a comprehensive background check law — without other measures relevant to standards for legal gun ownership and accountability and without commitment to really enforce the comprehensive background check laws — may not be sufficient to reduce gun violence if there is not concerted effort to enforce the law,"" Webster said. ""Bottom line,"" he said, ""comprehensive background checks laws saved lives, but when coupled with permit-to-purchase laws."" Experts we spoke to appeared to agree Moulton was partially right, but overstated the case. According to his reading of the scientific literature, Webster said background checks on all gun transfers are necessary to stop prohibited people from getting guns. But it hasn’t been established scientifically that background checks could do so alone, separate from a broader system of laws and regulations, he said. ""The best evidence for impact on mortality rates is when comprehensive background checks is coupled with permit-to-purchase law requirements,"" Webster said. ""The impact of these laws depends on the legal standards for gun ownership, systems having necessary records and whether the laws are actually enforced."" David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said he tends to agree with the general thrust of Moulton’s claim, but believes ""unequivocally"" is too strong a word. ""Stronger gun laws and fewer guns are associated, all else equal, with lower rates of gun violence,"" Hemenway said. ""Among all the gun laws, there is probably the best evidence that background checks help reduce gun violence. A handful of studies find that they appear to reduce interpersonal firearm violence (and gun trafficking)."" Cook also said research into the relationship between background checks and gun violence is less clear cut than Moulton suggested. ""The true state of play in the scientific literature is somewhat equivocal,"" he said. Moulton said, ""Background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence."" Research has shown background checks to be associated with reduced gun violence, and they’re believed to be a necessary measure to stop guns from falling into the wrong hands. But it hasn’t been scientifically established that background checks alone could reduce violence, separate from a broader system of laws, regulations and enforcement. In short, the scientific literature is fuzzier than Moulton claims, experts said. We rate this Half True. ",/factchecks/2017/oct/11/seth-moulton/have-background-checks-been-unequivocally-shown-re/

Donald Trump omits facts in claim about loopholes, unaccompanied minors
","President Donald Trump recently sent Congress a list of his immigration priorities as legislators consider a plan to allow Dreamers to stay in the United States. Dreamers are young people who grew up in the United States after being brought here illegally as children or infants. Trump has said he was willing to negotiate with Democrats in order to allow them to stay. In exchange, Trump is seeking changes to immigration law that would affect other minors who come to the United States illegally. ""Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed,"" said Trump’s outline. ""Rather than being deported, they are instead sheltered by the Department of Health and Human Services at taxpayer expense, and subsequently released to the custody of a parent or family member -- who often lack lawful status in the United States themselves."" The children Trump is talking about tend to be from Central America, as opposed to Mexico. Waves of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador came to the United States in recent years fleeing gang violence and poverty. Trump wants to make it harder for these children to claim asylum (a type of relief sought by unaccompanied minors) and to be able to remove them all expeditiously. Typically, a loophole refers to an unintended consequence, ambiguity or omission from a law that allows something to be evaded. The Trump administration, however, deems the procedures laid out in law for treating unaccompanied minors as ""loopholes"" that need to be changed. But the law explicitly requires that a federal agency place children from non-border countries ""in the least restrictive setting"" (in many cases with family members) and to help them access legal counsel for their removal proceedings. Even with these procedures, however, thousands of children are still ordered removed. Trump’s claim gives a misleading impression. An Unaccompanied Alien Child is the legal term for a child who does not have a lawful immigration status in the United States; is under 18 years old; and has no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or for whom no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of apprehensions of unaccompanied minors peaked in 2014 at 68,541, up from 38,759 in fiscal year 2013. Their apprehensions have fluctuated since 2014. Border Patrol agents tallied about 38,500 apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from October 2016 to August 2017. There have been concerns for years that unaccompanied minors were not being adequately screened to determine if they should be sent back to their countries. So Congress passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, formalizing how they should be treated, and President George W. Bush signed it into law. ""Special rules"" in the law allow unaccompanied minors from contiguous countries (Mexico and Canada) to be quickly returned to their countries. But unaccompanied minors from other countries are not immediately sent back by immigration officers; they are placed in formal removal proceedings. The law requires that they be transferred within 72 hours to HHS, which places them ""in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child."" In many cases, children await their immigration court hearing while living with family members in the United States, including relatives who are in the country illegally. The law directs HHS to ensure ""to the greatest extent practicable"" that unaccompanied minors have access to legal counsel, including pro-bono services. The procedures for unaccompanied children cases are not loopholes, but rather basic requirements of the law, said Mark Greenberg, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute and a former acting assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families within HHS during the Obama administration. The most common immigration relief granted to unaccompanied minors includes asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, and ""T nonimmigrant status"" for victims of trafficking, said a January 2017 Congressional Research Service report. Data shows that children with an attorney are more likely to be allowed to stay in the country than children who lack representation. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University examined outcomes for unaccompanied minors cases filed and decided from fiscal years 2012 to 2014. Outcomes for unaccompanied minors with an attorney (8,761 cases): In 73 percent of cases an immigration court allowed the child to stay in the United States, in 12 percent of cases a child was ordered removed, in 15 percent of cases a judge entered a ""voluntary departure"" order (child still has to leave the country, but the voluntary departure carries less severe consequences than a removal order). Outcomes for unaccompanied minors without an attorney (12,817 cases): In 15 percent of cases the child was allowed to stay in the country, in 80 percent of cases a child was given a removal order, and in 5 percent of cases, a voluntary departure order. Trump said, ""Loopholes in current law prevent ‘Unaccompanied Alien Children’ (UACs) that arrive in the country illegally from being removed."" The Trump administration argues there is a loophole for unaccompanied minors primarily from Central America. They are referred to HHS and in many cases placed with family members while they await their immigration court hearing. The law directs HHS to try to connect unaccompanied minors with legal counsel, and having an attorney can help them win their case and allow them to stay in the United States. But this process is not a loophole; it’s outlined in the law. The law also does not prevent their deportation: at least 2,707 unaccompanied minors were removed in fiscal year 2017. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression.

Donald Trump did not kill NFL's tax-exempt status by executive action
","A news story that asserts President Donald Trump’s feud with the National Football League led him to revoke the organization’s nonprofit tax status is a trick play created by a fake news website. The headline on an Oct. 9, 2017, post on ConservativePaper.com read, ""President Trump signs executive order stripping NFL of ‘non-profit’ status."" Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being bogus, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news stories. The same story appeared on several other websites reported by Facebook users. The story, which is fake, said Trump on Oct. 8 had revoked the NFL’s ""401(c)(3) status ‘until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.’ "" (There is no such thing as tax-exempt 401(c)(3) classification in the tax code.) This was a response to players protesting racial inequity by kneeling during the Star-Spangled Banner, which has raised Trump’s hackles in recent weeks. Now, it may surprise some to know that the NFL’s league office did have tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit — a tax classification for business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate and trade boards and yes, professional football leagues. The change in the tax code was granted in 1966, to allow the NFL and AFL to merge without the threat of violating anti-trust laws. The league office essentially acts as a trade organization for the individual teams, which are what make most of the league’s profits, which are taxed. This is different than 501(c)(3) status, which is for charitable organizations. But the league voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status in 2015 after being criticized by politicians who thought the entire league was avoiding taxes. ""As you know, the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in the letter to team owners that year. ""The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax-exempt."" U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., revived the subject on Sept. 26 when he became lead sponsor of the Pro Sports Act, looking to make the voluntary status change permanent by changing the tax code. Trump also brought up the issue on Oct. 10, when he tweeted, ""Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!""

Fake news site says Jason Aldean gave anti-gun rant on 'Saturday Night Live'
","A fake news story that said country singer Jason Aldean had a concert canceled after making an anti-gun statement following his Saturday Night Live performance is the work of a website that appears to be part of a troll network. ""Jason Aldean gig canceled after he sells out to liberals on SNL,"" read the Oct. 8, 2017, headline on AsAmericanAsApplePie.org. Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news stories. At least part of the story showed up in a couple of other posts also questioned by Facebook users. Aldean was performing onstage at a Las Vegas country music festival on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from a hotel room, killing 58 and injuring 489 more. He appeared for a musical performance on Saturday Night Live on Oct. 7, singing I Won’t Back Down, which also served as a tribute to Tom Petty, who died Oct. 2. The AsAmericanAsApplePie.org post, however, mixed some real details with some entirely fictional ones. It said Aldean addressed the audience before the song to say ""people should not own more than one gun,"" and blamed the National Rifle Association for the massacre. Aldean did not do that. It then gives a real quote from Aldean, who said about shooting victims, ""So I want to say to them, ‘We hurt for you, and we hurt with you.’ But you can be sure that we’re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit, it’s unbreakable."" You can watch the real statement and performance here: The post snaps back into fake events by saying Aldean ""took a knee"" as the band played part of the national anthem, and told people ""not to cave to the NRA’s terroristic agenda"" and ""always stand up to gun violence and the policies that enable it."" None of those things happened, but the article said it spurred a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag and led to the cancellation of Aldean’s concert in Birmingham, Ala. Aldean’s Birmingham show was Aug. 10. There is a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag, but it’s difficult to tell if it stems from this fake story, which has fooled many people on Twitter, of Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White’s condemnation of Aldean for choosing to perform on SNL over UFC 216 in Las Vegas the same night. Aldean did cancel three California shows after the shooting ""out of respect for the victims, their families and our fans,"" but returned to Las Vegas on Oct. 8 to visit with shooting survivors.

Hillary Clinton’s False claim on mass shootings
","Citing the Las Vegas shooting that killed 59 people and injured hundreds, Hillary Clinton urged the nation to do more to prevent gun violence during a speech at the University of California at Davis on Monday. The Democrat and former presidential candidate rejected the idea that a debate over gun safety should wait until well after a mass shooting takes place. ""What better time than now?"" Clinton said, speaking on her current book tour’s only scheduled stop in California. Clinton went on to make a claim about the number of mass shootings that have taken place this year — and misstated how they are defined. ""There have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States this year alone. That’s where four or more are killed. Two hundred and seventy. We cannot accept this as normal. We cannot become desensitized.""   Hillary Clinton made her claim about mass shootings during a speech Oct. 9, 2017 at UC Davis.  PolitiFact California took a deep look at how mass shootings are defined here, and found there’s wide disagreement on the matter. Democrats and gun control advocates use the very broad criteria that a mass shooting includes four or more people killed — or injured — in one event. It was developed by the Gun Violence Archive, a group that logs shootings across the country by crowdsourcing media reports. Under its definition, which does not require that anyone is necessarily killed, there have been more than 270 mass shootings so far this year. But there have been far fewer of these crimes where, as Clinton termed it, ""four or more people are killed."" More restrictive criteria A database compiled by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, shows there have been only three mass shootings so far this year that meet the four-or-more measurement expressed by Clinton at the speech. The magazine itself shows seven mass shootings so far this year because it uses three or more deaths as its criteria. It excludes more conventional crimes such as armed robberies and gang violence in its count, focusing instead on ""the distinct phenomenon of mass shootings.""  The Gun Violence Archive, meanwhile, which includes gang shootings and home invasion robberies as mass shootings, had tallied 19 shootings in which four or more people were killed.  In the past, the federal government has used the more restrictive criteria of four or more killed to define a mass shooting. We found there’s no widely accepted definition that doesn’t create its own share of questions. A spokesman for Clinton pointed to the Gun Violence Archive’s definition for mass shootings, but did not immediately provide an explanation for Clinton’s misstatement of that definition. Our ruling Hillary Clinton in her UC Davis speech said there have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States so far this year. She defined the events as ""where four or more are killed."" Our research has shown that a broad definition of mass shootings requires four or more people to be killed or injured. There have been more than 270 of those horrific crimes so far this year. But Clinton left out the key words ""or injured,"" dramatically changing the criteria for these shootings. There have been a much smaller number of mass shootings that meet this stricter criteria of ""four or more people killed,"" nowhere near the 270 she claimed. We rate Clinton’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",/factchecks/2017/oct/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-false-claim-mass-shootings/
"['Abortion', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Rauner consistent from the start on his pro-choice views
","Gov. Bruce Rauner’s signing of a controversial abortion bill last month triggered an avalanche of protest from his fellow Illinois Republicans and anti-abortion groups, who said he had betrayed them. The bill, House Bill 40, removed a ""trigger provision"" in Illinois law that would have made abortion illegal should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade. It also made abortion eligible for coverage under Medicaid in Illinois and under the state’s employee health insurance plan. Opponents were angry that Rauner broke a promise he made five months earlier to veto the bill because of its Medicaid and insurance component, which for the first time would use state taxpayer funds to pay for abortion outside of cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother. They also claimed Rauner reneged on a campaign pledge that he had ""no social agenda,"" which they interpreted as Rauner having no plans to change the state’s abortion laws. In a Sept. 28 press conference in which he announced his intent to sign the bill, Rauner lamented that he could not convince Democratic lawmakers to split the legislation into separate bills, one covering the trigger provision and the other dealing with insurance coverage. But he defended his action as consistent with his pro-choice principles. ""I personally am pro-choice. I always have been. And I made no qualms about that when I was elected governor,"" Rauner said. Rauner’s statement sent us combing through video clips, ads and news coverage of the 2014 gubernatorial election to see if he really was consistent in presenting his pro-choice stance to voters during that hotly contested race. Here’s what we found. Rauner, a wealthy private equity investor who had never run for elected office, sought to build his campaign solely on economic, educational and political reform issues. He stated often that he had no social agenda, and his wife, Diana, appeared in a campaign ad making that very statement. This helped Rauner avoid taking a direct stand on same-sex marriage, which was a hot topic in Illinois politics in the months preceding the 2014 GOP primary for governor. In May 2013, just before Rauner formally declared his candidacy, longtime state GOP chairman Pat Brady resigned in part because of fallout from him having declared his support for same-sex marriage. Rauner’s no-social-agenda claim also proved useful when it came to navigating the political minefield of abortion. To win election in a Democratic-leaning state, Rauner needed to get votes from Democrats who support abortion rights and moderate Republicans without antagonizing social conservatives. ""My opponent is desperate for social issues to become prominent in the campaign,"" Rauner said in a campaign appearance with his running mate, Evelyn Sanguinetti, in June 2014. ""And I’ve been crystal clear: I do not have a social agenda. Evelyn and I are not running on social issues. We all have our personal beliefs. We are not advocating leading on social issues, we are fine with the status quo on that."" That said, we found several examples in which Rauner explained his position on access to abortion during the campaign. In an appearance before Wauconda Township Republicans on Oct. 2, 2013, Rauner said: ""Abortion is a tragedy. It’s a loss of life. To me that’s not debatable. However, I do not advocate making it illegal. I can’t, I won’t, I’m not going to talk about making it illegal. I’m going to work and support efforts to make it safe and rare. Parental notification, late-term restrictions, teaching abstinence outside of marriage and strongly encouraging adoption as a far better alternative."" To residents of HeatherRidge community in Gurnee on Nov. 3, 2013:   ""The reality is the right for a woman to choose is the national law and we’re not gonna, that ain’t gonna change in Illinois. I think we can agree on some common-sense ways where abortion can be more rare and safe. I support parental notification. I support late-term restrictions. I strongly encourage adoption as a far better alternative to abortion. There are things we can agree on to work on to try and get done, realistically… ""I just think it’s better for a woman and her physician and her family and her minister or priest make the decision than the government. That’s my view. People can disagree with me. I respect that. But that’s my view, it ain’t gonna change."" It came up in an interview on the ""Big John and Amy Show"" on WIND-AM 560 on March 17, 2014: Amy Jacobson: ""If there was a possibility that the decision was passed from federal to state jurisdiction, what would your position be?"" Rauner: ""My position would be abortion is a tragedy but it should be an issue left to a woman with her physician and her family and her minister, not the government.""   It wasn’t just the candidate himself proclaiming his ""pro-choice"" bona fides during the campaign. Diana Rauner, head of the child advocacy concern the Ounce of Prevention Fund, became a strong spokeswoman for her husband’s no-social-agenda agenda, especially where it concerned reproductive rights. ""You can trust him that there’s no way he will ever let anything happen to our reproductive rights,"" Diana Rauner said in an interview with NBC5 political reporter Mary Ann Ahern on Sept. 26, 2014. ""I actually think this is a great opportunity in this race where we actually don’t have to think about the social issues because both candidates are pro-choice."" The campaign featured a 30-second TV ad in which Diana, who claimed to be a Democrat,  sought to bring Democrats to her husband’s side by telling viewers, ""Bruce doesn't have a social agenda. He has an economic and educational agenda."" After an Oct. 24, 2014, event in Chicago in which feminist icon Gloria Steinem endorsed Quinn and accused Rauner of financially supporting anti-abortion causes and candidates. ""In terms of money and action, he is, in fact, anti-choice,"" Steinem said during her appearance with Quinn. Diana Rauner provided the response in an interview with then ABC-7 political reporter Charles Thomas. ""Bruce has a strong history of being a supporter of reproductive rights,"" she said. ""He’s a social moderate and he’s committed to education and has shown that commitment over the years."" Throughout the campaign, Rauner found himself in the strange position of being a Republican candidate forced to deny charges that he opposed abortion. Despite Rauner’s many statements to the contrary, the Quinn campaign sought to portray Rauner as a major funder of anti-abortion candidates and organizations. The Chicago Tribune story on Steinem’s appearance carried this rebuttal from Rauner’s campaign: ""Rauner campaign aides said the candidate and wife Diana have donated money to abortion rights groups including Planned Parenthood and the Roger Baldwin Foundation."" The Baldwin Foundation is a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union that litigates issues including reproductive rights. At the same time, however, Rauner was a heavy donor to Republican candidates and state and national Republican organizations that were firmly in the anti-abortion camp. Chicago Magazine detailed the political/ideological conflict of the Rauners in an article published the day before the 2014 election headlined, ""Is Bruce Rauner Pro-Choice, Anti-Choice, or Just an Opportunist?"" (I)t’s interesting to look at the self-proclaimed Democrat, Diana, who has given in 2014 the max in the primary and/or general to several Republicans, some who are decidedly not socially moderate...

Just a couple of examples: David McSweeney (abortion and gay marriage opponent), Mark Neerhof (against gay marriage). Diana has also given generously ($10,000 in 2012; $5,300 this time around) to the Republican Renaissance PAC of the late ultra-conservative Jack Roeser (anti abortion, anti gay marriage).

Bruce has a much more extensive record of contributions—including $27.6 million to himself, $5 million to the state Republican party, and also, along with Diana, donations to McSweeney, Neerhof, and to Roeser’s PAC. (Roeser, who died last June, was an early Rauner backer and a member of his gubernatorial exploratory committee.) Considering the contradictory nature of the Rauners’ donations -- giving heavily to groups that support abortion rights and also to political candidates and organizations that oppose them -- it’s reasonable to believe that some anti-abortion voters might have inferred anti-abortion leanings in candidate Rauner. But we found no evidence of Rauner himself attempting to hide his true stance. In 2014, campaigning on maintaining the status quo on abortion was a viable option. State finances were a wreck and there appeared to be little pressure either way to change the state’s laws on abortion. The election of Donald Trump, who stated an intent to overturn Roe v. Wade and turn the question of abortion’s legality back to the states, changed that overnight. Almost immediately, Democrats in the Illinois General Assembly began advancing a bill to both keep abortion legal should Roe v. Wade be overturned and provide insurance coverage for it under Medicaid and Illinois’ state employee health insurance. ""I look at it as an insurance parity issue. There’s no excuse about the cost,"" Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, said in December 2016. By packaging the trigger language and the expanded insurance coverage into a single bill, supporters of what became HB 40 effectively boxed Rauner by forcing the no-social-agenda governor to pick a side in the culture wars. He would infuriate pro-choice voters by either vetoing the bill outright or issuing an amendatory veto to strike the abortion insurance provision, the practical effect of which would be to kill the measure anyway. But signing HB 40 would be sure to antagonize much his Republican base, much of which remains passionately opposed to abortion. This was something Rauner had worked throughout the spring to avoid, at times sending out mixed signals about how he intended to handle the bill if lawmakers sent it to his desk. He made public statements in April promising to veto the bill as written. When he broke that promise, he faced the wrath of everyone from rank-and-file Republican lawmakers to Chicago Cardinal Blaise Cupich. Rauner, speaking haltingly and appearing physically uncomfortable, explained at his signing press conference that adding government funded insurance coverage was consistent with his pro-choice beliefs. ""I also believe that no woman should be forced to make a different decision than another woman make purely based on her income,"" Rauner said. ""I believe that a woman living with limited financial means should not be put in a position where she has to choose something different than a woman of higher income would be able to choose."" Bruce Rauner said his signing of a controversial abortion bill was consistent with his pro-choice principles and that he had never presented himself as anything but pro-choice. We looked through numerous campaign appearance videos, ads and news stories and found no evidence that Rauner ever tried to hide or downplay his pro-choice beliefs. In fact, his campaign touted the Rauners’ support of abortion rights groups to rebut the charge that he was not pro-choice. Rauner sought anti-abortion voters by assuring them that, as governor, he had no social agenda and that ""the right for a woman to choose is the national law and… that ain’t gonna change in Illinois."" Politically, it proved to be a smart strategy that helped gain him election in 2014. By 2017, however, it became impossible to continue finessing the issue. In picking a side, Rauner declared that he has been consistent in declaring his pro-choice beliefs. We rate that statement True.",/factchecks/2017/oct/10/bruce-rauner/rauner-consistent-start-his-pro-choice-views/

NFL's Colin Kaepernick incorrectly credits Winston Churchill for quote about lies
","Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, apparently responding to a TV report he considered incorrect, tweeted a quote about lying that he attributed to British leader Winston Churchill. Like every good play in football, let’s set up our formation: During the 2016 season, Kaepernick knelt during the Star-Spangled Banner to protest racial inequality. He then opted out of his 49ers contract and has not been re-signed. Many people think Kaepernick has been blacklisted by the NFL for his protests. USA Today and ESPN then reported in March that Kaepernick would stand during the national anthem. The stories both used anonymous sources, because Kaepernick had not (and as of this writing, still has not) spoken publicly about whether he would continue his protests. On Oct. 8, 2017, CBS Sports reporter Jason La Canfora told The NFL Today host James Brown that Kaepernick wanted to play in the NFL again. Brown asked La Canfora, who said he had spoken to Kaepernick the night before, whether the quarterback would continue to kneel in protest. ""He's not planning on kneeling,"" La Canfora answered. That garnered some attention in the sports world, but upon further review, La Canfora walked back his remarks. He clarified his answer via Twitter shortly after the broadcast, writing that that he had not actually asked Kaepernick about his protests. Standing for Anthem wasn't something that I spoke to Colin about sat. I relayed what had been reported about him standing in the future... Reports about @Kaepernick7 standing for anthem had not been refuted. However, I cant say if they are true or not. Colin and I didn't discuss In an apparent response to La Canfora, Kaepernick tweeted the quote later that day. ""A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on. Winston S. Churchill,"" he wrote. A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.Winston S. Churchill But we have to throw a flag on this one, because there’s no evidence that Churchill ever said it — although the British Bulldog does often get the credit. Tim Riley, director of the National Churchill Museum at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., said Kaepernick is not the first to make this mistake. This and other misattributed Churchill quotes often spread online, he said. ""The irony is that today such misattributed quotes circle the globe a thousand times before the truth even begins to think about putting on pants,"" Riley said. Churchill historian Richard Langworth found the saying traced back to President Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull, who wrote: ""A lie will gallop halfway round the world before the truth has time to pull its breeches on."" Langworth also noted Churchill would have said trousers, not breeches, so there’s that. But we’re still only partially dressed with that explanation. This quote has dozens of variations, stretching back quite some time. If we go to 1919, Mark Twain got credit for saying, ""A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots."" (Samuel Clemens died in 1910, by the way.) Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon allegedly used a version with boots in it back in 1855. The saying sometimes substitutes shoes. In 1840, it was credited to Thomas Jefferson. There’s an entire history of the saying on QuoteInvestigator.com, citing sources that attribute versions of it to all manner of outlets, from magazines to Chinese proverbs. The origins of the quote reach all the way back to the 18th century. One version is attributed to English clergyman Thomas Francklin. ""Falsehood will fly, as it were, on the wings of the wind, and carry its tales to every corner of the earth; whilst truth lags behind; her steps, though sure, are slow and solemn,"" he wrote in a 1787 sermon. But Bonnie Taylor-Blake, a neuroscience researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and amateur etymologist, told PolitiFact that she and other word investigators found a probable origin with no mention of boots or pants. ""Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it,"" Jonathan Swift wrote in The Examiner in 1710. ""I should note that it's possible, though maybe not terribly likely, that the metaphor wasn't entirely Swift's,"" Taylor-Blake said. ""He may have adapted it from an earlier, now-unknown form, even a version not then in English."" Kaepernick credited Churchill for saying, ""A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on."" This is a quote that often is attributed to the British prime minister, but there’s no record of him saying it. But that’s a common mistake, experts told us. The line has grown and evolved — and then credited to different people — many times over hundreds of years, potentially starting with a version by Swift in 1710. This is a broken play by Kaepernick.

"['Economy', 'Taxes', 'New York', 'Charles Schumer']","
Does Trump's tax plan do nothing for low income earners?
","Senate Democratic Leader Charles E. Schumer says President Donald Trump’s tax plan would raise the federal income tax rate for the country’s lowest earners while lowering it for the wealthy. Democrats oppose the plan, saying it benefits the rich over the poor. ""It’s completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class,"" Schumer said on CBS’ Face the Nation. The plan’s framework is big on policy but scarce on details. So is Schumer right? Given the proposed changes to tax rates, brackets, deductions and tax credits, does the Trump plan focus only on the nation's wealthiest taxpayers? The tax rates Trump’s tax plan would increase the lowest federal tax rate, but it also would increase the number of people who don’t have to pay federal income tax. The lowest earners currently have a federal income tax rate of 10 percent. Those are single filers who earn up to $9,325 and married couples who earn up to $18,650 in 2017. Trump’s tax plan would increase the lowest rate from 10 percent to 12 percent. The White House hasn’t said what income level would top out that bracket. People in the highest tax bracket would pay a lower rate. Single filers who make more than $418,400 and married filers who make more than $470,700 are currently taxed at 39.6 percent. That rate would decrease to 35 percent in Trump’s tax plan. Trump leaves open the possibility of adding a fourth tax bracket for the highest earners. Adding another bracket means the new tax code ""does not shift the tax burden from high income to lower and middle income taxpayers,"" according to the plan. Details on what that bracket would look like were not in the plan. RELATED: Are Republicans paying for tax cuts with reductions in Medicare, Medicaid? The deductions More people in the lowest tax bracket would not have to pay federal income tax under Trump’s plan. Most low-income filers already pay no federal income tax because their deductions are more than their reported income. Filers who make less than their total deductions do not pay federal income tax. Two major deductions benefit low-income filers the most: the standard deduction and personal exemptions. The current standard deduction is $6,350 for single filers and $12,700 for married filers. Filers can itemize their deductions rather than taking the standard deduction. Personal exemptions allow filers to deduct $4,050 for each taxpayer and dependent they claim, including themselves. The two combined equal a deduction of $10,400 for a single filer without children in 2017. The amounts change each year. Trump’s plan would eliminate personal exemptions but double the standard deduction to $12,000 for single filers and $24,000 for married filers. That means any filer who earns less than those amounts would pay no federal income tax. Looked at in a different way, a single filer currently in the gap between $10,400 and $12,000 would no longer pay federal income tax. ""The framework is basically taking the current 10 percent tax rate and increasing it to 12 but at the same time it’s effectively increasing the size of the zero tax bracket, at least initially,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax policy think tank. Trump’s plan would replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit, which currently allows a $1,000 credit for each child claimed. A tax credit is different from a deduction. A credit is a dollar amount put toward a filer’s total return while a deduction reduces the amount of a filer’s taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service says a tax credit is always worth more than a deduction of the same amount. The new plan does not specify how much the credit would increase. Who gets the best deal? Many of the tax changes would benefit high-income earners more than others, a report from the Tax Policy Center said. Some of the proposals, like ending the alternative minimum tax and estate tax, would benefit high-income earners disproportionately. About 80 percent of the total tax benefit would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers by 2027, the report said. Their after-tax income would increase 8.7 percent. Taxpayers who make less than about $150,000 each year would see an average tax cut of half a percent or less by 2027 under the plan. Taxpayers who make between $150,000 and $300,000 would actually pay about $800 more on average in taxes. Taxes would increase for about a quarter of all taxpayers by 2027. The report estimates about a third of people making between $50,000 and $150,000 and close to two-thirds of people making between $150,000 and $300,000 would see a tax increase. The report partly attributes those increases to Trump’s plan to replace personal exemptions with a higher Child Tax Credit. Trading the deduction for a credit could leave larger low and middle income families worse off than the current tax code. That will depend on how much the Child Tax Credit increases under the Trump plan. Filers also would no longer be able to deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxes under the plan. That means residents in high tax states like New York could end up paying more in federal taxes. A report from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office estimates 3.3 million residents in New York would on average pay $5,300 more in federal income taxes if they were not able to deduct state and local taxes. More than three million of those residents make below $300,000, according to the report. About 1.8 million make less than $100,000. Our ruling Schumer said Trump’s tax plan is ""completely focused on the wealthy and the powerful - not the middle class."" Granted, there are lots of details missing from Trump's tax plan. But the plan presented so far does deal with taxpayers who are not wealthy. So in a strict reading of his claim, Schumer is saying the Trump plan has no changes, positive or negative, for low- or middle-income taxpayers. That isn't the case. It's possible that by ""completely focused"" Schumer meant the Trump plan benefits only the wealthy and the powerful. But that also isn't completely true. While many of the plan’s proposals would benefit the wealthy, doubling the standard deduction would mean more of the country’s lowest earners would pay no federal income tax and taxpayers earning less than about $150,000 would see a tax cut. We rate Schumer's statement False.",/factchecks/2017/oct/09/charles-schumer/does-trumps-tax-plan-do-nothing-low-income-earners/
