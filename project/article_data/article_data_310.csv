Gov. Scott Walker says board wanted to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler as valid signatures in recall
","Legislative Republicans are fast-tracking a bill to scrap the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, and Gov. Scott Walker turned to Twitter to urge them on. Republicans say the board engaged in unfair treatment of their candidates during the 2011 and 2012 recall elections for Walker and several state senators. They also are critical of its implementation of a voter ID law and its participation in what one GOP senator has called a ""witch hunt"" of conservatives. In advance of a hearing on a bill to replace the accountability board with two new bodies, Walker tweeted eight times Oct. 12, 2015 on the subject, each time using the #ReformGAB hashtag. In one, he brought up two familiar names: ""GAB wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions. #ReformGAB."" Is Walker right? When we asked Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick for evidence to support the claim, she referred us to a Dec. 14, 2011 report on WISN TV and a story that appeared on Politico on the same day. Patrick noted that the WISN story said that ""these names would be counted as long as they were properly dated and included a Wisconsin address."" Patrick also cited a Dec. 13, 2011 video posted by the conservative MacIver Institute and said it shows that the ""GAB specifically states they will accept Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures."" That got us digging into the PolitiFact archives. On Dec. 18, 2011, we looked at this claim from MacIver’s video: ""Wisconsin election officials to accept Mickey Mouse, Hitler signatures"" on recall petitions. We rated it Mostly False. The claim stems from a comment made by GAB elections specialist David Buerger during a Dec. 13, 2011 meeting of the board. Buerger was asked about Mickey Mouse and Hitler and responded: ""We will flag them, but we will not strike them without challenge."" The MacIver video said the board decided to ""accept"" the fictitious signatures, as in counting them toward the total of about 540,000 that was required to force a recall election. That was not the case. Indeed, Buerger noted explicitly they would be ""flagged"" for more review, just not automatically stricken. Here is one window on how technical the verification process is: In 2011, the board did immediately strike an Adolf Hitler signature -- since it listed an out-of-state address (Berlin, Germany). As our item noted: ""For such signatures to actually be counted, they would have to pass undetected through petition circulators, the recall committees, a pair of Government Accountability Board reviewers, Walker’s representatives and other groups that review the petitions. If such signatures were found, Walker could formally challenge them to the board to get them stricken."" According to state law governing recall elections, it’s up to the candidate being recalled to challenge names on the petitions. The statute says: ""The burden of proof for any challenge rests with the individual bringing the challenge."" Patrick, the governor’s spokeswoman, pointed out that the Walker campaign won a court order on Jan. 4, 2012 directing the board to be more aggressive in seeking out and eliminating ""duplicate and fictitious signatures and illegible addresses in recall petitions."" That order was later overturned by an appeals court. GAB spokesman Reid Magney told us in an email:  ""Out of 930,000 signatures submitted on petitions to recall the governor, there were 4,001 duplications and four fictitious signatures (Adolf Hitler, Mick E. Mous, Donald L. Duck, and I Love Scott Walker Thanks)."" To be sure, Walker’s claim is not identical to the one we reviewed from MacIver. Walker tweeted that board wanted to consider the signatures ""as valid."" MacIver asserted they would be accepted -- which, as we noted, still allows for a challenge that would knock them out. Our rating Walker tweeted that the GAB ""wanted to consider Mickey Mouse and Adolf Hitler as valid signatures on recall petitions."" But there’s no evidence to support that. The process would not have immediately struck them. Rather, it would have flagged them for review. And there were numerous layers of scrutiny before it would have been determined valid. Walker took a Mostly False statement and embellished it. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-board-wanted-accept-mickey-m/
"['Candidate Biography', 'History', 'Texas', 'Jason Villalba']","
Jason Villalba said Bernie Sanders is a Democratic Socialist and ""Nazis were Democratic Socialists""
"," Bernie Sanders proudly declares himself a democratic socialist. A Texas state representative suggested that Sanders must somehow then be aligned with the Nazis of Adolf Hitler. State Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas, posted a tweet during the CNN-hosted Democratic presidential debate Oct. 13, 2015, that opened: ""The modern Democrat Party is filled with Democratic Socialists and soft socialists. Is this where we are in America?"" To that tweet, Villalba attached an image of what looked like an old document stating: ""That awkward moment when … 1) Bernie Sanders admits he is a Democratic Socialist. 2) Nazis were Democratic Socialists 3) America fought an entire World War to stop the advance of Democratic Socialists."" The image closed: ""Sincerely, Sane Americans."" A Democratic activist, Ed Espinoza of Progress Texas, brought it to our attention for a fact check. We didn’t hear back from Villalba about the presented ""Democratic Socialist"" conclusions. But he told the Dallas Morning News and Jonathan Tilove, chief political writer for the Austin American-Statesman, that the image with its mentions of Sanders and the Nazis was a meme he found online. He also insisted his tweet wasn’t likening Democrats to Nazis. ""So is the history accurate in this?"" Villalba told Tilove by phone. ""Of course not. Look, was I trying to make a connection between Sanders and the Nazi party? Absolutely not. I categorically reject any suggestion that that  is what I was intending to do."" By the next day, Villalba's tweet was no longer posted by him. Regardless, we checked its accuracy. Sanders a democratic socialist Sanders, the independent Vermont senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination, considers himself a democratic socialist. He’s also Jewish. In the debate, moderator Anderson Cooper delved in: COOPER: ""You call yourself a democratic socialist. How can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?"" SANDERS: ""Well, we're going to win because first, we're going to explain what democratic socialism is. And what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent - almost - own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong, today, in a rigged economy, that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. ""That when you look around the world, you see every other major country providing healthcare to all people as a right, except the United States. You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not going to separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have - we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth. ""Those are some of the principles that I believe in and I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people…"" COOPER: …""You don't consider yourself a capitalist, though?"" SANDERS: ""Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires."" Nazis And were the Nazis also Democratic Socialists? We consulted historians and books, finding the Nazi party’s full name was the National Socialist German Workers’ Party. That name was adopted in 1920; before that, the party had been the German Workers’ Party. But there was little socialist about the party’s platform or Hitler’s actions once he acceded to leading Germany in the early 1930s. By phone and email, Rice University historian Peter Caldwell told us the key word in the party’s name was ""national"" and the party’s focus was on building nationalism — a focus ultimately reflected in Hitler’s twisted vision of cleansing the country of residents, especially Jews, not considered of pure German blood. While socialists on the left celebrate democracy, Caldwell said, the word has a different meaning on the right — in this instance, he said, excluding people who are not part of the nation, hence rejecting Jews and communists and, in pre-World War II Germany, democracy itself. Caldwell said the ""misleading"" tweet suggesting an alignment between Sanders’ professed democratic socialism and Hitler’s party would ""have Hitler turning in his grave, wherever the grave is. The Nazis loudly opposed democracy, the first and foremost thing."" Also, he said, ""they were opposed to emancipating the workers, giving them the rights to vote and to organize"" in unions. Similarly, Barbara Miller Lane, a Bryn Mawr College professor and co-editor of a compilation of Nazi ideology before 1933, said by email: ""The Nazis were NOT ‘democratic socialists,’ whatever that means. The Nazis were never democrats and never real socialists either."" While there was a longstanding and distinguished Social Democratic Party in Germany from the 1870 to the 1920s, Lane wrote, the Nazis fought against it, and after 1933 imprisoned its leaders. Lane added: ""The Nazis opposed all traditional socialism, wanting to substitute something they called ‘German socialism’ or ‘Aryan socialism.’ This meant citizenship and privileges only for ‘Aryans’ (meaning non-Jews), concentration camps for others."" According to the ""The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany,"" Hitler joined the German Workers’ Party in 1919, the year before the party’s decision to add National and Socialist to its name. At the time, according to the book, supporters included ""well-placed anti-Semites and extreme nationalists"" who hoped to gain influence over members of the working class; Hitler, a spellbinding orator, became the party’s chairman in 1921. Another book, ""A Brief History of Germany,"" says the Nazi’s ""appealed to a broad swath of the German population, attracting fervent nationalists and radical conservatives, as well as those who hated the Versailles settlement, feared the communists, or despised the Jews."" Our ruling Villalba said Sanders ""admits he is a democratic socialist… Nazis were Democratic Socialists."" Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist. The Nazis were not democratic socialists. Whether or not Villalba intended to link Sanders to the Nazis, his tweet neatly did the job. We find this claim historically inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

"['Georgia', 'Jobs', 'American Petroleum Institute']","
Group gets it close on oil/gas jobs in Georgia
","Anything that has to do with jobs captures the scribes’ eyes here at PolitiFact Georgia. And it was an eye-popping number of jobs that the American Petroleum Institute attributed to the oil and gas industry in a recent press release. ""The oil and natural gas industry provides or supports 141,600 jobs in Georgia,"" according to the blog posting designed to highlight the economic and job impact the energy industry has on the Peach State. This for a state that has yet to produce a single drop of commercially produced gas or oil, we wondered?  The numbers The API cited a 2013 report that it commissioned, Economic Impacts of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry on the U.S. Economy in 2011, from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The report includes state-by-state breakdowns on how many jobs have been created, as well as the overall economic impact of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry. The analysis arrives at the 141,600 job estimate first with data from the U.S. bureaus of Economic Analysis and of Labor Statistics for a dozen job codes. The report breaks that job tally into three categories. It says 42,638 jobs were directly involved in the oil and natural gas industry. That includes the expected extraction and production jobs and – as we will get to in a moment – a total of 29,146 jobs at gas stations with and without convenience stores. If that were the only category, those jobs would account for just 0.8 percent of all Georgia jobs. But the report classifies another 33,502 workers as indirectly involved in the oil and gas industry, or with positions in activities in outside industries that supply those fields. Drew Lyon, principal and leader of the national economics and statistics group at PwC and the author of the report, said care was taken to eliminate double counts so that some suppliers who would have been in the direct jobs tally were removed. Then the largest number of jobs -- 65,490 -- are counted as ""induced"" jobs. Lyon said those are the positions that are created to meet the demand from the spending of employees in the direct and indirect jobs. In that category, the general ""service"" field has by far the most indirect and induced jobs, with 43,349 workers – or 711 more employees than work directly for the oil and natural gas industries. Considering those jobs are apt to be in professional services, healthcare, education and the like – all known powerhouses in metro Atlanta’s economy -- those numbers are not surprising. And to Lyon, they show how many of those back office jobs -- say in human resources -- owe their existence to an industry thought of as minor in the Peach State. ""It’s no surprise, for example, that a significant amount of employment in Texas is directly related to oil and gas,"" Lyon said. ""But it’s of interest in how other states, either as suppliers to in-state or out-of-state producers, or through some of these other industries, are impacted by the oil and gas industry."" Taken together, that brings the total to 141,600 jobs, or 2.7 percent of the Georgia workforce. But is it fair to count all of those jobs, knowing that two thirds of the positions in question are outside the oil and gas industries? Bruce Seaman, an economist at Georgia State’s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said he was not troubled with the methodology of the study. The report took care not to count jobs twice and also used commonly accepted input-output models to show the known relationships between industries (Basically, the output from one industry become inputs in another but must be adjusted not to exaggerate the impact). That said, Seaman wondered about the service station employees, who primarily are not working as pump attendants or mechanics. Especially at stations with stores, those workers are apt to run the cash registers, do janitorial work or even cook. ""Those jobs are more accurately convenience store retail jobs,"" Seaman said. The BLS codes back up that assessment, listing those positions as retail, versus the mining or production jobs expected in oil and gas. Lyon said PwC included those gas station positions as a best estimate of companies and jobs that exist only because of the gas and oil industry. Reid Porter, a spokesman at API, agreed, adding ""What happens in the oil and natural gas industry reverberates throughout the entire economy."" Our ruling The American Petroleum Institute recently released a series of press releases, drawing attention to the economic impact of the oil and gas industry on every state. Georgia, it said, has 141,600 jobs provided or supported by oil and gas. A 2011 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers backs up the number by looking at direct positions in the industry, supportive jobs and, accounting for most of the workers, all of the positions created from the industry and its supply chain. The math and economics are right – to a point. But careful examination of the report shows that 68 percent of the jobs counted as directly working in the oil and gas industry could just as easily be classified as retail workers. Adjusting the base number up by 29,146 workers, then, amplifies the number of jobs that support the industry or caters to its whims. The report is clear that it counts those positions, though. And the claim takes care to say the industry ""supports"" that large number of workers. It’s accurate, but somewhat misleading. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/16/american-petroleum-institute/group-gets-it-close-oilgas-jobs-georgia/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says K-12 education funding is highest in Florida's history
","Amid his calls for legislators to cut taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars next year, Gov. Rick Scott bragged that Florida’s education system is getting record funding on his watch. During a news conference on Oct. 14, 2015, Scott called for tax cuts beyond the $400 million the Legislature approved earlier in the year. Scott had promised to cut taxes by $1 billion over two years, but lawmakers are already signaling that may not be possible. When a reporter asked Scott how he can push tax cuts and still guarantee public schools the capital funding they need, Scott repeated a boast he’s made before: ""We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state."" Scott and Florida Republicans have been making the claim since his 2014 re-election campaign that school funding has been at historic levels, but it’s simply not a complete picture of the education budget. (Scott intends to release his full budget proposal in December.) We decided it was time to revisit this particular claim. Total vs. per-pupil vs. inflation The education budget has been a prickly issue for Scott since he recommended major cuts in his first year in office. State tax revenues have recovered with the end of the recession, and Scott has pushed to move the budget back up each year since, which has led to his current claim. While Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist squabbled during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign over who held the spending record, we noted they both could stake a claim: Scott had the largest budget in total dollars, while Crist spent the most per student back in 2007-08. With Scott well into his second term, the same is still true today. After winning re-election, Scott wanted to bump up spending in his January 2015 budget proposal, to $19.75 billion total and $7,176 per pupil. That would have been about $850,000 higher than the previous year’s budget, and $50 higher per student than the record of $7,126 under Crist. But the Legislature has the final say, and faced a budget deadlock over several issues, including a debate about potentially expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. After a special session in the summer to hammer out a budget, the Legislature didn’t give Scott the amount he wanted. We checked the latest calculations for the Florida Education Finance Program, a pot of state and local money for schools that is adjusted periodically throughout the year to factor in tax receipts and enrollment. We found that for the 2015-16 school year, the K-12 system is getting a total budget of about $19.7 billion, or about $7,105 per student . Let’s take a look at the past few years to get a better idea of how much money has been going to education spending. Fiscal year (governor) Total K-12 budget Per pupil spending K-12 enrollment 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2.63 million 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2.62 million 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2.63 million 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2.64 million 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2.67 million 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2.70 million 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,769 2.705 million 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,915 2.74 million 2015-16 (Scott) $19.7 billion $7,105 2.77 million *Includes federal stimulus money There are some details about the funding that we won’t explore in much detail. The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida used about $900 million each in federal stimulus money for the budget, for example. Also, the amount of property taxes collected through what is known as the Required Local Effort can change from year to year. Scott's office said the budget is at its highest level ever in terms of total dollars. But you would expect it to be, considering the K-12 school system also has its highest enrollment ever. There are about 100,000 more students today than when Scott took office, and about 140,000 more than when Crist oversaw the highest per-pupil spending in 2007-08. The money in today’s budget isn’t exceeding the record level in terms of sheer dollars per student, but that’s even less so when we factor for inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, which is somewhat imprecise but can give us broad insight on the subject, even Scott’s January 2015 request to best Crist’s spending by $50 per student lags far behind. Just to match 2007’s $7,126, per-pupil spending would have to be in the neighborhood of $8,190 today. Using this method, the current total budget would have to be in excess of $21.4 billion. We’ve rated claims similar to this one Half True in the past, but it’s apparent that Scott’s claim is misleading. Any reasonable person would expect a growing education system to naturally have a larger budget after nearly a decade. In this case, the dollars simply don’t go as far as they once did. Our ruling Scott said, ""We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state."" That’s accurate in one sense, because the state’s total education budget is at an all-time high of $19.7 billion. But enrollment is also higher than in years past. Per-pupil spending is still below historic dollar totals and remains far below equitable levels when adjusted for inflation. Education spending has essentially stood still over the last nine years. Scott’s claim obscures that. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/15/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-k-12-funding-highest-states-histor/

Paul Ryan one of few GOP House members 'to have voted for every bailout,' RedState blogger says
","In the frenzy that followed the surprise decision by California Republican Kevin McCarthy to drop his bid for Speaker of the House, all eyes turned to Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan. And the knives came out. The left-wing website Salon slammed Ryan as too conservative, saying he ""is just as much a wild-eyed right-wing nut as the rest of them, even if he can occasionally look a bit calmer on the TV."" But even as it appeared that Ryan -- the Ways and Means chairman and 2012 GOP vice-presidential nominee -- was the consensus choice for speaker, he was attacked as not being conservative enough. Ryan ""is a dangerous pick for conservatives,"" RedState.com editor-in-chief Erick Erickson wrote in a Oct. 9, 2015 blog post. ""While in Congress, he voted for No Child Left Behind, the Prescription Drug Benefit, TARP, caps on CEO pay, the AIG bill, the GM bailout, the debt ceiling, and now the fiscal cliff. ""In fact, Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress."" Let's see if the bailout claim against Ryan -- who continues to be wooed, even though he has continued to say he's not going to run for speaker -- is on target. Ryan’s conservativeness Ryan is widely considered a conservative; indeed, he would be the most conservative House speaker in generations, as measured by a congressional rating system widely used by political scientists. Of course -- just like it is on the other end of the political spectrum -- there is right wing and then there is more right wing. Since 1971, the American Conservative Union has rated members of Congress based on legislation the group says is important. On a scale of zero to 100, Ryan, who has been in the House since 1999, has a lifetime rating of 90. On the other hand, his annual rating hit a career-low of 80 in 2011 and again in 2014.   Meanwhile, the Conservative Review, headed by nationally syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin, gives Ryan a ""liberty score"" of 58 percent on votes taken over the past six years -- a rating which it equates to a grade of F. Defining bailout It’s not clear from Erickson’s blog post what he regards as a bailout. He did not reply to our requests to provide information to back up his statement.   Bailout, of course, is not a precise term. But there were at least three votes taken by the House on bailouts -- one on the giant bailout known as TARP, one on a separate measure for the auto industry, and one for the federal enterprises known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. TARP and the Freddie Mac and Fannie May rescues are the bailouts followed by Bailout Tracker, a feature of ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news site. 1. TARP In October 2008, the Democratically controlled Congress approved a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, primarily to rescue banks in response to the subprime mortgage crisis. It was aimed at rescuing banks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America. Later, a bailout of the auto industry also was part of TARP, primarily to Chrysler, General Motors and GM’s financial subsidiary, GMAC. (The total amount was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank law in 2010. About $245 billion went to banks and about $80 billion to the auto industry.) It’s worth noting that the measure, known as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, was signed into law by a Republican president, George W. Bush. But it was also backed and continued by Bush’s Democratic successor, Barack Obama. TARP passed by a margin of 263-171 in the House. Ryan was among 91 Republicans who voted yes. Ryan’s vote earned him a demerit from the American Conservative Union. He said on the House floor at the time: ""This bill offends my principles, but I’m going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles, in order to preserve this free enterprise system."" 2. Auto bailout bill In December 2008, the House approved a related auto bailout bill by a vote of 237-170. Only a third as many Republican voted for the auto measure as voted for TARP. Ryan, whose district was home to a sprawling General Motors plant that closed the same month as the vote, was among 32 Republicans who voted yes. He said in a statement at the time that ""because no additional taxpayer dollars were appropriated, I was able to support this legislation."" By our tally, Ryan was one of 20 Republicans who voted for both TARP and the separate auto bailout measure, which did not become law. That's not less than a dozen, the figure Erickson used. But Ryan is among only five of the 20 who are still in the House. 3. Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae Freddie Mac (officially, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) and Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) are government-sponsored enterprises that help increase the money available for home loans. They were placed under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency in September 2008. Some $187.5 billion in federal funds have been invested in the two companies, according to ProPublica. Those funds were authorized by a law known as the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which passed the House more than a year earlier, in August 2007. But Ryan voted against it. Before we close, we’ll note there was also a bailout of AIG, the insurance company, in 2008. But that $182 billion rescue was done with loans from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, not through an act of Congress. And Erickson’s claim was limited to those acted on by Congress. Our rating Erickson said Ryan ""is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress."" Ryan was one of 20 GOP House members who voted for TARP and for a related auto industry bailout measure that did not become law, although he is only one of only five of those members who are still in the House. On the other hand, Ryan voted against the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.

15 of 20 most polluted cities in world are in India, China, says Jim Webb
","Former Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., spent most of the first Democratic presidential debate in the shadow of frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. But he got in a few shots here and there. During the debate, Webb discussed the issue of climate change, arguing that the United States can’t go it alone. ""We are not going to solve climate change simply with the laws here,"" Webb said. ""We've done a good job in this country since 1970. If you look at China and India, they're the greatest polluters in the world. Fifteen out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in one of those two countries. We need to solve this in a global way. It's a global problem."" We decided to check whether Webb is right that ""15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China, and whether his point is relevant for the climate change debate. (Webb’s staff did not respond to an inquiry.) The top-20 list There is indeed a credible top-20 list for most-polluted cities. It was assembled by the World Health Organization in 2014. It compares cities based on how much fine particulate matter they have in the air. This measurement is called PM 2.5, standing for particulate matter that is 2.5 microns in width or smaller. (There are about 25,000 microns per inch, so these particles are very small.) Such pollutants at the ground level pose such immediate health risks as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, and they can elevate the risk for lung and heart ailments over the longer term. These small particles typically come from exhaust from cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles, though they can also come from natural sources such as forest and grass fires. Here’s the list: Rank CIty and country PM 2.5 pollution level 1 Delhi, India 153 2 Patna, India 149 3 Gwalior, India 144 4 Raipur, India 134 5 Karachi, Pakistan 117 6 Peshawar, Pakistan 111 7 Rawalpindi, Pakistan 107 8 Khormabad, Iran 102 9 Ahmedabad, India 100 10 Lucknow, India 96 11 Firozabad, India 96 12 Doha, Qatar 93 13 Kanpur, India 93 14 Amritsar, India 92 15 Ludhiana, India 91 16 Idgir, Turkey 90 17 Narayonganj, Bangladesh 89 18 Allahbad, India 88 19 Agra, India 88 20 Khanna, India 88 So, 13 of the 20 cities on the most-polluted list are located in India (they’re highlighted in bold). That’s two fewer cities than Webb had said, and none of the 20 cities on the list are located in China, as he’d indicated. Still, Webb’s not that far off, and he has a point that the list is dominated by developing countries, including many in south Asia. The relevance of this finding for climate change It’s important to note, however, that particulate pollution is not a key contributor to climate change. Rising global temperatures are more heavily tied to emissions of another substance -- carbon dioxide. Webb’s comment ""does seem to conflate two issues,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Looking at the U.S. experience over the past few decades can help clarify the difference between the two metrics. ""The U.S. cleaned up emission of particulates and sulfate aerosols by requiring cleaner, lower-sulfur coal and cleaner diesel fuel,"" Reilly said. ""But cleaning up those emissions does nothing directly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, since we continued to use coal and petroleum products."" Ironically, particulate emissions may actually have a cooling effect rather than a warming effect because they can reflect sunlight back into space, said Brian Soden, a professor in atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. This reflectiveness may have made the earth warm more slowly than it might otherwise have. That said, experts agreed that there’s likely a reasonably high correlation between cities that have high particulate counts and those that have high emission levels for carbon dioxide, particularly when you look beyond advanced industrialized nations like the United States. While ""the two lists will not necessarily line up perfectly, the 20 most polluted cities are certainly also top contributors of carbon emissions,"" Soden said. And experts said that Webb does have a point about the need for international cooperation if carbon levels are to be cut. While the United States is a bigger carbon emitter right now, other nations like India are seeing their emissions rise more rapidly. Emissions are only going to fall worldwide if most major emitters reduce their output together. ""Yes, it is absolutely a global problem, but someone needs to lead,"" Soden said. Our ruling Webb said that ""15 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world"" are in India and China. He’s close -- 13 are in India, though none are in China. It’s worth pointing out, however, that the top-20 list measures cities with the greatest level of particulate pollution, which is not the same thing as emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.  https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b78a803a-7a52-45a4-beff-8123446f0f36",/factchecks/2015/oct/15/jim-webb/15-20-most-polluted-cities-world-are-india-china-s/

Chafee says no scandals on his watch; that's true by R.I. standards
","It was the grandest of stages for a former Warwick mayor turned U.S. senator, turned Rhode Island governor, turned presidential candidate. Rhode Island’s Lincoln Chafee was in a nationally televised debate Tuesday night with a chance to shine against just four rivals. Chafee set out to distinguish himself in his opening statement, making a number of claims we’ve heard before as well as this boast:   ""I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals,"" Chafee said. No scandals? Nothing in almost three decades? A bold claim, especially for a Rhode Island politician. It’s true Chafee has never been charged, indicted, convicted or imprisoned. During those 30 years, one governor, the mayor of Providence and a gaggle of others have gone to prison.   But scandal isn’t strictly a legal term. According to the dictionary, a scandal is a public disgrace. We kept that in mind as we reviewed Chafee’s 30 years of public service. One story jumped out at us. A controversy about the purchase of frogs — yes frogs for the mayor’s aquarium — as well as toboggans, theater tickets, flowers and other items totalling thousands of dollars a year. Chafee’s office bought the four frogs, which cost $1.99 each in 1997, and the rest of the stuff with taxpayers’ money from a discretionary account for the Warwick mayor’s office. The story blew up in 2000 as Chafee ran to keep his U.S. Senate seat. Chafee said other mayors had used the same account. But, he said, he was the first mayor to keep records on expenses. Unimpressed, Chafee’s critics charged he had inappropriately spent taxpayer money. One, mayoral candidate, Michael Woods, the 43-year-old brother of actor James Woods, called for a state police investigation.  The Journal’s archives include two chapters in Chafee’s life that are more personal. For some politicians, college escapades involving cocaine or other narcotics, are fodder for scandal, especially when it’s something that’s concealed initially. Chafee’s experience with cocaine was still under wraps in the late ’90s and when the much anticipated questions finally came, he took pride in his transparent response. He immediately admitted his use of cocaine. And moved on with his career. As governor, there was another controversy surrounding the state’s handling of an underage drinking party thrown by Chafee’s 18-year-old son Caleb Chafee on the family’s Exeter property in 2012. The younger Chafee pleaded no contest to a criminal charge of violating the social host law; the state police never released the records on their investigation of the governor’s son. Some suggested that this raised questions about the possibility that there was something to hide. As governor, Chafee made an appointment in the final days of his administration that critics saw as a violation of the state’s revolving-door law. Chafee nominated a top aide and political ally, Richard Licht, for a state judgeship. The state ethics commission allowed the nomination, but critics argued the law should have been applied to Licht, the state’s director of administration. Finally, in the first six months of the Raimondo administration, revelations about the management of the Department of Transportation and the Department of Children, Youth and Families have raised questions about conduct in those departments under Chafee. Our ruling In his opening remarks Tuesday night Chafee said: ""I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals."" We’re not entirely sure what Chafee considers a scandal. We reached out to Chafee’s spokeswoman to get the candidate’s definition, but she said she would need more time to respond.   The dictionary again says a scandal is a public disgrace. Over the past 30 years, Chafee has had his share of controversy, and an occasional brush with scandal. But scandal, a full blown public disgrace? Probably not. After all, in the broader scheme of things, is it disgraceful to buy four frogs for $7.96 to amuse visitors to the mayor’s office? We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/oct/15/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-no-scandals-his-watch-s-true-ri-standa/

Bernie Sanders says people are getting prison sentences for smoking marijuana
","Marijuana came up a number of times during the first Democratic debate on Oct. 14, 2015 -- in some cases when candidates were asked whether they had used the stuff, and at other times in the context of criminal justice policy. A reader asked us to check one claim by Sen. Bernie Sanders related to marijuana. Late in the debate, Sanders was asked whether he had a position on a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana in Nevada, the state where the debate was being held. If he were a Nevada resident, Sanders said, ""I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for nonviolent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs."" A moment later, Sanders’ rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton, provided rhetorical support for Sanders’ claim, saying, ""I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana."" But is it true that, as Sanders put it, the United States is ""imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana""? We decided to take a closer look. Prisoner data What the figures show is that possession itself isn’t usually enough to land someone in jail. Rather, those sentenced to prison for marijuana offenses were typically found to be committing crimes more serious than just possessing marijuana (or ""smoking"" it, as Sanders put it). Often, this means selling it or trafficking it. The Justice Department estimated that 3.6 percent of state inmates in 2013 had drug possession as their most serious offense. That includes possession charges for all drugs, not just marijuana. To gauge the marijuana-only percentage, we have to go back to data that’s about a decade old. The Justice Department periodically carries out surveys of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities, the last of which was from 2004. According to this study, only about three-tenths of 1 percent of state prison inmates were there because of marijuana possession alone, without a more serious charge. Meanwhile, the statistics for federal inmates paint a similar picture. The data shows that among the roughly 67,600 offenders sentenced to prison in federal criminal cases between Oct. 1, 2011 and Sept. 30, 2012, only 28 of them were incarcerated on drug-possession charges alone -- roughly four one-hundredths of 1 percent of all incarcerations. And that includes all drugs, not just marijuana. Looked at another way, the same report found that 99.9 percent of those sentenced to federal prison for any drug-related crime during that year-long period were sent to prison for something more serious than simple possession. Drug policy experts we contacted agree that imprisonment for marijuana possession by itself is rare. ""He’s wrong,"" said Jonathan P. Caulkins, a public policy professor and drug-policy specialist at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. ""Basically no one goes to prison just because they use marijuana. The vast majority of time, the people who are in jail for marijuana possession also have other things that are part of their record."" Nancy G. La Vigne, director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, agreed. ""Very, very few people are incarcerated for low quantities of marijuana possession,"" she said. And Allen St. Pierre -- executive director of the pro-marijuana-legalization group NORML -- concurs, calling Sanders’ claim ""a tad off."" NORML and other groups have estimated that there are 50,000 to 110,000 cannabis-only offenders are in prison in the United States -- yet ""most, but not all, of those incarcerated on marijuana charges are there for cultivation, sales or trafficking,"" he said. Some caveats All this said, we should note a few points. Experts say different jurisdictions may have divergent standards and thresholds in charging defendants for marijuana possession. Some states even consider passing around a joint at a party to be considered ""distributing,"" said Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor. In addition, the statistics we cited above do not include people sent temporarily to jail -- potentially a much larger population than those serving sentences prison. The jail population could include people who have violated probation for testing positive for marijuana, or for failing to pay a fine for marijuana possession, said Bill Piper, the director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance. Marijuana arrests As it happens, Sanders might have been on safer ground had he stuck to citing arrests for marijuana possession rather than prison time. St. Pierre said that the most recent FBI data shows that of the roughly 700,000 arrests for marijuana-related charges in 2014, about 90 percent were for possession only -- and these arrests can have radiating consequences. Even spending a night or two in jail for marijuana possession can cause ""tremendous disruption to their lives -- they can lose their jobs when they don’t show up for work the next day, or they can miss critical doctor appointments, or they can’t pick up their kids from school,"" Piper said. ""This is regardless of whatever penalty they get, and even if the charges are ultimately dropped."" La Vigne added that the high arrest rates for marijuana possession has other negative consequences, such as racial disparities in exposure to the criminal justice system. Indeed, when we checked with Sanders’ staff, spokesman Warren Gunnels cited a news report of the FBI arrest statistics. As for prison time, he said that even if the numbers of people in prison for marijuana possession are relatively small, it’s still more than ""the number of senior executives on Wall Street who went to jail for the near collapse of the economy in 2008"" -- which is the comparison Sanders made during the debate. Our ruling Sanders said, ""We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana."" Being sentenced to prison for marijuana possession by itself can happen -- but it’s exceedingly rare. Sanders would have been on safer ground had he kept to pointing out continuing high levels of arrests for marijuana possession. These can result in a night in jail and a cascade of problems for those who are arrested, but getting a prison sentence for just smoking a joint is extremely unusual. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/oct/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-people-are-getting-prison-sent/

Hillary Clinton claims Edward Snowden had whistleblower protections, didn't use them
","Edward Snowden’s decision to reveal the existence of massive national security databases of Americans’ email and telephone data remains a flashpoint for debate among Americans. Some people praise Snowden as a hero. To others, Snowden is a traitor. The U.S. government charged Snowden, an employee of a government security contractor, with violating the Espionage Act. He found asylum in Russia but would like to return home. At the first Democratic debate Oct. 13, CNN moderator Anderson Cooper pressed the candidates to offer their view of Snowden. Hillary Clinton said Snowden shouldn’t come home ""without facing the music."" ""He broke the laws of the United States,"" Clinton said. ""He could have been a whistleblower. He could have gotten all of the protections of being a whistleblower. He could have raised all the issues that he has raised. And I think there would have been a positive response to that."" That’s not accurate, we found. While American law does shield government whistleblowers, it wouldn't necessarily apply in Snowden's case. The law Snowden was charged with two counts of unauthorized communication under the 1917 Espionage Act. That law makes it a crime punishable by death or imprisonment to share ""information relating to the national defense"" with anyone who might want to do harm to the United States. Among other details, Snowden showed that under a federal court order, Verizon was providing the National Security Agency with the phone records of nearly all its customers, and on similar terms, giants such as Google and Facebook were turning over user data. He also let the world know that the United States was listening in on the private calls of the leaders of its closest allies. That law has no specific whistleblower protection. What Snowden could have relied on, experts say, is the 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. That law includes some protections, but they're not as strong as Clinton lets on. And it's not clear they could have saved Snowden. Under that 1998 law, Snowden could have raised his concerns with the Inspector General’s Office at the NSA or spoken to congressional intelligence committees. (A separate federal law protects whistleblowers more generally, but that only applies to sharing unclassified information, not the secret materials that Snowden had in hand.) Snowden claims that he did raise his concerns with a legal division at the National Security Agency but was rebuffed. The National Security Agency has released a single email from Snowden in which he asked for clarification of the laws that govern the agency. A debate over protection The 1998 law aimed at intelligence community workers specifically includes contractors such as Snowden. Daniel D’Isidoro, a former U.S. Army judge advocate, argued in the Harvard Law School National Security Journal that Snowden did have a legal pathway to voice his concerns. But he also said it was unclear if the issues Snowden raised would have fallen under the guidelines of that law. Briefly, Snowden’s complaints would need to meet the definition of an ""urgent concern."" That term specifically doesn’t cover policy disagreements. At the time, the NSA could reasonably assert that it was following the law, which would undercut Snowden’s case, D’Isidoro said. Tellingly, Thomas Gimble, the acting inspector general for the Army, said in 2006 House testimony that the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act was ""a misnomer."" It ""does not provide statutory protection from reprisal for whistleblowing for employees of the intelligence community,"" Gimble said. An assessment in the Boston University Law Review concluded that the 1998 law ""arguably fails to provide any real protection to national security whistleblowers."" Others familiar with this legal landscape echoed the view Snowden would have been vulnerable to prosecution if he went public through government channels. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, for instance, does not prohibit agencies from retaliating against employees, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University School of Law. Goitein said President Barack Obama helped matters slightly when he issued a presidential order preventing retaliation against federal employees. But that order did not explicitly address the rights of contractors such as Snowden. And Goitein added, neither that directive nor the whistleblower law ""bars the government from criminally prosecuting whistleblowers."" This has played out before. In 2010, NSA staffer Thomas Drake tried to use proper channels to report allegations of improper contracting but wound up the target of an investigation, said Kathleen McClellan, the national security and human rights counsel for the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower advocacy group. ""Drake followed the Intelligence Community Whistleblower law to a ‘T’,"" McClellan said in January 2014. ""He went to the Department of Defense inspector general and both congressional intelligence committees and it did not protect him from retaliation. In fact, it made him the target of an investigation."" Federal agents went after Drake in pursuit of a separate matter and charged him with multiple felonies, according to a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists. When it became clear that whatever Drake had shared with the press was either not classified or already in the public domain, the government’s felony case collapsed. A federal judge said it was ""unconscionable"" that Drake and his family had endured ""four years of hell."" We reached out to the Clinton campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Clinton said that Edward Snowden could have gotten all the protections of being a whistleblower."" A key 1998 law focused on intelligence community workers does lay out a pathway Snowden could have followed. However, there is at least a significant legal debate over whether the issues Snowden wanted to raise would fall under that law. Additionally, legal experts including an Army inspector general have said that the 1998 law does not protect whistleblowers from reprisals. The protections that Clinton referenced do not seem to be as strong as she suggested, and most of the expert opinion suggests they would not apply to Snowden.

Bernie Sanders says 'every other major country' has family paid leave except United States
","U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders defended his record as a democratic socialist by calling for the United States to bring its family leave policy in line with other countries.   ""You see every other major country saying to moms that, when you have a baby, we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby, because we are going to have medical and family paid leave, like every other country on Earth,"" he said during the first Democratic presidential debate. We will put aside the narrower question of medical leave and focus on family leave. United States lags behind on paid leave A spokesman for Sanders pointed to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which studied paid maternity leave for about 34 OECD countries -- advanced nations -- and seven additional European Union countries. On average across OECD countries, mothers are entitled to 17 weeks of paid maternity leave. However, the United States is the only country to offer no statutory entitlement to paid leave on a national basis. Another widely respected source of data on this topic is the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations. It found in 2014 that out of 170 countries, all but two provide cash benefits to women during maternity leave: the United States and Papua New Guinea. In the United States, under the federal Family Medical Leave Act, employers with 50 or more workers must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition. While that law protects their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. Some employers choose to offer paid leave. About 13 percent of workers had access to some kind of paid family leave in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a very low rate compared to the rest of the developed world. Of 41 other developed economies, the United States also mandates the shortest period of unpaid leave — 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and Australia each allow a full year off (though not all of it is paid). But some countries exclude certain groups of workers such as those who hold temporary or part-time positions or work on farms, as domestics, police, armed forces or civil servants. In some cases, such as domestic workers, the laws don’t explicitly explain if the leave policies apply or not, while explicit legal exclusion of farm workers has been identified in at least 27 countries. The International Labor Organization recommends that countries provide these benefits: women should receive at least 14 weeks off; they should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings; and the benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or Social Security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks. Why does the United States lag behind Explaining the reasons why the United States lags behind other countries is rooted in historical and political factors. We interviewed Vicki Shabo, a vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families, one of many organizations advocating for more family leave for both women and men. Here is a graphic from the partnership showing the timeline of how other nations established paid leave:  The United States has a weaker tradition of social welfare compared with other countries such as Germany. There was a push for family leave during times of war in Europe, when men went off to war and women were needed in the workforce. Although women did go to work in the United states during World War II, they generally went back into the home at the end of the war. ""We missed this historical window and never really caught up,"" Shabo said. In some other countries, unions have played a stronger role in creating leave policies. Experts said that the political power of the business lobby has helped prevent changes to family leave law. ""The absence of paid leave, paid vacation, and national health insurance all reflect a long history of a business-dominated political economy,"" said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at City University of New York. There has been scant legislative action to change the policy here. In March, U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act to allow 60 qualified caregiving days per year, but it hasn’t received a vote. Sanders is one of 19 co-sponsors, all of them are Democrats. (Sanders is an independent in the Senate but running for president as a Democrat.) Our ruling Sanders said ""every other major country"" has family paid leave. Two comprehensive studies of multiple nations backup Sanders’ point that the United States is an outlier when it comes to paid family leave. One study found that the United States is the only country to offer no statutory entitlement to paid leave on a national basis. A separate study of more countries found that the United States and Papua New Guinea were the only two not to provide cash benefits to women during maternity leave. The only caveat here is that family leave isn’t a universal benefit in some countries, due to exclusions on certain workers.

Clinton says her Keystone XL position isn't a flip-flop
","Hillary Clinton says she now opposes the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Is that a flip-flop? Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said yes during the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13. ""Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things,"" he said. Clinton said no. ""You know, we know that if you are learning, you're going to change your position,"" Clinton said in response. ""I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone."" We wanted to look at Clinton’s comments, which drew the ire of some critics. They pointed to something Clinton said in 2010. Then, she said the administration was ""inclined"" to approve the pipeline extension. But isolating that single word leaves out a good bit of context. The Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to the United States, has long been on hold pending a review by President Barack Obama and the State Department. The administration must first determine if the pipeline ""serves the national interest"" because it crosses an international border. Chief opposition to the project comes from environmental groups. Throughout her campaign in 2015, Clinton has avoided taking a position on the pipeline -- until she announced in September that she opposes it. Prior to that, Clinton’s last substantial comment on her Keystone position was in 2010 when she was secretary of state. Speaking on Oct. 15, 2010, with the Commonwealth Club, a public forum in California, Clinton took a question asking if the administration would be willing to ""reconsider"" the pipeline. Here’s Clinton’s response: ""Well, there hasn't been a final decision made. (Crosstalk) Probably not. And we -- but we haven't finished all of the analysis. So as I say, we've not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so, and we are for several reasons -- going back to one of your original questions -- we're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada. And until we can get our act together as a country and figure out that clean, renewable energy is in both our economic interests and the interests of our planet -- (applause) -- I mean, I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone how deeply disappointed the president and I are about our inability to get the kind of legislation through the Senate that the United States was seeking."" A couple of days later in 2010, a State Department spokesman said, ""her words obviously stand,"" and ""her response reflected the status of the Keystone XL pipeline."" So yes, Clinton indicated that the administration at the time was ""inclined"" to sign off on the pipeline. But she did say multiple times that the analysis was not complete -- leaving open the possibility that the administration could backtrack if negative information were to come forward. The answer was positive toward the pipeline’s prospects, but she did not in any way say she supported it unequivocally. In a 2011 news conference with the Canadian foreign minister, Clinton answered a couple questions about the administration’s preliminary Keystone XL review. But she did not indicate her position beyond vague comments such as, ""We are leaving no stone unturned in this process."" Our conclusion Clinton said, ""I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone."" In 2010, she said the administration was ""inclined"" to back it, but she qualified that statement by noting that the analysis was not complete, and the administration had not taken a final position. While this shows a more positive attitude toward Keystone XL than Clinton’s position today, it was not a firm stance. Other than that one comment, Clinton did not indicate her position on Keystone until she announced that she opposed it in September 2015.

Six in 10 Americans back federal money for Planned Parenthood, Wisconsin Democrat Gwen Moore says
","When U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore said, ""I don’t think we do children a favor by forcing women to give birth,"" she drew criticism from The Daily Caller, a conservative-leaning website. The Milwaukee Democrat was speaking at a Washington, D.C., news conference in favor of continuing federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Moore made similar remarks the next day, Sept. 29, 2015, during a speech on the House floor about a Republican-backed bill to defund the organization. And she made a claim we thought we’d check. ""The reality is,"" Moore said, ""is that 60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded."" Given the recent publicity over secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood officials, we wondered where support stands for federal funding of the group.   Defunding Planned Parenthood The series of videos, first released in July 2015, were recorded by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress. They show Planned Parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research. The center alleges Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales. But Planned Parenthood says it has done nothing illegal and that the videos were edited in a misleading way. The videos led to the defunding effort. Earlier this month, we checked a claim by Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. Speaking on the House floor in favor of the defunding bill, Duffy said millions of dollars are spent by Planned Parenthood to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives. We rated his claim Mostly True. The organization itself has not made the expenditures, but Planned Parenthood affiliates have. Polls on defunding To check Moore's claim, we examined results of national polls conducted in September 2015, earlier in the same month in which she made the claim. Three surveys back Moore: A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of adults asked: ""Would you favor or oppose totally eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood for family planning and preventative health services?"" The result: 61 percent opposed. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll of likely voters asked: ""Do you think all federal funding for Planned Parenthood should be cut off: yes or no?"" The result: 65 percent said no. A Pew Research Center poll used a more complex question -- tying funding to a possible government shutdown-- but got a similar result: 60 percent of adults said any federal budget agreement to avert a government shutdown would have to maintain funding for Planned Parenthood. In two other surveys, a majority supported continued federal funding of Planned Parenthood, though the levels were less than 60 percent: Quinnipiac University asked registered voters: ""Do you support or oppose cutting off federal government funding to Planned Parenthood?"" The result: 52 percent opposed. The New York Times/CBS poll asked adults: ""Do you think Planned Parenthood should or should not receive funding from the federal government?""
The result: 55 percent said should. We consulted three polling experts, including Charles Franklin, the Marquette Law School Poll director and co-founder of Pollster.com. He noted that, on average, support for funding was 58.6 percent in the five polls. Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow and research coordinator at the American Enterprise Institute, said critics argue the polls didn't ask respondents if they preferred the federal funding go to other organizations rather than to Planned Parenthood. She said although it isn't clear how much attention Americans are paying to the videos controversy, the available polling data suggests most support continued funding. Our rating Moore said: ""60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded."" Three national polls put the support at 60 percent or higher. Two others show support of less than 60 percent, but taken together, the average support among the five polls is nearly 59 percent.

Bernie Sanders: The United States has 'more people in jail than any other country on Earth'
","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders argued that part of what holds the country back is it spends far too much money keeping people behind bars. Those dollars, he said in the first Democratic debate, could do much more good. ""Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth,"" Sanders said. ""It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe, just maybe, we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids."" We take Sanders’ use of the word ""jail"" to included prisons. The United States is the third most-populous nation -- China and India are way ahead with about four times as many people. Do we really incarcerate more people than any other country? The latest numbers say we do. According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2013 there were more than 2.2 million people in local jails, and state and federal prisons. It’s a little harder to get rock solid numbers internationally. The United Nations collects some information, but it covers only about 50 countries, and it doesn’t include China. Fortunately, the Institute for Criminal Policy Research based at the School of Law at Birkbeck at the University of London, has gathered more comprehensive data. By its tally, China has about 1.65 million prisoners. That places it second behind the United States. Russia comes in third, with about 655,000 prisoners. The UN data says Russia has about 700,000 prisoners but that includes people held without a final sentencing decision. China’s incarcerated population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid 2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.3 million in China, pushing it above the United States. But we can’t settle that possibility here. A better way to compare prison populations worldwide is to measure a country’s prison population as a share of the national population, experts told us. Adjusted for population, the United States’ prison population (707 prisoners per 100,000 population) exceeds countries around its size, including China. But according to the latest data, it ranks second -- not first -- worldwide. First place goes to the tiny nation of Seychelles, which posts the highest rate of 868 prisoners per 100,000 population based on the most recent data. Peter Wagner is executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit group that supports reducing the prison population. Wagner told PolitiFact in February the countries are not at all in the same league. Seychelles is a group of African islands in the Indian Ocean northeast of Madagascar and is home to just over 90,000 people. For perspective, the least populous U.S. state is Wyoming with more than 580,000 residents. The addition of 240 Seychellois from 2012 to 2014 into an already small prison population dramatically pushes the rate from 707 prisoners per 100,000 population to 868, overtaking the United States. ""I think countries that small are just not comparable,"" Wagner said, adding that his group’s 2014 States of Incarceration report filtered out countries with less than a half-million residents.

The latest federal census found more than 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States. A research center in England reports that China ranks second with about 1.65 million prisoners. But the Chinese figure fails to include many thousands of people in detention centers, and we don’t know how many that would be. Regardless, based on population size, America has an incarceration rate higher than any other nation.

Fact-checking an attack on Biden and Warren that harks back to 1962
","A pro-Bernie Sanders Facebook post says that the Vermont senator was a longtime opponent of segregation and the Vietnam war while portraying two of his rivals — former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — as holding views more in line with the right. The post makes a series of claims about the three candidates about their views or statements in 1962. It states that Biden ""worked with segregationists,"" while Warren called the Democratic Party ‘subversive’ and ""debated as a pro-Vietnam conservative."" The post said that Sanders ""organized against segregation and Vietnam war.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We will leave it up to voters to consider the importance of the candidates’ actions in 1962, when Biden and Sanders were college students and Warren was in her early teens. But here we will explain what the post got right and wrong about these Democrats running for president. We found no evidence that Biden worked with segregationists in 1962, when he was a college student at the University of Delaware.  We have previously fact-checked statements related to Biden’s record on busing for school desegregation in 1975. While Biden opposed mandatory busing, he supported other measures designed to combat inequities in voting and housing. In June 2019, Biden faced a backlash after he used the term ""civility"" in describing his work in 1970s with senators James Eastland, D-Miss., and Herman Talmadge D-Ga., who were both segregationists. Biden said they ""didn't agree on much"" but they ""got things done.""   He later apologized for his comments and defended his civil rights record. This attack on Warren says these were her positions about the Democratic Party and the Vietnam War in 1962. She was around 13 years old at the time. U.S. involvement in Vietnam was minimal in 1962 — it wasn’t until 1965 that the U.S. deployed combat troops. Warren is now a progressive Democrat, but when she was a teenager she was a conservative. The New York Times found that when Warren was in high school in the 1960s, the dominant culture in her state of Oklahoma was conservative. Warren’s high school friend Katrina Cochran told the New York Times that Warren was ""extremely conservative at the time."" ""She would ask me what other subversive organizations I was a member of besides the Democratic Party,"" Cochran said. Warren’s older brother Don Reed flew combat missions in the Vietnam War. Warren has said that growing up, her family didn’t discuss politics at the dinner table.  Subhead: Sanders ‘organized against segregation and Vietnam war.’ There is photographic evidence showing Sanders was involved in protesting segregation in the early 1960s. Snopes found in 2016 that a 1962 photo by Danny Lyon showed Sanders speaking to a group of students at a sit-in at the University of Chicago. And a 1963 photo shows Sanders getting arrested while protesting school segregation. Sanders was anti-war in the 1960s, and as a college student he was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Student Peace Union. A Facebook post said in 1962, Biden ""worked with segregationists,"" Warren called the Democratic Party ""subversive"" and ""debated as a pro-Vietnam conservative"" while Sanders ""organized against segregation and Vietnam war."" In 1962, Biden was a college student and we found no evidence that he worked with segregationists then. In the 1970s, Biden worked with fellow Democratic lawmakers who were segregationists and opposed federally mandated busing for school desegregation, but the post doesn’t fully reflect his civil rights record.  Warren’s high school friend told the New York Times that she referred to the Democratic Party as subversive. Warren was a conservative as a teenager in the 1960s, but in 1962, she was only 13 years old, and full U.S. troop deployment to Vietnam wouldn’t start for a few more years. Overall, the attack is misleading about Biden and Warren, although it correctly notes that Sanders opposed segregation and the Vietnam War.

Coronavirus testing is free, but there could be other costs
","Fears about the novel coronavirus are starting to dovetail with concerns about costs.  ""The blood test for coronavirus costs $3,200,"" says a Feb. 27 Facebook post. ""Trump’s White House already said I won’t be able to afford the vaccine. If I can’t afford the test and I can’t afford the treatment, am I just supposed to die. This is exactly why I support healthcare as a human right."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post seems to stem from a story about a man who got a steep medical bill after visiting a hospital when he returned from China in January and became ill. One headline about the man’s ordeal, from Business Insider, says: ""A US resident racked up a $3,200 hospital bill for suspected coronavirus treatment, and his insurance only covered part of it."" The Miami Herald first reported on the story on Feb. 24, 2020. One version of the headline said: ""Novel coronavirus test for Miami man leads to $3,275 bill,"" but the article itself reveals a more complicated story.  Osmel Martinez Azcue went to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami after developing flu-like symptoms when he got back from a work trip to China in January, according to the Herald. He was placed in a closed-off room, and nurses wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant smoke under the door before entering. Hospital staff members said he’d need a CT scan to screen for the virus but Azcue said he asked for a flu test first, because he knew he would have to pay out of pocket, and he wanted to be discharged if he tested positive for the flu. ""Fortunately,"" the story says, ""that’s exactly what happened. He had the flu, not the deadly virus that has infected tens of thousands of people, mostly in China.""  Two weeks later, according to the Herald, Azcue got a notice from an insurance company about a claim for $3,270. Jackson Health officials said at the time that more bills were on the way but the total cost was still unclear.  The Herald story said the hospital told the newspaper that Azcue would be responsible for only $1,400 of the $3,270 bill; his insurance would cover the rest. But Azcue said he had learned from his insurer that he would be stuck with the whole bill unless he provided three years of medical records proving that his flu didn’t relate to a preexisting condition.  ""How can they expect normal citizens to contribute to eliminating the potential risk of person-to-person spread if hospitals are waiting to charge us $3,270 for a simple blood test and a nasal swab?"" the story quotes him as saying.  Ultimately, according to Business Insider, Azcue’s total co-pay was $1,400. After the Miami Herald story ran, the insurer contacted Azcue and said the requirement to provide three years of records was an ""administrative error.""  ""We had concerns that your expectations of service were not being met based on some news articles that had come to our attention,"" Business Insider quotes an email from the insurer as saying. The publication breaks down the Azcue’s medical bill, including the total charge — $3,270 — and what Azcue owed. Two blood tests cost him about $157, virus and flu testing cost about $299 and his co-pay for the emergency room visit cost him $819.  Azcue wasn’t tested for COVID-19, however, because he tested positive for the flu. And as Business Insider reports, the CDC, which is the only facility that can test for COVID-19 or designate other laboratories to test for the disease, isn’t billing for testing.  ""This means a patient who goes to the ER or urgent care for coronavirus treatment wouldn’t incur a charge for COVID-19 lab testing,"" the story says.  But as Business Insider reports in another story, free testing doesn’t mean free health care. Patients could rack up thousands of dollars in costs associated with the hospital visit or tests for other viruses.  In fact, on March 2, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced he was directing the state’s health insurers to waive costs ""associated with testing for coronavirus, including emergency room, urgent care and office visits."" ""We can’t let cost be a barrier to access to COVID-19 testing for any New Yorker,"" he tweeted.  Our ruling The Facebook post says the ""blood test for coronavirus costs $3,200."" Testing for COVID-19 is free. But there could be costs associated with seeking such testing, like a visit to the hospital. In one case, in Florida, a man who worried he was infected initially faced a $3,270 bill even though he never received a coronavirus test.  We rate this post Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/04/facebook-posts/coronavirus-testing-free-there-could-be-other-cost/

Pro-Bernie Sanders Facebook post cherrypicks Joe Biden’s record on segregation
","As Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden compete for African American voters in the Democratic primaries, a Facebook post portrays the two politicians as being on opposite sides of the segregation issue decades ago. ""Bernie Sanders in 1963 — arrested protesting segregation. Joe Biden in 1975 — passionate speech defending segregation,"" stated a March 2 Facebook post. The accompanying side-by-side photos show Sanders being arrested and Biden from decades ago. The post has been circulating at least since June 2019, around the time that Biden’s past statements on busing became a hot topic in the Democratic primary. We found that the post is accurate about Sanders’ arrest, but it doesn’t tell the full story about Biden’s record on segregation.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Sanders’ 1963 arrest protesting segregation We previously fact-checked a separate Facebook post that stemmed from Sanders’ 1963 arrest in Chicago. The Chicago Tribune wrote a story in February 2016 about the photo and confirmed with Sanders’ campaign that it was him. Sanders, who at the time was a 21-year-old student at the University of Chicago, was arrested in August 1963 at a South Side protest over school segregation. Sanders was charged with resisting arrest, found guilty and fined $25, according to the Tribune’s reporting. The protests that led to the arrest were over mobile classrooms dubbed ""Willis Wagons,"" named for then-Chicago Schools Superintendent Benjamin Willis. Black children were kept in the trailers rather than being allowed in white schools. A January 1964 Tribune story on the court cases of those who had been arrested mentioned a Bernard Sanders. RELATED: Joe Biden oversimplifies his school busing record in Miami debate The Facebook post doesn’t cite a particular speech by Biden, then a Delaware U.S. senator, in 1975, but it likely refers to his statements opposing busing. Biden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he faced white constituents who overwhelmingly opposed busing to achieve integration. A Gallup poll in 1973 found that while a majority of Americans supported school integration, only 5% supported busing.  A federal court order in 1974 to integrate Wilmington, Del., schools brought the issue home for Biden. In the Senate, he began supporting much of the anti-busing legislation. In 1975, Biden supported an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, a North Carolina conservative who opposed civil rights, while stating he didn’t share all the views of those who opposed busing. The amendment, which Helms called an ""anti-busing amendment"" was intended to ban schools from using federal funds to classify teachers or students based on race.. ""I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept that, in fact, does not bear any of the fruit for which it was designed,"" Biden said on the Senate floor Sept. 17, 1975. ""If anything, it obfuscates the real issue today, which is whether or not there is equal opportunity within the educational field for all people within the United States.""  Biden said that rather than busing, the Senate should focus on all areas of opportunity in housing, education, equal credit and voting rights to provide minorities with equal access. When the Helms amendment was defeated, Biden himself proposed measures to oppose busing as a segregation remedy.  But that same year, Biden co-sponsored a 10-year extension of the Voting Rights Act, sponsored legislation to prohibit creditors from discriminating on the basis of race and opposed the nomination of Ben Blackburn, who had voted against civil rights bills in Congress, to the federal bench. A Facebook post said ""Bernie Sanders in 1963 — arrested protesting segregation. Joe Biden in 1975 — passionate speech defending segregation."" The post is correct about Sanders — he was arrested in Chicago in 1963 for protesting school segregation. But the text attacks Biden too broadly when it states that he was ""defending segregation."" Biden did oppose court-ordered busing in 1975, a program intended to achieve school integration. But he supported other legislation that aimed to fight segregation in housing and expand voting rights.

President Obama declared H1N1 a public health emergency before anyone in the United States died
","President Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus is being defended with an attack on how President Barack Obama handled the outbreak of H1N1, also known as swine flu, in 2009. The headline of an article shared on Facebook made this claim: ""Flashback: Obama waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article was published on Prntly, which describes itself as a conservative news website that defends Trump. The article goes on to say that ""it wasn’t until six months after"" H1N1 became a global pandemic that ""then-President Obama declared a public health emergency on what was already a pandemic. By that time, the disease had infected millions of Americans and more than 1,000 people had died in the U.S."" Not only is this timeline wrong, but the story and headline eliminate important facts and distort others, imparting a false narrative that social media users are resharing. Let’s take a look. Online, fact-based news is going to be very important in the coming weeks. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.   The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world.  It was originally referred to as ""swine flu"" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. It was serious. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, in the United States, there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated. Obama and his administration issued two emergency declarations, but the article refers only to one. Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency on April 26, 2009. That was when only 20 cases of H1N1 — and no deaths — around the country had been confirmed.  Two days later, the administration made an initial funding request for H1N1 to Congress. Eventually $7.65 billion was allocated for a vaccine and other measures. H1N1 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on June 11, 2009. In other words, the Obama administration’s public health emergency declaration came more than six weeks before the pandemic designation. Now to Obama’s second action. On Oct. 24, 2009, six months after his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency, Obama declared it a national emergency.  At that point, H1N1 had claimed more than 1,000 American lives, according to the CDC. When Obama made his declaration, the New York Times reported at the time, thousands of people were lining up in cities across the country to receive vaccinations, as federal officials acknowledged that their vaccination program had gotten off to a slow start, with some states having requested 10 times the amount they have been allotted. Millions of people in the United States had had H1N1. The national emergency declaration allowed the federal government to temporarily waive or modify requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs. It also permitted doctors and hospitals to bypass certain requirements as they responded to H1N1. By way of comparison, Trump declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on Jan. 31, 2020, also prior to any deaths in the United States. One effect was that U.S. citizens who had been in China's Hubei Province, the source of the outbreak, in the previous 14 days were subjected to 14 days of mandatory quarantine if they traveled back to the United States. NBC News reported March 3, 2020, that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is planning for the possibility that Trump could make a national emergency declaration to bring in extra funds and personnel to assist the administration's coronavirus response. The headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed: ""Obama waited six months to call swine flu an emergency after thousands died."" In October 2009, after more than 1,000 people in the United States had died of swine flu, also known as H1N1, Obama declared a national emergency. But six months earlier, his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. At that point, no deaths in the United States had occurred.  We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/04/facebook-posts/president-obama-declared-h1n1-public-health-emerge/

Pro-Sanders post said US sanctions blocked access to a Cuban lung cancer vaccine. Is that true?
","Online supporters of Bernie Sanders came to his defense on the issue of Cuba, touting the communist island nation’s accomplishments beyond improving literacy rates. ""Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine we in the US had no access to because we sanctioned Cuba,"" the Feb. 24 post said. ""Cuba eliminated HIV transmission from mother to child. Cuba has a literacy rate of nearly 98% now."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ll focus on the claim about the lung cancer vaccine because the facts behind the statement lead to a less certain conclusion than the Facebook post suggests. (The other elements in the post are accurate.) Though we tend to think of vaccines as protecting you from getting sick, cancer vaccines work differently. In 2016, nearly 150,000 people died from lung cancer in the United States. Neither the United States nor Cuba nor anyone else has developed a vaccine that would stop those deaths. That’s because cancer vaccines don’t block disease; their purpose is to shrink existing tumors, and failing that, slow them down. There are 91 lung cancer vaccines under study today in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. During the 1990s, Cuba began testing a drug called Cimavax and found that it extended lung cancer patients’ lives by about three months.  In 2011, Cuba began offering the drug to Cubans for free. That same year, Cuban researchers discussed the results with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. Four years later — the same year that the United States and Cuba re-opened embassies in each other’s capitals — scientists from both countries agreed on a collaborative research project. It was the first time since the Cuban revolution that Cuban and American institutions had been permitted to engage in such a joint venture, Roswell Park’s chief executive, Candace S. Johnson told the New York Times. The initial results in Cuba were ambiguous, and they needed to be replicated in the United States to meet Food and Drug Administration rules. Ultimately, the Roswell Park study hopes to have 180 patients. These are people with advanced cancer who have exhausted other treatments. So far, the study has not met its goal. Approximately 100 people have gone to Cuba on their own for treatment. With about 200,000 new cases of lung cancer each year, the fraction of patients accessing Cimavax is about one tenth of one percent. When the Trump administration re-imposed restrictions on travel to Cuba, it created a legal bind for Americans — about 100 since 2016 — who have gone there for this treatment. According to the new rules, they were now breaking the law.  But this highlights that opening the doors to Cuba also increased access to the drug, although access was limited to patients who could afford to make the trip. A Facebook post said Cuba had a lung cancer vaccine that the United States had no access to due to the decades-long embargo. There is an element of accuracy here, but it lacks several important pieces of information.  A lung cancer vaccine doesn’t prevent the disease; it is judged a success if it slows down or stops tumor growth. The drug in this case, Cimavax, extended life by about three months in the Cuban study. Access to Cimavax is limited to about 180 patients in one American study and those who go on their own to Cuba. The combined total represents a tiny fraction of people with lung cancer.  There are about 90 cancer vaccines under study in America today. None of this would be apparent to people who read the Facebook post. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/04/blog-posting/sanders-supporters-said-sanctions-blocked-access-c/

It’s also possible that someone could get COVID-19 by touching something that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but the CDC says this isn’t the main way the virus spreads.   Noreen Hynes, director of the John Hopkins Geographic Medicine Center, told PolitiFact in an email that talking — especially when saying words with the letters ""t"" or ""d"" — could also spread the droplets that can cause infection when they come into contact with the mucous membranes of someone’s eyes, nose or mouth.  The spread of coronavirus via such droplets has been documented. Airborne transmission has not been documented but, Hynes said, it ""has been hypothesized to occur."" Hynes explained that ""airborne transmission"" refers to when residue from evaporated respiratory droplets contains a microorganism and can linger suspended in the air for a long time.  ""The organism on such droplet nuclei, as they are called, must be capable of surviving for a long time outside the body and must be resistant to drying,"" Hynes said. ""Such droplet nuclei act like a gas, allowing organisms to enter both the upper and lower respiratory tract. Diseases associated with airborne transmission include measles, chickenpox and tuberculosis."" But the University of California San Francisco says in a Feb. 13 post on its website that the new coronavirus ""isn’t believed to be an airborne virus, like measles or smallpox, that can circulate through the air."" Charles Chiu, a doctor who studies infectious diseases at the university, is quoted in the post as saying: ""If you have an infected person in the front of the plane, for instance, and you’re in the back of the plane, your risk is close to zero simply because the area of exposure is thought to be roughly six feet from the infected person.""  There’s a difference between viruses that are transmitted by droplets and things that are aerosolized and float around in the air, according to University of Chicago Medicine.  The school puts it like this: ""Think of droplets as small bits of fluid that you can see and feel when someone sneezes. You sneeze or cough and these droplets get on surfaces and then you touch them and get them on your hands, or they can fly right into your mouth or nose or eyes. That’s how most coronaviruses are transmitted and that’s how we think this one is too.""  Now consider an aerosol — like hairspray. You may still be able to smell it a while after someone has used it because it’s lingering in the air, according to the school: ""Obviously we’re learning a lot about this virus, but most coronaviruses aren’t airborne this way. Generally speaking, there may be times when some of these droplets or particles are airborne, but it’s limited."" Our ruling The Facebook post says a woman in Mississippi was infected by the coronavirus and that it was airborne.  We’re still learning about the coronavirus and how it spreads, but this isn’t accurate.  Currently, there are no confirmed cases in Mississippi, and while it has been suggested that coronavirus could be airborne, it hasn’t been documented to spread that way. Rather, the virus’s spread has been documented via respiratory droplets mainly when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  We rate this Facebook post False. ",/factchecks/2020/mar/03/facebook-posts/there-are-no-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-mississip/

Mike Bloomberg exaggerates his support for Obama in 2008, 2012
","The fact that Mike Bloomberg hasn’t been a Democrat his whole life keeps coming up in his 2020 presidential bid. At a CNN town hall, host Anderson Cooper asked Bloomberg why Democrats should trust him to lead their party. Bloomberg acknowledged his past as a Republican and an Independent. But he argued that he isn’t such a Democratic outsider if you look at who he supported. ""But if you want to know my Democratic credentials, I spoke for Hillary Clinton at the DNC Convention in Philadelphia in 2016,"" Bloomberg said at the Feb. 26 forum. ""I certainly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden, (Biden) says no, but I was there both times for them, thank you very much."" Was Bloomberg really there for Obama and Biden in their 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the White House? It would be a stretch to say he was an enthusiastic Obama supporter. Bloomberg did not endorse Obama’s 2008 run, and while he did endorse him in 2012, that happened a week before the November election in an opinion piece that also criticized Obama’s record. ""Mike said he supported Obama both times. He voted for him both times,"" said Stu Loeser, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman. RELATED: Bloomberg is registered as a Democrat, but is he accepted as one? Obama’s 2008 bid was plagued with rumors that he was secretly a Muslim with anti-Israel views. Bloomberg, who is Jewish, flew to Florida in June 2008 to defend Obama. Bloomberg at that time was mayor of New York City. The rumors about Obama were lies, Bloomberg told the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County, ""wedge politics at its worst, and we have to reject it — loudly, clearly and unequivocally."" Bloomberg told the audience he had not decided whom to support, the New York Times reported. When he was asked whether he would become an ambassador to Jews for Obama, Bloomberg said he would ""speak out against intolerance for both candidates,"" including Republican nominee Sen. John McCain. In a July 2008 speech to the Independence Party of Minnesota, Bloomberg spoke about both Obama and McCain, without picking a side. ""Now, we're lucky this year: we have two candidates who have shown, on at least some issues, that they are capable of thinking and acting independently of the special interests,"" Bloomberg said. Overall, Bloomberg delivered a largely neutral stance in 2008. He did not endorse either of the party candidates. Bloomberg endorsed Obama Nov. 1, 2012, in a Bloomberg.com post headlined, ""A vote for a president to lead on climate change."" Bloomberg lauded Obama’s efforts to reduce carbon consumption, for setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks, and for adopting tighter controls on mercury emissions. But he also said Obama had not done enough to build a coalition of centrists, ""which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction."" ""And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it,"" Bloomberg wrote in his endorsement. Loeser told PolitiFact that Bloomberg’s endorsement was ""designed to flip or lock down voters who still hadn't committed to Obama-Biden by the last days of the campaign."" Bloomberg said, ""I certainly supported Barack Obama and Joe Biden. ... I was there both times for them."" In 2008, Bloomberg defended Obama against attacks that he was anti-Israel, but Bloomberg did not endorse a presidential candidate that cycle. In 2012, he endorsed Obama’s re-election in a post that mixed in criticism of his record. Bloomberg’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Hand sanitizer can be used to prevent coronavirus infection
","Health officials say one of the best ways Americans can prevent the spread of the 2019 coronavirus is to clean their hands. But should they use hand sanitizer?

The original Twitter user clarified that in a follow-up tweet, but the context was lost on Facebook. On its list of ways to prevent coronavirus infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to ""wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing."" If soap and water are not accessible, the CDC recommends using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Although hand sanitizers are not effective against all viruses, the ones with high alcohol content have proven effective against some. Several studies indicate that alcohol-based sanitizers are effective against ""enveloped viruses,"" which include human coronaviruses.

Klobuchar misfires with debate salvo on Wisconsin voter suppression
","In the most recent Democratic presidential debate, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said she didn’t want to keep rehashing the past.  Instead, she said, she’s focused on the way forward. Klobuchar then went on to outline a series of issues she believes demand attention. One of them was voting rights, and she used Wisconsin to underscore her point. ""While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls,"" she said Feb. 25, 2020 in South Carolina. Wisconsin’s voter rolls have been front and center in recent months after the state Election Commission sent letters to 234,000 voters it believed may have moved, asking them to update their registrations if relevant. The plan was to remove them from the rolls in 2021.  That prompted a lawsuit from a conservative law group contending those voters should be taken off the rolls now. The matter ultimately may go to the state Supreme Court. Klobuchar’s campaign said she was referring to voter purges in 2017 and 2018 — not those at the center of the lawsuit. But that doesn’t explain why she implied it was happening right then. (Note: Klobuchar dropped out of the presidential campaign March 2, 2020, after a sixth-place finish in South Carolina, as we were working on this fact-check. We decided to complete it, since removal of voters from the state’s rolls is an ongoing issue.) Let’s see where Klobuchar’s claim lands. Changes to Wisconsin’s voter rolls When asked for evidence for Klobuchar’s claim, a staffer pointed to a 2018 report from the left-leaning Center for Media and Democracy that indicated nearly 700,000 voters had been removed from the rolls since 2016. This included 44,000 voters in Milwaukee alone. The decline stemmed from two separate actions in 2017 and 2018, according to Reid Magney, public information officer for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. To meet a requirement under state law, the commission in 2017 removed more than 351,000 voters who hadn’t voted in four years and didn’t respond to a mailed notice to continue their registrations. Over half of those voters didn’t respond, and roughly 43% of the notices were returned as undeliverable. Some people had died or were deactivated for other reasons. Then, in 2018, the commission canceled the registrations of more than 300,000 voters after the agency’s Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, identified voters who had become inactive or needed to update their registration.  Once officials realized there were problems with accuracy of that list, they implemented a supplemental poll book to ensure anyone incorrectly removed could vote without reregistering. The commission later said it found few examples of voters who were removed inappropriately. So, the commission did deactivate hundreds of thousands of voters in 2017 and 2018. But by saying they were ""kicked off,"" Klobuchar suggests the motive was voter suppression. Magney disputes that.  In any case, Wisconsin has same-day registration, so removal from the rolls does not prevent people from voting, as it might in some states if done too close to election day. The latest election saga  There is another problem with Klobuchar’s statement: She said Wisconsin has purged voters ""while we are all sitting here debating."" That suggests the issue is immediate — not one from several years ago. As we noted, Wisconsin is currently in the throes of a controversy over its voter rolls.  The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, representing three suburban Milwaukee men, filed a lawsuit arguing that 234,000 voters who may have moved and received notices in the mail should be removed from the rolls within 30 days if they don’t respond. The commission had said it wouldn’t suspend registrations until after April 2021. Critics of the lawsuit believe any voter purge would be an affront to the democratic process and could inadvertently affect voters who didn’t even move. The case has drawn heightened attention because of Wisconsin’s pivotal role in this year’s presidential race. In December 2019, an Ozaukee County judge sided with the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty and ordered the election commission to remove those people from the voter rolls. He found the commission and its Democratic members in contempt of court on Jan. 13, 2020 for failing to adhere to his ruling. But one day later, an appeals court ordered voters to be kept on the rolls while it considered whether people should be removed. The court officially struck down the Ozaukee County ruling on Feb. 28, 2020. That means the targeted voters won’t be kicked off any time soon. Our ruling Klobuchar said during the debate in South Carolina that, ""While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls."" Her campaign said she was referring to purges in 2017 and 2018, which did result in hundreds of thousands of voters being removed from the rolls. But her statement implied that was underway during the debate, which is not the case. Our definition of Mostly False is ""The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.

(The image and the post were deleted in the course of our reporting, but we found similar posts showing the image elsewhere along with similar claims.) The vaccine pictured, called ScourGuard 4K, is made by animal drug manufacturer Zoetis and is real. And we found products with similar labeling available for sale online. But the vaccine is, according to the drug manufacturer, ""effective as an aid in preventing diarrhea caused by bovine rotavirus (serotypes G6 and G10), bovine coronavirus, and E. coli in calves of vaccinated dams."" It won’t help humans, at least not now. ""The coronavirus used in the Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine is distinct from the current coronavirus,"" said Ming Tan, a faculty member of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.  ""The antibodies produced by the Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine will not recognize the current"" coronavirus ""and thus will not protect humans from infection."" Studies would need to be done to determine whether the bovine vaccine could provide any help with the current coronavirus, said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. ""The bovine vaccine may be formulated in a manner that is not conducive to humans,"" he said. There is a ""very remote"" chance a bovine vaccine might work in humans, said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, but ""the possibility it would work is low enough that it is more efficient to design a vaccine specifically for COVD-19."" It helps to differentiate some terms being used in the news and social media. Many reports refer to the coronavirus. But coronavirus is a general term; there are different coronaviruses out there. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. They’ve been around for a long time, but there are different strains. More specific terms relating to the current situation include: 2019 novel coronavirus — novel, as in, new. SARS-CoV-2 — the technical name of the new virus. COVID-19  — the name of the disease caused by the new coronavirus, as in ""coronavirus disease, 2019."" All three of those terms refer specifically to the coronavirus that was discovered in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread around the world. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 and none is expected soon.

""That whole process is going to take about a year to a year and a half.
