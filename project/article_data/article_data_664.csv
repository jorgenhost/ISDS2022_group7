Senate Republican web video attacks Barack Obama, saying he increased health care premiums
","
In a web video tied to the two-year-anniversary of the enactment of President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Senate Republican Conference accused Obama of breaking a promise because the health law increases premiums.

This portion of the video begins with screen text that says, ""Promise 3."" It cuts to a clip of Obama speaking on March 14, 2008, saying, ""We're going to work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year.""

When the Obama clip ends, the following text appears on the screen: ""Reality: The president's health care plan raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family.""

We wondered if the charge was accurate. 
The Senate Republican Conference didn't provide information to support the claim by our deadline.

The video’s claim is similar to a claim we looked at in December 2009. Back then, we checked the claim by Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. Pence said that under the Democratic health plan -- which was then in the final stages leading up to passage -- families ""will be forced to spend an additional $2,100 a year to keep their current health care.""

As we noted then, the figure comes from a Nov. 30, 2009, analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress.

The CBO's analysis of how the law would affect premiums was broken into three categories, based on expectations for the year 2016:

• Those in the small group market, or people who work for businesses with up to 50 employees and receive employer-provided coverage. This category would make up about 13 percent of the total insurance market by 2016, CBO found.

• Those in the large group market, which would account for about 70 percent of the insurance market.

• Those in the non-group (or ""individual"") market, who purchase insurance as individuals. This group is expected to grow to about 17 percent of the insurance market. Today, these individuals purchase plans on their own, but most purchases made after the health care law is fully in place in 2014 would be made through the newly created insurance ""exchanges"" -- virtual marketplaces where Americans without employer-sponsored coverage can browse through insurance offerings and choose which plan to buy.

According to the report, the CBO estimates that the average premium per person in new individual policies would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium for individual coverage under current law.

Specifically, the average premiums per policy in the non-employer-provided market in 2016 would be roughly $5,800 for single policies (up from $5,500 under current law) and $15,200 for family policies (up from $13,100 under current law).

The latter comparison, for families, is the source of the Senate Republican Conference’s number (and Pence’s) -- $2,100.

So the web video is correct that for families with non-group coverage, premiums could rise by $2,100.

But the video also leaves out some important context.

It ignores subsidies that many purchasers will receive. The CBO report notes that the majority of non-group enrollees -- about 57 percent -- would receive federal insurance subsidies, which on average would cover about two-thirds of the total premium.

It ignores improvements in the plan for beneficiaries. Much of the coverage purchased on the individual market prior to the law included high deductibles and restrictions. But the plans to be sold on the exchanges will be required to offer a minimum benefit package that should, in most cases, be superior what was offered in policies sold before the law took effect.

So while the new coverage may cost more, beneficiaries will get more insurance for their money and should see their out-of-pocket medical costs go down. According to the CBO report, an ""apples to apples"" comparison of the average price of equivalent insurance under the Democrats' plan would translate to an average premium about 7 to 10 percent lower than under current law.

Using the individual market as the standard is cherry picking. The other two categories -- the small group and large-group markets -- are entirely ignored by the video, even though the vast majority of people -- 83 percent -- get private health care insurance that way.

And the impact of the law on premiums for these groups is far lower than for the individual market. CBO projected that small-group premiums would jump just $100 by 2016, while large-group premiums would jump by just $200. Neither figure is as eye-popping as the $2,100 figure cited in the video.

Put it all together and what the CBO actually projected is that the vast majority of families with private insurance would see little change in premiums -- some because they’ll have employer-sponsored insurance that won’t experience big premium hikes, and some because they’ll have federally subsidized coverage in the individual market.

The families at risk of having to pay $1,200 in extra premiums would be those who have individual market insurance in 2016 but no subsidies -- about 7 percent of all Americans who have either individual or employer-sponsored insurance.

Using statistics for the individual market is a non-sequitur. The video airs a clip of Obama promising to ""work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year."" As we recently noted, we’ve given Obama a rating of Stalled for his promise to lower employer-provided family premiums by $2,500, so noting that failure is a legitimate point.

But video goes on to note that Obama law ""raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family."" The individual market is the only type of private insurance where the employer plays no role.

Our ruling

The Senate Republican Conference video claimed that while Obama promised to ""work with your employer to lower your premiums by $2,500 per family per year,"" his health care law ""raises premiums in the individual market by $2,100 per family.""

The number does come from a Congressional Budget Office analysis, and it’s phrased accurately. But it’s stripped of crucial context and distorts the truth. It ignores subsidies that would ease the financial burden for a majority of those seeing premium increases; it ignores that the additional premium dollars will pay for more generous benefits; and it ignores that the vast majority of Americans with private insurance will pay no more than $200 extra for their premiums due to the law -- and possibly less than that.

Self-defense deaths in Florida have increased dramatically since 'stand your ground' became law in 2005, lawmaker claims
","
The fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., has reopened debate about the state’s ""stand your ground"" law.

One of the arguments we’ve heard from lawmakers wanting to change the 2005 law is that deaths due to self-defense are up dramatically since ""stand your ground"" passed. The law -- approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005 -- allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk.

Sen. Chris Smith, a Democrat who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, wants to rewrite the law because he fears its protections are too broad. Smith wants to change the law so that it only applies in cases that take place in a home, car or at work. He also wants to prohibit the use of ""stand your ground"" in cases where the shooter has provoked a confrontation, Smith said in a March 21 press release sent by the Senate Democratic office.

""This law has been a double-edged sword,"" said Smith, who was the House Democratic leader in 2005 when ""stand your ground"" passed. Smith voted against the law. ""Stand your ground’ appears to be giving suspects better protections from arrest and prosecution than increased security measures for the citizens the law was originally intended to protect. This needs to be dramatically changed. … We can’t keep turning a blind eye to the number of lives this law has claimed.""

According to the press release, Smith noted that ""since the law’s passage, deaths due to self defense have jumped over 250 percent."" 
That’s a significant increase worth checking out.

As we do in cases like this, we’ll first check the numbers and then check to see if ""stand your ground"" is to blame as Smith suggests.

The statistic

The ""stand your ground"" statute states that ""a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.""

Smith’s office and the Senate Democratic office pointed to news stories -- a 2010 article in the Tampa Bay Times and a March 20, 2012, report on CBS 4 -- about the number of ""justifiable homicides,"" since the ""stand your ground"" law passed in 2005.

We contacted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement directly for data on justifiable homicides from 2000-10 and through the first half of 2011.

FDLE uses this definition of justifiable homicides when collecting data for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting: ""The killing of the perpetrator of a serious criminal offense either by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty or by a private citizen, during the commission of a serious criminal offense.""

FDLE’s manual explains that the label is based on an investigating officer’s findings -- not on the actions by a prosecutor or court.

The FBI’s UCR handbook explains that a storekeeper shooting a gunman attempting a robbery is a justifiable homicide. But if two men playing cards get into an argument in which the first man attacked the second with a broken bottle and the second man shot his attacker claiming self-defense, that should not be reported as justifiable homicide.

FDLE’s data is based on information reported by police departments -- that reporting is voluntary but nearly all the agencies comply, FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg said. The data refers to how police labeled the homicide -- not charging decisions by prosecutors or court outcomes. FDLE compiles the data for the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, a national source of crime statistics.

Here’s a breakdown by calendar year and whether the person acting in self-defense was a civilian or a law enforcement officer: 
  
From 2000-04 -- the five full years before ""stand your ground"" took effect -- law enforcement agencies in Florida reported an average of 12 justifiable homicides a year committed by civilians. From 2006-10 -- the first five full years after ""stand your ground"" became law -- law enforcement agencies reported an average of 36 justifiable homicides committed by civilians. Average to average, the number of justifiable homicides by civilians is now three times higher than it was in the years before 2005. That’s an increase of 200 percent. (We excluded 2005 from this calculation because the law went into effect part way through the year.)

Is ‘stand your ground’ to blame?

So Smith is a little high in his estimate using FDLE data. Next, we wondered whether the 2005 law is the reason justifiable homicides among civilians are up.

Experts we contacted didn’t agree whether there is a simple cause and effect.

Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, has researched how the FBI and police departments define justifiable homicide.

Criminologists are suspicious of sharp increases or decreases within a short time frame, he said.

""I don’t believe anything triples.…Increases that sharp are probably due to some artificial cause like a shift in how people are defining events,"" Kleck said. ""It’s possible nothing actually changed in frequency except police departments increasingly defined homicide claimed to be defensive as a justifiable homicide. … Local police departments are increasingly viewing alleged defensible homicide as falling into the UCR definition. I don’t think they are trying to rig data, they honestly shifted their perceptions of what qualifies.""

Bill Eddins, state attorney in Florida’s 1st Circuit and president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, said he couldn’t conclude if there is a correlation between the ""stand your ground"" law and the increase in justifiable homicides.

Although our overall crime rate has trended downward, ""the random violence seems to be increasing to me,"" Eddins said.

To determine the effect of the ""stand your ground"" law would require examining how many times the statute was used, the result of the case and whether or not the ""stand your ground"" statute contributed to that resolution, he said.

""There is no real measurement set up to do that at this point. I cannot reach the conclusion that there is a direct correlation in the increases of justifiable homicide as a result of stand your ground law. I know other people are saying you can, but I can’t reach it.""

Nancy Daniels, a public defender in the 2nd Circuit and president of the Florida Public Defender Association, said that she thinks there is a clear correlation between the ""stand your ground"" law and increase in justifiable homicide cases.

""The types of incidents involved in ‘stand your ground’ cases have always been with us, but some now are found to be justifiable,"" she said in an email. ""And who knows how many people have been emboldened to think violence is justified just because of the new law?""

Dennis Kenney, a criminal justice professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and a former police officer in Polk County, said that determining correlation between the numbers and the law would require examining the cases and seeing how often elements from the ""stand your ground"" law were raised. Without examining the numbers or the cases themselves, Kenney said it’s ""highly likely"" that there is a correlation.

And Kenney, who was critical of the law, predicted: ""After all the publicity the current case is getting you would expect it to go up much more.""

David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys based in Washington, said the increase in reported justifiable homicides could be the result of any number of factors -- including overall crime or population growth.

Our ruling

Smith said that since ""stand your ground"" passed in 2005, deaths due to self-defense have jumped over 250 percent. When we calculated the average for five years before the law passed and five years after it passed, we found an increase of 200 percent. That’s short of Smith’s claim, though the numbers largerly support the idea that self-defense deaths have increased since 2005. As for whether ""stand your ground"" is the reason self-defense deaths are up, experts either disagree or say it’s difficult to determine without examining the specifics of each case.

Tommy Thompson says Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was the lowest in the nation when he was governor
","
Former Gov. Tommy Thompson loves talking about about the good old days of Wisconsin’s economy as he runs in the GOP primary for an open U.S. Senate seat.

Amid continuing high unemployment in the Badger State and across the nation, Thompson often redirects voters to the mid- to late-1990s.

""We created 740,000 jobs – can you imagine that? – a record for the state!"" Thompson proclaimed in a March 3, 2012 speech at a party caucus meeting in Sauk County. ""The state was in bad shape, and we turned it completely around. Our unemployment dropped down to 2.1 percent … (and was) the lowest in the country for 40 consecutive months. The lowest in the country!""

In his familiar cheerleading style, he added: ""Then, we were so good, people were so excited, we went to the Rose Bowl and we won three times!""

Wisconsin’ economic success in Thompson’s time -- as well as gridiron glory in Pasadena -- is well-established. The Badgers won all three Rose Bowl trips during Thompson’s era, and not once during his governor’s tenure (1987 to 2001) did unemployment rise to the February 2012 mark of 6.9 percent.

But did the state really lead the nation in shrinking unemployment -- and for more than three years?

We turned to the official scorekeeper of labor market performance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The numbers showed some things for Thompson to crow about.

But on the specific claim, it is more along the lines of eating crow.

When Thompson won the job, the small-town lawyer and legislator inherited a tough -- but dramatically improving -- unemployment picture. Four years before his election, unemployment peaked at 11.5 percent in January 1983, but it had fallen to 6.6 percent as he took office.

Under Thompson, the rate dropped for three more years, jumped around for a couple, then dropped slowly for seven years before heading back up in his last full year, 2000. This trend line mirrored the national one.

The Wisconsin unemployment rate was 3.9 percent as Thompson left in February 2001 for a cabinet post in President George W. Bush’s administration -- an improvement over that 6.6 mark in his first month as chief executive.

(Historical footnote: it would climb to 5.3 percent within 10 months after he departed.)

In his Sauk County speech, Thompson said unemployment dropped all the way down to 2.1 percent.

But the most commonly used official figures show Wisconsin’s low was 3.0 percent, achieved in six different months during that time.

That’s according to seasonally adjusted figures, which BLS officials told us are preferred for month-to-month comparisons. In addition, Wisconsin governors have long relied on and emphasized the seasonally adjusted figures when announcing unemployment figures.

In short, they are treated as the official numbers.

Even Thompson, as he left office, used the seasonal numbers, saying the low point in his tenure was around 3 percent, according to media coverage at the time.

When asked about the claim, Thompson’s campaign pointed to data that is not seasonally adjusted. The rate was 2.0 percent in September 1999, according to a Thompson administration press release from December of 1999. However, the federal data shows a 2.4 percent unadjusted rate for that month, likely because figures are preliminary when announced, and later get updated.

So the 2.1 percent figure doesn’t hold up.

Now let’s examine Thompson’s national comparison.

Was Wisconsin No. 1?

We couldn’t find a single month -- much less 40 straight months -- in which Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was lowest among the states.

To be sure, its rate was in the very bottom tier for most of the 1990s -- bottom five or 10, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows.

But Nebraska and the Dakotas consistently beat Wisconsin’s numbers throughout the decade. And Minnesota, Iowa and Indiana -- other Midwestern states -- put up lower figures when Wisconsin was its best in 1998, 1999 and 2000.

Indeed, this held true even when the data was not seasonally adjusted.

Reacting to our findings, a campaign official said Thompson actually was referring to the city of Madison when he said ""lowest in the nation."" The campaign also noted the state’s unemployment rate was below the national average for well over 40 months.

But Thompson cited a statewide number in his claim. And he didn’t say below the average. He said lowest.

Our rating 
In a speech in Sauk County, Thompson contended Wisconsin’s unemployment rate dipped to 2.1 percent and was lowest in the nation for more than three years running when he sat in the governor’s chair.

Federal statistics clearly refute the ""lowest in the nation"" claim, and the 2.1 percent is on target only if you cite preliminary numbers from a less-preferred statistical method.

Senate hopeful claims Obama administration’s health care law eliminates doctor-patient relationship
","
For Joe Kyrillos, it’s clear ""we must repeal ObamaCare.""

In a campaign e-mail, the Republican state senator and U.S. Senate hopeful made his case for taking the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- or as some call it, ObamaCare -- off the books.

""The fears are unanimous. ObamaCare is too expensive. It is a government takeover of our healthcare system. Services will be diminished. The patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated. It will not make healthcare more affordable. And it will bankrupt small businesses,"" Kyrillos said in the March 15 e-mail.

There’s a slew of claims in that paragraph, including PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year about the government takeover of health care, but one jumped out at us: ""the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated.""

To support the claim, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, Chapin Fay, first pointed to a survey of physicians that found more than half of the roughly 5,000 doctors who responded said health care reform would have a negative impact on their relationship with patients.

But that doesn’t prove the relationship will be eliminated and a spokesman for the company that conducted the survey said Kyrillos’ statement is ""a step further than what our survey would say.""  

When asked for specifics from the law, Fay pointed to the ""value-based payment modifier under the physician fee schedule."" The modifier provides financial penalties or rewards to doctors serving Medicare patients depending on the quality and cost of the care delivered.

In another e-mail he said: ""To the extent that Medicare drives all health care services, one could make the argument that the relationship as we once knew it will be 'eliminated.’ Primarily due to two new federal bureaucracies - IPAB and Preventive Services Task Force.""

The 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, will recommend ways to prevent Medicare’s spending growth from exceeding targets.

The board can’t recommend changes that would ration care or raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries, among other measures. It will be able to decrease government payments to health care providers and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force makes recommendations on clinical preventive services to primary care clinicians. Under the new law, certain plans must cover recommendations made by the task force.

Some experts expressed concerns about how such measures will influence the doctor-patient relationship, but it’s clear that relationship isn’t eliminated. Whether treatments are covered by insurance or result in out-of-pocket costs is another matter -- and not a new one.

Robert Moffit, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the traditional doctor-patient relationship, if defined as a doctor recommends treatment and insurance pays for it, has been deteriorating.  

Moffit said the health care law ""does change the practice of medicine,"" significantly, but he called Kyrillos’ language ""a little too strong.""

Other experts said Kyrillos’ claim overreaches.

""As I read the legislation these are all tools to strengthen the primary care infrastructure so that it can better support patient-physician relationships,"" said Ann O’Malley, a senior health researcher for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a research group cited by both Republicans and Democrats.

O’Malley also said Kyrillos’ statement assumes the ""existing system is set up so it’s  in the best interest of patients, and it’s not.""

Judy Feder, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University who served in the federal health department under President Bill Clinton, said the measures Kyrillos highlighted ""define some of the coverage and payment features but they are not in any way dictating the relationship between the patient and a doctor.""

Kyrillos’ campaign was not swayed.

""The fact is that this law eliminates the ‘doctor-patient’ relationship and creates the ‘doctor-patient-government’ relationship,"" Fay said.

Our ruling

Under the Obama administration’s health care law, Kyrillos claimed ""the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated.""

That’s a hefty charge. And there’s little proof to substantiate it.

Provisions in the health care law allow changes to payments to health care providers and influence what’s covered by certain insurance plans, but nothing in the bill prevents physicians and patients from making health care decisions together.

Kyrillos may need to call a doctor after this ruling: Pants on Fire!

Rep. Robert Hurt says $900 million health reform price tag has swelled to $1.8 trillion
","
U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt says Americans can’t afford the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Commonly called ObamaCare, the 2010 law that expands Medicare eligibility and requires all legal U.S. residents to have some form of health care insurance.

In a March 19 posting on his web site  Hurt, R-5th, called the law ""budget-busting."" He cited a March 10 report from the Congressional Budget Office and reeled off potential problems with the reforms.

""Additionally, the report projected that the cost of this health care law will increase to nearly $1.8 trillion – increasing the price to far greater than the $900 billion than was projected when it was enacted – raising costs for American taxpayers at a time when we can least afford it,"" he wrote.

We wondered if the new CBO report really did project a 100 percent increase in the cost of health care reform.

When President Barack Obama proposed the health care legislation in September 2009, he said, ""Now, add it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over 10 years -- less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration.""

In March 2010, the CBO calculated the gross cost at $938 billion for 2010 through 2019. But that figure did not take into account revenues the law would produce by imposing taxes on top earners, levies on high-cost insurance plans and penalties on individuals and employers who remain uninsured. The net cost of health care reform was projected at $788 billion for the decade.

It’s important to remember that the law phases in over the decade. From 2010 to 2013, the CBO projected the gross and net costs of the law at less than $10 billion a year.

The gross cost estimate swelled to $54 billion and the net to $49 billion for 2014, when major reforms begin, such as expanded eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as well as subsidies for insurance exchanges. For 2019, the CBO estimated the gross cost at $214 billion and the net at $172 billion.

Now, let’s look at the CBO’s latest report. It provides updated figures but looks at different years than the first study.

The new gross cost is $1.762 trillion from 2012 to 2022, which Hurt accurately rounded up.  The net cost is $1.252 trillion. But the total numbers are for an 11-year period, whereas the earlier report’s figures were for 10 years. And the new timespan, 2012 to 2022, adds three years at the end when reforms are fully implemented and removes two years at the beginning, when costs were minimal.

So has the CBO doubled its original projections on the cost of health care reform, as Hurt suggests? We compared the years both reports have in common -- 2012 through 2019 -- and came up with these results:

*The total gross cost in the first report was $931 billion, compared with $1.011 trillion in the second study. That’s an 8.6 percent increase.

*The total net cost in the first report was $777 billion, compared with $772 billion in the second study. That’s an 0.6 percent decrease.

Our ruling

Hurt said the CBO has estimated that the cost of health care reform will rise to $1.8 trillion, ""increasing the price to far greater than the $900 billion projected"" when the law was signed in 2010.

The Republican correctly rounded off numbers contained in two CBO reports, but then he made a misleading comparison between them. The first estimate covers a 10-year period -- from 2010 to 2019 -- including four early years when costs for the phased-in reform are minimal. The second projection covers an 11-year period -- from 2012 to 2022 -- that adds three years when the program is in full force and drops the first two low-cost years of the law. Hurt did not mention these key differences.

When you compare the years the reports have in common -- 2012 to 2019 -- gross-cost projections in the the latter study are 8.6 percent higher than in the initial work.

So there’s some truth in Hurt’s claim that estimates for the cost of health care reform have increased. But his statement implies he projections have doubled, and that’s plain wrong.

Numbers back up tax claim by Deal spokesman
","
Cheers and celebratory handshakes swept through the Georgia Legislature last week when it overwhelmingly passed a bill to overhaul much of the state’s tax code.

But some good government types and fiscal watchdogs were disappointed by the process. It was unveiled and passed in less than a week.

One top aide to Gov. Nathan Deal said the legislation, House Bill 386, is good for Georgia.

""This pro-jobs, pro-family tax reform broadens the tax base so we can lower the tax burden overall,"" Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the day after the House passed the bill. ""It’s important to remember ... that this is an overall tax cut. We can’t get away from that fact.""

Since some people have questions about the bill, and it passed so quickly, we wondered whether Robinson is right?

Let’s take a look at the 56-page bill.

If you’re married, you’ll probably like the bill. It would increase exemptions by $2,000 for married couples who file joint returns and by $1,000 each for spouses who file separately.

If you’re retired, you may not like it. The bill would cap the exclusion on the state collecting taxes on nonwork income at $65,000 for Georgians 65 and older. The state’s current policy would allow the cap to rise significantly to $200,000 by 2015 and eventually no cap at all.

If you frequently shop online, you may not like it. The legislation would impose a tax on some items purchased on the Internet.

There are other changes as well. It would eliminate the annual ad valorem tax on vehicles that the state’s car owners pay on their birthdays. It would be replaced by a one-time title tax. The bill would end the sales tax exemption for film production activities but bring back the sales tax holiday a couple of times later this year and in 2013. HB 368 also would phase out most of the sales taxes on energy used in manufacturing, mining and newspaper publishing. There are other exemptions in the bill concerning agriculture and construction materials.

State officials estimate the government will see a $62.8 million decline in revenue between now and the end of fiscal year 2015. Local governments would see a greater decline of nearly $200 million during the same time period, according to the state research, which was put in an eight-page fiscal note.

The bill’s proponents believe the legislation will result in increased economic activity in the state and more jobs, which will more than make up for the estimated cuts.

Robinson, who also holds the title of Deal’s deputy chief of staff, said he was specifically referring to the impact on state revenue.

""Overall [which is the exact word I used], this decreases tax revenue,"" Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia.

Georgia lawmakers tried a similar bill last year, but it never came up for a vote for several reasons, including concerns that the state’s revenue estimates were inaccurate. This year, there have been no widespread complaints about the numbers, although there were complaints that not enough time had been allowed to properly review the proposal.

The state’s figures show a $22.7 million surplus in state revenue in FY 2015, which begins July 1, 2014, and ends June 30, 2015. There is a deficit in FY 2013 and FY 2014 of a combined $85.5 million to the state. The difference between FY 2015 and the two other years is that the sales tax holiday and the construction materials exemption are not included in FY 2015. The sales tax holidays amount to an estimated annual $40 million net loss to the state while the construction exemption is projected to cost the state about $20 million a year.

Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Institute, a fiscally conservative think tank, said the Legislature will probably continue both exemptions before they expire because of their popularity with the public.

""It took a recession to get rid of the sales tax holiday,"" he said.

Robinson’s claim passed one major political hurdle. The Washington, D.C.-based Americans for Tax Reform has its problems with the bill, specifically that it believes the Internet tax provision is unconstitutional and that the legislation doesn’t go far enough in accomplishing ""tax reform.""

Still, Josh Culling, its state affairs manager, called the bill a ""net tax cut,"" basing that conclusion on the fiscal note.

The organization asks political candidates to sign a pledge not to support any legislation that results in a net tax increase. The pledge is virtually a requirement for any fiscal conservative who wants to get in office. Deal has signed the pledge, along with nearly one-quarter of the Georgia Legislature.

""While we are not excited about many of the tax changes in the bill, we have informed the Legislature that it is compliant with the Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" Culling told us in an email.

Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, which constantly monitors fiscal matters at the state Capitol, agreed with Robinson’s statement if you define an overall tax cut as a decline in taxes collected by local and state governments.

Speaking about the changes concerning retirement income, McCutchen said ""that technically is a tax increase on senior citizens. But I would say [Georgia already has] one of the more generous retirement exclusions in the country.""

McCutchen, a supporter of the bill, agreed with Robinson’s claim.

""Overall, it’s a tax cut, and I don’t think there’s much debate on that,"" McCutchen said.

We’d like to see more years worth of estimates to see how much revenue the state would collect past FY 2015. Some believe the state will see a surplus in revenue if Georgia’s population grows and more people buy cars. They could be right, especially if the sales tax holiday and construction exemption do not continue past FY 2015.

Since Robinson’s quote was based solely on the impact to the state, and not to its taxpayers, the current state estimate does back up his claim -- unless the construction exemption and sales tax holiday don’t continue. 

Based on the current estimates, we rate Robinson’s claim as True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/26/brian-robinson/numbers-back-tax-claim-deal-spokesman/

Rep. Marcy Kaptur says that the poorest in America are women
","
U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Toledo, appeared recently on MSNBC’s PoliticsNation with Al Sharpton in which the host took a swipe at Republicans for focusing on women’s reproductive issues rather than creating jobs.

Kaptur shared Sharpton’s indignation and said voters in her district do, too. ""They think the Republicans want to take us back a half century on reproductive health,"" she said.

The subject then turned to economics and the pending transportation bill, with Kaptur lamenting the fact that Congress has not been able to approve a bill that would put a lot of Americans back to work.

""The American people are clamoring for getting the roads paved, for improving our airports, for improving our mass transit, for improving our ports,"" she said.

She then brought the conversation back to the subject of women and the economic challenges many of them face.

""The poorest in this country are women,"" she said.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to focus on this simple statement about the economic plight of women.

Kaptur’s communications director Steve Fought provided PolitiFact Ohio with U.S. Census data and a National Women’s Law Center report to back up his boss’s statement.

The numbers indeed show that the poverty rate for women in the United States was 14.5 percent in 2010, which was 3.3 percentage points higher than for men.

Women also fared worse when comparisons were made within ethnic groups, such as white (non-Hispanic), black, Hispanic, Asian and native American. For instance, slightly more than 25 percent of all African-American women were in poverty in 2010, compared with 19.1 percent for African-American men.

Greater numbers of women also tended to be poor when broken down by age groups. More than 25 percent of women 18-24 years of age are in poverty, compared with 18.8 percent for men in the same age group.

And for women in that same age group who are also single mothers, the percentage of those in poverty jumps to 40.7 percent, compared to 24.2 for single men with children.

We went one step further and found the percentage of women in extreme poverty was 6.3 percent, 1.4 percentage points higher than for men. People who are considered in extreme poverty have incomes that are more than halfway below the federal poverty line.
In those cases, one is ""really destitute,"" said Claudia Coulton, co-director of the Center for Urban Policy and Community Development at Case Western Reserve University.

So, just about any way you slice it, women are more likely than men to be poor, or at least below the poverty line.

GOP Wisconsin state senator says study shows kids living with parent and parent's partner ""20 times"" more likely to be sexually abused
","
The tasks of Wisconsin’s Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board include raising public awareness about the mistreatment of children.

Under a bill introduced in February 2012 by state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, the board would be required to ""emphasize non-marital parenthood as a contributing factor to child abuse and neglect.""

That’s a reference to homes where a child lives with a biological parent and the parent’s boyfriend or girlfriend.

The ""non-marital parenthood"" focus of the bill attracted national news coverage from CNN and the Huffington Post. It also drew criticism from advocates of single parents such as liberal talk show host Alan Colmes.

During his national Fox News radio program on March 2, 2012, Colmes asked Grothman to explain the bill.  

""We do have a child abuse and neglect board and their goal is to educate people on how to reduce abuse,"" Grothman replied.

""Now the studies show that, if you are living with your two biological parents compared to with a biological parent and a boyfriend or girlfriend -- if you were with that boyfriend or girlfriend, you have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused.""

Grothman went on to say that ""people certainly know there are single moms who are good parents and there are single moms who aren’t. But when the statistics show you’re 20 times greater -- in one type of family structure than another -- to cause a child to be a victim of sexual abuse, it’s something that ought to be out there.""

We decided to take a look at Grothman’s numbers.

Grothman’s evidence

Although he said ""studies,"" Grothman made it clear to Colmes that the statistic he cited is from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study on child abuse and neglect published in January 2010. Mandated by Congress, the study ""serves as the nation’s needs assessment on child abuse and neglect"" and is the fourth in a series that dates back to the 1970s.

The newest study surveyed child protective service agencies in a representative sample of 122 counties about abuse and neglect cases they investigated during a one-year period -- the second half of 2005 and the first half of 2006. The study also obtained information about children who were identified by professionals as having been abused or neglected but whose cases were not officially investigated.

A major difference was found among perpetrators of different types of abuse. More than 70 percent of children who were physically or emotionally abused were abused by a biological parent, but only 36 percent of children who were sexually abused were sexually abused by a biological parent.

As for Grothman’s claim, Grothman aide Lance Burri cited a chart in the study on the rate of sexual abuse in different types of households.

The chart shows that children living with two married biological parents were sexually abused at a rate of 0.5 per 1,000 children, while the rate for children living with a single parent with a partner in the home was 9.9 per 1,000 children.

That means the sexual abuse rate for children living with a single parent who has a partner in the home was 19.8 times higher than the rate for children living with biological parents who are married.

So, by saying the rate is 20 times higher, Grothman is correct, a point we confirmed with the study's lead author, Andrea Sedlak. She noted that the study did not determine who the perpetrator was in the cases where children who were sexually abused were living with a parent and the parent's partner.

We would also note that the sexual abuse rate wasn’t higher in all types of single-parent homes. The same chart Grothman cited shows the rate among children living with a single parent who had no cohabiting partner (2.4 per 1,000 children) was lower than that of children living with other married parents, such as a biological parent and a stepparent (4.3 per 1,000 children).

Other viewpoints

We asked Ken Taylor, executive director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Council on Children & Families, about Grothman’s claim. His group is one of three that lobbied against Grothman’s bill.

Taylor said that while Grothman accurately quotes the study, a child living with a single parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend is only one of many risk factors associated with abuse and neglect generally. Others include poverty, an adult’s substance abuse or mental illness, and whether the adult was abused as a child, he said.

The Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which also opposed Grothman’s bill, testified at a hearing on the bill that promoting marriage over single parenthood could put children at greater risk if there is domestic violence in a home with married parents. Conversely, promoting the reduction of substance abuse among adults, for example, would have only a positive impact on child abuse and neglect, the coalition said.

The Legislature didn’t act on Grothman’s bill before adjourning its session in March 2012. That means the bill would have to be re-introduced to be considered and Grothman hasn’t made a decision about doing that, his aide said. But the bill’s statement -- that ""non-marital parenthood"" is a ""contributing factor to child abuse and neglect"" -- is supported by the study.

The overall rate of abuse and neglect was lowest in homes with married biological parents -- 6.8 per 1,000 children. It was highest for children living with one parent who had an unmarried partner in the household -- 57.2 per 1,000 children. That’s more than eight times higher than the rate in households with married biological parents.

Our rating

Grothman said a federal study shows that children who live with a biological parent and the parent's boyfriend or girlfriend ""have a 20 times greater chance of being sexually abused.""

Grothman accurately quotes the study, which found that the rate of sexual abuse among children who live with a biological parent and the parent's partner is 20 times higher than the rate for children who live with their married biological parents.

"['New Jersey', 'LGBTQ', 'Marriage', 'Chris Christie']","
Gov. Chris Christie says he and Obama have same views on gay marriage
","When it comes to marriage equality, Gov. Chris Christie’s position is clear: he supports civil unions and ensuring that same-sex couples have the same legal protections as married couples.

In this regard, Christie said during a Feb. 23 appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program that he and President Barack Obama are like-minded.

Christie, a Republican, and Obama, a Democrat, agreeing on an issue that has divided people across the nation?

Not exactly, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The governor and the president agree on some issues related to same-sex marriage – but not all.

Let’s review what both leaders have said about gay marriage.

Christie opposes same-sex marriage and on Feb. 17 conditionally vetoed a Legislature bill legalizing it.

In 2008, prior to the presidential election, Obama said marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Since then, he has said is viewpoint is ""evolving,"" according to numerous published reports.

In vetoing the Legislature’s bill, Christie suggested a referendum this November on gay marriage. Obama has opposed referenda on same-sex marriage, most recently legislation in North Carolina that would define marriage as between one man and one woman.

So what do the governor and president have in common? Both have said they support strengthening states’ civil union laws. But unlike Christie, Obama has not answered directly whether he supports same-sex marriage.

White House spokesman Brandon Lepow referred us to past remarks made by White House Press Secretary Jay Carney when we sought comment on Christie’s statement.

""The President has long opposed … divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples,""  Carney said in January.

Christie has the same view, according to an e-mail from his spokesman Michael Drewniak.

""The Governor has proposed a strengthening of civil unions to ensure that those rights are appropriately enforced and administered under the law.  The Governor has never spoken to the legislature’s qualifications to decide the issue one way or the other; he said what he would do with legislation if it was passed and did so (conditional veto), because it was against his beliefs.  He said an issue of such magnitude and importance deserved to be put in the hands of the people, as a pathway for those who support same sex marriage to achieve it – if it was supported by a majority of voters. None of this is news, it’s been said multiple times by the Governor.""

But given their differing view on same-sex marriage referenda, Christie might have taken too far his claim of a similar view as Obama when program host Joe Scarborough asked, ""Is there any space on your position on gay marriage and President Barack Obama's?"" ""Not that I'm aware of,"" Christie responded. Others disagree with the governor.

""President Obama has taken a strong position opposing state efforts to put the rights of minorities up for a popular vote -- including most recently in North Carolina -- and the President is committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination against LGBT Americans under federal law, like the so-called 'Defense of Marriage' Act,"" University of Pennsylvania law professor Tobias Barrington Wolff said in an e-mail. Wolff also was an adviser to Obama's 2008 campaign on issues affecting the gay community.

Ned Flaherty, a Boston-based project manager for Marriage Equality USA, criticized Christie for going against the Legislature's vote, vetoing the bill and suggesting a referendum be held.

""He’s turning to people in the business of having a pulse on the public and saying, ‘I don’t believe you,’"" Flaherty said.

Our ruling

During a recent television interview Christie said he and Obama shared the same views on gay marriage. That’s true to a point – both leaders say they support civil unions and oppose discriminating against same-sex couples. But that’s where the similarities end. Christie supports a public vote in New Jersey on allowing same-sex marriage; Obama opposes such referenda. Christie opposes same-sex marriage. The president won’t answer the question directly.

"['Immigration', 'Rhode Island', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Workers', 'Peter  Palumbo']","
Rhode Island state Rep. Peter Palumbo says that all polls show that the vast majority of people support E-Verify.
","
State Rep. Peter G. Palumbo was on WHJJ’s ""Helen Glover Show"" recently to talk about his latest attempt to crack down on illegal immigration in Rhode Island.

The Cranston Democrat has submitted legislation in the General Assembly that would require companies with three or more employees to check on the immigration status of any job applicants using the federal E-Verify database.

During his talk-radio appearance March 20, Palumbo told Glover that not only is E-Verify the ""simplest way to curb illegal immigration,"" it’s also a program that has broad public support.

""Every poll you see, the overwhelming majority of people want the bill,"" he said.

Does E-Verify really have such overwhelming support?

E-Verify is a federal government program that allows companies to check on a worker’s immigration status through an online database. The program compares information on the worker’s Form I-9 to records from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. If the records match, there’s no problem. If the records don’t match, the worker may be in the country illegally.

When we asked Palumbo to show us some polls on E-Verify, he referred to only one, conducted a year ago by Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy & American Institutions. We found that poll, but it didn’t ask any questions about E-Verify.

The closest was a question about the controversial law in Arizona that requires local police forces to enforce federal immigration laws. Fifty-four percent of the Rhode Islanders in the survey were in favor of such a law.

We did our own research and found many polls that asked about a variety of illegal- immigration questions, but few that asked specifically about E-Verify. The one poll that supporters of E-Verify around the country most frequently cite was conducted by Rasmussen Reports, a nationally recognized polling firm. That poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted May 27-28, 2011.

The poll asked this question: ""The federal government maintains an E-Verify system which allows employers to determine the immigration status of potential employees. Before hiring a new employee, should businesses be required to check and make sure that each potential employee is in the country legally?""

Eighty-two percent of respondents answered yes, 12 percent said no and the remaining 6 percent were undecided. That is an overwhelming majority in favor of E-Verify.

But that’s only one poll. What about others? NumbersUSA, a group that opposes illegal immigration and also advocates for limits on legal immigration, last month released the results of a poll it commissioned from Pulse Opinion Research, a subsidiary of Rasmussen Research. 

The poll asked: ""On the issue of illegal immigration, do you favor or oppose mandating that all employers electronically verify the immigration status of their workers?"" Seventy-eight percent were in favor, 12 percent were opposed and 9 percent were unsure.

The Federation for American Immigration Reform, another group opposed to illegal immigration that also seeks to curb legal immigration, released the results last year of a poll it also commissioned from Pulse Opinion Research. According to FAIR, 88 percent of respondents supported the use of an ""electronic verification system to check worker eligibility,"" while 11 percent were opposed.

A 2010 poll of 616 Arizona residents conducted by The Arizona Republic newspaper found that 66 percent supported a state law that would require employers ""to prove that all their workers are U.S. citizens or have valid work visas.""

As for Rhode Island, we found two polls, both conducted in 2008 by Rhode Island College’s Bureau of Government Research and Services, that asked voters about then-Gov. Donald Carcieri’s executive order to use E-Verify to screen state workers and employees of companies that do business with the state. 

In the first poll, done that June, 75 percent of the 500 Rhode Islanders in the survey agreed with the governor’s order. In the second poll the following September, 73 percent agreed with it. 

Our ruling

Palumbo said that ""every poll"" shows ""overwhelming support"" for E-Verify. Obviously, we can’t guarantee that we found every poll on E-Verify. But we did find several, some conducted by independent pollsters, others financed by groups that favor stronger enforcement of immigration laws.

All of the polls that we found -- both national surveys and others conducted in Rhode Island -- showed strong support for E-Verify, ranging from 66 percent of respondents in favor to 88 percent.

We rule Palumbo’s statement True.

Democratic legislators say nearly 45% of women who get health screenings through the Women’s Health Program do so at Planned Parenthood
","
Speaking out against the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from a Texas family planning program for low-income women, five Democratic legislators aired a statistic indicating that the group is a crucial provider. 
""Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through this program do so at a Planned Parenthood health center,"" said a commentary in the March 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman by Austin state Reps. Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard. 
We looked into that figure amid debate over the state’s decision, which led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of about $30 million in annual federal funds for the Texas Medicaid Women’s Health Program, which has served tens of thousands of women a year since its launch in 2007. 
To participate in the program, providers may not perform elective abortions. Since the program’s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don’t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do. 
That is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, which had the effect of disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas’ new rule violates federal law by restricting women’s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money — and without Planned Parenthood. 
Under the program, participating women may receive health screenings, including a Pap smear, during the one family planning exam per fiscal year that the program covers. Examples of other screenings, related to family planning, that women can get during their visit: breast exam, pregnancy test, routine urinalysis, as well as testing for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and high blood pressure. Screenings are not covered outside of the annual exam. 
The program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms. 
Naishtat aide Nancy Walker told us by email that the ""nearly 45 percent"" figure came from ""multiple sources,"" including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She said the agency told her that in fiscal 2010, about 46 percent of clients in the state’s Women’s Health Program had received services from Planned Parenthood — which, we noticed, is a wider description than the legislators’ reference solely to ""health screenings."" 
Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us that the state has not compiled data on where women in the program receive health screenings. 
Asked about the figure that Naishtat’s aide cited from the commission, Goodman told us that the figure is based on a data analysis for fiscal 2010 — Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 — showing that of the 106,711 women who were served by the program, 49,162 received a service from a Planned Parenthood clinic. That’s 46.1 percent. 
We wondered, though, if it’s correct to assume that all women in the program received health screenings, as the Democrats’ article suggests. Goodman speculated that it might be, pointing out that all women in the program are entitled to an annual exam with health screenings. 
Also, the Democrats’ article leaves the impression that the referenced women solely depended on Planned Parenthood clinics for their screenings. 
That might not be so. According to the commission’s figures, 27,256 of the 49,162 Women’s Health Program clients who were served by Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 also received a Women’s Health Program service from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood. 
In a previous fact-check, we laid out a couple of possible explanations for those women being served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider. 
For one, some portion of the 27,256 women may have had their exams and screenings at a Planned Parenthood clinic and then any tests processed at an outside lab. In those cases — and the state couldn’t tell us how many of them there were — the only ""services"" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider was lab testing. These women would not affect the Democrats’ statistic, since they received their screenings at Planned Parenthood. 
But under the program, it’s also possible for women to switch providers during the year and receive another exam and screenings. So some portion of the 27,256 women may have received screenings from both a Planned Parenthood and a non-Planned Parenthood provider during fiscal 2010. 
And if the number were large enough, the percentage of women in the program who received their screenings exclusively from a Planned Parenthood clinic would be smaller than 46 percent. 
Goodman told us the state has not teased out the detailed data that would settle this issue. 
Our ruling 
The Democratic legislators wrote that nearly 45 percent of women who received health screenings through the targeted family-planning program in fiscal 2010 had them at Planned Parenthood clinics. 
That could be so, but we identified a couple of unsettled hitches. 
According to the state, 46 percent of the cited program’s clients went to a Planned Parenthood clinic, but the state has no breakdown of the number of women who were screened overall, which is what the Democrats focused on. Also, the Democrats’ statement implies that 46 percent of women rely on Planned Parenthood exclusively for screenings, but some women included in the 46 percent could have had screenings at a different kind of clinic, though (again) such details are not available.

Democratic legislators say more than half of Texas births funded by Medicaid
","
In an op-ed column questioning the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from a women’s contraception program, Austin members of the Texas House say the result would be more government-funded births.

""More than half of the births in Texas are paid for by Medicaid and, without this (women’s) program, that percentage will undoubtedly increase,"" says the column posted on the Austin American-Statesman’s website on March 5, 2012.

The Medicaid Women’s Health Program, which has a goal of reducing Medicaid-funded births, has not been eliminated, though its federal ties are in transition. Specifically, the Statesman op-ed article, by Democratic Reps. Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard, objects to a move by the state’s Republican leaders to remove Planned Parenthood clinics as providers in the 5-year-old program, which has annually offered contraception and cancer screenings to tens of thousands of low-income women.

After the state action, the federal government announced that it was phasing out its aid to the Texas program. Gov. Rick Perry replied that state funds would be found to make up for the loss.

While none of the barred clinics provided abortions, state leaders said they were rightly enforcing a state law against state aid reaching any clinic with a connection to Planned Parenthood, which has other clinics that do provide abortions.

We can’t judge the Democrats’ prediction that more births will need to be paid for by Medicaid because of these turns. For this article, we wondered if indeed more than half of Texas births are currently covered by Medicaid, the government insurance program that mostly serves low-income mothers and children.

Naishtat’s legislative director, Nancy Walker, passed along a January 2011 Texas Health and Human Services Commission presentation, ""Medicaid and Healthy Babies,"" stating that more than 55 percent of Texas births are paid for by Medicaid. ""Medicaid is the primary public coverage program providing prenatal and perinatal care in Texas, and is the primary payor of all Texas births,"" the presentation says. ""Texas spends over $2.2 billion per year in birth and delivery related services.""

In 2001, Medicaid covered 47.5 percent of all Texas births, according to a chart in the presentation. The Medicaid-funded share of births escalated to 56.5 percent in 2006, 56.3 percent in 2007 and 55.4 percent in 2008.

By email, commission spokesman Geoffrey Wool confirmed the cited figures, adding that in 2010, 56.9 percent of Texas births -- or 220,899 out of 388,447 total births -- were covered by Medicaid, at an average cost of $11,600. He provided a commission chart showing the share of births funded by Medicaid for each state fiscal year from 2004 through 2010.

Wool said the state’s share of the $2.2 billion annually paid by Medicaid for Texas births and related services is about $900 million.

Crime rates in Florida have dropped since 'stand your ground,' says Dennis Baxley
","
An author of Florida’s ""stand your ground"" legislation has been defending the law on national television, warning that it may not have anything to do with the recent death of Trayvon Martin.

Martin was an African-American 17-year-old who was watching a basketball game at a friend’s apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. During a break, he walked to a nearby store for candy and iced tea.

While he was out, a resident, George Zimmerman, reported him to 911 as acting suspicious. The operator told Zimmerman not to pursue Martin, but Zimmerman shot Martin a short while later. Police didn’t arrest Zimmerman, and that angered Martin’s family and others.

It also got people talking about Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law. The law allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk.

Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, told MSNBC’s Tamron Hall on March 21, 2012, that the law protects people who are attacked, but it does not protect aggressors. ""There’s nothing in this statute to protect people who are pursuing and confronting other people,"" he said.

Hall asked Baxley about crime statistics that show justifiable homicides are up in Florida, but Baxley said that’s only one statistic.

""What we’ve learned is if we empower people to stop bad things from happening, they will,"" Baxley said. ""And in fact, that statistic is coupled with another statistic. That is the fact that we’ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law has been in effect."" 
In an interview with PBS Newshour the next day, Baxley added that he thought the law ""has saved thousands of people's lives."" 
Here, we’re checking whether there’s been a dramatic drop in violent crime since the law went into effect. To do that, we turned to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s crime statistics and various news reports about violent crime in Florida.

We found that violent crime has dropped significantly in Florida since 2005. (The law went into effect Oct. 1, 2005.)  We calculated the drop in violent crime rates, to account for population growth. In 2006 and 2007, violent crime rates were up just slightly up compared with 2005. In 2008, the violent crime rate began declining. By 2010, the violent crime rate had dropped 23 percent since 2005. (See chart below.)

But that’s not the whole story. We also looked at crime rates for the five years before the ""stand your ground"" law started, and we found violent crime was declining during those years as well. Between 2000 and 2005, violent crime dropped 12 percent.

When we turned to news reports, we found many stories documenting drops in crime nationwide over the past decade. Experts have been surprised that the numbers have continued dropping through a historic recession.

Why are rates declining? Nobody can say for sure. The theories are highly diverse, to say the least, and some are fairly controversial.

Here are just a few we ran across: Police are getting better at using technology to prevent crime. More people are in jail and therefore can’t commit crimes. Online banking and debit cards mean people don’t have cash at home. Abortions have suppressed the number of poor, unsupervised young men. Low inflation makes stealing less attractive. President Barack Obama is setting a positive example for African-American youth. New gun laws establishing the right to carry are deterring criminals. Joblessness means people are at home watching the neighborhood. Extended unemployment benefits and food stamps mean people don’t have to turn to crime.

Baxley told PolitiFact Florida he didn’t think the ""stand your ground"" law was the main reason for Florida’s drop in crime rates. But it could be one of several reasons, he said.

""I don’t want to claim all the effect,"" Baxley said. ""But in public policy, if you make changes, and things go in a positive direction, you’re grateful. So I don’t want to say we caused all of it, but I do think that it helped.""

Others, though, have said the ""stand your ground"" law could potentially drive up the crime rate.

In 2007, the National District Attorneys Association convened a symposium on the ""stand your ground"" law and other expansions to the right to use of deadly force in self-defense. A symposium report listed a number of concerns: Criminals might be emboldened as they learn to use ""stand your ground"" as a legal defense. More deaths could result as more people carry weapons for self-defense. People might feel less safe if they believe anyone could use deadly force in an unsettling situation.

More pointedly for the Trayvon Martin case, the report noted that a misinterpretation of physical clues could result in the use of deadly force, ""exacerbating culture, class, and race differences"" and that there could be ""a disproportionately negative effect on minorities, persons from lower socioeconomic status, and young adults/juveniles.""

Our ruling

Baxley said ""We’ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law has been in effect."" His comments in television interviews implied the law itself reduced violent crime rates. There has been a drop, but rates were declining before the law went into effect. We found no proof that that the ""stand your ground"" law caused the drop in crime rates; some groups worry the law could lead to more violence. We rate his claim Half True. 
  
Editor's note: Due a data entry error, the number of violent crimes for 2010 was originally listed as 113,415 in this report. The story now reflects the correct number of 101,906. The ruling remains the same. ",/factchecks/2012/mar/23/dennis-baxley/crime-rates-florida-have-dropped-stand-your-ground/

CDC warned of acute flaccid myelitis in 2020, not 2021
","The text over a video being shared on social media warns that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to ""expect a polio-like outbreak coming in children in the next four months."" But if you watch the three-minute video, which appears to be a clip of a longer Sept. 1 recording, you’ll hear a clue that this isn’t right.  One of the men in the video says that U.S. News & World Report, the Florida Star and other media outlets are talking about a notice the CDC sent to every hospital in the country. He said the notice said ""you can expect an outbreak between now and November of this year of a polio-like outbreak disease among children, average age of 5 years old."" He says that the CDC is warning of ""a flooding into hospitals around the country"" of children with paralyzed arms and paralyzed legs due to ""acute flaccid myelitis.""  ""They have actually stated that they have seen small outbreaks every two years from 2014, ‘16, ‘18 and they’re expecting an even larger one this year,"" he says. This year? Every two years would be 2020, not 2021.  And 2020 is exactly when the CDC encouraged doctors to be on the lookout for symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis, ""an uncommon but serious neurologic condition that affects mostly children."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the CDC, the disease has peaked every two years in the United States between August and November since 2014.  Because the disease can progress rapidly, leading to permanent paralysis or other problems, delays in care can be serious, the CDC says. The symptoms can look like polio symptoms.  But the agency didn’t warn of a flood of children suffering from this disease. Since the CDC started tracking it in August 2014, there have been 665 confirmed cases, including 32 cases in 2020 and 15 in 2021.   Less than one person in a million will ever develop it, according to the Washington State Department of Health.

No, Tim Tebow didn’t write this about a cashless society

Video takes Biden out of context on the role vaccines play in hurricane preparedness
","Pundits have described Joe Biden as a ""gaffe machine,"" prone to verbal errors and slips of the tongue, throughout his long political career.  But that isn’t what happened in a video that makes it look like Biden mistakenly urged people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from hurricanes.  The video was shared across Instagram and Facebook, and it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Yes, Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is FDA approved
","Even after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave its approval to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine — the first vaccine to get such approval — posters on TikTok were still suggesting it was some kind of rogue jab. One video started with a woman stating: ""You guys, the Pfizer vaccine is not approved. They’ve been saying it’s been approved. I have proof, straight from the website where you sign up to get your vaccine, it is not approved for anything beyond the emergency use approval.""  TikTok identified videos with this message as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) Similar claims have been made elsewhere on TikTok. Text with another video states: ""The Pfizer vaccine is not an approved FDA vaccine it's only approved for emergency use for a third dose.""  The claim that the Pfizer vaccine is not approved is wrong. During public health emergencies, the FDA has the legal power to grant emergency use authorization to certain products if they meet specific criteria and when there’s no adequate, approved and available alternative to treat the malady. That’s what happened when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in early 2020 and there weren’t any approved vaccines for it. The FDA granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in December 2020 and to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in February 2021. FDA approval, meanwhile, depends on more substantial evidence that the product is effective and that its benefits outweigh its risks. In a news release on Aug. 23 that was headlined, ""FDA Approves First COVID-19 Vaccine,"" the FDA announced its approval of the Pfizer vaccine to people age 16 and over.  Perhaps adding to the confusion, the FDA announcement noted that Pfizer would now market the vaccine under the name Comirnaty. It also noted that the vaccine is still covered only by the emergency use authorization for people ages 12 to 15 and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. But there is no question that the Pfizer vaccine has received FDA’s approval. While the Pfizer vaccine ""and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,"" the FDA announcement said.  ""While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated.""

United States’ gun deaths are among highest in the world, but only the highest by one measure
","Is the United States so awash in guns that gun violence has become a public health crisis?  Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told CNN in a late August interview that she wants the agency to treat gun violence that way.  State Sen. Melissa Agard, D-Madison, is on board, issuing a Sept. 2, 2021 news release that hailed the agency for ""acknowledging the stark reality of too many lives lost each day.""  She went on to make this claim:  ""The fact is, no other country on the planet witnesses the number of gun deaths that we do here in the United States, and it’s not even close."" Is Agard right? When asked for backup, Agard’s staff pointed us to various studies examining the level of gun violence in the United States and in other countries, including studies on mass shootings, gun ownership, and the number of children shot and killed. For instance according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study, about four in 10 Americans say they either own a gun or live in a home with guns -- the highest level among the nations surveyed.  But Agard’s claim was about gun deaths, not gun ownership. And the way she phrased it -- flat out most in the world, without any qualifications -- means she is a bit off. Let’s start with the raw numbers. According to the World Population Review ""Gun Deaths By Country 2021"" report,  Brazil topped the list of the most gun deaths, with a total of 43,200 out of the 250,000 deaths worldwide. The United States had the second-highest number of gun deaths with 37,200.  The report noted that in the U.S., mass shootings receive a great deal of media attention, however, they account for a small number of overall gun violence deaths. So, by that measure, Agard is close -- the U.S. ranks second, but is certainly not ""far and away"" in first. Of course, countries are of various sizes. So, what about deaths as a proportion of the population?  There Agard fares even worse. A March 24, 2021 NPR article cited data from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and noted ""the U.S. has the 32nd-highest rate of deaths from gun violence in the world: 3.96 deaths per 100,000 people in 2019."" At the top of the list were a series of Central and South American countries, starting with El Salvador (36.77 per 100,000), followed by Venezuela (33.27), Guatemala (29.06), Colombia (26.36) and Brazil (21.92 per 100,000.)  Other high-ranking countries included the Bahamas, Honduras and Mexico. Researchers noted that a large factor in gun violence in Central America and the Caribbean is a high level of gangs and drug trafficking. Venezuela, meanwhile, has struggled with political unrest and economic problems. The report, released in 2020, noted that deaths from gun violence can be rare in many low-income countries — such as Tajikistan and Gambia, which saw 0.18 deaths and 0.22 deaths, respectively, per 100,000 people. But wealthy Asian countries such as Singapore (0.01), Japan (0.02) and South Korea (0.02) have the absolute lowest rates — along with China, also at 0.02. So, by this measure, Agard is way off. What happens if you narrow the examination to countries that are larger, or more developed?  In a March 2021 article, the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation focused strictly on gun homicides (so, not including gun-related suicides) among 64 high-income countries and territories. The U.S. ranked 8th with two U.S. territories -- Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands -- coming in first and third. (Bahamas was second). When the institute narrowed it further, and looked at high-income countries and territories with populations of 10 million or more, the U.S. did come out on top. United States 4.12 per 100,000 population Chile 1.82 Canada 0.5 Portugal 0.4 Italy 0.35 Greece 0.35 Belgium 0.34 France 0.32 Sweden 0.25 Netherlands 0.23 So, by this specific measure, the U.S. was on top, and far ahead of the next countries. But, of course, Agard did not specify that measure. She spoke in the most general terms. Agard said ""the fact is, no other country on the planet witnesses the number of gun deaths that we do here in the United States, and it’s not even close."" The U.S. does top the list when only high-income developed nations with populations of 10 million or more are considered.  However, Agard is off by a bit when looking at raw numbers, and off by a whole lot when looking at gun-related deaths as a share of the population.  For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2021/sep/17/melissa-agard/united-states-gun-deaths-are-among-highest-world-o/

Does Christina Bohannan want to abolish law enforcement? No
","Campaigning has already begun in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District, which freshman Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, won by six votes in 2020. As the 2022 election season is ramping up, Miller-Meeks shared a statement about her challenger, state Rep. Christina Bohannan, D-Iowa City, claiming Bohannan supports abolishing law enforcement.  ""I support law enforcement. My opponent wants to abolish them,"" Miller-Meeks tweeted on Sept. 8.  PolitiFact looked into this statement to see if the Democratic congressional-hopeful favors abolishing the police, based on the information Miller-Meeks provided and Bohannan’s record as a state legislator.  Miller-Meeks cited a piece by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative outlet, in her tweet.  The Free Bacon reports that Bohannan donated to a Facebook fundraiser in 2019 for the Prairielands Freedom Fund to reunite families by freeing imprisoned immigrants held on bond. The Prairielands Freedom Fund provides bond and bail to free immigrants from detention, their website states. Organization leaders support abolishing detention and prison. The group’s website focuses on immigration but says it started to pay pretrial bonds in 2020 for protesters in the aftermath of George Floyd’s and Breonna Taylor’s deaths at the hands of police officers.  Groups have increasingly organized these types of payments because of concerns that poor people are routinely held for long detentions before being found guilty of a crime, while people with means quickly pay their way out.  In an interview with PolitiFact, Miller-Meeks said she believes where someone gives their money shows an insight to who they are as a person.  ""When you contribute to organizations like that you’re supporting the underlying philosophies,"" she said.  Bohannan told PolitiFact, however, that she did not know the mission of the Prairielands Freedom Fund when she donated, and that she donated to support a friend’s birthday fundraiser. She commented, though, on the fund’s Facebook post, ""Great idea for a fundraiser. I was glad to contribute — thanks for organizing it."" The Bohannan campaign told PolitiFact Bohannan gave $60.  ""I do not support abolishing the police. I never have, I never will,"" Bohannan said in a PolitiFact Iowa interview. ""As a law professor for over two decades, I have dedicated my career to standing up for the rule of law, and I do not support abolishing law enforcement."" In an Iowa House Debate on Senate File 342 — which ultimately passed into law, increasing penalties for protestors — Bohannan said she would be a no vote because the bill would undermine public trust for law enforcement when it needed to be rebuilt, subject young people and other protesters to harm, and prevent local enforcement from exercising discretion in how to respond.   ""I do support law enforcement and I will be a no on this bill, because I also support other things, including the right to protest for racial justice and for other issues,"" Bohannan said in debate. ""And I really think this bill unnecessarily pits law enforcement against groups like Black Lives Matter and other protesters just at a time when we need to be bringing all of these groups together.""  In her statement she said she supported some elements of the bill that provided benefits and sick leave to law enforcement, but that those measures were combined with other sections she said were problematic.  Bohannan also co-authored a Press Citizen opinion column with Iowa City Councilor Janice Weiner criticizing Republicans for limiting local discretion for law enforcement.  ""A local government found in violation would be denied state funds for the next fiscal year. In other words, the bill effectively defunds both law enforcement and municipal operations for exercising discretion they have always had,"" the piece reads.  Miller-Meeks said Bohannan wants to abolish law enforcement. She supports her statement with The Washington Free Beacon article and her explanation that where someone puts their money reflects their values. The donation, however, was to a bail and bond project, not a law enforcement abolishment plan. Bohannan has made statements on the Iowa House floor and in an op-ed, saying she supports law enforcement, which PolitiFact finds to be more relevant than the 2019 Facebook donation to the Prairielands Freedom Fund.  For these reasons, we rate the claim that Bohannan supports abolishing law enforcement False.",/factchecks/2021/sep/17/mariannette-miller-meeks/does-christina-bohannan-want-abolish-law-enforceme/

Looking at how Hurricane Ida compares with other hurricanes in U.S. history
","Hurricane Ida killed dozens of people and caused flooding and damage in Louisiana and beyond as heavy rains inundated the Northeast, but some people on social media don’t think it’s getting the infamous credit it deserves.  ""Ida was THE strongest hurricane to ever strike anywhere in the United States,"" reads a screenshot of a post that’s being shared widely online.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to the National Hurricane Center about the claim. Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesperson for the center, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told us it’s not true.  ""Hurricane Ida, at 150 mph, is tied with several other hurricanes (including 2020’s Laura) as the 5th strongest hurricane in terms of wind speed at the time of landfall onto the U.S. coastline,"" Feltgen said in an email.  The top four? The Labor Day Hurricane, which made landfall in Florida in 1935, before hurricanes were given people’s names; Hurricane Camille, which made landfall in Mississippi in 1969; Hurricane Andrew, which made landfall in Florida in 1992; and Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Florida in 2018, he said.  News coverage reflects this.  On Sept. 1, USA Today reported a story with this headline: ""Ida was one of the strongest hurricanes to hit US mainland. Here are some stronger ones.""  ""There are many rankings determining a hurricane’s strength, ranging from its death toll, sustained wind speed or atmospheric pressure and winds at landfall,"" the newspaper said. ""When it comes to winds at landfall, Ida’s 150-mph winds tied it with other previous hurricanes as the fifth strongest hurricane to ever hit the United States’ mainland."" The Washington Post reported that Ida and two other hurricanes — Last Island Hurricane in 1856 and Hurricane Laura — had the strongest winds to ever hit Louisiana, but it, too, noted that it was tied as the fifth-strongest storm to make landfall anywhere in the country based on wind speed. The Associated Press also reported that Ida tied with another hurricane, 2007’s Humberto, for the most rapid intensification in the day before landfall; Ida was listed at 85 mph 26 hours before landfall.  Meteorologists also rank hurricanes by central pressure, according to the AP — the lower the barometric pressure, the stronger the storm. By that measure, Ida tied for the ninth strongest storm on landfall.  ""While not quite record-setting,"" the AP said, ""Ida is among some of the strongest and fastest intensifying storms in more than 150 years of hurricane records.""  It’s just not the strongest to strike anywhere in the United States, as recent social media posts have claimed.  The posts also made the case that members of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, better known as the Hurricane Hunters of the U.S. Air Force Reserve, couldn’t collect accurate storm data to send to the National Hurricane Center, which then determines a storm’s strength and category. ""Right before Ida made landfall, the Hurricane Hunters plane tried to get readings,"" the posts said. ""They got the north quadrant. Then they got the west-southwest quadrant. Then they flew across the eye… And got the proverbial northeast quadrant…. And then… The hurricane hunters went to the south quadrant… But they had to abandon their mission because the windows on their plane began cracking!!! So no… Uncle Sam’s weather agencies do NOT know how strong Ida was at landfall."" We asked Uncle Sam’s weather agencies about this, too. The National Hurricane Center directed us to the 53rd Air Weather Squadron, and Staff Sgt. Kristen Pittman confirmed that a window did crack during an Aug. 28 flight, forcing the pilots to return to base early.  But there were no maintenance issues during an Aug. 29 mission ""right as the storm was making landfall,"" Pittman said. ""The crew was able to make two passes through the eye before it moved onto land. Once the center of the system is over land, the crews don’t fly through it both for flight safety reasons and because at that point there are generally instruments on the ground that can measure the conditions of the eye."" Pittman also noted that it can take months to finalize a storm’s life cycle.  ""Case in point,"" she said, ""Zeta last year was thought to have made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane. It wasn’t until months later, after looking over all the data, they revealed in the final report for Zeta that it actually reached major hurricane status hitting Louisiana as a Category 3.""  But the argument that the current conclusions about Hurricane Ida are wrong because of a windshield crack doesn’t bear out. And there’s no evidence now to claim that Ida is the strongest storm to ever hit the United States.  We rate these posts False.",/factchecks/2021/sep/17/viral-image/looking-how-hurricane-ida-compares-other-hurricane/

No, COVID wasn’t planned by FEMA to kill thousands and open concentration camps
","A clip from a 2010 episode of the truTV series ""Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura"" has resurfaced on social media, and it’s being used to claim that COVID-19 was planned by the government. The clip, which was posted to TikTok and reshared on Facebook Sept. 9, shows former Minnesota governor and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in Madison, Ga., hiding behind trees next to a plot of land filled with what they called hundreds of thousands of ""plastic coffins."" While looking over the scene, the two men discussed claims that the government was holding these coffins in preparation for a biological pandemic, which would be used to kill thousands of ""dissidents"" and send people into concentration camps owned and operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  ""Officially, they’re plastic grave liners, seven feet long, three feet deep, with lids,"" Ventura is heard narrating as the camera pans to stacks of the black containers. ""The company that makes them says they’re just being stored for people’s pre-needs. Well, who in the hell has a pre-need for this many coffins — unless they’re planning a massacre?""  The episode first aired in November 2010, seven years after Ventura left office. But the new post of the video on Facebook claims that it shows ""proof"" that ""COVID was planned.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The containers were being stored in Madison, but these claims surrounding them are false. And while conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic having been ""planned"" have raged for more than a year, there is no evidence that this is the case.  The containers in the video are called burial vaults, or grave liners, and they’re made by a company called Vantage Product Corp. The vaults are meant to protect interred caskets. They also keep the ground from caving in at burial, said the company’s vice president, Lisa Barlow.  ""The majority of cemeteries across the United States require the use of a burial vault when a body is interred,"" Barlow said.  This isn’t the first time this claim about the caskets being for nefarious purposes has arisen. In 2008, Madison-based newspaper the Morgan County Citizen, debunked the claim and stated that Vantage leased the land and used it to store burial vaults.  Vantage’s then-Vice President of Operations Michael Lacy said that the vaults are stored for people who pre-arrange for their funerals. It’s common practice for people to make their funeral arrangements before death, including selecting a casket and burial vault. ""Once this selection has been made, the local funeral home that has made the arrangements can purchase the burial vault product from Vantage Products and we will store it for them until that person dies,"" Barlow said. She also noted that there were 50,000 vaults stored on the property — far fewer than the hundreds of thousands that Jones had described in the video.  Ventura and Jones, who owns InfoWars, a site known to promote right-wing conspiracy theories, also claimed that Vantage used to be owned by a company that had ties to Halliburton, a Houston-based oil and energy company once led by former Vice President Dick Cheney that held lucrative government contracts during the Iraq War. Ventura and Jones claimed a Halliburton subsidiary was paid $385 million to partner with FEMA to build concentration camps.  A FEMA spokesperson told PolitiFact that the information in the video is ""unequivocally false,"" and that they’ve never contracted with Halliburton to build any type of camp. ""FEMA does not and has not operated concentration camp centers in response to COVID-19 or any other disasters. FEMA’s mission is to help people before, during and after disasters,"" the spokesperson said.  Halliburton did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. PolitiFact investigated similar rumors about FEMA-created COVID-19 camps in 2020, and found them to be baseless. A video shared on Facebook claims to show proof that COVID-19 was planned. It features a 2010 clip of Ventura and Jones discussing a Madison, Ga., plot of land filled with ""plastic coffins,"" which they said were being stored by the government as part of a plan to kill thousands in a biological pandemic and open FEMA concentration camps.  The containers are burial vaults used to put caskets in when they’re interred in the ground. They are being stored for people who made burial arrangements before death. And there is no evidence they are linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Old video about Apple update unrelated to new security fix
","""New Apple update,"" reads the text in a video shared on Instagram on Sept. 15. It shows what looks like an Aug. 6 Associated Press headline that says ""Apple to scan U.S. iPhones for images"" and text from an Aug. 23 article in the Independent.  ""Apple is now going to be able to see all of your photos and here’s what you need to know,"" a voice in the video says. ""The new Apple update means that Apple will be scanning your photos, messages and anything you tell Siri. And if Apple finds anything bad or related to CP a real human will manually review your stuff."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s untangle what’s going on here.  First of all, the information in the video is unrelated to the emergency software updates that Apple issued on Sept. 13 after security researchers found a flaw that left devices vulnerable to spyware. Second, the AP headline that appears in the video appears to have been truncated.  When we searched for that Aug. 6 headline, we found a similar one with the same bylines: ""Apple to scan U.S. iPhones for images of child sexual abuse."" The earliest archived version of this story that we found, captured on Aug. 5, shows the same headline.  The AP story reported a plan that Apple had announced to scan U.S. iPhones for images of child sexual abuse. Under the plan, if the tool designed to detect such images found a match, they would then be reviewed by a human. If the human confirmed that the images were child pornography — presumably the ""CP"" referred to in the video — the user’s account would be disabled and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children would be notified.  Apple also planned to scan users’ encrypted messages for sexually explicit content as a child safety measure, the AP said. Why? According to the AP, Apple had ""been under government pressure for years to allow for increased surveillance of encrypted data"" and that ""coming up with the new security measures required Apple to perform a delicate balancing act between cracking down on the exploitation of children while keeping its high-profile commitment to protecting the privacy of its users."" On Aug. 23, the Independent reported that Apple had released ""yet more details on its new photo-scanning features.""  This paragraph from the story appears in the video: ""Earlier this month, Apple announced that it would be adding three new features to iOS, all of which are intended to fight against child sexual exploitation and the distribution of abuse imagery. One adds new information to Siri and search, another checks messages sent to children to see if they might contain inappropriate images, and the third compares photos on an iPhone with a database of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and alerts Apple if it is found.""  As both the AP and Independent reported, the plans were controversial, alarming some privacy experts. And on Sept. 3, nearly two weeks before this video was posted on Instagram, Apple announced that it had ""decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.""  Apple initially said that these changes would be part of updates to its operating software, but those changes have been delayed.  They also are separate from the update that was announced and widely reported on Sept. 13.  This post conflates the two by sharing a seemingly old video with old news on the heels of an announcement of a news, separate update.  While there was an update planned that would scan iPhone images, as the video in the Instagram post says, that update has been delayed and is unrelated to a more recent update announced to improve security on Apple devices.  That context is important, and missing in this case.  We rate this post Half True.",/factchecks/2021/sep/16/viral-image/old-video-about-apple-update-unrelated-new-securit/

Wis. GOP Atty. Gen. candidate misses mark in repeating previously 'Mostly True' claim
","Repeat a story -- or fact -- often enough and you eventually mess it up.  That’s what appears to have happened with Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney, who is running for the Republican nomination for attorney general, and has repeatedly made  variations of this claim: ""I'm the only front-line prosecutor in this race that's actually used the resources of the Wisconsin Crime Lab in the prosecution of cases."" He’s technically accurate, but more clarification was needed (more on that below). We have rated that claim Mostly True. Now for the messed up version. On Sept. 9, 2021, Toney issued a news release announcing the endorsement of La Crosse County Sheriff Jeff Wolf. The news release said this of Toney: ""He is the only candidate in the Wisconsin Attorney General race with experience as a prosecutor."" As we noted in our earlier fact-check, incumbent Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, is a former federal prosecutor in Baltimore, a position he held from 2010 to 2014. In that role, well, he prosecuted criminals, such as murderers and drug traffickers. As attorney general, meanwhile, Kaul oversees the Department of Justice’s more than 800 employees, which includes about 20 prosecutors (and, by the way, also includes the state crime lab that Toney more regularly references). Those prosecutors cover cases ranging from fraud to drug trafficking to homicides. When asked about the new version of the claim, Toney left us a voicemail that blamed a ""drafting error.""  The campaign then issued a new version of the release that specified that Toney is the only candidate with experience as ""a front-line Wisconsin prosecutor."" In short, the battle of biographies continues.  In a news release, Toney’s campaign claimed: ""He is the only candidate in the Wisconsin Attorney General race with experience as a prosecutor.""  That’s flatly wrong. Indeed, Toney should well know that precisely because he has taken such  pains to frame his other statements regarding his experience much more narrowly, and much more correctly.

Biden plan to require more bank account reporting to IRS is still a proposal
","If a Biden administration proposal now being considered is adopted, financial institutions would be required to report more information on the accounts of everyday Americans to the IRS. The stated goal is to collect taxes from rich individuals and businesses on income that is earned but not reported. The proposal, however, would affect more than just rich people, with disclosure requirements that cover the vast majority of bank, loan and investment accounts. Even so, a headline widely shared on Instagram from InfoWars, the conspiracy-oriented website run by Alex Jones, contains only an element of truth. The headline states: ""Biden’s Treasury Dept. Declares IRS Will Monitor Transactions of ALL U.S. Accounts Over $600.""  The Infowars article under that headline goes on to make a more far-reaching claim: that the IRS will ""audit virtually all financial transactions of Americans with bank accounts holding at least $600.""Similar claims have been made on other social media.  The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Treasury Department has made no such declaration. For now, the proposal to tighten bank disclosure requirements is just that — a proposal. And while it would feed more financial data to the IRS, it does not call for IRS audits of virtually all financial transactions. The Treasury Department made the proposal in May 2021. The Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees could adopt it as part of budget reconciliation legislation they are considering. Under the measure, financial institutions would be required to annually report gross inflows and outflows from all business and personal accounts  — including bank, loan and investment accounts — if the inflows and outflows of an account total at least $600 in a year, or if the account has a fair market value of at least $600. So, for example, if you had at least $600 in your bank account, the bank would be required to report the amounts of any debits or credits to that account to the IRS. If the debits and credits that flow through the account add up to at least $600 — including deposited paychecks or electronic payments through smartphone apps tied to the account — those totals would have to be reported, too. Under the measure, the banks would report only the total inflows and outflows, but no details on individual transactions.  In making the proposal, the Treasury Department said the IRS estimates that for business income outside of large corporations, the ""tax gap"" — the difference between taxes that are owed and collected — is $166 billion a year. The Treasury says the focus of the proposal would be on ""higher earners who do not fully report their tax liabilities."" The American Bankers Association opposes the measure. ""The proposal would create a significant burden on small businesses and community banks and add no discernible value to tax enforcement,"" the group said in a Sept. 7 letter to the House and Senate committee leaders, adding that ""it is far from clear that requiring banks to report on every single customer financial account with gross inflows and outflows above $600 — creating a mountain of new data — will lead to better tax compliance."" Chuck Marr, senior director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the proposal would help identify business and partnership owners who report relatively low income to the IRS but have millions of dollars flowing through their accounts. ""It just helps the IRS get better at finding noncompliance, finding people who are cheating,"" he said.  Marr said setting a low threshold of $600 would make it harder for tax dodgers to set up multiple accounts and avoid having the activity in those accounts reported to the IRS. An Infowars headline widely shared on Instagram stated that ""Biden’s Treasury Department declares IRS will monitor"" all accounts over $600. The Treasury has made no such declaration. The department has made a proposal that Congress is considering. Under the proposal, financial institutions would be required to annually report the total inflows and outflows from bank, loan and investment accounts, if the total is at least $600 in a year, or if the account’s value is at least $600. The headline contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Human error explains votes that ‘disappeared’ in CNN coverage of California recall
","CNN among other news organizations projected that California Gov. Gavin Newsom will hold onto his job after an election to decide whether he should be recalled.  According to unofficial election results posted on California’s secretary of state website, nearly 64% of voters opposed recalling Newsom compared with about 36% who voted yes.  Those numbers will change before the results are certified on Oct. 22 as more mail-in and provisional ballots are tallied, but Newsom’s lead wasn’t in question.  Still, unfounded claims of election fraud loomed as people headed to the polls on Sept. 14.  In one video from that evening that’s being shared on social media, a man recorded his television, which was tuned to CNN.  The screen shows a graphic that says: ""Should Gov. Newsom be recalled?"" The graphic then reflected that 4,530,002 ""no"" votes had been counted — 67.1% of the votes tallied by that point — and 2,225,915 ""yes"" votes had been counted, or 32.9%. In the bottom right corner of the graphic it says ""52% estimated vote,"" meaning that these totals only account for about half of all ballots cast in the race.   The man recording the screen then zooms in on a similar, smaller graphic with the same information in the bottom right corner of the screen.  ""2.25 — watch,"" he says. The graphic then changes and some of the numbers change. The ""yes"" votes go from 2,225,915 to 1,874,206, and from 32.9% of the vote to 29.3% of the vote. The number of ""no"" votes, meanwhile, don’t change, and the percentage of ""no"" votes increases to 70.7%. The estimated vote changed from 52% to 49%. ""1.874,"" the man says. ""Where did they go? 400,000 votes just disappeared? Wow."" The man wasn’t seeing things, and the recording of the CNN broadcast is authentic.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) CNN declined to comment for this story. But it got those numbers from Edison Research, a polling firm that provides elections data to CNN among other news organizations.  Rob Farbman, the firm’s executive vice president, told PolitiFact that Edison relies on different sources including state data and reporters hired to collect vote tallies in person at county elections offices.  A reporter hired by Edison who was stationed at an office in Santa Clara County called the firm and accidentally said that about 350,000 votes there were in favor of recalling Newsom. In reality, that number reflected all tallied votes in that county, no and yes votes combined. The mistake resulted in CNN wrongly reporting that there were about 350,000 extra votes to recall Newsom.  ""This error was entered at 11:19pm ET and corrected 2 minutes later at 11:21pm ET,"" Farbman said in an email. The vote ‘drop’ was taking out the error and putting in the vote being reported by Santa Clara County.""  The estimated vote changed from 52% to 49% because when the correction was made, ""the total number of votes tabulated declined by 350,000 votes and estimated percent of the total vote currently tabulated declined,"" he said.

Fact-checking DeSantis on COVID-19 natural immunity
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing back against vaccine mandates, particularly for people who already have been infected. During a stop in Gainesville, DeSantis accused city officials of threatening to ""destroy"" the jobs of city workers. The Gainesville City Commission has given employees until Oct. 31 to get fully vaccinated. At an Aug. 5 meeting, the city attorney seemed to take a hard line, saying ""You have a choice. If you don’t want to get vaccinated, then your choice is to seek employment elsewhere."" DeSantis said mandates ignore the natural immunity many first responders gained from getting the disease earlier in the pandemic. ""The ones that have recovered have very strong immunity,"" DeSantis said Sept. 13. ""That’s very clear from every study that’s been done."" At a Tampa event later the same day, DeSantis mentioned a study out of Israel. ""They compared the protection from a previous infection versus the Pfizer protection. They found that Pfizer did provide protection, but the natural immunity was far stronger,"" he said. We looked into the studies on natural versus vaccine-driven immunity, and natural immunity delivers a lot of protection. But researchers also see some signs that the best protection comes from a 1-2 punch of natural immunity plus one dose of vaccine. Importantly, natural immunity comes at a much higher personal risk than vaccination, and verifying natural immunity is more technically complex than verifying vaccination status. Israeli researchers looked at thousands of medical records. In one part of the study, they compared over 16,000 patients who were previously infected and never vaccinated against another 16,000 who had only received the Pfizer vaccine. They factored in age, gender, health and when they were infected or vaccinated. They found that the vaccinated group that did not report any prior infection was much more at risk of catching COVID-19 later on than those who had already been infected but not vaccinated. There was a 13-fold higher risk of a breakthrough infection compared with reinfection. ""This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer-lasting and stronger protection against infection,"" the Aug. 25 study said. They noted that the period they examined included the time when the delta variant was dominant in Israel. This study was released immediately, and still needs to be peer reviewed. Several factors might have shaped the results. Researchers might have missed a number of asymptomatic infections because those people would have less reason to be tested. And there was no control for social distancing and mask wearing habits that would affect the risk of infection. New work out of Rockefeller University adds weight to the Israeli findings. It focuses on the body’s molecular level defenses against the virus, especially the memory B cell. Long after the initial antibody response fades, these cells hold on to the blueprint of the virus and when they see it in the body months later, they crank up the antibodies to crush it. Both vaccinations and natural exposure build memory B cells. But the Rockefeller team found that the memory B cells produced through natural infection are more robust. They continue to evolve over the months, while the vaccination-driven memory B cells stopped changing after about two months. When facing variants, the naturally occurring memory B cells delivered better protection. The research is preliminary and future work might change the picture. But for now, there’s reasonable evidence that someone who recovered from the virus has protection that’s at least as good as that from a vaccine. What DeSantis didn’t mention is that the people who recover and then get vaccinated seem to get higher protection against the virus. In the Israel study, the effect was modest, but visible. ""Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the delta variant,"" researchers wrote. An August CDC study of Kentucky patients who were infected by COVID-19 in 2020 found that by mid-2021, the ones who never got vaccinated were more than twice as likely to get reinfected. However, the CDC researchers noted, vaccinated people might be less likely to get tested, which would drive down the reported reinfection numbers. A study published in April 2021 from a team at Oregon Health and Science University found that vaccinations boosted the antibody response against virus variants among people with natural immunity. Another study based on a small number of health care workers in Maryland reached a similar conclusion, saying those who had been previously infected benefited from a single dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. On the downside, a British study published in the Lancet reported that people who were vaccinated after they had been infected were more likely to report side effects such as headache or fever than those who hadn’t been infected before. There were nearly no reports of side effects after one week. We lack a clear picture on the variation among people in the strength of natural immunity, and how long it lasts, especially as variants emerge. As is always true with COVID-19, the research is ongoing and the findings we see today might be supplanted by new work. DeSantis’ overall stance on vaccinations has become less clear over time. When the vaccines first arrived, he promoted them heavily, especially for the elderly. Now, he has pushed back against the mandates coming from the White House, saying Washington lacks the legal authority. At his event in Gainesville, he stood silent as city workers came to the podium and spread clear falsehoods about the safety of the vaccines. One man said the vaccines change a person’s RNA. DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw told the Tampa Bay Times that the governor supports vaccines. ""Getting vaccinated is a smart choice to protect yourself from severe COVID outcomes,"" Pushaw told PolitiFact. But doctors worry the focus on natural immunity dilutes the pro-vaccine message. The lead author of the Rockefeller research underscored that relying on natural immunity is a high-risk strategy. ""While a natural infection may induce maturation of antibodies with broader activity than a vaccine does, a natural infection can also kill you,"" said immunology center director Michel  Nussenzweig in an August university article.  Dr. Matthew Laurens of the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health echoed that point. ""Vaccination is the best prevention,"" Laurens told PolitiFact Aug. 31. ""This has been clearly shown in multiple prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trials, which are the very highest quality for clinical studies."" DeSantis said people who have recovered from COVID-19 have very strong protection. The studies are preliminary, but they do find that surviving COVID-19 leaves people with robust immunity, even stronger than immunity gained through vaccination. However, some of the same research found that giving a single vaccine dose to those who had recovered provided the best protection. DeSantis’ point is accurate but needs more context.

Ivermectin was approved by the FDA to treat some diseases, not COVID-19
","Americans who have turned to ivermectin to treat COVID-19 have drawn both ridicule and support.  One recent social media post, seemingly in the latter camp, argues that the drug ""has been FDA approved for human use since 1996.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is true that ivermectin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration that year — but not to treat the coronavirus. The drug was approved for strongyloidiasis, a disease caused by a roundworm, and onchocerciasis, or river blindness, which is caused by a parasitic worm.  The drug was approved for humans under the brand name Stromectol, National Geographic reported, and since then it’s been recognized as a safe treatment for several tropical diseases caused by parasites. In 2015, two scientists even won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of ivermectin and its use to treat diseases caused by parasites. But unlike, say, river blindness, COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus, not by parasites. And as PolitiFact recently reported in a story exploring ivermectin, there’s no conclusive evidence that ivermectin is effective against COVID-19.  Indeed, it carries physical risks, and the FDA warns against using it, saying that while ""ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses to treat some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea … the FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical attention, including hospitalization, after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for livestock.""  The science on whether ivermectin intended for humans could help treat COVID-19 is limited and mixed. Some studies, many with small sample sizes, have suggested it can, and others have shown no significant impact.   The World Health Organization advises against using ivermectin with COVID-19 patients ""except in the context of a clinical trial"" because there’s ""very low-certainty evidence"" that the drug works. Such clinical trials are ongoing.  So while ivermectin has been approved by the FDA for human use since 1996, the FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19.  And, the ivermectin products intended for animals are different from the products approved for humans. ""Use of animal ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in humans is dangerous,"" the FDA says.  The statement in the Facebook post is accurate but needs additional clarification.

No, Wis. Gov. Evers did not wait to send help to Kenosha during unrest
","A year after the violent and fatal protests that took place in Kenosha, and a year before the 2022 election, political opponents are focusing on Gov. Tony Evers and his response to the crisis that left dozens of buildings burned and two dead.  The critique, in short: He did too little, too late. Most recently, Republican Rebecca Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor, made such a claim as she launched her bid Sept 9, 2021 to take on Evers, a first-term Democrat. RELATED: Kleefisch attacks Evers over Kenosha but also once said 'far too many shots' were fired in police shooting In most cases, the criticism is presented as opinion. But a recent television and digital ad from Empower Wisconsin, a right-wing super PAC that describes itself as ""Wisconsin's premier information hub,"" got its facts jumbled.  So, we thought it was worth a fact-check to examine just what happened in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, and the protests that almost immediately followed. The ad features Kimberly Warner, a Kenosha resident and business owner, though on the screen she is identified only by her first name. At times, she speaks directly to the camera. At other points, there are images of burned-out buildings and words that reinforce her series of criticisms of Evers.  Most notable is this claim: ""It took the loss of lives before help finally came."" Since the ad is from Empower Wisconsin, that’s who we are fact-checking here. Is the group right that Evers did not act until people had died? When asked for evidence, Empower Wisconsin did not provide any specific details, but the comments from spokesperson Stephan Thompson made clear they were talking about the response by Evers to help sought by local leaders.  Said Thompson: ""For three straight nights, Kenosha was burning. Local and federal leaders were pleading for help and Evers ignored it."" Let’s start with the basics. The protests broke out Aug. 23, 2020, hours after Jacob Blake, 29, was shot from behind at close range seven times by Kenosha Officer Rusten Sheskey. The officer had responded to a call about a domestic incident a little after 5 p.m. A bystander caught much of the incident on video, which showed Blake walking away from several officers and trying to get into an SUV, with three of his children inside, before he was shot. Blake survived, but was paralyzed from the waist down. Prosecutors decided not to charge Sheskey. Blake has filed a lawsuit against Sheskey. Two nights later, on Aug. 25, 17-year-old Illinois resident Kyle Rittenhouse, arrived at the ongoing protests with an AR-15 and a self-described mission to protect property in the city. Rittenhouse ultimately shot three people, killing two and wounding the  third -- incidents also caught largely on video. He is scheduled to go to trial in November. The question at hand is what happened between those two incidents. ""The fact of the matter is, the state and Governor Evers worked closely with local leaders to provide assistance and fulfill every request they had,"" said Sam Roecker, Evers’ communication director. What happened in Kenosha? Let’s look at the timeline. This review is based on past articles and fact-checks, which have explored this sequence in detail. Sheskey shot Blake at around 5:15 p.m. on Aug. 23, 2020. Soon after the first stories were posted, crowds began to form. This was in the middle of a summer of protests over police brutality following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis, who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes. At around 3 a.m. on Aug. 24, Kenosha Sheriff David Beth submitted a formal request to the state, calling for support from the Wisconsin National Guard. Later that day, at 3:05 p.m. — less than 24 hours after Jacob Blake was shot — Evers authorized 125 members of the National Guard to support local law enforcement agencies. Neighboring jurisdictions had provided more than 100 law enforcement officers the night before -- a presence that would continue. On Aug. 25, 2020 at 2:33 p.m., the governor doubled the number of National Guard members to 250 troops.  Earlier that day, the Trump administration spoke to Evers (first Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, then President Donald Trump himself). Evers declined their offers of federal help in Kenosha. That night, protestors were not met just by law enforcement, but groups of self-described militia members, who said they were there at the request of business owners. Rittenhouse killed 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum and 26-year-old Anthony Huber and injured 26-year-old Gaige Grosskreutz at around 11:45 p.m on Aug. 25.  By that time, the aforementioned 250 National Guard troops had been sent to Kenosha, so the ad is way off base when it claims state help did not come until after the deaths. The following night, Evers increased troop numbers to 500.  After more talks with Meadows, the governor also accepted assistance in the form of federal troops from the Trump administration. In an earlier fact-check, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said as of Aug. 31 that was the only federal government assistance provided. To be sure, we are not checking claims about whether Evers did enough, or did it soon enough. Kleefisch and others are signaling that this will be a major point in the 2022 campaign. Voters will hear plenty from both sides to sway their views. Here we are looking narrowly at this specific claim, which mangles the timing of what happened. In an ad, Empower Wisconsin said of Evers and Kenosha violence: ""It took the loss of lives before help finally came."" But the timeline shows Evers had sent in 250 National Guard troops in the days before the night Rittenhouse shot and killed the two men. We rate this claim False.  ",/factchecks/2021/sep/15/empower-wisconsin/no-wis-gov-evers-did-not-wait-send-help-kenosha-du/
