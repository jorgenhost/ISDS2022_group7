Canada did not ban use of ‘Let’s go Brandon,’ as fake memo claimed
","A Canadian agency banned government workers from using the phrase ""Let’s go Brandon,"" a chant used to mock President Joe Biden, according to a letter being passed around on the internet. The only problem: The letter is fake. The alleged memo was formatted as a ""formal notification"" sent by Shared Services Canada, an agency for government technology support. It said that government workers who used the ""Let’s go Brandon"" slogan risked being fired ""without recourse or labour union representation."" ""The uses of colloquialism or sayings with intended double meaning or offense are strictly prohibited in all means of correspondence or communication,"" it said. ""Specifically, the use of the wording ‘let’s go Brandon’ and any variation thereof under any circumstance is banned.""  A fake letter allegedly from Shared Services Canada circulated online. The phrase ""Let’s go Brandon"" has become popular with conservatives in recent weeks as a euphemism for ""F--- Joe Biden."" The anti-Biden slogan was born out of a NASCAR interview from early October, when an NBC Sports reporter was interviewing driver Brandon Brown and mistook the crowd’s chants of ""F--- Joe Biden"" for chants of ""Let’s go Brandon."" But in a statement, Shared Services Canada said ""this message was not issued by Shared Services Canada and it does not reflect departmental policy.""  Several elements of the letter should have given that away, according to the National Post, a Canadian news outlet, and AFP Fact Check. The letter included one sentence that was missing punctuation, and the letterhead was placed in a different position on the paper than on most other government communications. The fabricated letter appeared to originate with an anonymous Twitter account that posted it on Oct. 17 and claimed it came ""from a Canadian friend,"" the National Post reported.  It spread further after it was shared by Peter McCaffrey, the president of a libertarian think tank in Alberta, Canada, in a tweet that received over 14,500 likes and 4,700 retweets.  The memo also circulated in stories from conservative websites like the Daily Wire, as well as on Facebook and Instagram, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  ""The Canadian government threatens to fire any government employee who uses ‘Let's Go Brandon’ in communications,"" one widespread Facebook post said. McCaffrey acknowledged in a follow-up tweet the next day that the letter was ""not genuine,"" but the second tweet got far less engagement than the original. Twitter also started marking posts sharing the letter as ""manipulated media,"" with a link to several fact-checks debunking it.

Fact-checking false claims about FEMA workers, vaccine mandates and fired health employees

There’s still no evidence a Tennessee nurse who fainted after getting the vaccine is dead
","It’s been 10 months since Tiffany Dover, a nurse manager at Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn., received her first Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine dose. She fainted shortly after she got the shot and was in the middle of a television interview when it happened. After recovering a few minutes later, Dover told local news outlets that she felt a little disoriented when it happened but was fine immediately afterward. She has an overactive vagal response, Dover explained, which causes her to pass out from even the slightest pain. Still, clips of her fainting spread far and wide online accompanied by claims that it was proof that the vaccine wasn’t safe. Then, a more insidious rumor started to gain steam: that Dover actually died from the shot, and everyone was covering it up.  Now, despite countless fact-checks, statements from hospital officials and comments from her family, there are still scores of internet users who continue to push the conspiracy theory. ""Do you remember the nurse in TN who passed out live on camera?"" a woman says in an Oct. 17 Instagram video. ""Well nobody covered what happened to her next. So watch this next video and find out what happened to her next. This is insane what they’re trying to cover."" The next clip shows a man repeating the details about Dover’s fainting episode before saying, ""And, well, what they didn’t tell you, is that she died that day, on the 17th of December. She is dead. They covered it up. They paid the family off."" There is no evidence that this is true. The hospital has repeatedly responded to these rumors and confirmed to PolitiFact again on Oct. 20 that Dover is alive and is still an employee there.  In the months since the false claim first surfaced, journalists have documented intense and bizarre harassment toward Dover, her family, and the hospital, insisting she died when she didn't.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Regarding the claim that Dover ""died that day,"" there is video evidence that Dover recovered from the Dec. 17 incident. ""I have a history of having an overactive vagal response, and so with that if I have pain from anything, hangnail or if I stub my toe, I can just pass out,"" Dover told WRCBtv a few minutes after she fainted.  She added: ""It just, you know, hit me all of a sudden, just felt very diaphoretic. I can feel it coming on so I felt a little disoriented. But I feel fine now and the pain in my arm is very minimal actually, but it doesn't take much. I have passed out probably six times in the past six weeks. It’s common for me."" Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital has since confirmed, several times, that Dover is alive and well. The Tennessee Department of Health still lists Dover as a licensed registered nurse. ""Nurse Tiffany Dover appreciates the concern shown for her. She is home and doing well. She asks for privacy for her and her family,"" the hospital said on Twitter on Dec. 19, according to a fact-check by USA Today.  On Dec. 21, multiple news organizations reported that the hospital also shared a video of Dover and her colleagues to prove she was alive, with some holding signs that read ""Nursing Leadership Supports Tiffany"" and ""#CHIMemorialStrong."" Another hospital official told the Associated Press that Dover was feeling well and was working a shift that day. Around the same time, another spokesperson for the hospital said that the organization was ""aware of the multitude of false information circulating on social media about Tiffany Dover,"" and made the video to ""clear up many of the circulating rumors,"" the Daily Beast reported in February. It didn’t matter. Commenters continue to flood her social media accounts to this day with messages like ""RIP angel"" and ""where is Tiffany!!"" because she hasn’t posted recent videos. We were unable to reach Dover, and the hospital has deleted its references to Dover on its social media accounts. But this is hardly evidence that Dover is not alive, given the level of the backlash she and the hospital have been subjected to by those who believe that the facility is somehow covering up her death.  At one point, Dover’s brother-in-law shared an article debunking claims that she was dead and hundreds of people left angry comments like, ""How much money do they pay you all that you post this? She is dead and you know,"" according to reporting by the Daily Beast. Under a similar post by her sister-in-law, which attracted nearly 900 comments, someone wrote, ""Your entire family is disgusting that you don’t let Tiffany speak herself!"" Regarding further ""proof"" presented in these claims, some pointed to screenshots of what they  said was Dover’s death report on SearchQuarry.com and Ancestry.com, neither of which contain official public records or show official death certificates.  When PolitiFact tried to search on SearchQuarry.com, an unreliable public database where the information can only be accessed after purchase, the website repeatedly timed out. An Ancestry.com spokesperson previously confirmed to Reuters that details entered for an individual ""don’t need to be backed up or supported by official sources"" and are not verified by the genealogy company. An Instagram post claims that Tiffany Dover, a Tennessee nurse who was seen fainting after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, is dead. There has been no evidence that Dover died and Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital confirmed to PolitiFact that she is alive and is still an employee. We also found no legitimate record of her death and her nursing license remains active. Several news and fact-checking organizations have repeatedly debunked rumors about her death, citing multiple statements from the hospital and a video that showed Dover alive and well.

Hoax Twitter account sparks false rumor that Desmond Tutu died
","A hoax Twitter account created under the name of an Anglican archbishop from Johannesburg falsely claimed that anti-apartheid leader Archbishop Desmond Tutu died at the age of 90.  ""ATTENTION. The Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg receives now the sad news of the death of our dearest Archbishop Desmond Tutu,"" the fake account, which purported to belong to the Archbishop Stephen Moreo of Johannesburg, tweeted Oct. 20. The rumor spread quickly online, fueled by a flurry of blog sites that shared it and a number of verified Twitter users who reported it as truth.  But in reality, Tutu is still alive. The word of his passing was completely fabricated.  The claim that he died originated on a fake Twitter account that was made by an Italian man known for creating hoax accounts. The account was set up in August and had posted only a few tweets before Oct. 20. After the rumor took off, the account was deleted.  A hoax Twitter account falsely claimed Desmond Tutu died Oct. 20. In a statement on its website, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said the account claiming to be Moreo’s was ""fake"" and denounced the viral rumor that the account started.

""Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is firmly with us, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation has announced categorically."" The organization posted the same statement on Facebook and Twitter, and it also responded directly to the since-deleted tweet from the account claiming to belong to Moreo. In a statement of his own, Moreo also decried the social media reports that quoted him as having said that Tutu had died, calling them ""false and malicious."" Some social media users and journalists captured screenshots of another tweet from the fake Twitter account after it started the Tutu rumor. The tweet, posted before the page was deleted, said, ""This account is a hoax created by Italian journalist Tommaso Debenedetti."" Debenedetti has created several fake accounts over the years, sparking similar false rumors about the deaths of other famous people, such as the writer Cormac McCarthy. The Washington Post reported in 2017 that he typically tweets the same line owning up to the hoaxes he creates after they go viral online. He told the Guardian about his methods in 2012. Reached for comment, Debenedetti confirmed in an email to PolitiFact that he created the fake account in Moreo’s name and posted the hoax about Tutu’s death. ""I did that to show how (it) is easy to spread fake news using social media,"" Debenedetti said. Debenedetti said the fake Moreo account was the same account, with the name and handle changed, that he used to impersonate Tanzanian author Abdulrazak Gurnah and falsely claim that Nigerian author Wole Soyinka had died.

Senate candidate wrongly says NC hospitals are 'most endangered'
","For years now, Democrats in North Carolina have called on the legislature’s Republican majority to expand Medicaid.  Not only would expansion provide healthcare access to more North Carolinians, Democrats say it would also help bail out hospitals in rural parts of the state that are struggling to make ends meet. State Sen. Jeff Jackson brought up ailing hospitals during a forum for Democratic U.S. Senate candidates in Greensboro on Oct. 11. Jackson is one of several Democrats hoping to secure the party’s nomination and win Richard Burr’s Senate seat in 2022, when Burr plans to retire. At the Indivisible NC forum, a moderator asked the candidates what they would do to reduce patient costs associated with going to the emergency department. Erica Smith and Richard Watkins talked about increasing access to preventative healthcare through Medicare For All.  Jackson emphasized the need to help rural hospitals. And he suggested the situation is more dire in North Carolina than most other states in the country. ""The five most-endangered hospitals in the country are all in our state,"" he told the crowd after the 22-minute mark of this video. Is it true that the five most financially vulnerable hospitals are all in North Carolina? Jackson has a point that some of North Carolina’s rural hospitals, specifically, are struggling. In fact, experts say some are financially vulnerable — and are among the most struggling in the nation. But Jackson gave a misleading impression when he suggested they alone are at the top of a list of ""the most endangered,"" or that North Carolina’s situation is worse than other states. Jackson’s campaign said he was referring to a 2020 report by The Chartis Group, a firm that studies healthcare and has analyzed available hospital data. The group developed a statistical model that identifies ""key indicators most likely to impact a hospital’s ability to sustain operations during the critical tipping point window."" Of the 216 hospitals Chartis considered to be the ""most vulnerable,"" six are located in North Carolina. Jackson ""meant to say that six of the most endangered hospitals in the country are in North Carolina,"" campaign spokesman Dylan Arant told PolitiFact NC. Several other states have more hospitals in the ""most vulnerable"" category than North Carolina, including: Texas (41), Oklahoma (17), Tennessee (15), Mississippi (14) Georgia (13), Alabama (12), Kansas (12), and Missouri (11). While researchers specifically mention those states and others for having the worst situations, they don’t single-out the Tar Heel state in their report. North Carolina is only listed among the group’s charts. A newer 2021 report from Chartis shows North Carolina with 15 vulnerable hospitals. It again identified about 10 other states — Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas — with a higher number of vulnerable hospitals than North Carolina. Other states also had higher percentages of vulnerable rural hospitals, as well as rural hospitals with worse financial operating margins. Billy Balfour, spokesman for The Chartis Group, said that while its Center for Rural Health analyzes the financial health of rural hospitals, ""we don’t rank hospitals based on vulnerability nor do we disclose the names of hospitals identified as vulnerable."" We were curious whether any group of experts tracks the financial health of hospitals and ranks them by how ""endangered"" they might be. Representatives for the American Hospital Association, North Carolina Healthcare Association and the National Rural Health Association all said no. Neither does the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit known for its research on healthcare. The University of North Carolina’s Cecil Sheps Center for Health Services Research is another one of the most reputable health research groups in the country. The Sheps Center keeps track of financially-distressed hospitals across the country. But it does not rank hospitals by how ""endangered"" they are, either, said Mark Holmes, the center’s director.  Rural hospitals, particularly in the South, are in more financial trouble than hospitals near urban areas, experts say. And some argue that expanding Medicaid can help. Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a mix of state and federal funding from the Medicaid program provided health coverage for low-income families with dependent children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. Additional funding under ACA, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand their Medicaid coverage to a wider range of people, including low-income adults without children.  North Carolina is one of 12 states that so far has not accepted the additional funding to expand coverage. Hospitals in states that haven’t expanded Medicaid (such as North Carolina) now have higher rates of unrecoverable debt and charity care, according to a 2019 American Hospital Association report. The association found that 80% of rural hospital closures since 2014 have occurred in non-expansion states. ""The pandemic has exacerbated financial challenges for many hospitals, especially for rural hospitals,"" Cynthia Charles, a vice president for North Carolina’s Healthcare Association, told PolitiFact NC. ""Some of them are having to make some difficult financial decisions,"" she said. ""It would help struggling hospitals if the state would expand Medicaid, something being discussed as part of the state budget process."" North Carolina is home to a few hospitals suffering financial distress. In the Sheps Center’s most recent 2019 report on financially-distressed rural hospitals, researchers found that Alabama, Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma each had 16 or more hospitals facing a ""high risk"" of financial distress.  North Carolina has nine rural hospitals at a ""mid-to-high"" risk for financial distress and four at a ""high-level"" risk for financial distress. North Carolina’s total of four hospitals at high-risk was tied for the lowest number among all southern states. ""It is pretty difficult to systematically examine hospitals for their finances,"" said Holmes, the Sheps Center’s director. ""One can use ‘cost reports’ required for all hospitals accepting Medicare, but this is no substitute for knowing the details of the hospital.""  ""Although we track these using (the financial distress index), it’s a model and models are not crystal balls and it would be dangerous to use them that way,"" Holmes said.  Jackson said: ""The five most-endangered hospitals in the country are all in our state."" North Carolina does have financially vulnerable hospitals. A 2020 report from The Chartis Group found six North Carolina hospitals to be among 216 of the nation’s ""most vulnerable."" A Sheps Center also found financially-vulnerable hospitals in North Carolina. But there is no ranking among these hospitals. And, based on available data, it’s inaccurate for Jackson to suggest that the situation is more dire for rural hospitals in North Carolina than it is for those in other states. Jackson’s spokesman acknowledged that Jackson misspoke. What Jackson did say has an element of truth, but certainly leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression.

Are Virginia's school standards the lowest in the nation, as Youngkin says?
","Republican Glenn Youngkin is promising to stiffen academic standards in public schools if he’s elected governor next month. ""Virginia has the lowest standards for math and reading of all 50 states,"" he wrote in a Sept. 2 guest column for The Washington Post.  We fact-checked this often-made Youngkin claim and learned that federal research does show Virginia has the lowest baselines for student proficiency on its standardized tests of all measured states for fourth-grade math and reading and eighth-grade reading. This comparison only measures the rigor of various state standards, however, not how well students are learning. When it comes to performance on standardized national exams, Virginia’s fourth graders rank near the top and its eighth graders rank high in math and at the national average in reading. Youngkin does not offer this important perspective.    Youngkin’s bottom-of-the-barrel claim is based on a 2021 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, a branch of the U.S. Department of Education. The center examined the proficiency standards in each state in 2019 and assigned them ""equivalent scores"" on a 0-to-500 scale. Higher scores mean higher standards. ""The study is intended to help readers understand the myriad state assessment results that are otherwise difficult to compare and to serve a policy need for reliable information that compares state standards,"" the report says. ""The study is not an evaluation of the various state assessments or of the quality of the states’ achievement standards, and the findings should not be interpreted as evidence of deficiencies in state assessments…"" In other words, the study is not judging whether state proficiency standards tests  should be high, low or in the middle. It’s just offering data. The report focuses on reading and math tests in fourth and eighth grades. The equivalent score compares the percentage of students who are deemed proficient on state tests to the percentage that reach the proficiency standard on national tests. Virginia’s exams are called Standards of Learning tests, or SOLs, and are taken by all fourth and eighth graders, as well as some other grades. The national exam is taken by a representative sample of fourth and eight graders in each state. It’s called National Assessment of Education Progress but is better known as the ""Nation’s Report Card."" In fourth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were the lowest among 49 states (excluding New Hampshire). The equivalent score was 200. The median score among states was 224. Tennessee had the highest score at 238. In fourth grade math, Virginia standards were again the lowest among 49 states. The equivalent score was 219. The median was 242. Colorado had the highest score at 257. In eighth grade reading, Virginia’s proficiency standards were lowest among 46 states measured. The equivalent score was 236. The median was 266. Kansas was highest, at 288. Virginia’s standards for eighth grade math were not measured, nor were those of 14 other states. The reason — according to Charles Pyle, director of media relations for the Virginia Department of Education — is that eighth graders take different math classes based on their abilities, so there is not a single standardized math exam for everyone. Pyle said the state’s education department doesn’t dispute the report’s findings. ""We certainly do take note of their comparisons,"" he said. Experts stress that equivalent scores do not evaluate how well students are learning. ""What Virginia considers proficient may not be at the same level of what other states consider proficient,"" said Grady Wilburn, a statistician for the National Center for Education Statistics. ""It doesn’t mean that the students know less than students in other states."" Indeed, Virginia fourth graders in 2019 had the third-highest math score on the national test and the ninth-highest reading score. Virginia eighth graders ranked seventh in math and 30th in reading. Youngkin says Virginia’s public schools have strayed from basic instruction under the last two Democratic governors including Terry McAuliffe, his opponent this year, who led the state from 2014 to 2018. Youngkin says the state’s standardized tests should require students to attain high, aspirational learning levels. Virginia’s proficiency standards for reading were set in 2013 by a state school board appointed by Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell. The math standards were set in 2019 by a state school board appointed by McAuliffe and current Gov. Ralph Northam.  McAuliffe deemphasized standardized testing when he was governor, a move that was cheered by many local school boards and gained bipartisan support in the General Assembly. Dan Gecker, president of the state school board, said Virginia’s proficiency standards are set with a practical goal rather than an aspirational one. ""We’re looking to set the cut level at a specific body of knowledge for a child to succeed at the next grade level,"" he said. Youngkin wrote, ""Virginia has the lowest standards for math and reading of all 50 states."" He is referring to a federal study that shows Virginia in 2019 had the lowest baselines for proficiency on its standardized tests for fourth grade math and reading and eighth grade reading. The National Center for Education Statistics does not compare test standards for other grades. Youngkin’s statement, however, skips important context. The NCES stresses that its equivalency ratings on standardized tests in states do not reflect how well students are learning in each state. Youngkin omits that Virginia students score near the top on standardized national tests for fourth grade math and reading and eight grade math. Eighth grade leading levels are at the national average. Youngkin’s claim, without elaboration, wrongly suggests that Virginia students are learning less than their colleagues across the county. So we rate his statement Half True.  ",/factchecks/2021/oct/20/glenn-youngkin/are-virginias-school-standards-lowest-nation-young/

No evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused plane crashes
","On Oct. 11, a small plane descended from the sky above Santee, Calif., a suburb outside San Diego, and crashed into two residential homes, leading to two deaths.  In the days that followed, some social media users seized on the news, claiming without evidence that the accident had been caused by a COVID-19 vaccine.  ""Epidemic of plane crashes linked to vaccine-related strokes in pilots,"" reads text across an Oct. 17 video posted to Rumble. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video’s claims are entirely baseless. The cause of the Santee crash has not yet been established, said a representative for the National Transportation Safety Board, the government agency investigating the accident. The video hinges its claim on the fact that Dr. Sugata Das, the pilot of the crashed plane, was a cardiologist, who would have been ""required to get the vaccine."" However, it does not provide any proof of its assertions that a stroke resulting from a vaccine caused the accident.  In addition, the video’s claim that the COVID-19 vaccines have caused an ""epidemic"" of plane crashes is not based in fact, a spokesperson from the Federal Aviation Administration told PolitiFact.  ""The FAA has seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations caused by pilots suffering medical complications associated with COVID-19 vaccines,"" FAA spokesperson Crystal Essiaw wrote in an email.  The rate of fatalities resulting from aviation accidents has actually been at a low point during the period COVID-19 vaccines have been available to the public.  According to FAA’s statistics, 0.96 aviation fatalities occurred every 100,000 flight hours in 2019, before the coronavirus began to spread in the U.S. In 2020, that rate decreased to 0.91. And in 2021, after the COVID-19 vaccines became available, it reached 0.74, its lowest point in at least the last six years.  According to the FAA’s guidelines, pilots are not allowed to fly for 48 hours after they have received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the period within which most side effects subside.  A video posted to Rumble claimed that there is an ""epidemic of plane crashes linked to vaccine-related strokes in pilots."" As evidence, the video cites a plane crash that killed two people in Santee, Calif. The National Transportation Safety Board told PolitiFact that the cause of the crash has not been established and that there is nothing to support the video’s claims.  The Federal Aviation Administration told PolitiFact that it has seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations caused by pilots suffering from medical complications involving COVID-19 vaccines.  The rate of aviation fatalities has reached a relative low point during the period COVID-19 vaccines have been available to the public.  We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2021/oct/19/facebook-posts/no-evidence-covid-19-vaccines-have-caused-plane-cr/

Gateway Pundit conflates voter outreach with voter fraud in bogus claim
","Donald Trump’s allies have floated all sorts of wild theories to argue that Democrats stole the 2020 presidential election. One right-wing website is now citing a study of low-income voters to claim that it explains how Democrats purportedly pulled off their caper.  But the website’s statements are bogus. ""Democrats reveal big clue in the big steal: operatives manufactured votes from low income voters to steal the battleground states,"" says the headline on an Oct. 17 Facebook post by the Gateway Pundit. ""Start the canvassing!"" The article under the headline highlights a Huffington Post report about a study of low-income voters in the 2020 presidential election. The article invites Trump supporters to use this information to discover ""the fraud"" and canvass ""lower-income citizens who reportedly voted in 2020."" The study about low-income voters is real. But the conclusion that Democrats admitted to using low-income voters to steal the election in favor of Joe Biden is false. Low-income people are allowed to vote, after all. And the Gateway Pundit failed to recognize the difference between voter outreach and voter fraud. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The study cited by the Gateway Pundit and the Huffington Post was by the Poor People’s Campaign. The group, formed in recent years, was modeled after Martin Luther King Jr.’s campaign to mobilize poor people for political change. The group is nonpartisan, but many of the policies it advocates align with goals on the left, such as expanding voting rights and raising the minimum wage.  In the final months of the 2020 election, the group reached out to about 2 million low-income voters in multiple states with a history of low voter participation to encourage them to vote. The study defined low-income voters as those with an annual household income of less than $50,000. The study concluded that 35% of the voting electorate who cast ballots were low-income voters, and that percentage rose in some battleground states.  ""This cuts against common misperceptions that poor and low-income people are apathetic about politics or inconsequential to electoral outcomes,"" the study stated. The Huffington Post cited the study to assert that low-income voters were the key to Biden’s victory, though the study didn’t state that. ""We cannot use the numbers to say that low-income voters were the decisive factor in the election outcome,"" Shailly Gupta Barnes, author of the study, told PolitiFact in an email. ""However, given the small margins of victory in multiple states, their sheer size and vote share indicate the potential that the low-income electorate can have on election outcomes if more directly engaged.""  The Gateway Pundit made a more far-reaching conclusion: that Democrats used low-income voters to steal the election, although nothing in the study backs that up. One hole in that argument: The study shows that the battleground state with the highest share of low-income voters, Florida, went for Trump.  Other research suggests that low-income voters played a smaller role in 2020 than in 2016. The Pew Research Center, which studied the characteristics of the 2020 electorate, found that ""as in 2016, voters in 2020 had higher incomes"" than nonvoters. Pew found that 35% of voters had family incomes of less than $50,000 in 2020, a drop from 2016 when 48% of voters had family incomes of less than $50,000. RELATED VIDEO  We have previously debunked various false claims by Trump and his allies that the election was rigged or stolen by the Democrats.  Federal officials in Trump’s administration said the November election was secure, and judges nationwide, including GOP appointees, rejected dozens of lawsuits alleging wrongdoing. Evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election was statistically rare among the more than 160 million votes cast. The Gateway Pundit, citing a study by the Poor People’s Campaign, said Democrats ""manufactured votes from low income voters to steal the battleground states."" There’s nothing in the study to support that. The study was about the impact of a voter outreach effort focused on low-income people.  Poor people are allowed to vote, and voter outreach is not voter fraud.   We rate this statement Pants on Fire.  ",/factchecks/2021/oct/19/gateway-pundit/gateway-pundit-conflates-voter-outreach-voter-frau/

$123,000 turkey? Viral photo of pricey Target turkey is several years old, shows pricing error

Mike Pence: Hillary Clinton failed to keep U.S. troops in Iraq
","The vice presidential debate quickly dissolved into Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine interrupting and talking over each other to score points against the top of the ticket candidates. In an exchange about security in Iraq, Pence said, ""Iraq has been overrun by ISIS because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate, Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement."" ""No, that is incorrect,"" Kaine shot back. The argument centers on a period in 2011, when the Obama administration was negotiating with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to keep troops in Iraq. Called a status of forces agreement, it would have kept up to 10,000 troops on the ground beyond Dec. 31, 2011. Obama was working against a deadline signed by President George W. Bush late in 2008. Under the Bush agreement, American troops would be gone by the end of 2011. As 2011 began, military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size. Its number was 10,000. But the Iraqis balked as well, so that number shrank. The New York Times detailed how the force grew smaller until negotiations failed altogether. According to the New York Times, Obama himself ruled out the 10,000-troop option in an Aug. 13, 2011, conference call, dropping the number to about 3,500 troops. But even that lower figure hit a brick wall. The agreement failed over a demand that American troops be given immunity from prosecution by Iraqis, a very touchy political issue within the Iraqi Parliament. Some experts said Iraqi leaders may not have been willing to take great political risk with their citizens in exchange for a relatively small American force. But no immunity meant no sizable residual troop presence. ""When the Americans asked for immunity, the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible,"" al-Maliki said in an October 2011 news conference. ""The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped. Now that the issue of immunity was decided, and that no immunity to be given, the withdrawal has started."" Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor, told PolitiFact in 2015 that al-Maliki allegedly supported the residual force and may have signed a new plan, but the Iraqi Parliament would not. There has been plenty of debate since then on whether it was Washington or Baghdad that was more intractable on a new agreement. Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, said an Iraqi delegation to the institute agreed terms of the planned renewal could not have passed parliament. ""They said that the Iraqi government was too weak and unwilling to go against the wishes of those Iraqis who wanted the Americans to leave,"" Preble told us in 2015. On Oct. 21, 2011, Obama announced the pullout of the vast majority of American troops in Iraq by Christmas. Staying behind were a couple hundred Marines to train the Iraqi army and provide security for diplomatic personnel. Important to this fact-check, the State Department has overall responsibility for leading the U.S. government’s negotiation of status of forces agreements. However, while the U.S. ambassador to Iraq was involved (ambassadors work for the State Department), the key decisions and negotiations with Iraq took place inside the White House. At times, Obama himself was on the phone with al-Maliki. Our ruling Pence said Clinton failed to negotiate a status of forces agreement with Iraq. It is accurate to say that negotiations failed. However, the claim suffers from a number of flaws. It puts too much emphasis on Clinton’s role, when the key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders. The Obama administration wanted to insulate American troops from legal action in Iraq. That was a political minefield in Iraq. While there is room for debate on whether American negotiators could have found a way around that problem, there is no reason to believe the administration simply walked away from a deal to keep U.S. troops in Iraq. The claim has an element of truth, but it leaves out much key information that would give a different impression.

Mike Pence leaves out some details on his tax cut
","As Donald Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence is getting scrutiny for his record as governor of Indiana. Pence, who is finishing out his first term and is not seeking another, has touted his record on taxes -- a key issue for Republican voters. Speaking near Richmond, Va., on his way to the vice presidential debate in nearby Farmville, Pence said, ""In the state of Indiana, I’ve signed more than $3.5 billion in tax relief."" Is that correct? We found that Pence has backing for the number, but he glosses over some important details. When we checked with Pence’s staff, they pointed to figures released by the Indiana Office of Management and Budget detailing some of the changes enacted by Pence and state legislators early in his term. The changes included a reduction in the personal income tax rate from 3.4 percent to 3.23 percent, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 7.5 percent to 4.9 percent, and a full repeal of the estate tax. (Pence had initially sought a 10 percent reduction in the individual income tax rate, but Republicans in the legislature wanted more corporate tax relief, so the final bill cut income taxes by half of the rate Pence had wanted.) Here is the data Pence’s staff provided to PolitiFact. (Totals may vary slightly due to rounding.) Year Individual income tax Corporate income tax Inheritance tax Financial Institutions Tax Total Fiscal 2014 0 0 $61 million $1.7 million $63 million Fiscal 2015 $65 million 0 $131 million $8.2 million $204 million Fiscal 2016 $159 million $12 million $113 million $12.9 million $297 million Fiscal 2017 $214 million $41 million $96 million $19.2 million $370 million Fiscal 2018 $292 million $70 million $78 million $23.9 million $464 million Fiscal 2019 $307 million $100 million $61 million $25.7 million $493 million Fiscal 2020 $318 million $130 million $44 million $28.9 million $520 million Fiscal 2021 $329 million $148 million $26 million $33.9 million $537 million Fiscal 2022 $341 million $190 million $9 million $40.5 million $580 million Total $2.024 billion $691 million $620 million $195 million $3.5 billion Source: Indiana Office of Management and Budget So Pence can point to specific data showing that the tax cuts he signed into law amount to $3.5 billion. However, it’s worth pointing out some important caveats: • This total covers nine fiscal years, including several well into the future. Budget windows of this length aren’t unusual in the world of policy wonkery, and Pence avoided a stumbling block by wording his statement carefully to say that he ""signed"" that much tax relief into law -- not that $3.5 billion in tax relief has materialized yet. Still, nine years is a pretty long period of time, and it would not be obvious to the casual observer that the figure in question covers a span that long. Indeed, 2022 will be six years after Pence left the governor’s mansion, and even if he had run for a second term and won, 2022 would have been two years after he left office. • The benefits are ""backloaded."" That’s budget-speak for pushing the cost off into the future -- meaning that some other governor or lawmaker will have to grapple with the fiscal impact. Specifically, three years into the tax cuts, only 16 percent of the final amount has been realized so far. The remaining 84 percent is still to come between 2017 and 2022. And looking just at the individual income tax cuts, only 11 percent have been realized so far, with 89 percent still to come. With so much of the total amount still pending, a lot of the tax relief Pence touts will come to fruition only with the consent of future governors and legislatures. A national recession or a prolonged slump within Indiana might make it impossible for elected officials to stick to this timetable for cuts. • The numbers come from one of the governor’s own offices. The head of the state Office of Management and Budget is appointed by the governor, all the staffers are effectively gubernatorial staffers, and the physical office of the director is right next to that of the governor's chief of staff. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the numbers are wrong or biased, but it’s worth noting that they are not calculated by a fully independent governmental entity or a group that is outside of state government entirely. Our ruling Pence said, ""In the state of Indiana, I’ve signed more than $3.5 billion in tax relief."" Figures from an office Pence controls did produce projections of tax cuts at that level. But it’s worth noting that a relatively small share of those cuts have happened already -- 84 percent are set to occur in fiscal years 2017 through 2022, a period far enough in the future to make it an open question whether the cuts will ultimately materialize. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/49854eb0-8781-473e-998c-0a708cd719d1",/factchecks/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/mike-pence-leaves-out-some-details-his-tax-cut/

Mike Pence says Tim Kaine tried to raise Virginia taxes by $4 billion
","Republican Mike Pence accused Democrat Tim Kaine of being a big taxer during the 2016 vice-presidential debate. ""He actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion,"" Pence said of Kaine’s record as Virginia governor from 2006 to 2010. Pence made a similar statement during an Oct. 3 rally in Ashland, Va. Stephen Cheung, a spokesman for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, emailed us that Pence was referring to three unsuccessful tax proposals Kaine made during his gubernatorial term. The first came days after Kaine took office. He rolled out a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for the state’s longstanding transportation woes.     Kaine wanted to raise taxes on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees and imposing steeper fines on drivers who got tickets. The registration fees are similar to a tax, since all drivers must register their cars. Pence takes license by including the higher driving penalties as a tax, since those payments could have been easily avoided. We should note that Senate Republicans that year unsuccessfully proposed a bill -- different from Kaine’s proposal -- that also would have raised taxes by $1 billion for transportation.   Kaine’s second tax proposal came during the summer of 2008, when lawmakers gathered for a special transportation session. Ahead of the conclave, Kaine proposed a $1.1 billion plan that would have increased the titling tax to 4 percent from 3 percent, and hike vehicle registration fees by $10. Kaine offered his final tax hike in December 2009 -- his last full month in office. Virginia’s economy was reeling from the aftershocks of the Great Recession, and Kaine proposed raising state income tax rates for all brackets by 1 percentage point. Kaine’s plan, defeated a week after he left office in January 2010, would have generated $1.9 billion a year. That would have been offset by $650 million taxpayers would have saved by a companion proposal to end Virginia’s personal property tax on vehicles. So the net effect of his last-year plan would have been a $1.25 billion annual tax hike. All told, Kaine proposed $4 billion in annual tax hikes during his term, tempered by $650 million in cuts. That comes to a net total of $3.35 billion. Alternate route There’s another way to get to $4 billion in tax increases that Trump used during a July 25 rally in Roanoke, Va. The presidential nominee said that Kaine, during his first week as governor, ""proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase."" Trump’s campaign backed the statement by taking the $1 billion transportation tax hike Kaine proposed in 2006 and multiplying it over the four years of his gubernatorial term. It should be noted, however, that neither Trump in Roanoke, nor Pence during the debate, said they were referring to the four-year cumulative cost of one proposed tax increase. Our ruling Pence said that when Kaine was governor, ""He actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion."" Pence was referring to three unsuccessful tax hikes proposed by Kaine. Two of them, in 2006 and 2008, were for transportation. The third, in 2009, was to raise general funds for the state. Added up, they come to $4 billion in proposed tax hikes and fees. There’s a couple of issues, however. Kaine’s 2009 income tax hike was offset by a $650 million cut in the state’s car tax. So the net annual cost of all three tax and fee proposals was $3.35 billion. Secondly, Pence’s math double counts Kaine’s unsuccessful efforts to raise taxes for transportation. On the whole, we rate Pence’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/mike-pence-accuses-tim-kaine-raising-taxes-leaving/

Tim Kaine says Donald Trump, Mike Pence want to eliminate the federal minimum wage
","Sen. Tim Kaine tried to align himself and Hillary Clinton with working people while portraying Donald Trump and Gov. Mike Pence as representing the wealthy. ""First, Donald Trump said wages are too high, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage,"" Kaine said during the vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. We found that Trump has been all over the map about wages and the federal minimum wage, while Pence opposed raising the minimum wage as a member of in Congress. Trump and the minimum wage No state can set a minimum wage lower than the federal minimum wage of $7.25. But states can set a higher wage. Trump has made some conflicting statements about wages. Early in the campaign, he often said wages were too high and showed no interest in raising the federal minimum wage. ""We have to become competitive with the world,"" he said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe in November  2015. ""Our taxes are too high, our wages are too high, everything is too high. What's going to happen is now people are going to start firing people."" That echoed similar comments he made during the Republican presidential debate in November that wages are ""too high"" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, ""I would not do it."" But later in the campaign, Trump showed more interest in raising the minimum wage, though he often said that he would leave that up to the states. On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, ""Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?"" Trump responded, ""Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more."" When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, ""Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility."" Also on May 8, on NBC’s Meet the Press, he said that he doesn’t understand how people survive on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Trump said that while he would personally like to see a higher minimum wage, he would leave that up to the states. ""I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,"" Trump told NBC’s Chuck Todd. ""But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other."" Todd followed that up by asking if Trump thought the states should only be able to decide whether to raise their minimum wages from the $7.25 federally mandated minimum wage, or if there should be no federal minimum wage at all – giving states the option to go lower than $7.25 or have no minimum wage at all. ""But should the federal government set a floor?"" Todd asked. ""No,"" Trump replied. ""I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do."" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung referred us to Trump’s statement about letting the states set the minimum wage from his July 27 press conference in South Florida. Here’s what Trump said: ""The minimum wage has to go up. People are -- at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states -- federal -- I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage -- but it has to go up... So I would like to raise it to at least $10."" We gave him a Full Flop for his stance on whether the federal government should set the minimum wage. Pence statements on minimum wage Pence has a record of opposing minimum wage increases and bashing the minimum wage in general while in Congress. However, we could not find evidence he wants to eliminate it as Kaine claimed. In July 2006 while in Congress, Pence said in a statement to the press that he opposed legislation that he said would raise the federal minimum wage by 41 percent. ""Minimum wage increases raise unemployment among teenagers, minorities and part-time workers,"" he said. ""The minimum wage violates fundamental free market economics. It costs jobs, and I cannot support policies that will take jobs from those who need a paycheck the most. Pence was one of 21 House Republicans who voted against a bill that included an increase in the minimum wage. Pence voted against raising the minimum wage in January 2007 over two years from $5.15 to $7.25. ""An excessive increase in the minimum wage will hurt the working poor, Mr. Speaker, and especially those who are trying to begin the American Dream by entering the workforce at entry level jobs,"" he said. ""Minimum wage increases, the unbroken record of our economic history attests, raise unemployment among the young, minorities and part-time workers -- the very people that a minimum wage is thought to help."" In 2013 as governor, Pence signed a law that prohibits local governments from requiring businesses to pay a higher minimum wage beyond what is required in federal law. We asked a Trump spokesman about Pence’s current position on the minimum wage and did not get a response to that specific question. But when we asked if Pence ever called for eliminating the federal minimum wage, Cheung said ""No. He voted against raising the (federal) minimum wage in 2007."" We told Clinton’s spokesman we found examples of Pence opposing an increase in the minimum wage but not calling for eliminating it. Spokesman Josh Schwerin said that Kaine was referring to the ""Trump ticket"" and that it is Trump who ""dictates the agenda."" Our ruling Kaine said ""First, Donald Trump said wages are too high, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage."" He’s right that Trump has said that about wages, but Kaine exaggerates by saying Trump and Pence want to eliminate the minimum wage. Trump has been all over the map on wages and the federal minimum wage. He has said he wouldn’t raise the minimum wage. He later seemed open to raising the minimum wage but has said that states should make the decision. Pence’s record in Congress showed he was against raising the minimum wage and made some critical comments about the idea of a minimum wage, but we didn’t find him calling for eliminating it.

Ex-DEP secretary McGinty (legally) profited from the environmental business
","The attack ads are upon us. It’s difficult to sit through any newscast or sporting event without seeing one, and ads for Senate candidates Katie McGinty and Pat Toomey are filling up the Pennsylvania airwaves like nowhere else. Outside groups have contributed $57.5 million on the Toomey-McGinty race -- more than any other Senate battle in the country.   One recent anti-McGinty ad comes from the Freedom Partners Action Fund, a Republican-leaning PAC involved in Senate races in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada and Indiana. The ad, which Freedom Partners Action Fund backed with $1 million, calls her out for taking jobs related to her past government work, stating, ""she’s made thousands from companies she previously regulated."" McGinty had several jobs and advisory positions after her work as Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection in Governor Ed Rendell’s administration. Were those companies’ business under the purview of the DEP? And did she really make thousands? After leaving Rendell’s administration, according to her LinkedIn profile, McGinty worked as a director for NRG Energy for three years, senior VP and managing director of strategic growth for Weston Solutions for two and chair of Fresh Start PA for five months. She also advised for the solar energy company Plextronics and served as a board member of Iberdrola, a wind-energy and natural gas company.    For NRG, she was pulling in six figures annually. According to SEC filings from NRG Energy, McGinty made $200,000 in cash and stock in 2011 and $146,000 in 2009. Penn Live reported Iberdrola paid McGinty $125,000 for her work on the board.   Would those firms fall under the DEP’s umbrella? DEP press secretary Neil Shader said the DEP regulates the activities of energy companies, as well as others related to the environment.   Asked whether it took issue with the statement about McGinty making thousands ""from companies she previously regulated,"" the McGinty campaign responded with a statement that essentially ignored our question. The campaign said only that ""Katie has dedicated her career in both the public and private sector to creating good paying jobs and protecting the environment. She has a long record of accomplishment, including bringing $1 billion renewable energy investments to Pennsylvania and creating 3,000 jobs as Secretary of PA's Department of Environmental Protection."" In Pennsylvania, for the most part there are few laws prohibiting the type of work a public official can do after leaving office. One exception is lobbying. Public officials are barred from lobbying the agency at which they worked for a year after they left. It’s not uncommon for Democrats or Republicans to move into private sector jobs related to their past positions in government. Michael Krancer, for instance, joined Blank Rome’s energy, industry team after his tenure as DEP secretary under Tom Corbett. Barry Kauffmann, executive director of the state watchdog group Common Cause, would like to see that prohibition extended for two years and the introduction of regulations for public officials who take private sector jobs closely related to their previous position.        ""The problem is conflict of interest,"" he said. ""You need to have a buffer or a barrier to make sure the public is protected from the conflict of interest. And there has to be penalties to make sure those disincentives are in place and effectively monitored.""   Our ruling  The pro-Republican PAC Freedom Partners Action Fund attacked Senate candidate Katie McGinty in a recent ad, stating, ""she’s made thousands from companies she previously regulated."" After McGinty stopped working as DEP secretary in 2008, she worked for or served on the board for energy companies NRG Energy, Iberdrola and Plextronics, among others. NRG Energy and Iberdrola both compensated her with more than $100,000. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, the office is responsible for regulating the activities of energy companies.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Congress', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Is Ron Johnson right that he is only manufacturer in U.S. Senate?
","When you hear the words ""Russ Feingold,"" Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wants you to think ""career politician."" A recurring theme of Johnson’s campaign against Feingold, the Democrat who Johnson unseated in 2010, is their differing backgrounds. As Johnson tells it, he rose from a dishwashing job to help start a manufacturing company, while Feingold has been a politician for 34 years, collecting his income from taxpayers. Such is the gist of a recent ad from Johnson’s campaign, one that — as in the 2010 campaign — features him at a whiteboard. ""In 2010, there were 57 lawyers, zero manufacturers and way too many career politicians in the United States Senate,"" Johnson says in the ad. The tallies are shown on the whiteboard, though it does not offer a number to represent the career politicians. ""Today, there are 54 lawyers, 1 manufacturer — that’d be me — and still way too many career politicians,"" he continues. ""And now Senator Feingold wants to add another one — himself."" We decided to check Johnson’s math. What’s in a job? Johnson’s camp said his numbers came from the official biographies of the 100 current U.S. Senators posted on Congress.gov. He said there were 54 lawyers in the Senate; a review of the biographies confirms 54 senators graduated from law school. While just 51 reported having careers in law in a Congressional Research Report from December 2015, he’s not far off. Only one biography — Johnson’s — includes the word ""manufacturer."" ""Ron is the only senator who has built a career as a manufacturer,"" William Allison, a spokesman for the Johnson campaign said. ""He helped to start Pacur — an Oshkosh plastics manufacturing company — and built it from the ground up."" We have previously examined what Johnson’s involvement with Pacur entailed. He helped his brother-in-law grow the company and held various positions over a span of 30 years, including working on the shop floor, overseeing the company’s accounting and later running the company. When he won a Senate seat in 2010, he stepped down from his day-to-day duties but continues to retain a 5 percent stake in the company. Does that make him a manufacturer today? We think it is fair to use that term, since it was his primary occupation before arriving in Washington almost six years ago. Likewise, other senators continue to identify themselves as teachers, lawyers and doctors. But a few other senators also have manufacturing connections. U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, worked as sheet metal shearer and assembly line worker early in his career before going into farming. U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, once worked for a medical device manufacturer — but on its legal team. Neither identify as manufacturers. Most notably, U.S. Sen. David Perdue, R-Georgia, has said he spent most of his career helping companies outsource manufacturing operations. He held high-level positions with Reebok, Sara Lee, Dollar General, Haggar Clothing and a North Carolina textile manufacturer before he was elected. Like Johnson, he touted his business background — and lack of political experience — while campaigning. Perdue’s Senate biography describes him as a ""management consultant"" and ""company executive."" But both he and Johnson spent the bulk of their pre-Senate careers in the manufacturing industry. The other side of the ballot Earlier this year, we rated Mostly True a Johnson claim that Feingold is a ""career politician."" In the 36 years since Feingold finished law school, he was in office for 28 and engaged in political or diplomatic work for five, meaning about 92 percent of his career has been spent in politics. Feingold himself makes no apologies for this and has said he is proud of his career in public service. He also takes every opportunity to paint his opponent as an out-of-touch millionaire who approved a $10 million payment to himself from Pacur when he left for the Senate. In the ad, Johnson argues there are too many ""career politicians"" in the Senate —  an opinion that is not really checkable. Nevertheless, we can provide some perspective on the background of other senators. A review of the senators’ biographies (and official websites, when needed) turns up just three individuals who only worked in politics or public policy before holding office, excluding lawyers. Most had another profession, or several, before entering the public arena. There are multiple social workers, farmers, business owners and college professors, for example. But it has been shown by the Brookings Institution that an increasing number of so-called ""career politicians"" are serving in both the Senate and the Congress when the term is defined as someone whose previous jobs included at least one in politics or public policy. Our rating Johnson said he is the only manufacturer in Senate, among many lawyers. Based solely on the brief biographies posted online, his statement is accurate. But other sources suggest there were some details left out: He counted law school grads instead of those who reported careers in law and he overlooked a colleague whose business career centered around manufacturing. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/oct/04/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-right-he-only-manufacturer-us-senate/
"['Jobs', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Bruce Rauner pits father against daughter in Illinois workers' comp battle
","For more than a year, Illinois has been gripped by political gridlock that’s left it operating with no state budget and on pace to finish 2016 in the worst financial condition in state history. Fueling the standoff is a dispute between Gov. Bruce Rauner -- a Republican serving his first term in any elected office -- and House Speaker Michael Madigan -- a Democrat and the state’s most powerful and longest-serving politician -- over how to revive the state’s economy. One of the biggest points of contention is Rauner’s complaint that the state’s workers’ compensation insurance rates are among the highest in the nation and are chasing manufacturing jobs out of Illinois. Indeed, the latest numbers from the Illinois Department of Employment Security show the state lost 11,800 manufacturing jobs from August 2015 to August 2016. In addition to being Rauner’s political nemesis, Madigan also is the father of Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan. That’s why one statement Rauner made during a press conference on Sept. 19 struck us as noteworthy: ""Even our attorney general who is a strong Democrat, she has said that we need causation in our workers’ comp system. That’s the No. 1 thing pushing our manufacturing jobs out of Illinois,"" Rauner said. Is Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who is a Democrat and also the daughter of Rauner’s arch political rival, on the Republican governor’s side on this issue? We decided to check. ‘Causation’ clash Rauner believes the current system for compensating workers who are injured on the job is too lenient, and gives businesses no way to defend themselves against claims of workplace injuries that may be only minimally work-related or not at all. Under Illinois law, if the workplace is involved in any way with an injury, even indirectly, the employer -- usually through its insurance -- bears responsibility for the workers’ compensation claim. Rauner wants Illinois to adopt a law in which the workplace must be at least 50 percent responsible for the injury for the employee to qualify for a workers’ compensation claim. In legal terms, he wants to increase the standard of ""causation."" Speaker Madigan has said, repeatedly, that Rauner’s system would ""send injured workers to welfare and the emergency room.""  The evidence The basis for Rauner’s claim is a 2012 opinion from the Attorney General’s Office with the catchy title, ""Background on Workers’ Compensation Claims Filed by State Employees and Reforms Proposed by the Office of the Attorney General."" The administration did not respond to three requests for verification that Rauner based his statement on this document. This opinion has been cited for years by advocates of a stricter standard. Issued in March 2012, the 23-page document provides an exhaustive look at problems in the workers’ compensation system from the perspective of the attorney general -- who acts as the defense attorney for the state when state employees file on-the-job injury claims. ""In defending against workers’ compensation claims, the State is in a position similar to private employers,"" the opinion says in its introduction. The document is chock full of incidents in which employees are awarded workers’ compensation benefits after suffering injuries in ridiculous circumstances. (One example: A Circuit City employee ""was injured when he threw himself up against a vending machine in an attempt to dislodge a bag of Fritos."") The opinion came out at a time when a bill in the General Assembly proposed a reform similar to what Rauner calls for in his turnaround plan. ""To protect taxpayer dollars, the legislature must address and change the causation standard that is currently applied by the (Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission) and the courts,"" the opinion states. ""Senate Bill 2521 addresses the causation standard and provides an opportunity to discuss the appropriate language to make this needed change."" That’s not an out-and-out endorsement of every detail within the bill in question (which died quietly in committee without ever being voted upon), but it certainly encourages lawmakers to take up the issue. Then and now But that was in early 2012, when Illinois was in another political epoch. Rauner was an unknown to most Illinoisans, and Democrats were in their 10th year of controlling both the governor’s office and both chambers of the General Assembly. Rauner’s 2014 election hit the political landscape like a tsunami, and partisan tension never has been higher than it is now. Does Lisa Madigan still believe ""we need causation in our workers’ comp system,"" as Rauner claims? ""We do support changing the standard and strengthening it, but we have not laid out a new standard,"" said Ann Spillane, Lisa Madigan’s chief of staff. ""From our perspective, there ought to be reasonable ways to change the standard that would not damage the purpose of workers’ compensation to ensure that employees who are injured on the job can fully recover."" So far, though, there’s been no discussion between Rauner and the General Assembly about ""reasonable ways."" Our ruling Rauner said, ""Even our attorney general who is a strong Democrat, she has said that we need causation in our workers’ comp system."" In 2012, Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office went on record in considerable detail about the problems caused by Illinois’ lenient burden of proof for workers claiming workplace injury. The attorney general didn’t explicitly endorse the causation standard contained in a bill before the General Assembly at that time, but said the bill ""provides an opportunity to discuss the appropriate language to make this needed change."" Today, even as this issue has become a focal point in Rauner’s deadlock with Speaker Madigan, Attorney General Madigan’s office maintains that the state should find ""reasonable ways"" to protect the rights of injured workers and employers. We rate Rauner’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4d40d9ba-0159-4404-a764-69d792bbe061",/factchecks/2016/oct/03/bruce-rauner/bruce-rauner-pits-father-against-daughter-illinois/
"['Population', 'State Budget', 'Virginia', 'Virginia First Foundation']","
Several problems with Virginia First's claim about soaring per capita state spending
","A conservative group says Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly have failed to harness state spending. The Virginia First Foundation is lamenting a recently revealed $1.5 billion projected budget shortfall. It posted a game show-themed video on its website. The narrator asks what’s behind ""Window Number 1?"" The answer is this claim: ""The Virginia population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent,"" the group’s video says. The video identifies three House Republican leaders as ""big spenders"": Speaker Bill Howell of Stafford; Majority Leader Kirk Cox of Colonial Heights; and Chris Jones of Suffolk, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We wondered whether the foundation’s statistics are right. Let’s start with Virginia’s population increase. U.S. Census Bureau tallies show the state’s population stood at nearly 7.6 million in 2005 and rose to more than 8.3 million in 2015. That’s an increase of about 10 percent, a bit higher than the foundation says. Now, let’s move to the foundation’s claim about a 38 percent increase in state spending per capita - the amount of state spending divided by the number of people in Virginia. Steve Waters, a founding board member of the foundation, pointed to a couple of sources to show that state spending per person has spiked over the past decade. The first is a table from the 2004-06 budget which says that when fiscal 2005 ended in mid-2005, the state’s per capita spending in its operating budget was projected to be $3,894. Waters also points to a chart from BallotPedia, which says that the state’s per capita spending in fiscal 2015 was $5,483, a number culled from a figures compiled last year by the National Association of State Budget Officers. Those per capita figures amount to a 41 percent increase from 2005 to 2015 - a bit higher than the foundation’s estimate. We also looked at state spending by examining annual reports by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, a watchdog agency. Using tables on the state’s annual population and overall operating expenses in a given year, we came up with a trend line similar to the foundation’s. Our calculations show per capita state spending was $3,861 in 2005 and rose to $5,642 in 2015 - a 46 percent increase. So in raw dollars, the foundation’s state spending figures are in the ballpark and, if anything, underestimate the increase. But there’s a big factor these calculations ignore - the effects of inflation. A dollar in 2015 wasn’t worth as much as a dollar in 2005. When we ran our figures through the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, we found the increase in per capita spending instead was about 21 percent - nearly half the size of the foundation’s growth rate. There’s another point to consider. All of the computations are based on total spending figures in the state budget. But legislators directly control only about 40 percent of the budget called the general fund. The fund, about $20.4 billion this year, is predominantly raised through state income and sales taxes and is used to pay for education, public safety and health programs. The remainder of the budget, more than $30 billion called the non-general fund, comes from sources over which legislators have limited or no control, such as college tuition, federal grants and hospital fees. These distinctions are important to note when looking at the context of the foundation’s claim, which blames GOP lawmakers for poorly reining state spending. JLARC noted in a report last year that the main driver of higher state spending were non-general fund increases in federal dollars; tuition payments to colleges that set their own rates; and child support payments. So to get to the bottom on this claim, we looked at per capita spending in the general fund over the 10-year period that the foundation cited. JLARC figures show it rose by 20.5 percent in raw dollars - from $1,819 in 2005 to $2,191 in 2015. When adjusting those figures for inflation, the spending actually declined by about 1 percent - from $2,207 in 2005 to $2,191 in 2015. Our ruling The Virginia First Foundation says the state’s ""population increased by just 8 percent from 2005 to 2015, but the per capita spending in the budget increased by a whopping 38 percent."" The conservative group specifically faulted three GOP lawmakers for not holding the line. The population increase, we should note, is closer to 10 percent. In raw dollars, the increase in per capita spending is 46 percent - a little higher than the group says. But the group’s calculations omit some key factors. When adjusted for inflation, the per capita increase for the entire state budget falls to 21 percent. Even then, the figure still holds state lawmakers responsible for a major portion of the state budget over which they have little or no control. If we focus on the portion of the budget that legislators fully direct - the general fund - per capita spending in raw dollars increased by 20 percent from 2005 to 2015. When adjusted for inflation, it actually decreased by about 1 percent. So the foundation’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"['Medicaid', 'Missouri', 'Chris Koster']","
Koster leaves out facts in Medicaid statement
","As we move into the final weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Democratic gubernatorial nominee and Attorney General Chris Koster is making a point to separate his political stances from the actions of the Missouri General Assembly. In a graphic posted on Instagram, Koster’s campaign wrote, ""The legislature’s failure to expand Medicaid has brought crisis to many of Missouri’s rural health care providers."" That sounded pretty dramatic, so we decided to look into the claim. The post referred to research done by the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Koster campaign also directed us to an article from the Springfield News-Leader. What we found in examining the evidence is that not every hospital Koster cited is ""rural,"" and the hospitals closed for a variety of reasons. Cecil G. Sheps Center Report The Sheps Center has tracked hospital closings in the continental United States since 2010. In that amount of time, three rural Missouri hospitals have closed, the center reports. The Sac-Osage Hospital in Osceola closed in September 2014, the Parkland Health Center Weber Road in Farmington closed in January, and the SoutheastHEALTH Center of Reynolds County in Ellington closed in March. Koster’s campaign also directed our attention to the Ozarks Community Hospital in Springfield, which closed its surgery department and emergency room in July. The Ozarks Community Hospital is not considered a rural hospital because it’s located in Springfield, population 160,000. The hospital contained 45 beds, plus 10 more in its geriatric psychiatry unit, a small number for a city of that size. If we start counting in September of 2014, these four closings work out to approximately one every eight months. But, again, while the Ozarks Community Hospital is small, it’s not rural. Medicaid According to Ryan Barker at the Missouri Foundation for Health, Missouri could have expanded Medicaid starting Jan. 1, 2014, before any of the hospitals closed. Expanding Medicaid would have had a significant impact on the reimbursement of health care providers. Dave Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association, told St. Louis Public Radio that the legislature’s decision to not expand Medicaid will cost Missouri $4 billion in federal payments over the next six years. Under the Affordable Care Act, states were given the opportunity to expand the pool of citizens covered by Medicaid, a subsidized insurance for citizens living in poverty. The federal government would have covered the entire costs of the broadened coverage for the first three years, but the level of federal subsidy would decline after that. Legislators in Missouri and 18 other states chose not to expand Medicaid, in part because of the greater costs to the state, but also because of ideological opposition to subsidized insurance and Obamacare. Since many rural hospitals were already in crisis before 2014 because of a large burden of uninsured patients, the failure to expand Medicaid isn’t the direct cause for closings. However, Medicaid expansion was a missed opportunity to lessen the load on those affected hospitals. Why the hospitals closed In an article from the Kansas Health Institute News Service, Chris Smiley, the CEO of the Sac-Osage hospital, said the hospital was forced to close because of a large amount of uninsured patients and shrinking payments from Medicare. ""Hospitals expected to see millions of newly insured customers thanks to federal subsidies enabling people to buy health insurance and the expansion of state Medicaid programs,"" explained the article. ""In exchange, they agreed to accept reduced Medicare payments and a huge cut in disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, funding, which the federal government pays to offset the costs of uncompensated care."" Since Missouri opted out of Medicaid expansion, this left the hospital with a gap in reimbursement. The closest hospital to Osceola is now Ellett Memorial Hospital in Appleton City, 30 minutes away. Parkland Health Center Weber Road officials were much less specific in their explanation, but said that concerns about building safety and regulations factored in the decision to close. Most of the hospital’s services, including emergency care, have since been relocated to other Parkland Health facilities, also located in Farmington. SoutheastHEALTH was forced to close because of a $6 million debt owed by Advanced Healthcare, the previous owner of the hospital. As the owners of the property, state Medicaid officials informed the company that it was liable for the debt. The nearest hospital to Ellington is now the Iron County Hospital in Pilot Knob. Ozarks Community Hospital was forced to close its ER and surgery center because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determined it did not have a large enough inpatient population to be considered a hospital. Since approximately 40 percent of the hospital’s patients were uninsured and it was being paid less money to treat them, the hospital was only able to admit patients following surgery by 2015, according to OCH Health System owner and CEO Paul Taylor in a Springfield News-Leader article. He said there is ""no doubt in my mind"" that the hospital would have stayed open if Missouri had expanded Medicaid. The Ozarks Community Hospital now functions as a clinic. Our ruling Koster said, ""A rural hospital in Missouri closes every 8 months. The legislature’s failure to expand Medicaid has brought crisis to many of Missouri’s rural health care providers."" Koster’s claim is a bit of stretch. Four small Missouri hospitals have closed entirely or in part since September 2014, three of which are rural. In half those cases, patients being unable to pay their bills was cited as a reason for the closure. And many of those patients likely would have been covered had Missouri expanded Medicaid. Koster’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/777d846a-33b3-42b6-8f88-49d665f6fe6a",/factchecks/2016/oct/03/chris-koster/koster-leaves-out-facts-medicaid-statement/
"['Environment', 'Taxes', 'California', 'No  on 67']","

What’s in the Calif. bag fee for the environment? Opponents: ‘Not one penny’
","A ‘Yes’ vote on California’s Proposition 67 would ban thin plastic carryout bags at grocery and convenience stores statewide. The ban is supported by environmental groups that argue the bags choke wildlife and cause problems for recycling centers when they wrap around machinery. Along with imposing the ban, Prop 67 would also mandate that stores charge customers a minimum 10 cent fee on the other carry-out options they supply, such as paper or heavy duty plastic bags. The No on 67 campaign has seized on this 10 cent charge, calling it a tax and claiming it does nothing to fund environmental protections. ""Don’t be fooled: Not one penny of the bag ban tax goes to the environment,"" the No on 67 campaign claimed in its official ballot argument against the proposition. No on 67 is led by a plastics industry trade association. The same group introduced a competing ballot measure, Proposition 65, which would redirect the bag fee money to an environmental fund administered by the state Wildlife Conservation Board. We wondered if the No on 67 claim is accurate. Does any money from the charge go to environmental causes?  California's Prop 67 would ban thin plastic grocery carryout bags statewide and impose a 10 cent fee on other store options such as paper or heavy duty plastic. Photo by Jae C. Hong / Associated Press Our research Prop 67 is a referendum on a law Gov. Jerry Brown signed two years ago banning plastic carryout bags statewide. The plastics industry challenged it, placing the law on hold. The measure is also known as the ""California Plastic Bag Ban Veto Referendum."" It would apply to grocery and convenience stores, large pharmacies and liquor stores. Notably, the No on 67 campaign uses the word ""tax"" rather than charge or fee in its claim. The term doesn’t fit, as the revenue goes to stores, not a government agency. A spokeswoman for the No on 67 campaign said its claim is backed up by the text of the ballot measure, which says the 10 cent charge (it doesn’t use the term ‘tax’) would be ""retained by the store and … used only for specified purposes."" The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office examined Prop 67 and found ""stores would retain the revenue from the sale of the bags."" It went on to say: ""They could use the proceeds to cover the costs of providing carryout bags, complying with the measure, and educational efforts to encourage the use of reusable bags."" Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for the Yes on 67 campaign, acknowledged there’s no requirement for stores to fund beach cleanups, land preservation or similar environmental efforts. That doesn’t mean there’s no environmental upside to the 10 cent charge, he said. ""The environmental benefit of charging for the actual average cost of bags (versus) giving those bags for free, is that consumers use substantially fewer bags,"" Maviglio said in an email. ""Fewer bags, even fewer recycled paper bags, means a smaller environmental footprint."" He pointed to a 2012 report by the city of San Jose to back up that statement. San Jose is among the more than 100 cities or counties in California that already ban plastic grocery bags. The city’s plastic bag ordinance includes a 10 cent charge on paper bags retained by stores. Comparing periods before and after the ban, the report found an 89 percent reduction in bag litter in San Jose’s storm drain system; and about a 60 percent reduction in the city’s creeks, rivers, streets and neighborhoods. In Santa Cruz County, Laura Kasa of Save our Shores told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in 2013 her group has witnessed a reduction of bags collected during cleanups ""because of the four bans which took effect (in the county) in 2012."" Our ruling The No on 67 campaign claims ""Not one penny of the bag ban tax goes to the environment."" A large portion of this is correct: Nothing requires the bag fee revenue be spent directly on environmental causes, as found by the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. But the claim ignores the indirect benefit the fee could have on the environment. Supporters make a fair point that the fee will persuade customers to use reusable bags, thus cutting down on river- and creek-choking plastic bags. Finally, the No on 67 statement describes the fee as a ""tax,"" a wrong and misleading description. We rate the claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: After this fact check was published, a spokeswoman for the city of San Jose told us that the city's estimate of 89 percent litter reduction was later determined to be miscalculated.

Email spreads bogus claim Kaine helped 'radical jihadi' in exchange for donations
","A chain email says of Tim Kaine: ""In exchange for campaign contributions, he appointed a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission."" A reader sent us a copy of the Sept. 21 email and asked if it’s true. No group or individual takes credit for the email, but its content is a verbatim copy of a 20-paragraph blog that was posted July 25 by American Thinker, a conservative website. The blog was headlined ""Clinton’s VP pick Kaine: Promoting jihadis in America in exchange for cash."" The blog names Esam S. Omeish, a Fairfax County surgeon and Muslim activist, as the jihadi with whom Kaine had a ""quid pro quo"" relationship. Omeish, born in Libya, has lived in Virginia since 1982 and is a U.S. citizen. He’s been chief of the division of general surgery at Inova Alexandria Hospital since 2006. In August 2007, Kaine, then governor, appointed Omeish and nine others to the Virginia Commission on Immigration, a new panel that was set up to advise Kaine on state immigration policies. A month later, Kaine was on a radio show when a caller complained about Omeish’s appointment, saying the surgeon had made controversial statements about jihad and Israel. Kaine said he was unaware of the statements and would look into them. Later that day, Kaine announced that Omeish had resigned from the commission at his urging. Newspapers reported then that the controversy sprang from internet-posted speeches Omeish had given as president of the Muslim American Society, a nonprofit set up to promote charitable, religious and educational causes. In December 2000, Omeish spoke at a rally across the street from the White House protesting Israel’s occupation of Jerusalem. He told the crowd, ""... you have learned the way and you have known that jihad is the way to liberate your land."" At an August 2006 rally in Washington, when Israel was fighting a border war with Lebanon, Omeish criticized the ""Israeli war machine."" He called the Israeli action ""criminal"" and accused the nation of ""massacre and genocide against the Palestinian people."" Omeish called on people ""not to allow an Israeli agenda that controls our Congress and holds us hostage."" The day after Kaine ousted him from the commission in 2007, Omeish held a news conference. He said his call for jihad came before the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center and, in using the term, was referring the concept of Islamic struggle rather than a holy war. Omeish said the word ""jihad"" can be misunderstood in a post 9/11 environment. The Merriam-Webster dictionary says the full definition of ""jihad"" is ""a holy war based on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; also: a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.""   As for Israel, Omeish said he favored a two-state government in the city with Israel and Palestine. ""It is not a call for violence. We never condone terrorists,"" Omeish said of his speeches. Kaine, in a prepared statement announcing Omeish’s resignation, praised him as a ""respected physician and community leader."" A spokesman for Kaine said then that the governor was concerned Omeish’s controversial comments would ""distract"" the commission’s work. The spokesmen also said the governor’s office would improve its vetting of potential political appointees. We tried to reach Omeish, but he did not reply to messages we left with personnel at his office. The money   The email, based on American Thinker’s blog, says Kaine appointed Omeish ""in exchange for campaign contributions."" American Thinker, in making that claim, points to a July 23 blog posted by the Clarion Project, a nonprofit that says it’s ""dedicated to exposing the dangers of Islamist extremism while providing a platform for the voices of moderation and promoting grassroots activism."" Clarion’s effort to establish a quid-pro-quo link starts with the New Dominion PAC - an organization founded by Arab-Virginians that contributes almost exclusively to state and local Democrats. The blog notes that the PAC from 2003 to 2005 contributed $43,050 to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign, a figure we confirmed through records kept by the Virginia Public Access Project. The blog offers no evidence that the money came in exchange for Omeish’s appointment which, again, didn’t occur until 2007. And records show that Omeish never has contributed money to the PAC. Clarion also seeks to link a payback through the International Institute of Islamic Thought, a Fairfax County-based think tank whose stated goal is ""to bridge the intellectual divide between Islamic tradition and western civilization."" The Washington Post reported in 2006 that a federal grand jury was investigating whether the institute and other Islamic organizations in Northern Virginia were financing terrorist organizations. The blog notes that in May 2011, the institute donated $10,000 to the New Dominion PAC - the organization which years earlier given money to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign. Kaine’s term as governor ended in January 2010 - more than a year before the institute’s contribution to the PAC. The New Dominion PAC did not contribute money to Kaine’s successful 2012 campaign for the U.S. Senate; it was ineligible to give money to a federal candidate, because it never registered with the Federal Election Commission. Records show Omeish never personally contributed money to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign or his Senate campaign. We should note that a small money link can be traced between Omeish and the International Institute for Islamic Thought. In 2009, Omeish ran unsuccessfully in a Democratic primary for a Fairfax seat in the House of Delegates. The institute contributed $3,500 to the campaign - a small fraction of the $143,734 Omeish raised. We found no record, in contrast, of Omeish contributing money to the institute.   Our ruling A chain email, based on postings by two conservative blogs, says that  Kaine ""in exchange for campaign contributions … appointed a radical jihadi to the Virginia Immigration Commission."" This refers to a 2007 appointment. The appointee, Esam Omeish, a surgeon and Muslim activist, said in a 2000 speech that the ""jihad way is the way to liberate your land."" Kaine, when told of the comment seven years later, immediately obtained Omeish’s resignation from the panel. In the aftermath, Omeish said the word jihad has several meanings, and that he was referring to it as an Islamic concept of personal struggle - not a call for holy war. As for the supposed payoff, the email refers to $43,050 in contributions that the New Dominion PAC, representing Arab-Virginians, made to Kaine’s gubernatorial campaign years before Kaine created the advisory commission and appointed Omeish to it. It also refers to $10,000 the PAC - not Kaine -- received from an Islamic nonprofit group four years after the appointment. Kaine was out of office at the time, and there’s no evidence he benefitted from the donation. Federal laws, in fact, barred that money from being advanced to Kaine’s U.S. Senate campaign in 2012. So the claim that Kaine appointed Omeish ""in exchange"" for political money is based on flimsy happenstance, not fact.  We rate it False.",/factchecks/2016/oct/03/chain-email/chain-email-spreads-bogus-claim-kaine-appointed-ra/

Hillary Clinton's off-base linkage of tax cuts and the Great Recession
","During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton tried to fix blame for the Great Recession on a cherished part of conservative economic policy -- tax cuts. ""Trickle-down did not work,"" Clinton said, referring to a derisive name for tax cuts that dates from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. ""It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn’t worked."" Later in the debate. Clinton doubled down on that argument, saying, ""Well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm."" We had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton’s argument held water. First, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton’s assertion at the debate. Most, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Three Pinocchios out of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a 663-page report from 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.) That said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign’s arguments stand out as plausible: • Bush administration regulators took their eyes off Wall Street. • Bush’s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back. We found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton’s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (The Post’s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.) ""It’s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression,"" and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn’t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said. So there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession. However, the  economists we checked with expressed skepticism -- some strongly so -- about Clinton’s assertion that the recession emerged ""in large part"" due to tax policies. On the left, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, said he wouldn’t just call tax cuts a minor factor in causing the recession -- he said he ""can't think of any way they were a factor at all."" If anything, he said, ""the conventional wisdom goes the other way -- tax cuts tend to increase the deficit, which pushes up interest rates and in turn drags down house prices."" On the right, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. ""Hillary is spouting nonsense,"" he said. ""No economic theory links tax cuts -- or, for that matter, tax increases -- to financial market meltdowns."" Other economists we contacted echoed these sentiments. ""Clinton is on solid ground criticizing Bush’s tax cuts, but blaming them for the recession goes too far,"" said Bruce Bartlett, a former Ronald Reagan aide who has sometimes broken with some conservative orthodoxies. ""One can certainly say that the Bush tax cuts failed to raise economic growth or lower unemployment to any significant degree, and one can argue that the Reagan tax cuts were not especially stimulative as well. But to argue that the Bush tax cuts caused the 2008-09 recession is a stretch."" Harvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who was an official in the administrations of both Bush and his father, said that tax cuts seem like an unlikely culprit, because ""historically we’ve had relatively low rates without terrible -- or any -- recessions."" He added that low tax rates ""would not make my list of the top 10 reasons for the recession."" Instead, Rosen pointed to a ""housing bubble in the United States and Europe that was fed by excess liquidity and poorly regulated mortgage markets."" This became a problem, he said, when large financial institutions that had huge amounts of assets dependent on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed. ""After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the financial system collapsed,"" Rosen said. ""With the collapse in confidence came a collapse in credit markets -- no one was able to borrow -- which ultimately caused a contraction of the real economy."" Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless added another factor: the irrational psychologies of the bubble, on the part of both homebuyers and lenders who felt empowered to pursue risky arrangements in the absence of strict regulation. ""By the middle of the 2000-2010 decade, a great many loans were made that prudent lenders would not have made in the 1990s or ever the early 2000s,"" Burtless said. This, in turn, led to the ""end of a housing boom, a sharp decline in housing prices, widespread mortgage defaults, widespread mortgage securities defaults, and a lack of assets to cover the losses at nine large financial institutions -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, the CitiCorp holding company, and the AIG holding company,"" said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Our ruling Clinton said the Great Recession emerged ""in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm."" It’s broadly accepted that lack of Wall Street regulation played a role, and it’s arguable that income inequality helped set the conditions. But an ideological cross-section of economists agreed that the recession was primarily caused by a housing bubble that turned into a financial crisis, and that it was caused by many factors more significant than low taxes. So for Clinton to say that tax cuts for the rich ""in large part"" caused the Great Recession is a significant exaggeration.

How much do undocumented immigrants pay in taxes?
","Donald Trump may not have paid federal income taxes for 20 years, but the undocumented immigrants he rails against certainly have, according to the head of a Latino civic engagement organization. Maria Teresa Kumar, CEO and president of Voto Latino, said on NBC’s Meet the Press that ""no one is surprised"" by the New York Times report on Trump’s personal finances and pointed out Trump’s ""hypocrisy."" ""He keeps talking about undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion of taxes every single year. They pay their taxes. They have skin in the game. He is not contributing to a system that he says he's going to go in and fix,"" Kumar said. (Editor's note, March 30, 2017: Subsequent news reports have indicated that Trump paid at least some taxes, specifically $38 million in 2005.) Kumar referred us to an Atlantic piece about undocumented immigrants paying Social Security taxes. It cites a note issued by the Social Security Administration in 2013 that contains the $12 billion figure. But the calculation is based on contributions from immigrants and their employers, not just the immigrants themselves. According to the Social Security Administration, there were nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States in January 2009. Factoring out kids, nonworking immigrants and those working in the underground economy and not paying taxes, the Social Security Administration estimated about 3.1 million unauthorized immigrants  who worked and paid Social Security taxes in 2010. This group and their employers generated about $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010. The administration then subtracted about $1 billion in benefits that could’ve been received in 2010 from earnings in years when workers were unauthorized. Workers and employers contribute roughly the same amount. In a 2014 Vice News piece, the Social Security Administration’s chief actuary Stephen C. Goss affirmed the $12 billion contribution. Social Security Administration analysts said ""a relatively small portion"" of those who could draw benefits do so. Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, the administration said. An analysis by the conservative Heritage Foundation came up with a lower figure: $7 billion, excluding payments from employers. Though Kumar told us she meant Social Security taxes in an email interview with PolitiFact, she didn’t specify this on Meet the Press. Without the specification, her figure would have been more accurate about taxes overall. A 2016 study by the Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy, a left-leaning research organization, estimated that undocumented immigrants pay $11.64 billion in state and local taxes in 2013, equivalent to about 8 percent of their total income. This includes sales and excise taxes on goods and services ($6.9 billion), property taxes ($3.6 billion) and personal income taxes ($1.1 billion, assuming a 50 percent compliance rate). The Heritage Foundation came up with a similar result in a 2013 report. It found that the average undocumented immigrant household paid $10,334 in taxes. About half of these 3.4 million households do not pay any taxes. Using Heritage’s analysis, that would translate to about $17.6 billion paid in taxes. Heritage noted that the average undocumented immigrant household received about $24,721 in government benefits and services (i.e. public education, welfare benefits and services like police and highways), resulting in a deficit of $14,387. Our ruling Kumar said, ""Undocumented immigrants pay $12 billion of taxes every single year."" A left-leaning research organization estimated that undocumented immigrants paid about $12 billion in total taxes in 2010, while a conservative think tank pegged it at $17.6 billion. Kumar told us she meant Social Security taxes, but that would make her figure less accurate. According to the Social Security Administration, half of the $12 billion in payroll taxes comes from employers. (But she didn’t say it this way.)

Fact-checking Rudy Giuliani on Meet the Press
","Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani says Hillary Clinton is only pretending to be a feminist. On NBC’s Meet the Press Oct. 2, Giuliani criticized the Democratic presidential nominee for ""attacking"" women who have accused her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of sexual abuse. He also brought up Hillary Clinton’s record on human rights. ""A woman who pretends to be a feminist shouldn't be taking money from countries where women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery, and women can't drive,"" Giuliani said. ""She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries."" Giuliani was referring to the Clinton Foundation, which has brought in significant amounts of money from foreign entities and governments to fund its international charitable programs. One of the biggest concerns about the Clinton Foundation is that some of this foreign money came from countries with questionable records on human rights, as well as countries that had business before the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. On this particular claim, though, Giuliani stretches the truth. The donations from the countries in question do not come close to ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars. And the money goes to the foundation, not to Clinton. Giuliani specifically mentioned countries where women are stoned, killed for adultery and can’t drive. By our count — using the State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and Cornell University’s death penalty database — we found four countries who fall loosely into these categories: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Here’s a chart laying out those countries’ stance on adultery, stoning and women driving, and donations to the Clinton Foundation. (The foundation lists donors on its website, organized into groups based on the size of the donation, without giving the specific dollar amount.) Country Donation to Clinton Foundation Women’s rights issues Saudi Arabia $10 million - $25 million Women are not allowed to drive. Adultery is illegal, and perpetrators can be sentenced to death by stoning. Kuwait $5 million - $10 million Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery. United Arab Emirates $1 million - $5 million Sharia courts allow flogging as a punishment for adultery, and stoning is a form of execution. Bahrain $50,000 - $100,000 Lenient sentence for a person who kills someone caught in the act of adultery. In total, the Clinton Foundation brought in between $16.05 million and $40.1 million. That’s not a small number, but it’s nowhere near ""hundreds of millions."" Saudi Arabia is the clearest example of what Giuliani is talking about, and it donated a maximum of $25 million. We should note that outside the narrow band of countries that ban women from driving and stone them for adultery, a few other countries with other women’s rights issues donated to the Clinton Foundation. For example, Qatar, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, allows for flogging (non-lethal) as a punishment for adultery. And Brunei, which donated between $1 million and $5 million, specifically says spousal intercourse cannot be considered rape. But even if you expand the group of foundation donors to countries that have significant women’s rights issues generally, the donations do not amount to ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars. It’s also important to note Giuliani’s phrasing. He said, ""She's taken hundreds of millions from those countries,"" referring to Hillary Clinton herself. But the donations did not go to Clinton personally; they went to the foundation. While Clinton has been intimately involved in the foundation when not serving in the government or running for office, neither Clinton nor her political campaigns have ever received a direct monetary benefit, such as a salary, from the foundation. Our ruling Giuliani said Hillary Clinton has ""taken hundreds of millions from those countries"" where ""women are stoned, where women are killed for adultery and women can't drive."" The Clinton Foundation, not Clinton personally, has taken in tens of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions, from countries that have questionable records on women’s rights, including those that ban driving and stone women for adultery. Giuliani’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Landfills in upstate New York still accept fracking waste
","When New York State officials banned fracking in late 2014, environmentalists celebrated a victory against the controversial natural gas extraction method. Then last year, a report said waste from the process was still coming into the state. Lawmakers grilled Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos at a water quality hearing in Albany. He contradicted the report. ""No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State, and those who perpetrated that are wrong,"" Seggos said at the hearing. ""There's no high volume hydraulic fracturing going on in New York. It's going on in other states. No waste from those other states is coming into New York."" Environmental advocates, however, point to information from Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection that indicates trucks carry fracking waste from the Keystone State to landfills in upstate New York. So do upstate landfills accept fracking waste? The Department of Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania confirmed that landfills in New York State took in fracking waste. We looked into what kinds of waste comes into the state, and which ones do not. Waste brought into New York Fracking is different from traditional gas drilling. Instead of drilling a well straight into the ground, a company first drills vertically, then directs the well horizontally. The drillers then blast porous rock with fluid to extract natural gas. Regulations by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation block any waste more than 80 percent liquid from being dumped into landfills. That prevents liquid fracking waste, like flowback water, from being brought into the state for disposal. But any solid waste that may have come in contact with fracking liquids is permitted under current regulations. Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection shows three New York State landfills this year accepted waste from high volume hydraulic-fractured drilling.  According to a database from the Pennsylvania agency, the Chemung County Landfill took more than 15,000 tons of waste, including what’s listed as drill cuttings, synthetic liner materials, servicing fluid, soil contaminated by oil- and gas-related spills, and ""other oil and gas wastes."" Hakes C&D Landfill in Steuben County took in about 1,900 tons of drill cuttings. Hyland Facility Association in Allegany County took 550 tons of soil contaminated by oil- and gas- related spills. The definitions of this waste from the state of Pennsylvania are vague. We spoke with Scott Perry from the Pennsylvania environmental agency for a better understanding. Perry said any soil contaminated by an oil- or gas-related spill more often than not comes in contact with flowback water - a mixture of fluids and chemicals used during the fracking process. ""The most commonly spilled material is flowback water,"" Perry said. ""Drilling fluids and diesel are probably the next most common."" Companies are not required to detail what they include in the ""other oil and gas wastes"" category. Perry said it’s considered a catch-all for waste that does not fit any other description. He said it could mean anything from the packaging used to store chemicals before they are used for fracking to broken equipment. Synthetic liner materials are thick mats or liners used to prevent chemicals and other waste from leaking into the ground. Perry said any residue is washed from the liners before they’re transported for disposal. Servicing fluid is used to maintain the wells and can include a water/oil-based mud and foam. All three New York State facilities that received waste this year are owned by Casella, a landfill operator. When we contacted one of the landfills, they said they do perform analytics on the waste as it’s brought to the facility, but a message to Casella for details was not returned. We also reached out to both companies that operate the wells where the waste came from, but neither responded to our request for more information. As recently as last year, one facility in Syracuse was still accepting fluid that the Pennsylvania agency says includes brine from fracking. But no records indicate any New York State facility has accepted the fluids this year. Landfills accepted flowback waste from fracking as recently as 2013. The state's response We contacted the Department of Environmental Conservation about the contradiction between Seggos's statement and the Pennsylvania database. In a statement, the department said any drilling waste brought into the state was strictly regulated. In the same statement, the department said waste from fracking was not allowed in the state. ""Given recent public statements from advocates, it is important to set the record straight regarding the disposal and use of high volume hydraulic fracturing waste,"" said Kevin Frazier from the Department of Environmental Conservation. ""Under Gov. Cuomo’s leadership, New York State banned high volume hydraulic fracturing and prohibits the use and disposal of any high volume hydraulic fracturing waste or fluids, including brines, anywhere in the state."" ""DEC also strictly regulates the State’s four landfills that currently accept drill cuttings from drilling operations. These landfills employ radiation detectors to ensure that no regulated radioactive materials are received by the facility. In addition, DEC staff provide on-site oversight and inspection to ensure operations are in compliance with state regulations."" The DEC said it is ""in the process of strengthening these already robust regulations."" A public review and comment period about the proposed revisions ended Sept. 13, Frazier said. When asked to clarify the confusion over banning some waste while accepting others, the DEC did not offer a clear response. Our ruling During a hearing on water quality, Basil Seggos, the New York State commissioner for environmental conservation, said ""no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State."" Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection indicates waste from fracking is transported from Pennsylvania’s wells to three landfills in New York. The waste was transported as recently as earlier this year. Well operators did not report sending any flowback or fluid waste from fracking to New York State this year, but they have in years past.

Does Arizona’s recreational marijuana initiative block new dispensaries?
","Arizona is one of five states where voters will decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana this November. Our partners at ABC15 have reported on the weed effort in Arizona, noting that individual, anti-weed contributions outnumber pro-weed contributions almost four to one. A Sept. 15 attack ad from an anti-marijuana group, Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, portrays the potential passage of Proposition 205, which would legalize recreational marijuana, as a monopoly for existing medical marijuana dispensaries. ""Prop. 205 is a 20-page special interest goldmine that elevates the rights of users over the public,"" the ad’s narration claims. ""(It) blocks market entry for new dispensaries."" The first medical marijuana dispensary in Arizona opened in December 2012 after voters approved the act in November 2010. But, we wondered, would new dispensaries hoping to sell legal, recreational pot not be able to do so under this initiative? The state’s Health Services Department currently regulates medical marijuana in Arizona. If Prop. 205 passes, a new state agency, the Arizona Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control, would regulate both recreational and medical marijuana. Part of this would be done through a seven-member Marijuana Commission within the new agency, which would approve and deny licenses. Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, said existing medical marijuana dispensaries are given preference to become retail marijuana outlets. ""Newcomers to the market cannot even apply for licenses until after Dec. 17, 2017, nearly a full year after medical marijuana business owners can apply and have licenses awarded to them,"" Archer said. But that is not the same thing as an outright block on new dispensaries. Will Humble, a health policy expert at the University of Arizona, said the new agency still has to set several rules if Prop. 205 passes, including how much pot each retail store can produce, as well as a cap on the number of stores permitted. ""While the existing medical marijuana dispensaries would have a distinct advantage to becoming a retail store, it’s not a total blocked entry. The Prop. 205 cap is 147 dispensaries,"" Humble said. According to Humble, the agency could also add an undetermined number of new stores to ""meet demand"" in 2021.  Barrett Marson, a spokesman with the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-marijuana group, said there is ""certainly growth"" for new licenses in the initiative. Moreover, according to the initiative’s language, the new agency would not set rules on recreational marijuana until September 2017. Our ruling The ad claims Prop. 205 ""blocks market entry for new dispensaries."" While the ballot language does give an upper hand to existing medical marijuana dispensaries, it does not completely block a new dispensary from entering a legal recreational marijuana market.
