Rep. Forbes says Federal Register containing regulations has 34,000 pages, weighs 340 pounds
","
For Rep. Randy Forbes, government regulation is truly a weighty issue.

""Over the past several years, increasing and complex government regulations have stifled business creation and hindered jobs growth,"" Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a recent blog post.

""The Federal Register - which houses all Washington regulations - is 34,000 pages in length and weighs in at more than 340 pounds,"" the congressman said.

The Federal Register, which lists government agencies’ new regulations, proposed rules, and presidential papers, comes out every business day.

The National Archives and Records Administration, which helps compile the document, dubs it the ""daily newspaper of the federal government."" Published on recycled newsprint, it looks like a 8.5-by-11 inch technical manual.

Does it really contain 34,000 pages and weigh more than 340 pounds?  We asked Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, for the sources of the congressman’s claim.

Let’s start with the page count.

Hack sent us a link to a Government Printing Office synopsis of the June 14, 2011 Federal Register, which was published the day Forbes made his claim. The table of contents shows the Federal Register at the end of that day -- not including its table of contents and indexes --  was 34,844 pages. That’s close to what Forbes cited.

The figure is actually the running tally of the number of pages of the register published so far in 2011. Each daily edition is a couple hundred pages. As each business day passes, the size of the annual Federal Register increases.

In 2010, the register totaled 81,405 pages, said Jim Hemphill, the special assistant to the director of the Federal Register.

Although most Americans probably haven’t heard of the register, it's a resource to lawyers, journalists and special interest groups trying to keep tabs on regulations. U.S. agencies use it to publish proposed regulations and solicit public comments on them.

So how much does the Federal Register weigh? Although Hemphill could readily provide its size in pages, he wasn’t aware of anyone ever trying to measure it by the pound.

Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, provided the formula his boss used to back up his claim that the register would tip the scale at more than 340 pounds. He sent us a link to a website from an agency within the Department of Energy that states a 500-sheet ream of standard office paper weighs 5 pounds.

That means if you print it out, the 34,000 pages of the Federal Register would require 68 reams of paper, which would weigh a total of 340 pounds, Hack said.

Actual PDF copies of each daily Federal Register are available on the National Archives website and can be printed out. If that was done with each page printed on a single sheet of paper, it would come out to the weight that Forbes cited.

But there’s a critical flaw in the congressman’s calculations.  

The published copy of the Federal Register prints pages on both the front and back of each sheet of paper. So the 34,000 pages would be published on 17,000 sheets.

Therefore the weight would be less than 340 pounds.

We were not in a position to haul 34,000 of pages of the register to a scale, so we devised a way to estimate the register’s weight. We went to the Library of Virginia, got a copy of the May 11, 2011 edition, and asked a librarian to weigh it in the the mail room.

The 399-page edition -- complete with a title page, table of contents and index -- came in at 1 pound, 3 ounces.

We then turned to an overall tally of all daily Federal Registers for 2011 up to and including June 14 - the day Forbes made his statement.  

When we included the pages for tables of contents, title page and index for each daily edition we found there have been about 35,850 pages published so far this year. With every 399 pages coming out to 1 pound, 3 ounces, that means that those nearly 36,000 pages would weigh about 106.7 pounds - less than a third of the weight Forbes cited.

So Forbes was close on the overall page count - actually underestimating it - but wrong on the weight total.

Let’s turn to Forbes’ implication, that all those pages are evidence of regulation run amok.

The register’s annual page count over the past 20 years had generally been on the rise. But there’s disagreement on whether its growth is a meaningful gauge of government oversight.

""I think as a very broad measure it indicates that there is more regulatory activity now than in the past,"" said James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""It’s the most popular measure people cite.""

But Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, is dismissive of linking the register’s size to the amount of regulations. Not everything published in the document, he noted, are regulations.

""So the GSA (General Services Administration) says we need an office building and it needs to be built by these specs. All that’s in the Federal Register. That’s not what I think people mean by calling something ’regulations,’"" Van Doren said. ""Depending on one’s politics and one’s views ... people use the number of pages in the Federal Register as a weapon in political discourse.""

Of the 81,405 pages published in 2010, 46,758 were dedicated to rules or proposed rules. Another 34,306 pages contained notices of federal agency hearings, meetings, investigations, decisions and the like. And 611 pages were presidential documents - things like executive orders and presidential proclamations.

To recap:

To argue that regulation is out of control, Forbes said the Federal Register came to 34,000 pages and weighed 340 pounds.

The congressman was close on the number of pages, slightly underestimating them. But he greatly overstated the Federal Register’s weight by failing to realize that its pages are printed on both sides of paper. And we would point out that less than 60 percent of the register’s pages last year contained regulations.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Jeff Fitzgerald']","
“No fee increases” in Wisconsin’s 2011-13 state budget, Wisconsin GOP Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald says
","
Long before Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed the 2011-2013 state budget on June 26, 2011, he and fellow Republicans in the Legislature boasted that it solves a $3 billion shortfall without raising taxes or fees.

On the tax claim, PolitiFact Wisconsin’s Walk-O-Meter gave the governor a Promise Broken rating after he included tax hikes in his own budget proposal. However, the final budget, which raises three taxes, contains a larger amount of tax cuts, so the net result is an overall tax reduction of more than $23 million, according to the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau.

That’s the tax picture.

But what does the budget do with fees? Taxpayers pay plenty of those, too.

After the budget was approved by the Assembly on June 13, 2011, Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald said:

""To pass a budget like this, with no tax increases and no fee increases, and put the state in the right direction, is something we feel good about.""

""No fee increases"" is the key phrase here -- and the Horicon Republican isn’t alone in uttering it.

Similar claims have been made by other GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Robin Vos of Rochester and Sen. Frank Lasee of DePere, both of whom said the budget passed ""without raising taxes or fees""; Rep. Samantha Kerkman of Powers Lake, who touted ""no increases in state taxes or fees""; and Rep. Kevin Petersen of Waupaca, who said that compared to prior budgets, ""gone are … tax and fee increases"".

When we asked Fitzgerald for evidence to back his ""no fee increases"" claim, we noted that the fiscal bureau -- which both political parties have long cited as a neutral scorekeeper on budget matters -- had determined the budget would raise nine fees over two years by $133 million and reduce eight other fees by $22 million.

That’s a net increase in fees of $111 million.

Here are some of the major fee increases, as laid out by the fiscal bureau, as well as comments from Fitzgerald spokesman John Jagler.

College tuition: Tuition at University of Wisconsin System colleges would rise 5.5 percent  in each year of the two-year budget cycle, raising $107 million.

Jagler argued that the tuition hikes normally are not identified as fee increases in the state budget and that they are labeled as such this year only because the budget gives more autonomy to the UW System. That results in a ""technical change"" in how the figures are reported, he said in the email.

The fiscal bureau, however, says it has tallied tuition increases as fees in the past.

As we’ll see, even if we set aside tuition hikes, there are plenty of other fee increases to consider.

Lender fees: Licensed lenders would have to pay a new $5,000 annual fee in order to make motor vehicle title loans, raising $500,000 over two years. New fees would also be imposed on beer wholesalers.

Said Jagler: ""A new fee isn’t a fee increase.""

That’s a novel argument, but one that clearly goes against the GOP message -- that the budget does not rely on higher fees to be balanced. New fees obviously increase the amount of revenue the state takes in.

Driver’s license tests: Currently, drivers pay $15 to take a test for a regular automobile license, but if they fail, they can take two more tests without paying another fee. Under the new budget, drivers would have to pay another $15 for each additional test. That would raise $634,600 over two years.

Unlike the new lender fee, Jagler didn’t label the driving test fee as new. He acknowledged that it’s a fee drivers wanting to take additional tests would have to pay.

Background checks: Non-profit organizations would have to pay $7 -- up from $2 -- for every criminal record search they request on individuals, a change projected to raise $2.5 million. The fee for other entities would drop to $7 from $13, resulting in a loss of $1.92 million. That means the state will net an additional $580,000 in fees.

Said Jagler: ""A fee that goes down or stays the same is not an increase.""

OK, but fees would rise for non-profits and that would help drive an overall increase in revenue of $580,000.

You get the picture. And it’s not what you might have imagined it would be if you heard the phrase ""no fee increases.""

To sum up:

Fitzgerald said the new state budget contains ""no fee increases."" The non-partisan state fiscal bureau, however, lists nine fee increases (along with eight fee reductions). The net result is an increase in fees of $111 million. It’s ridiculous to claim there are no fee increases when some fees are being created, others are being raised and the result is more cash in the kitty.

We rate his claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C46A440>],/factchecks/2011/jul/01/jeff-fitzgerald/no-fee-increases-wisconsins-2011-13-state-budget-w/
"['Agriculture', 'National', 'Energy', 'Renewable Fuels Association']","
Industry warns gas prices would rise 89 cents without ethanol
","We recently noticed an advertisement in the Washington, D.C. Metro system that made a striking claim about ethanol -- an alcohol made from fermented corn that is added to gasoline, usually comprising 10 percent of a gallon.

First, some background to help explain the context of the ad. Supporters and critics of ethanol have battled for years over the wisdom of continuing longstanding ethanol subsidies. Currently, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, or VEETC, offers a credit $0.45 for every gallon of ethanol blended with gasoline. The credit had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, but Congress extended it for another year.

On June 16, 2011, the U.S. Senate approved legislation to end the VEETC subsidy, as well as end a separate, 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on imported ethanol. While the Senate measure is not expected to become law, it re-energized the debate over ethanol subsidies. With the law’s looming sunset at the end of 2011, the debate is likely to continue for at least the rest of this year.

Those who favor rolling back ethanol subsidies argue that a roughly $6 billion subsidy is unsustainable given today’s rising national debt.

However, the ethanol industry, represented by a group called the Renewable Fuels Association, has made an aggressive counterattack, arguing that ethanol is vital to keeping a lid on gasoline prices -- potentially a potent issue for Americans as gasoline hovers between $3 and $4 per gallon.

The trade group's Metro station advertisement mirrors other information available on the group’s website. It says, ""Ethanol reduced gas prices by 89 cents per gallon in 2010. Ethanol reduced the average American’s household gasoline bill by more than $800. If ethanol disappeared, gas prices could rise by as much as 92 percent.""

We checked these figures first with the Renewable Fuels Association, and then with outside experts.

The RFA cited a study by two economists -- Xiaodong Du from the University of Wisconsin and Dermot J. Hayes of Iowa State University -- published in April 2011. Using mathematical modeling, the study concluded that in 2010, the presence of ethanol reduced gasoline prices by 89 cents per gallon. Meanwhile, the study said, if ethanol production came to an immediate halt, the estimated gasoline price increase would range from 41 percent to 92 percent.

Meanwhile, the trade group extrapolated from the paper’s findings to produce the claim that ""ethanol reduced the average American’s household gasoline bill by more than $800.""

""In 2010 alone, ethanol reduced the average American household’s gasoline bill by more than $800,"" RFA said in a news release, citing data from the Federal Highway Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Energy Department showing that the average American household consumed 900 gallons of gasoline at an average price of $2.74 per gallon in 2010. The group calculated that the average family’s annual gasoline bill was $2,470, an amount that would have been closer to $3,270 without ethanol.

So RFA can point to a study by two university economists to back up its numbers. But what is the group leaving out? We’ll point out a few concerns.

The study’s funding. In the paper, the authors acknowledged the Renewable Fuel Association ""for their financial support."" This doesn’t mean the study is right or wrong, but it does mean that the RFA is quoting research it helped support financially, so the findings deserve independent scrutiny.

Choice of time period. The paper cited the 89 cent figure for 2010, but it also offered a longer-term calculation that’s less eye-popping, since it’s not based on a short period in which gasoline prices happened to be unusually high.

Specifically, between January 2000 to December 2010, the authors found, ethanol reduced gasoline prices by 25 cents per gallon nationally. That’s still a notable amount -- and the ad’s wording accurately described the figure they were using -- but 25 cents per gallon is less than one-third the amount it was in 2010. This means that RFA was highlighting a time period that made the claim more striking.

The paper poses an unrealistic scenario. The Senate bill would not have touched other federal laws that encourage ethanol production, including a ""renewable fuel standard"" initiated in 2005 that requires transportation fuel to contain a certain amount of renewable fuel blended with gasoline. So the standard by which the RFA-backed paper made its assumptions -- that ""ethanol production came to an immediate halt"" -- is not plausible in the real world.

""This is a fantasy study dreamed up to answer a question that no one has asked: What would happen if ethanol disappeared?"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that has been critical of ethanol subsidies. ""We are not arguing that ethanol should cease to exist, just that it make its way in the marketplace. Studies have clearly shown that absent subsidies like the tax credit and the mandate, there would be ethanol production. So it is irrelevant.""

To back up his claim that legislation now under consideration wouldn’t kill off the ethanol industry, Ellis pointed to research by Bruce A. Babcock, director of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University.

Babcock cited a study he co-wrote with an Iowa State colleague, Jacinto F. Fabiosa. They found that between 2005 and 2009, margins in the ethanol industry were wide enough that ""a large expansion in U.S. corn ethanol production would have occurred even if the subsidies and mandates had not been in place. The reason is that the return on investment in ethanol would have been so high that investors still would have brought their capital to the industry.""

The ad focuses on short-term impacts and ignores long-term impacts. Babcock said a big part of why ethanol production has kept gasoline prices low is that it has kept U.S. oil refineries, and to some extent world refineries, from having to operate at full capacity. That matters because when refineries operate at full capacity, they are able to charge higher prices. And if demand rises high enough, they’d have to pay to build new refinery capacity.

But while Babcock says this ""is a credible short-term and medium-term argument, over the longer term,"" oil companies would adjust their capacity so that ""over time, the impact of ethanol on gas prices should shrink.""

Similarly, while the trade association is almost certainly correct that a price shock would result from a sudden disappearance of ethanol -- which, as we said, is a highly unlikely scenario -- the experts we spoke to said that a new equilibrium would eventually be reached, and that equilibrium would likely produce cost increases well below the immediate, price-shock figures cited in the trade group’s ad.

RFA ignores other negative impacts of the subsidies in the economy. For starters, there is evidence that subsidies for corn used in ethanol have raised corn prices and, in turn, hiked prices for agricultural sectors that rely on corn for feed, such as beef production.

While estimates of the impact have varied, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in a 2009 study that ""the increased use of ethanol accounted for about 10 percent to 15 percent of the rise in food prices between April 2007 and April 2008. In turn, that increase will boost federal spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program) and child nutrition programs by an estimated $600 million to $900 million in fiscal year 2009.""

In addition, RFA’s ad doesn’t account for ""all the coal, natural gas, diesel fuel, soil, ground water, etc., that were used up to produce ethanol,"" said Tad Patzek, an engineering professor at the University of Texas. ""These valuable raw materials could have been used differently to produce more electricity, more food, lessen soil erosion (and) limit ground- and surface water contamination. All of these activities would be beneficial for the country, far outweighing a marginal and temporary increase of gasoline’s cost if ethanol subsidies were withdrawn suddenly, and its production collapsed.""

Finally, the ad doesn’t factor in roughly $6 billion direct hit to the Treasury (and, indirectly, to American taxpayers) from the subsidies, even though any comprehensive balance-sheet anaysis would include that.

When we presented the gist of our analysis to the Renewable Fuels Association, the group made several points. Officials said they used the 2010 figures because they’re most relevant to current price conditions. They said that using their model, even a 25-cent increase in gasoline prices would amount to $34.5 billion per year in added costs for gasoline -- ""far outweighing"" the annual cost of VEETC.

The group also argued that it’s unfair to include factors outside of the scope of a brief advertisement that focuses squarely on gasoline prices.

""The ad focuses on gas prices,"" said Geoff Cooper, vice president of research and analysis with the Renewable Fuels Association. ""Not food prices. Not corn prices. Not the cost of VEETC. Not lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. We are more than willing to engage in a thoughtful discussion on those issues, but they are outside the scope of the paper on which the ad is based.""

If you include other factors beyond gasoline prices, fairness ""would require you"" to note that ""the production and use of 13 billion gallons of ethanol last year helped create more than 400,000 jobs across the economy from agriculture to manufacturing to the service sector. Nearly 70,400 American are directly involved in the production of ethanol,"" said Christina Martin, executive vice president of the Renewable Fuels Association. Ethanol production adds nearly $54 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product, she said.

Finally, on the issue of whether the immediate end to ethanol is realistic, Cooper said that ""there have been recent calls to repeal the renewable fuel standard, kill the tax credit, and essentially undo all of the entire industry’s policy foundation. So, it is not entirely ‘unrealistic’ to envision a scenario in which ethanol production is significantly curtailed.""

Still, we’re not convinced. While the Senate bill would have ended certain subsidies, it would not have banned production outright, and even the changes proposed in the Senate bill would not have touched the renewable fuel standard, which aids the ethanol industry and ensures its partial or even complete survival. Even if more sweeping changes than those in the Senate bill were imposed, independent experts tell us that the likelihood of the industry’s sudden collapse would be remote.

So while changing or eliminating the law on ethanol subsidies might have an impact on prices at the pump, it’s highly unlikely that the industry would cease to exist -- so the immediate impact on gasoline prices would be less than 89 cents, and even lower as markets adjust in the longer term. We rate the Renewable Fuels Association claim Barely True.

"['Abortion', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Obama's repeal of policy means tax dollars funding abortions all over the world
","
At a Los Angeles anti-abortion rally, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said ""folks in Washington"" have failed ""to protect citizens at every stage in life."" 
In President Barack Obama’s first week in office, Perry said, he ""chose to overturn the ‘Mexico City Policy,’ which basically means that your federal tax dollars can now be used to fund abortions all over the world."" 
Perry’s June 12 statement landed in national news stories, including reports by National Public Radio and the Associated Press; readers asked us whether Perry was correct. 
Back story: Obama rescinded what is known as the Mexico City Policy on his third day as president in January 2009, according to news accounts posted online. The policy, first put in place by President Ronald Reagan, requires foreign nongovernmental groups getting U.S. family planning funds to agree that they will not perform or ""actively promote"" abortion as a method of family planning outside of the United States, even if using money from other sources. 
Those family planning grants are distributed through the U.S. Agency for International Development and are used to fund a variety of activities, including distribution of contraceptives and training of health care workers. Groups may also use the funds to provide emergency treatment for women who have been hurt by or become ill from an abortion. 
The Reagan administration announced the expanded restrictions at the 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City (the source of the policy’s name), saying that the United States ""does not consider abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs and will no longer contribute to those of which it is a part."" 
Since then, the Mexico City Policy has been in place during Republican administrations and repealed during Democratic ones. 
According to a 2001 Congressional Research Service report, the policy defined abortion promotion — banned under the Mexico City Policy — as working ""to increase the availability or use of abortion as a method of family planning."" Prohibited activities included operating a counseling service that includes information on the benefits and availability of abortion, advising someone that abortion is available and lobbying a foreign government to legalize abortion as a method of family planning. 
The policy allowed for several exceptions. Among them: A group receiving U.S. funds was allowed to perform abortions if a woman’s life was threatened or if a pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. Aid recipients could also continue to treat women who had been injured during legal or illegal abortions 
So, is Perry correct that the policy’s 2009 removal by Obama means federal tax dollars can fund abortions all over the world? 
Not so, says Ellen Starbird, deputy director of USAID’s office of population and reproductive health, because regardless of the Mexico City Policy, a 1973 federal law known as the Helms amendment prohibits U.S. foreign aid from paying for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries. 
A 2010 CRS report says that after 1973 but before the Mexico City Policy came to be, no U.S. funds could be used directly to pay for abortion as a method of family planning abroad, though in countries where abortion was legal, foreign NGOs receiving U.S. aid could use other money to perform them. In those cases, the report says, the groups were required to keep ""segregated accounts for U.S. money in order to demonstrate compliance with the abortion restrictions."" 
Once the Mexico City Policy was in place, groups that wanted U.S. family planning aid couldn’t provide abortions, regardless of the funding source. Conversely, now that the policy has been lifted, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning aid. 
Seems straightforward. But as we’ve learned with other abortion-related fact-checks, it’s not. 
After learning about the funding restrictions in the Helms amendment, we circled back to Perry’s office. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier stood by Perry’s statement, saying that ""if U.S. taxpayer money is going to groups that provide abortions, regardless of any other services they provide, it’s going toward promoting and funding abortions."" 
Likewise, Kellie Fiedorek, a lawyer for Americans United for Life, a pro-life advocacy group, told us that without the policy intact, ""Americans’ tax dollars may still go to NGOs that provide abortions."" 
Austin Ruse, president of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, a pro-life think tank, told us that a group’s ability to move its money around is the key to assessing whether Perry’s statement is accurate. ""If you believe money is fungible, then what Perry said is true,"" Ruse said. 
That concern also has played prominently in debates in Congress and statehouses over providing domestic abortion providers with funding for other services. 
Proponents of the Mexico City Policy also say that groups newly getting USAID money for family planning can then free up other funds for abortions. 
USAID spokesman Nicole Schiegg told us that the agency ""has a robust compliance system in place to ensure that our funds are not used for prohibited activities."" 
Starbird told us that if a foreign NGO that provides abortions receives U.S. family planning aid, it is required to keep that money separate from its own. The groups are not allowed ""free rein"" with the funds, she said. 
Starbird said each award to a foreign NGO is for a specific purpose, and written agreements specify limits such as the Helms’ restriction. She also said recipients are required to account for how the funds are spent, including any money awarded for overhead or indirect costs, and USAID workers monitor the programs. 
For longer perspective, we asked Barbara Crane, an author of a 2001 article on the Mexico City Policy for Science magazine, about Perry’s statement and the funding issues raised by the policy’s proponents. 
Crane, a former USAID employee working for Ipas, an international NGO that supports abortion rights, suggested the government takes a chance on money being misspent whenever it makes an award. 
Crane said, though, that if the government holds groups accountable for delivering the services for which the aid money was awarded, ""there is little opportunity for … the organization to divert funds to support current or new activities in other areas."" 
We unsuccessfully sought independent research into how foreign NGOs have spent USAID family-planning money. Separately, Perry’s office offered no evidence of U.S. family planning funds enabling particular NGOs to perform abortions. 
We also could not determine how many foreign NGOs receive U.S. family planning aid and also perform abortions. Starbird told us that the agency doesn’t ask groups seeking family planning money whether they provide abortions. But Crane, of Ipas, speculated that most don’t engage in abortion-related activities, and many are working in nations that have strict abortion laws. 
Where does that leave us? 
With the policy’s repeal, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning money. However, longstanding federal law bars any aid from being spent on abortions, and USAID polices how its family-planning grants are spent. 
But Perry’s statement retains a sliver of truth in that it’s possible some aid could be misspent or that U.S. aid could free up other money to go toward abortions. 
We rate the statement Barely True.

Rep. Marcy Kaptur says defense spending consumes more than half of the discretionary budget
","
Members of Congress peeved with the decision to involve the United States in Libya took to the House of Representatives floor on June 24 to voice their objections.

Toledo Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur was among them. Irked by the cost of U.S. involvement in the Middle East, she opined that the U.S. bears a disproportionate burden during joint actions with other countries, and tied the nation’s debt to ""expenditures of over $1 trillion in the past decade on wars that have not been paid for.""

""Creeping defense commitments in that region and globally now consume over half of the U.S. discretionary budget annually,"" Kaptur said. ""It is an astounding predicament 20 years after the end of the Cold War, as jobless Americans question whether our federal government even sees their plight.""

Is it true, as Kaptur says, that the United States’ global defense commitments ""now consume over half the U.S. discretionary budget annually?"" PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

Kaptur, a member of the House of Representatives Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, referred us to reports produced by the National Priorities Project, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Congressional Research Servicewhen we contacted her office.

They explain that the federal budget is divided into two types of spending: discretionary and mandatory.

Mandatory spending makes up most of the federal budget. It’s called ""mandatory"" because it’s required by law. Disbursements on popular entitlement programs like Social Security,  Medicare, veterans benefits and food stamps fall under this category. Spending levels for mandatory programs are generally controlled by eligibility criteria for the entitlements, and the size of the recipient pool. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the mandatory share of the federal budget was $1.969 trillion in 2010.

The rest of the federal budget is considered ""discretionary."" Congress decides how this money is spent through the appropriations process. Defense programs as well as education, health, transportation and housing assistance programs are considered discretionary.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, discretionary defense spending was $689 billion in 2010, compared with $677 billion in non-defense expenditures. That’s more than half.

The Congressional Research Service says discretionary defense spending dropped to historically low levels after the fall of the Berlin Wall, but escalated again when the United States went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Between 2000 and 2010, CRS says discretionary defense spending increased 6.8 percent per year, on average, in real terms.

Others can debate the merits or faults of ballooning defense spending.

Kaptur’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing signifcant missing. On the Truth-O-Meter it rates as True.

"['Georgia', 'Immigration', 'History', 'Robert Brown']","
Lawmaker compares immigration law to Black Codes
","
Opponents of Georgia’s new immigration crackdown law are drawing ugly comparisons between it and infamous chapters of civil rights history.  

Some are comparing the effects of House Bill 87 to segregation, saying it will turn Hispanics into second-class citizens. Former state Senate Minority Leader Robert Brown, a Democrat who recently resigned to run for mayor of Macon, hearkened back to Reconstruction in a June 2 news release.

""Georgia leaders should not attempt to satisfy Agribusiness interests by finding ways to selectively enforce what I am now calling the Brown Codes (HB 87), because of its similarity to the Black Codes passed in the 1800s,"" Brown said.

Southern states passed the ""Black Codes"" after the Civil War to force freed slaves back to the plantations. Is Georgia’s HB 87 similar to them?

PolitiFact has ruled on race-tinged analogies before. Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida said that Republican support for requirements that voters show ID cards at the polls means they ""want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws.""

False, we ruled. Although the law could disenfranchise a fraction of minority voters, it would not return the U.S. to Jim Crow.   

Closer to home, HB 87’s more controversial provisions give law enforcement officers more leeway to check the immigration status of people they think violated the law. They also prohibit citizens from harboring, transporting or encouraging illegal immigrants to come into the state under certain circumstances.

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash granted a request for a preliminary injunction that keeps key parts of HB 87 from going into effect.

We asked Brown to explain his ""Brown Codes"" remark. He said workers toil in punishing heat for ""subminimum wages"" in conditions amounting to ""indentured servitude."" (These claims are outside the scope of our inquiry.)

HB 87 intensifies this inequality, Brown said. It allows Hispanics to be singled out for their ethnicity and scares workers from complaining about poor working conditions for fear of deportation.

""Obviously, it’s not exactly the same [as the Black Codes]. It’s just as harsh, relative to the times. This is the 21st century,"" Brown said.

We consulted a half-dozen historians to check Brown’s claim.

The Black Codes are different from Jim Crow legislation, which segregated blacks and whites.  Enacted in former slave states right after the Civil War, the Black Codes tried to force ex-slaves back to their masters.

Unemployed blacks could be arrested as vagrants and hired out to people willing to pay their criminal fines. Blacks who quit their jobs could be arrested and returned to their old bosses, much like runaway slaves. Orphans or children whose parents could not support them could be apprenticed to a master.  

All the experts we interviewed found big holes in Brown’s analogy.

The biggest was this one: The Black Codes aimed to keep freed slaves on their plantations. Georgia’s immigration law pressures illegal immigrants to leave the state. Many of the state’s farmers say illegal immigrants are fleeing in droves.

This result appears to match HB 87’s apparent intent, which is ""to create such a climate of hostility, fear, mistrust and insecurity that all illegal aliens will leave Georgia,"" Thrash ruled.

There are other glaring differences between the Black Codes and Georgia’s law. Immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally to work are here by choice. Obviously, former slaves had no choice.

Swarthmore College professor Richard M. Valelly, an expert on Reconstruction, noted that illegal immigrants aren’t in danger of being re-enslaved. They’re at risk of deportation.

""That's draconian ... but there's a big difference between de facto re-enslavement ... and being sucked into a system that regulates movement across borders,"" Valelly said.

Although scholars agree that the Black Codes and Georgia’s new immigration law are very different, each one we interviewed saw one similarity.

The Black Codes stigmatized blacks. Georgia’s law stigmatizes illegal immigrants, Columbia University professor Eric Foner said. He is the author of ""Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877,"" a well-regarded history of the era.  

""These laws will probably tend to further solidify an underclass who exist outside of the protection of the law,"" said Michael W. Fitzgerald, a history professor at St. Olaf College in Minnesota who has written about the Reconstruction.

University of Georgia professor James C. Cobb, an expert on Southern history, was equally critical. He said HB 87, like the Black Codes, allows for discrimination.

""Under the new immigration bill, people who are, in fact, citizens or eligible for certain legal protections are now subject to having their rights violated simply on the basis of their racial appearance,"" Cobb said.  

Still, we think Brown’s comparison between Georgia’s new immigration crackdown and the Black Codes is fatally flawed.

The Black Codes forced freed slaves back to the fields of their masters. HB 87 chases illegal immigrants out of the state.  

Illegal immigrant workers come here by choice. Slaves were forced here. And the deportation illegal immigrants face is a far cry from the cruelty of re-enslavement.

Both laws do single out groups for stigmatization, but that won’t improve Brown’s rating by much. The difference between the Black Codes and Georgia’s new immigration law is so vast it gives an inaccurate impression.   

We therefore rule Brown’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC8580>],/factchecks/2011/jul/01/robert-brown/lawmaker-compares-immigration-law-black-codes/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Stephen Sweeney']","
New Jersey Senate President Stephen Sweeney says when Gov. Chris Christie was a gubernatorial candidate, he promised “no school cuts”
","
Democrats and Republicans made many promises during the 2009 gubernatorial campaign, but did Chris Christie vow not to slash aid for the state’s public schools?

State Senate President Stephen Sweeney claims he did.

""The governor, who as a candidate promised no school cuts, was well aware that his draconian cuts to education were illegal,"" said Sweeney (D-Gloucester) in a May 24 press release following the New Jersey Supreme Court’s latest ruling on school funding. The court said the state had to send $500 million in additional funding to 31 urban school districts known as Abbott districts.

PolitiFact New Jersey questioned Sweeney’s claim about Christie.

As governor, Christie cut school funding -- he withheld $475 million in aid in 2010 and slashed $820 million in funding from the current budget.. But did he promise to maintain school funding during his campaign? We initially found some conflicting evidence, but then the governor admitted that he had made that promise.

Derek Roseman, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, sent us to two news reports to support Sweeney’s statement: an Asbury Park Press article dated Jan. 9, 2010 that said Christie ""promised not to cut state aid to local school districts"" and another report from the newspaper dated Oct. 14, 2009 that reported Christie ""would keep local education funding flat for the year, saving the planned $500 million increase"" in state aid.  

PolitiFact New Jersey searched newspaper archives and found more contradictory reports, some saying he would cut the aid; others saying he wouldn’t.

The governor’s office did not return two requests for comment.

The conflicting evidence had the Truth-O-Meter jammed, but the governor himself made a statement that tipped its scales.

During a question and answer session on June 28, after the governor signed legislation overhauling public employee benefits, Christie responded to a question about a campaign promise not to change pensions for law enforcement officials.

""When I got here I found circumstances to be different than the governor was characterizing them when I ran. When you are a candidate, what you are restricted to is what the current occupant of the office will tell you about the circumstances surrounding the fiscal state of New Jersey. Gov. Corzine told us that fiscal year '11 was going to be a $6 to $7 billion deficit. It turned out to be $11 billion,"" he said. ""So, I made a lot of other promises. I also said that I wouldn't cut education aid in fiscal year 2011, but when a $6 or $7 billion budget deficit turns into a $11 billion deficit and you don't have the option to print money, you got to make a lot of decisions.""

Now, let’s return to Sweeney’s statement.

Sweeney said Christie promised during his campaign that he would not cut school funding.

The spokesman for the Senate Democrats provided conflicting evidence to support Sweeney’s claim and PolitiFact New Jersey found even more conflicting evidence in news reports.

However, Christie himself recently said he promised not to cut school aid while he was a candidate. We can’t argue with that.

We rate Sweeney’s statement True.

Wisconsin Sen. Dan Kapanke says protesters caused $7.5 million in damage to the Capitol
","
As the unprecedented nine Senate recall elections approach, the red alert has been sounded by state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse)

Facing a challenge from state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse), Kapanke issued an appeal June 28, 2011to subscribers to the National Tea Party Alert email service, seeking support and contributions.

In the email appeal, which came from his campaign office under his signature, Kapanke warns ""if we do not win here, liberals will be emboldened to try this recall tactic in states across the country.""

The email says ""The unprecedented damage and intimidation union protesters caused in Wisconsin this year isn’t over."" It lays out four ""facts you may not know about the impact unions have had in Wisconsin.""

Among them, this headline:  ""Protesters caused $7.5 million in damage to the Wisconsin State House.""

Beneath it: ""Union protesters who swarmed the State House and climbed through windows in an attempt to disrupt the people’s business caused millions in damage in the process.""

We’ve been down this path before.

Since the protests began, PolitiFact Wisconsin has rated seven statements about the conduct of protesters and claims of damage at the Capitol. One was Half True, one Barely True, one False, and four were Pants on Fire.

The Pants on Fire category included one from Kapanke, in which he claimed protesters damaged the windshield of his car. Madison police said it was likely due to a pebble on the highway.

And it also includes a March 3, 2011 claim by Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch who said protesters caused $7.5 million damage to the Capitol.

That’s the same claim Kapanke is making now.

The evidence for Huebsch’s claim -- which was almost immediately retracted -- was a single page, handwritten estimate. The state later paid $13,800 to historic preservation architect Charles Quagliana to assess the impact of weeks of protests on the Capitol and its grounds.

His report said the damages resulted in $270,000 in wear and tear to the building. He cited unintended damage such as nicks and chips to stone, as well as stains to stone from skin oils (such as from hands),  residue from tape used to hang signs and a few marker stains.

""Essentially the building experienced three to five years of wear within a two-week period,"" Quagliana wrote.

We asked Kapanke’s campaign about the $7.5 million claim.

""We issued a correction on that,"" said campaign manager Jennifer Harrington, adding the campaign staff dug up a March 3, 2011 JSOnline blog post based on the original claim.

But later blog posts and the March 4, 2011 Journal Sentinel article shot down the estimate.

The March 4 story included a tour of the Capitol with state officials who said they saw very little obvious damage. They estimated that a cleanup would cost $347,000 if outside specialists were not needed -- an estimate that also turned out to be high.

""Our guys were referencing the original article,"" Harrington said. ""For whatever reason, nobody caught it.""

Kapanke did not respond to requests for comment.

The campaign said an emailed correction had been sent to the tea party group, which sent the original solicitation to its members. Here’s what the Kapanke campaign posted on its website in an attempt to straighten it all out:

""The estimated costs, including security, are in the millions of dollars but are not expected to reach the estimate referenced in the Journal Sentinel. Any costs to the taxpayers that are unnecessary such as damages to public property or recall elections hurt Wisconsin.""

But that statement mixes apples (damages) with oranges (the cost of security) and strawberries (the cost of the recalls, which include three led by Republicans against Democratic senators).

A May 13, 2011 estimate said it cost $7.8 million to bring in police officers from around the state to handle the Capitol protests. The report says that figure is expected to grow because the estimate does not include overtime.

But Kapanke’s original solicitation never mentioned security costs.

So where does that leave us ... again?

Kapanke’s campaign staff cited a March news account with a wildly inflated estimate of damage to the Capitol. That estimate was almost immediately withdrawn, and then reduced to $272,000 -- a fraction of the original estimate. The campaign acknowledged its mistake. Yet its revised statement changed the nature of the claim, broadening it from a claim solely about physical damage to the building.

It’s starting to smell like a whole bunch of grills on a holiday weekend.

We rated an earlier $7.5 million Capitol damage claim Pants on Fire.

This one, too.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3E9200>],/factchecks/2011/jun/30/dan-kapanke/wisconsin-sen-dan-kapanke-says-protesters-caused-7/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says 2012-13 state budget ""leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund.""
","
In a recent New Orleans appearance, Texas Gov. Rick Perry recapped legislative action back home balancing the 2012-13 state budget while, he crowed, leaving billions in reserve.

Perry told the Republican Leadership Conference on June 18: ""To preserve our job-friendly climate, the Texas Legislature didn’t raises taxes this last legislative session while balancing their budget and maintaining essential services. And I might add, that new budget leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund.""

Some of what Perry celebrated isn’t at issue. Lawmakers must balance each budget; it’s a state constitutional requirement. Also, the GOP-steered 2011 Legislature never considered a tax increase.

Whether the resulting plan maintains essential services is subject to debate; time should tell.

For this article, we wondered if Perry’s correct that the budget will ultimately leave $6 billion in the state’s so-called rainy day fund, which has a current balance of $5 billion, according to the state comptroller’s office. The fund is fed by state oil and gas oil production taxes.

Some background: In January, state Comptroller Susan Combs predicted the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, would have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013. That figure was later whittled to $6.4 billion after legislators used $3.2 billion to cover a deficit in the current budget that runs through August.

But there’s a catch, potentially a biggun.

Republican leaders acknowledge the budget signed into law by Perry under-funds the state’s projected share of Medicaid costs by an estimated $4.4 billion. A summary portion of the budget says that’s the amount the state expects the program to need in supplemental state aid in 2013. Also, the new budget includes a kind of IOU by deferring a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts from the end of the 2013 fiscal year to fiscal 2014.

In separate interviews, the chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and House Appropriations Committee agreed that $6.4 billion should accumulate in the fund over the next two years. But, they said, lawmakers will have designs on those dollars when they meet to start writing the next budget in January 2013.

""There’s going to be a demand on the"" fund, said Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan. ""I decided to use it as a backstop.""

Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, said the $6 billion-plus ""is reserved for future spending"" because of the estimated Medicaid shortfall and the possibility lawmakers will restore school district payments to their usual schedule. ""We kicked the ball down the road,"" Pitts said.

From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, Ogden said, ""I feel good.... From a truth-in-budgeting standpoint, we should have gone ahead and committed"" money from the fund.

Caveat: Pitts and Ogden noted that fiscal expectations could change considerably before legislators confront the next budget. The state’s economy could grow faster than the comptroller projects, Medicaid demands could fall short of the state’s latest forecasts, Congress could even change what it expects states to fund.

Of course, the reverse could also happen, ratcheting up the state’s fiscal obligations.

So, as Perry says, lawmakers left $6 billion in the fund. However, if projections hold, that money looks likely to be sucked up in 2013 to make up for this year’s legislative decisions to under-fund Medicaid costs and postpone a payment to school districts.

Broadly, Perry’s statement leaves the misimpression that Texas state government is sailing along without financial frets. We rate this blue-sky claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1751C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-lawmakers-balanced-budget-an/

Yard sign claims Barack Obama has fired more cruise missiles than any Nobel Peace Prize winner
","
The decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama in 2009, the first year of his presidency, has long rankled his opponents, who felt he was inexperienced and hadn't earned the prestigious award.

And even many of Obama’s supporters were disappointed by his decisions to continue the U.S. role in Iraq and send more troops to Afghanistan.

So when Obama in March 2011 decided to enforce a ""no-fly zone"" to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from crushing rebel forces, criticism flared.

One of the most cutting lines, which ricocheted around blogs and even appeared on bumper stickers from a Libertarian website, stated: ""Obama’s fired more cruise missiles than all other Nobel peace prize winners combined.""

A version of that slogan was put on a sign (with ""missles"" misspelled) along Route 12 near Keene, N.H., by Mark Edgington, a libertarian talk-radio host whose program, Free Talk Live, is heard on about 100 stations around the country.

Edgington said he believes the sign is true because of what he's read on the Internet -- plus the fact that cruise missiles were not so available when other wartime leaders won Nobel peace prizes.

""They didn’t have cruise missiles around then, so I felt relatively confident that it was true,"" said Edgington, who said his concern was also directly tied to Obama’s decision to intervene in Libya without seeking congressional authorization.

""I find the actions to be unconstitutional. And I still think there is a greater message: he’s an awfully big killer to have received the Peace Prize, and I would have said the same thing about (former President George W.) Bush,"" he told PolitiFact.

But is Barack Obama really a warmonger? And does the Dalai Lama (winner, 1989) know about this?

First, a crash course in cruise missiles. They include everything from the short-range Chinese Eagle Strike missile to the U.S. Tomahawk Land Attack missile, which has a range of 1,500 miles.

The Federation of American Scientists, an independent Washington-based group created in 1945 to analyze national security issues related to science and technology, defines cruise missiles as ""an unmanned self-propelled guided vehicle that sustains flight through aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path and whose primary mission is to place an ordnance or special payload on a target.""

More simply put, cruise missiles, often fired from sea or air, are jet-propelled, as opposed to rocket-propelled missiles. Rather than the arc of a rocket, they fly more like a plane to avoid radar.

At least 12 exporting countries -- Great Britain, the United States, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Taiwan -- have developed them, according to the FAS website, and dozens of other countries have some variant in their arsenals.

They aren’t cheap, either -- Tomahawks now cost about $1.1 million apiece, the Navy said recently.

Cruise missiles can trace their antecedents to the infamous German V-1, or ""buzz bomb,"" of World War II. And some countries have had short-range, anti-ship cruise missiles for years.

John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington-based website of military information, said the U.S. relied on them as part of its nuclear arsenal for most of the Cold War and then began to deploy them as conventional weapons.

Pike said current-day cruise missiles’ major debut came in 1991 during the Gulf War under President George H.W. Bush. That campaign saw almost 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired.

An elite group

Given the limited time frame that cruise missiles have been used, the number of Nobel laureates who could have fired them is limited.

For starters, Nobel laureates such as the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (1997), Burmese human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi (1991) and Doctors Without Borders (1999) aren’t going to be firing cruise missiles -- ever.

Similarly, while the United States fired them in Serbia as part of a NATO air campaign, they can’t be attributed to 1991 Nobel laureate Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations, which had peacekeeping troops in the Balkans.

And former President Jimmy Carter, who won the prize in 2002, was not directly involved in any major hostilities while in office, outside of trying to rescue the American Embassy hostages in Iran.

Mikhail Gorbachev (Nobel, 1990) was known for helping to end the Cold War and reducing the nuclear arsenal, but did preside over the Soviet Union during its final years in its invasion of Afghanistan. Pike noted that western accounts of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are ""necessarily incomplete,"" but says he ""cannot imagine what type of cruise missile they would have used"" there.

And while the Israelis have also developed cruise missiles over the years, some reportedly for nuclear purposes, they have held them largely in check.

Accounts of the 1973 Yom Kippur War indicate that the Egyptians used about two dozen short-range Soviet-made anti-ship cruise missiles against the Israelis, which would implicate then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat (who won the Nobel along with Israel’s Menachem Begin in 1978). And the Israelis reportedly fired anti-ship Gabriel missiles at Egyptian and Syrian targets, sinking 10 of their boats.

But even if these were to be considered true cruise missiles, future Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, who shared the prize with Yasser Arafat in 1994, were not in power at the time, nor was Begin. And the numbers fall short of U.S. salvos. 
The Obama Tally 
So is Obama a cruise-missile-firing standout among Nobel laureates?

He has fired at least 192, according to the Pentagon’s March 28 briefing about Libya, and is the fourth American president in a row to launch them. But he's the only president in that group to win the peace prize.

Vice President Al Gore, who went on to win his Nobel in 2007 for his work on global warming, supported the American use of cruise missiles in the 1999 NATO effort to protect Kosovo. And, in fact, as president, Bill Clinton deployed Tomahawks repeatedly, sending well over 600 cruise missiles during his administration at targets in Iraq, Serbia, Sudan and Afghanistan. But, Clinton was commander in chief, not Gore.

It’s also worth noting that the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize winner, former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, has been linked to the secret bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. But he and Richard Nixon used bombers, not nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, for that campaign.

Experts said they believe the sign's claim about Obama and cruise missiles appears technically true, but also merits some context.

George R. Lucas Jr., the chairman in ethics at the Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership at the U.S. Naval Academy and a professor of ethics and public policy at the Naval Postgraduate School, said by e-mail that the statement was probably ""true by definition"" and undoubtedly ""deliberately ironic"" to score a point.

""My own sense is that this president (has) behaved very responsibly with the use of military force, but that, like all recent presidents, he has faced circumstances that are profoundly complex, and in which the decisions to use force are open to question and criticism,"" Lucas wrote.

For his part, Obama, in a March 28, 2011, speech, defended the Libyan strikes, saying they were for a humanitarian purpose, intended to save the city of Benghazi ""and the people within.""

Based on our review of historical records and interviews with military historians, it appears the sign along the New Hampshire highway is correct. The next closest contender was Sadat during the Yom Kippur war, but it appears he was far short of the number fired by Obama, even in combination with other laureates. If we hear of additional evidence, we'll revisit this item. But in the meantime, the numbers indicate the sign is correct. We rate the statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF1D00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/30/yard-sign/yard-sign-claims-barack-obama-has-fired-more-cruis/
"['Ohio', 'Federal Budget', 'Jim Jordan']","
Rep. Jim Jordan says 7 of 18 food programs check out, but 11 were deemed ineffective
","
Duplication and wasteful spending in federal welfare programs are targets near and dear to Rep. Jim Jordan.

The Ohio Republican chairs an influential group, the Republican Study Committee. The group’s political beliefs generally intersect with those of the Tea Party, and they include a desire to stop wasteful government spending.

Toward that end, Jordan called a hearing of a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee, which he chairs, to talk about potential duplication in federal welfare programs.  

Reading his opening remarks, Jordan touched on a General Accounting Office recommendation that more study is needed on the effectiveness of the federal programs.

""They found that only seven of 18 federal food assistance programs have been associated with positive health and nutrition outcomes,"" Jordan said, ""while the remaining 11 have not been effective.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.  Were nearly two-thirds of the food assistance programs really deemed ineffective?

We started with a GAO report, released in March 2011, that identified 34 areas where agencies, offices, or initiatives have similar or overlapping objectives or provide similar services. The areas spanned the federal government, touching on programs in agriculture, defense, economic development, energy, general government, health, homeland security, international affairs, and social services.

In some cases, the report said, financial benefits ranging from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars annually could be realized by improving efficiency and eliminating duplication.

Eighteen programs, most of them overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, spent more than $62.5 billion on domestic food and nutrition assistance in fiscal year 2008. Programs' spending ranged from $4 million for the smallest program to more than $37 billion for the largest.

The system of programs works to ensures that millions of low-income people are adequately fed. The GAO found that the system ""shows signs of overlap and inefficent use of resources.""

During the hearing, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the Cleveland Democrat who is the oversight committee’s ranking member, told Jordan he would support more study but not cuts in benefits. (See related PolitiFact item)

The GAO ""did not find waste, fraud and abuse in the administration and delivery of these programs,"" Kucinich said. ""It does not recommend delivering fewer benefits to those in need.""

Jordan said the GAO report left the question of whether the programs are working. What the report did not say that 11 of 18 programs were not effective.

Jordan’s press secretary, Meghan Snyder, acknowledged that his characterization of the 11 programs as ineffective ""was a misstatement. It should have been 'have not been shown to be effective.' ""

She quoted the pertinent statement in the GAO report: ""Little is known about the effectiveness of the remaining 11 programs because they have not been well studied.""

That's an important distinction. Nothing can fairly be said about the effectiveness of programs that have not been evaluated.

Jordan's point was that the programs do need to be studied, Snyder said. Language she cited from the report shows the GAO would agree: ""As part of its broader recommendation, GAO suggested that USDA (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) consider which of the lesser-studied programs need further research, and USDA agreed to consider the value of examining potential inefficiencies and overlap among smaller programs.""

Where does that leave us?

The first part of Jordan's statement, part of remarks he read at the hearing, was correct in that seven of 18 food assistance programs were associated with positive health and nutrition outcomes.

But the second part of his claim, that other 11 were found to be ineffective, was inaccurate. To his credit, his office readily acknowledged the mistake. But a tenet of PolitiFact is that words matter, and in this case, a part of his remarks made in a formal hearing was inaccurate.

His underlying point -- that more assessment of the programs is needed -- is buttressed by the GAO report.

With half the statement on point but the other half off target, on the Truth-O-Meter his claim rates as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0A1D00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/30/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-says-7-18-food-programs-check-out-1/

Acting Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio says he can’t release his internal affairs record
","
Acting Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio has set many precedents during his tenure with the Newark Police Department.

But there is one distinction he doesn’t want: ""to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey"" to release his internal affairs record.

During a recent interview on FOX 5’s ""Good Day New York"" program, a reporter said to DeMaio, ""The city council president, Donald Payne Jr., has really been pressing. He wants to see your internal affairs record. He believes there have been infractions in the past, committed by you. He wants to see your record. Why not release it to him?""

""It's really that I can't,"" DeMaio replied. ""There are Attorney General guidelines in place that protect it because of what's in those records. It's any allegation ... what I can say is there’s no sustained complaints on my record. I don't want to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey to set that precedent. It’s just not an issue.""

PolitiFact New Jersey learned there are guidelines covering different files kept on police officers, and there are strict protections on internal affairs files to maintain their confidentiality. But there are exceptions -- one of which would allow the release of DeMaio’s internal affairs file.

First, let’s explain why DeMaio is being asked to release his records.

DeMaio was appointed acting top cop in Newark days before the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the Newark Police Department.

The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey last year petitioned the federal government to investigate alleged civil-rights abuses by the department. When the previous police director, Garry McCarthy, announced his departure, ACLU-NJ Executive Director Deborah Jacobs asked Newark Mayor Cory Booker to require any internal candidate for the position  to ""voluntarily disclose to the public their work assignment history and their internal affairs/disciplinary history.""

After DeMaio’s appointment was announced, Jacobs wrote in a May 10 opinion-editorial piece, ""For DeMaio, the need for transparency is especially pressing,"" citing a 2007 incident when DeMaio was reprimanded by the state Attorney General’s Office for questioning a witness about his immigration status, as well as other concerns about DeMaio’s reputation in the community.

In Jacobs’ op-ed, she referred to the files she wants released as both internal affairs records and disciplinary records.

City council members and a group of Newark pastors have also called for DeMaio to release his file, which they often refer to as his disciplinary record.

But a disciplinary record is generally not maintained as a separate file. The state Attorney General’s Office recommends police departments keep a personnel file, an internal affairs file and a medical file on police officers.

A Booker spokeswoman told us the Newark Police Department follows that system.

DeMaio correctly stated that state Attorney General guidelines protect internal affairs files. The guidelines state that ""the nature and source of internal allegations, the progress of internal affairs investigations, and the resulting materials are confidential information.""

The guidelines describe several ""limited circumstances"" under which records from internal affairs investigations can be released, including upon a court order and upon the request of the county prosecutor or Attorney General.

But the guidelines also state, ""the law enforcement executive officer may authorize access [to] a particular file or record for good cause.""

The state Attorney General’s Office refused to confirm that the guidelines authorize Newark’s police director to release an internal affairs file.

Booker’s spokeswoman said the police director is the ""law enforcement executive officer"" in the city. She also noted, ""it should be pointed out that when they say a ‘particular file’ they mean incident specific.""

James Drylie, executive director of Kean University’s school of criminal justice, said that while DeMaio has the authority to release his internal affairs file as the ""law enforcement executive officer,"" the state Attorney General guidelines clearly aim to keep those files confidential.

The city administration sent this statement when we requested comment from DeMaio: ""Acting Police Director DeMaio remains focused on his number one priority - the public safety of our residents and making sure that this summer will be Newark’s safest.""

Let’s review. DeMaio said he can’t release his internal affairs record because there are state Attorney General guidelines protecting it.

The state Attorney General’s guidelines describe an internal affairs file as a confidential document, but also lays out specific exceptions to that policy -- one of which technically allows DeMaio to release his file.

We rate DeMaio’s statement False.

With the economy continuing to languish, many Republicans are clamoring to ease federal regulations on businesses as a way to goose job creation. In a press conference on June 29, 2011, President Barack Obama said that's a priority for him, too. In fact, he claimed, his administration was taking a never-done-before, government-wide look at existing regulations to eliminate ones that don't make sense.

""One of the things that my administration has talked about is, is there in fact a tangle of regulations out there that are preventing businesses from growing and expanding as quickly as they should?"" Obama said. 

""Keep in mind that, you know, the business community is always complaining about regulations,"" Obama said. ""When unemployment's at 3 percent, and they're making record profits, they're going to still complain about regulations because, frankly, they want to be able to do whatever they think is going to maximize their profits.

""I've got an obligation to make sure that we're upholding smart regulations that protect our air and protect our water and protect our food. You know, if you're flying on a plane, you want to make sure that there are some regulations in place to assure safety in air travel. And so there are some core regulations that we've got to maintain.

""What I have done -- and this is unprecedented, by the way; no administration has done this before -- is I've said to each agency, 'Don't just look at current regulations or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that we're proposing. Let's go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them.'""

We wondered if a systematic review of old regulations was really such an unprecedented effort. And we found it isn't.

In 1993, President Bill Clinton created the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), headed by Vice President Al Gore. Among other things the NPR was tasked with cutting regulatory red tape.

On Sept. 30, 1993, when Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 calling for a comprehensive review of regulatory policy, he used language that sounds a lot like Obama's. Here's the directive on existing regulations:

""In order to reduce the regulatory burden on the American people, their families, their communities, their State, local, and tribal governments, and their industries; to determine whether regulations promulgated by the executive branch of the Federal Government have become unjustified or unnecessary as a result of changed circumstances; to confirm that regulations are both compatible with each other and not duplicative or inappropriately burdensome in the aggregate; to ensure that all regulations are consistent with the President’s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order, within applicable law; and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of existing regulations: (a) Within 90 days of the date of this Executive order, each agency shall submit to OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs) a program, consistent with its resources and regulatory priorities, under which the agency will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified or eliminated so as to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective in achieving the regulatory objectives, less burdensome, or in greater alignment with the President’s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order.""

Elaine Kamarck, a special assistant to Gore who managed the project, told us via e-mail.""We conducted, as part of the reinventing government initiative, a regulatory review that resulted in 16,000 pages being cut from the federal register."" Kamarck is now a lecturer in public policy at Harvard.

Here's how a June 13, 1995, story in the Washington Post described the results:

President Clinton said good riddance to 16,000 pages of federal regulations yesterday and took special satisfaction in saying goodbye to a rule on how to test the consistency of southern grits.

""I would wager a considerable amount of money that no one will ever write me a letter complaining about the demise of these regulations,"" Clinton told small business leaders, with all 16,000 pages stacked up next to his lectern.

Clinton said the pages were being removed from the Code of Federal Regulations, out of 86,000 pages reviewed with an eye toward eliminating unnecessary red tape.

James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Clinton's executive order directed all agencies to regularly review rules on their books. ""That order is still in force, making the Obama directive technically redundant,"" Gattuso said.

And Clinton wasn't the first to initiate comprehensive regulatory review, said Gattuso. In the early 1990's when Gattuso was on the staff of Vice President Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush ordered a 90-day (later extended another 120 days) moratorium and review of all existing regulations.

""I was on the vice president’s staff at that time working on the initiative and have found the parallels (to now) striking,"" Gattuso said.

In a Jan. 28, 1992, memo to department and agency heads on ""Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation,"" Bush wrote:  

""I am concerned that, because of the constant pressure to develop new programs, we are not doing nearly enough to review and revise existing programs. For that reason, I ask that each of your agencies set aside a 90-day period, beginning today, to evaluate existing regulations and programs and to identify and accelerate action on initiatives that will eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burden or otherwise promote economic growth.""

Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, called Obama's comment a ""nonsense claim.""

""I would question whether President Obama has done more in re-examining existing regulations than prior presidents, and if he has I would ask why he wasted the resources,"" Baker told us via e-mail. ""Whatever it is called, presidents are always reviewing regulations to eliminate ones that impose unnecessary burdens.""

In fact, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report on July 16, 2007, states that, ""Every president since President Carter has directed agencies to evaluate or reconsider existing regulations."" 
Obama claims that his administration is doing something unprecedented -- ""no administration has done this before,"" he said -- by having each agency review existing regulations, with an eye toward eliminating ones that don't make sense. Lots of presidents have done that. We rate Obama's statement Pants On Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF77C0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/29/barack-obama/obama-claims-his-regulatory-review-unprecedented/

R.I. Sen. Algiere says legislators never got chance to debate $75-million loan guarantee for Curt Schilling's 38 Studios
","
As fallout from the 38 Studios affair continues to rain down on Rhode Island, the finger pointing and questions of who knew what when are springing up like dandelions.

In a May 23 letter to the editor in The Westerly Sun, Harriet Lloyd, executive director of the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition, said it was ""disingenuous"" for South County legislators Sen. Dennis Algiere and Rep. Donna Walsh to voice dismay over the $75-million loan guarantee that went to Curt Schilling’s company since they voted for the approving legislation in 2010.

""The source of the 38 Studios disaster lies in 2010 legislation they ... supported that enabled the EDC to spend taxpayer monies of monumental proportions without approval of voters,"" she wrote.

Her remark provoked a rebuttal letter the following day from Algiere, Walsh and three other Westerly and Charlestown lawmakers -- Representatives Samuel A. Azzinaro and Brian P. Kennedy, and Sen. Francis T. Maher. Together the Democrat and Republican lawmakers wrote:  ""The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios.""

In light of some of the vitriolic reactions to the company’s now precarious existence, we thought it timely to look at the accuracy of the legislators’ statement.

Here are the facts:

As The Providence Journal chronicled in a Nov. 7, 2010, story, the 38 Studios deal was cloaked in secrecy from the start.

In March of that year, then-Gov. Donald Carcieri attended a fundraiser for a World War II documentary at Schilling’s home in Medfield, Mass. Besides the documentary, the two talked business. Carcieri suggested the former Red Sox pitcher bring his new start-up video game company  to Providence.

During the next several weeks, Schilling and his team met privately with Carcieri’s top aides; Keith Stokes, the newly appointed executive director of the Economic Development Corporation; and House Speaker Gordon D. Fox. Schilling was interested in what funding the EDC could offer him.

What emerged from those discussions was an arrangement that would bring the expanding company and the promise of 450 jobs to Rhode Island in return for the state guaranteeing $75 million in loans to the company.

During the 2010 legislative session, with banks still not lending money in the aftermath of the housing collapse, Smith Hill lawmakers were already receptive to an EDC proposal for a $50-million revolving loan guarantee fund for small businesses.

But what House leaders attached to the state supplemental budget that April for lawmaker consideration -- and what eventually came before them as a separate bill -- was a $125-million proposal. It had a name: the Job Creation Guaranty Program. 

The added $75 million in loan guarantees was precisely the amount Schilling had told state leaders in private he needed in capital, Stokes told The Journal in 2010. The name of the company was not included in the legislation and rank-and-file members in the House or Senate were not told that 38 Studios or any other specific company would be getting a big chunk of the pot, several lawmakers told the newspaper.

In their letter to The Sun last week, Algiere and his colleagues said: ""When we voted in favor of the Job Creation Guaranty program nothing in the budget article or in the act that passed specifically referenced 38 Studios. Our ‘yea’ votes were cast with the understanding that many small businesses around the state would have access to the $125 million loan program.""

In a telephone interview, Algiere raised a good question: would the loan program actually have passed unanimously in the Senate and with only one opponent in the House ""if we knew $75 million could be going to one entity? I doubt it. That’s a high risk, start-up company.""

The legislation’s lone dissenter, Rep. Robert Watson,  R-East Greenwich, said in a phone interview that he smelled  a ""scandal waiting to happen"" behind all the secrecy.

""38 Studios was never mentioned on the floor as a subject or even a concept,"" said Watson, ""but I got up and railed against [the legislation] just as a generic principle because I feared there was something afoot. Programs that start out as $50 million and balloon to $125 million in a week’s notice, well, there is something up. Someone was going to get it.""

A videotape of the hearing on the bill supports Watson’s claim.

Our ruling

Algiere and his fellow legislators from Westerly and Charlestown say the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios.

While the legislature did overwhelmingly approve the $125-million loan guarantee fund, it’s clear from news stories at the time and afterward, and from the tape of the debate, that rank-and-file legislators did not know when they voted that $75 million was meant for 38 Studios, even if some of their leaders did.

Whether they should have been more skeptical of the loan guarantee fund is another question.

We rule the legislators’ statement True

Voter fraud means GOP candidates in Wisconsin ""need to do a point or two better"" to win, GOP chairman Reince Priebus says
","
Not four hours after Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus made a provocative statement about voter fraud in Wisconsin, news surfaced that three cases of suspected voter fraud were being investigated by law enforcement in suburban Milwaukee.

The coincidence, of course, isn’t proof of anything.

But how extensive is illegal voting in Wisconsin?

In a May 30, 2012, conference call with reporters, Priebus said that because of voter fraud, Republican candidates ""need to do a point or two better"" to win statewide elections in Wisconsin.

Priebus, who headed the Wisconsin Republican Party before taking charge of the national party in January 2011, was referring to percentage points of the total votes cast.

GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made essentially the same claim to The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, in an article posted online more than a week earlier.

Both statements, of course, were in advance of the June 5, 2012, recall election, pitting Walker against Democratic challenger Tom Barrett.

In the 2010 race for governor -- which featured Walker, Barrett and several minor candidates -- more than 2.16 million votes were cast. One percent of the total would be some 21,600 votes; 2 percent, 43,200 votes. (Walker won with 52.3 percent to Barrett’s 46.5 percent.)

In the 2008 presidential election, more than 2.98 million votes were cast in Wisconsin. One percent would be nearly 30,000 votes and 2 percent would be nearly 60,000.

Priebus’ evidence

Republican National Committee spokesman Ryan Mahoney cited two items to back Priebus’ claim:

Milwaukee police report: A Milwaukee Police Department report on the November 2004 election, released in February 2008, blamed shoddy record keeping by city election officials and error-prone poll workers for flaws that allowed illegal and improper voting in Milwaukee.

The task force found numerous problems in the voting process that could lead to fraudulent voting. The report concluded by saying the task force ""believes that there was fraud committed in the 2004 election, but as one investigator stated, ‘I know I voted in the election, but I can’t be certain it counted.’""

Police Chief Edward Flynn distanced himself from the report, however, saying it contained the views of the investigators, not the department.

Priebus opinion article: A Priebus column published in June 2011 cited voter fraud-related allegations in several states, but his only mention of Wisconsin was the Milwaukee police report.

Really, that’s it?

Needless to say, Priebus’ evidence doesn’t begin to back his claim, which applies a specific percentage to how much fraud occurs.

But there has been a history of voting irregularities in Wisconsin, from felons improperly voting to more votes being counted in Milwaukee than people listed as having voted.

Would that tally the 1 percent to 2 percent?

Flaws in election process

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found myriad voting problems occurred in Milwaukee and other parts of the state in the 2004 election, the one later investigated by the Milwaukee police and state and federal prosecutors.

Three of the newspaper’s findings provide some perspective:

1. In Milwaukee, there was a discrepancy between the ballot count and the number of people listed as having voted of about 7,000.

(Investigators were later able to whittle the discrepancy to 4,600 votes, or 1.67 percent of the 277,000 votes cast in the city.)

2. Some 1,300 on-site voter registrations in Milwaukee could not be processed for a variety of reasons, including missing addresses and missing names. More than 140 of those who voted listed addresses outside the city.

3. At least 278 cases statewide where felons may have improperly voted, though the number was likely considerably higher, since only a partial review of those who voted was possible.

The Journal Sentinel reports prompted a joint federal-state investigation in 2005. Those investigators found more than 200 cases of felons voting illegally in Milwaukee and at least 100 cases of double voting in the 2004 election, numbers that echoed the newspaper’s findings.

About a dozen cases of voter fraud were pursued, with mixed results, but then-U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic concluded there had been no findings of widespread fraud.

Then-Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann said in June 2005 he was troubled by the 4,600-vote discrepancy that remained, suggesting that questions will linger about whether systematic fraud occurred in the city.

""I have a reservation about those 4,600 votes,"" he said. 
Situation today 
Meanwhile, a host of reforms that came after the 2005 Journal Sentinel investigation -- including the start of a statewide voter list and comparisons of it to a database of felons -- means the situation today has changed since 2004.

For a current assessment, we asked Kevin Kennedy, director of the state Government Accountability Board, which runs Wisconsin’s elections, to respond to Priebus’ claim.

Kennedy cited a number of reforms in addition to the statewide voter list, including routine checks of the voter list for felons, recently deceased persons and duplicate registrations; and post-election checks for duplicate and felon voting.

Kennedy also said the board has found no more than 20 instances of voter fraud in any statewide election dating back to 2000 and that Priebus has never filed a voter fraud complaint with his office.

Our rating

Priebus said that because of voter fraud, Republican candidates ""need to do a point or two better"" to win statewide elections in Wisconsin.

Past reports have highlighted flaws in the city of Milwaukee, including cases of fraudulent votes. But Priebus made a specific numerical claim -- that a Republican candidate, to compensate for fraudulent votes, would need to get 1 to 2 percentage points worth of additional votes in order to win a statewide election.

Priebus did not provide information that supports the claim. We rate his statement False.

Top Florida Republican backs third-party voter registration changes
","
As election season heats up, the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida is defending Florida's controversial 2011 overhaul of state elections law.

State GOP lawmakers came up with the changes as a way to guard against voter fraud. But Democrats, the League of Women Voters and other groups say the law disenfranchises third-party organizations and makes it more difficult for Floridians to register to vote. 
The League of Women Voters has suspended its campaign to register people to vote and is suing the state over the law -- which requires third-party voter registration organizations to turn in voter registration forms within 48 hours or face fines, among other things. A federal judge barred enforcement of the 48-hour deadline in a May 31, 2012, ruling, saying the provision was ""harsh and impractical.""

Before the judge ruled, Republican Party of Florida chairman Lenny Curry defended the changes aimed at third-party registration groups in an Orlando Sentinel column. His point: Groups are still actively registering people to vote. His evidence: ""More than 250 groups, ranging across the entire political spectrum, have filed with the state and are registering voters right now.""

That’s worth a fact-check, we thought.

Our first stop was the Florida Department of State, which keeps track of third-party voter registration organizations.

The data show more than 250 organizations signed up to register voters, 293 to be exact. And the groups cross political (and life) spectrums, from the Pinellas Democratic Party, and the South Florida Tea Party to groups called the American Baptists, American Multi-millionaires, American Film Stars and the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws.

But are all those groups active? Not exactly.

To date, 136 of the 293 organizations have signed up one or more voters. The rest haven’t registered anyone to vote, and in most cases, haven’t even requested voter registration forms.

The biggest groups registering voters are the Florida Democratic Party, the Republican Party of Florida, Miami-Dade County Public Schools and America First, an organization to protect the U.S. Constitution. Latino organizations such as the the National Council of La Raza/Democracia Mi Familia Vota Education Fund also registered thousands of voters.

Those six groups made up almost 90 percent of the submitted applications.

Chris Cate, spokesman for the Department of State, said all third-party groups registered with the state after the law took effect -- which implies they plan to sign up voters before the November general election.

""Just because the groups haven’t registered voters yet doesn’t mean they couldn’t go out and register voters this weekend,"" Cate said.

Curry didn’t return phone calls. But RPOF spokeswoman Kristen McDonald wrote in an email ""whether or not each of the 250 groups is out registering voters every day is beside the point -- they all have the ability to do so at any time.""

Steve Tauber, a professor of American government at the University of South Florida, argues the number of registered organizations proves nothing about the possible chilling effect of the new law.

Organizations will not know if they can process voting forms within 48 hours until they deal with a high volume of voters -- closer to the general election, Tauber said.

Our ruling

Lenny Curry argued that more than 250 groups are actively registering voters from across the political spectrum, and ""are registering voters right now.""

Curry underestimated the number of groups that signed up with the state to register voters and continue to file monthly paperwork to stay active. But his statement is still misleading.

Less than half of those groups have registered a single voter since the law took effect, and six groups have registered nearly 90 percent of all voters so far.

Furthermore, the statement’s intent was to illustrate the ease of complying with the law, a measure that won’t be clear until election season is in full swing.

We rate the statement Half True.

How much of city government does Amanda Fritz manage by budget or employee count?
","
Amanda Fritz and Mary Nolan have another five months of campaigning to look forward to after neither was able to get 50 percent of the vote in the first round of elections earlier this month. That means we can probably expect more debates like the one that happened at the City Club of Portland in late March.

Back then, Mary Nolan closed up the debate by going after Fritz one last time with a pretty damning summation of her four years as a council member: ""By her own count, Amanda has initiated only 3 percent of City Council action items while she's been there. She manages less than 5 percent of city operations -- whether you measure it by number of employees or by operating budget.""

Both are interesting points. For now, we’re looking at how much of the city Fritz really manages. Five percent seemed low to us -- even with five council members divvying up the work.

Under Portland’s form of government, the mayor assigns commissioners to manage certain offices and bureaus. There are about 20 larger offices and other smaller ones. Sometimes the assignments are a reflection of skill -- sometimes they’re a reflection of politics.

Currently, Fritz oversees the Bureau of Emergency Communications, the Office of Healthy Working Rivers, the Office of Equity and Human Rights and the Office of Neighborhood Involvement. She also has a budget and employee count specific to her own office.

When we checked the number of employees budgeted for those offices, we got a total of 208 full-time equivalent positions. The bulk of that comes from Emergency Communications, which has 145 spots. All told, the city of Portland has a little under 5,800 FTE positions. If you divide 208 by that, you get about 3.6 percent.

Just to offer a little bit of perspective here, Mayor Sam Adams oversees about half the city’s employees. Randy Leonard, the mayor’s closest political ally, comes in second with about 23 percent, then there’s Nick Fish with about 9 percent and Dan Saltzman with 13 percent.

When we looked at the budgets, we found much the same. For the current budget cycle, Fritz’s bureaus have a combined budget of just over $28 million. That’s 1 percent of all the cash that flows in and out of the city, which has a net budget of $2.8 billion. And it’s just over 1.6 percent of the $1.7 billion bureau expenditures.

After we had all the numbers straightened out, we called Nolan’s campaign to make sure we were on the same page. We were. Our next call was to Amanda Fritz.

""That's probably true -- I haven’t run the numbers myself,"" she said. But ""the amount of work is not related to the number of employees or the budget of the bureau.""

She also pointed out that she previously oversaw the city’s Cable Communications and Franchise Office, which was the second highest revenue generator for the city during the recession. What’s more, Fritz has been in charge of creating two new offices (Equity and Health Working Rivers) -- something that she said is particularly time intensive. ""Establishing a new bureau is a lot more difficult than taking over a bureau,"" she said.

Finally, she noted that the office of Neighborhood Involvement may have just 39 budgeted positions, but it works with a network of thousands of volunteers.

The context -- and the fact that assignments are ultimately up to the mayor -- may take some of the bite out of Nolan’s remark but it doesn’t make it wrong.

The numbers back Nolan up; if you look at budgets or staffing, Fritz manages less than 5 percent of city operations. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097718F40>],/factchecks/2012/may/31/mary-nolan/how-much-city-government-does-amanda-fritz-manage-/

In recall, union group says Walker cut school funding to give tax breaks
","
Critics of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have condemned his funding cuts to schools and tax breaks for businesses and wealthier individuals.

But did the education cuts fund the tax breaks?

That’s what We Are Wisconsin, a labor unions group, claims in a piece mailed to voters ahead of the June 5, 2012, recall election.

""Walker took away $1.6 billion from our schools and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich, causing layoffs of educators, crowded classrooms and less opportunity for our children,"" the mailer says.

We’ve already rated statements about both figures. So we’ll look at those and then evaluate the connection the group is making.

School cuts: We rated Mostly False a claim by state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, that Walker’s 2011-2013 budget cut public school funding by $1.6 billion. Some in and outside of state government use that figure. But experts told us that what the state budget actually saved on K-12 education, compared with the previous budget, was $800 million to $900 million.

So, the group overstates its first figure, by about 100 percent.

Tax breaks: We rated Half True a claim by the liberal One Wisconsin Now group that tax breaks approved for corporations and the rich would cost taxpayers $2.3 billion over a decade. The changes aren’t a cost to taxpayers in the normal sense, because the tax breaks mean less will be paid in taxes. (In other words: How can money not paid by taxpayers also cost taxpayers?) But we noted the changes will bring an estimated $2.3 billion less in revenue over a 10-year period, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper.

We Are Wisconsin is mixing and matching numbers, however, giving a false impression to those who get the mailer.

The school cuts figure is for the 2011-’13 budget while the tax breaks are measured over 10 years, which inflates their size. In the two-year budget, the tax breaks are projected to amount to about $212 million, according to the fiscal bureau.

We asked We Are Wisconsin spokesman Kelly Steele if he had more evidence. He said the tax breaks reduced the amount of revenue available in the budget for education and other programs.

We also asked for a response from Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews. She said school districts could have used ""tools"" in Walker’s budget, such as forcing employees to contribute more to their pensions, to offset the roughly $800 million cut in state aid.

That’s not the issue at hand.

But both Steele and Matthews make the same point in different ways, which is, budgeting is a dynamic process. Had the tax breaks that became law not been approved, it doesn’t necessarily mean more money would have gone to schools. It could have gone elsewhere.

Our rating

We Are Wisconsin said Walker took $1.6 billion from schools ""and handed it off as over $2 billion in tax breaks to the rich,"" suggesting a direct transfer of funds.

But Walker’s school cuts amount to $800 million to $900 million over two years and the tax breaks amount to only $212 million during that period.

Moreover, had there been no tax breaks, there’s no telling how that revenue might have been used.

We rate We Are Wisconsin’s statement False.

"['History', 'Texas', 'David Dewhurst']","
David Dewhurst says that since 1992, every Texas Republican candidate for statewide office who drew over 43 percent in a primary won their runoff
","
David Dewhurst led the May 2012 Texas Republican primary for the U.S. Senate with 45 percent of the vote; his campaign then said that history is on Dewhurst’s side in the July 31 runoff against second-place finisher Ted Cruz, who drew 34 percent in the primary, according to nearly complete returns.

A memo from Dewhurst pollster Mike Baselice, issued at 11 p.m. May 29, 2012, says: ""While we should expect a normal post-election tightening of numbers, history demonstrates why Dewhurst is in a strong position to become U.S. senator: every Republican candidate with over 43 percent going into a statewide runoff during the last 20 years has gone on to win.""

For sure?

Dewhurst’s spokesman, Matt Hirsch, provided us with a spreadsheet he described as listing every statewide Republican primary since 1992 resulting in a runoff. Runoffs occur when no candidate draws more than 50 percent of the primary vote.

Hirsch said the information on Dewhurst’s spreadsheet was drawn from historical election returns kept by the state.

According to Dewhurst’s spreadsheet, 13 statewide GOP Texas primaries led to runoffs from 1998 through 2010. By phone, Hirsch told us the party had no statewide runoffs in 1992, 1994 or 1996, though we later confirmed there were runoffs in 1996.

And of the statewide Republican primaries that led to runoffs, four fit the Dewhurst campaign’s conditions, according to the spreadsheet. That is, three judicial primaries and a primary for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission involved candidates garnering more than 43 percent of the primary vote who later won their runoffs.

In four of the other GOP primaries resulting in runoffs, the candidate who led the primary won the runoff, according to the spreadsheet. Yet five GOP primary leaders -- including 1998 attorney general hopeful Barry Williamson -- lost their runoff. Two eventual losers carried 38 percent of the primary vote and one drew nearly 43 percent – not quite the ""over 43 percent"" figure aired in the Dewhurst campaign’s memo. Dewhurst’s spreadsheet shows that in a 2002 Texas Supreme Court primary, Elizabeth Ray drew nearly 42.92 percent of the vote to Dale Wainwright’s 31 percent. Ray lost the runoff, however, drawing 45 percent to Wainwright’s 55 percent.

Online recaps posted by the Texas secretary of state, which oversees election returns, confirmed the campaign’s examples of runoffs won by individuals who earlier drew over 43 percent of the primary vote. Specifically, Paul Womack, running for a spot on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, drew nearly 45 percent of the 2002 primary vote and won the runoff with nearly 57 percent. Also that year, Tom Price drew 47 percent in the primary and 57 percent in the runoff. In 2004, Victor Carrillo, running for the railroad commission, carried nearly 50 percent of the primary vote, 63 percent in his runoff. And in 2006, Charles Holcomb won 45 percent of the primary vote for a Court of Criminal Appeals seat, drawing 54 percent in the runoff.

Our review of each primary since 1992 unearthed three 1996 Court of Criminal Appeals runoffs not on Dewhurst’s spreadsheet. One of these runoff winners, Price, prevailed after barely trailing -- by 30.53 percent to 30.35 percent -- in the primary.

Bottom line: Four primaries resulting in runoffs neatly match up with the Dewhurst camp’s conditions.In contrast, a dozen primaries resulting in runoffs do not perfectly fit the parameters because the leader in the primary carried 43 percent or less of the vote, meaning he or she fared worse than Dewhurst in the 2012 primary -- and half of these other primary winners won the runoff, while half lost.

Our ruling

We are not judging the predictive value of Dewhurst’s claim, which would be speculative beyond the bounds of a backward-looking fact check. 
For instance, skeptics might stress that only four of the 16 GOP statewide primary-runoff combinations from 1992 through 2010 fully support Dewhurst's claim. Half of the remaining dozen primary leaders lost the runoffs. 
Put another way, however, there are no instances since 1992 of a Texas Republican candidate for statewide office drawing more than 43 percent of the primary vote and losing the runoff, which is Dewhurst’s point.

O’Malley criticizes Massachusetts job growth under Romney
","
With the presidential campaign focusing on the economy, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley is making the case that President Barack Obama is a better job creator than Republican Mitt Romney.

In an appearance on Meet the Press on May 27, 2012, O’Malley, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, squared off with former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, who defended Romney.

Gingrich called Obama’s effect on employment ""disastrous"" and said voters will question whether they can afford another four years with him in the White House.

O’Malley then brought up Romney’s record while governor of Massachusetts.

""When it comes to what little bit of job creation was happening in Massachusetts, it was happening in the public sector at six times the rate that it was happening in the private sector,"" O’Malley, a Democrat, said.

We decided to look into that job creation statistic.

Massachusetts job numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show private-sector employment grew by 0.79 percent during Romney’s term.

O'Malley said ""public sector"" in his claim, but that would also include local government jobs. That rate of increase is 1.57 percent -- about double the private-sector rate, which is significantly lower than O'Malley's six-times claim.

O'Malley may have been referring to the state payroll, which saw a growth rate of 4.73 percent -- just about six times the rate of private-sector growth. If he had specified state jobs, the area Romney presumably had the most control over, O'Malley would have been accurate.

Still, even that description is misleading because of the disparity in raw numbers between government and private-sector jobs. By using rate rather than the actual numbers, he gives the impression of a larger increase in public-sector jobs.

In raw numbers, though, private-sector jobs increased by 22,400, while state jobs grew by 5,300.

""The private sector accounted for a bigger share of all payroll employment gains in Massachusetts during Gov. Romney’s term,"" said Gary Burtless, a labor market expert with the centrist Brookings Institution. (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of John McCain, and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

He added: ""The more legitimate criticism of Gov. Romney’s job creation record is that total payroll employment growth lagged far behind the experience of the rest of the country."" For 2002 to 2006, the national growth rate was 5.2 percent, while Massachusetts’ rate was just .7 percent.

Our ruling

O’Malley said that Massachusetts’ public sector payroll grew at six times the rate of the private sector during Romney’s term as governor.

That statistic is true only when counting state employees. But he said ""public sector,"" which would include local government workers such as teachers and cops. What’s more, as Burtless pointed out, even though the growth rate was greater in government jobs, private-sector jobs still accounted for more of the state’s increase.

The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That meets our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971C4F80>],/factchecks/2012/may/31/martin-omalley/omalley-criticizes-massachusetts-job-growth-under-/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Tom Barrett']","
Barrett says Walker used a ""credit card"" approach to balance state budget, pushing borrowing costs into the future
","
The recall effort against Gov. Scott Walker was launched over how he eliminated a $3.6 billion budget shortfall -- in part by requiring greater health insurance and pension contributions from most public employees, and curtailing collective bargaining.

Now, in the days before the June 5, 2012 election, Democratic challenger Tom Barrett has focused on one of Walker’s budget-balancing techniques.

In the May 25, 2012 debate, Barrett claimed Walker had ""used the credit card"" to create a budget that the Walker administration says now shows a small surplus.

""You know how that budget surplus came about, if it is in fact there?"" Barrett asked. ""Because he used the credit card. He used the credit card, and pushed over $500 million in debt onto our children and our grandchildren.""

Barrett went on to say state taxpayers ""are going to have to pay more than $150 million in interest"" because of the move.

Barrett was talking about a debt restructuring Walker and Republican legislators approved in 2011 for the 2011-13 budget.

But the immediate context of Barrett’s remarks was Walker’s announcement on May 10, 2012, that the short-term interest savings from that debt restructuring were higher than expected, helping him turn a small mid-budget deficit into a small projected surplus.

Most of the additional savings was from pushing off the debt repayment into the future; about 15 percent was from getting a lower interest rate.

Walker’s Department of Administration said it would likely save an additional $78 million in the two years, and that helped knock down the projected deficit.

As backup for the claim, Barrett’s campaign pointed to a memo prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the non-partisan state agency that keeps track of state finances. In the May 18 memo to Sen. Kathleen Vinehout (D-Alma) Fiscal Bureau analyst Al Runde wrote:

""Therefore, in total, since May 2011, the state has issued additional debt to restructure, or make the principal payments on, approximately $558.3 million in GPR (general purpose revenue) supported principal that would have otherwise been paid off in 2010-11 and 2011-12.

""As a result, that principal will now remain outstanding for a longer period of time and thus an estimated $156.2 million in additional interest costs could be incurred by the state.""

Bob Lang, director of the Fiscal Bureau, said the payments would stretch out in the range of 20 years -- which goes to the ""children and grandchildren"" part of Barrett’s claim.

We asked the Walker campaign to respond to Barrett’s claim about borrowing. They sent a memo that made more than a dozen points -- mostly attacking Barrett -- but did not address the debt restructuring. Campaign spokesman Ciara Matthews referred more detailed questions to the governor’s state spokesman, Cullen Werwie.

Werwie said the administration decided the borrowing was better than other alternatives to balance the budget, including raising taxes or further spending cuts or ""some gimmick that would have delayed payments for Medicaid or school aids.""

He added: ""With  the restructuring, we were able to finish FY11 in the black (with a slight surplus)"" and repay $58.7 million in payments to the  Minnesota-Wisconsin reciprocity bill and $234 million owed to the Patients Compensation Fund.

Our rating

Barrett says Walker borrowed $500 million to help balance the state budget at a cost of $150 million in interest over 20 years. Those numbers are slightly lower than the Fiscal Bureau estimates, but, overall, on target.

But his calling it a ""credit card"" approach implies that this was an irresponsible action. No one’s claiming that -- it’s something the state did under Gov. Jim Doyle, and not unlike what many homeowners do when they refinance mortgages to better meet their budgets.

Indeed, more favorable borrowing terms saved $78 million and helped Walker claim his budget is running a surplus rather than a deficit.

We rate Barrett’s claim Mostly True.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says he has made first back-to-back payments to Rainy Day Fund in state history
","
With a better-than-expected tax-collection estimate and savings from delaying some debt payments, Gov. Scott Walker on May 10, 2012 made a small deficit at the mid-point in his two-year budget -- poof -- disappear.

Gone along with it: An issue Democrats were using against Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election.

This was posted the following day on the Walker campaign blog:

""Not only have we turned away from the failed policies that drove us to the brink of insolvency with chronic billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record-setting job loss, but we have taken a complete 180 degree turn to true prosperity with a budget surplus that will help far into our future,"" the post read in part.

The Walker’s campaign boasted the news was so good extra funds will be socked away in budget-stabilization account: ""For the first time in state history, we have put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years.""

History, or course, can be an awful long time.

Did back-to-back contributions happen thanks to Walker’s policies?

Wisconsin first created a stabilization fund in 1985, so it’s actually a fairly new thing. But the state has seldom put money into it. That’s one reason Wisconsin lives closer to the fiscal edge than many other states.

According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the first deposit into the fund was in 2006-07, during the final term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walker’s predecessor.

That deposit totalled $55.6 million, but was quickly used up in a budget crisis later in Doyle’s term.

The second deposit made to the fund -- $14.8 million -- came at the end of  Doyle’s last budget, 2010-11. The deposit was made after Walker had taken office. His first six months overlapped the final six months of the Doyle budget.

That brings us to May 2012.

That’s when Walker signalled that he could make another deposit, estimated at $45.4 million, after the fiscal year ends June 30, 2012.

So, did Walker -- for the first time in state history ""put millions of dollars into our rainy day fund in consecutive years""?

Not exactly.

First, the deposit is a projection. It would make two budgets in a row for the first time if it happens. It looks likely that a deposit will be made, but it’s premature to say it already happened.

Second, the numbers are not based on the ""official"" revenue estimates that come from the Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper on budget items. That caused Democrats to howl in protest when Walker put out the well-timed news.

In February 2012, the Fiscal Bureau said that tax revenues were coming up short, leaving a small projected deficit by June 2013.

The new Walker estimate is based on revenue forecasts compiled by Walker’s Department of Administration for February, March and April. In a May memo to Walker, Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch described it as ""the potential"" for a $45.4 million deposit when the books close at the end of June 2012.

While not official, the estimates are based on the same sources of data used by the Fiscal Bureau. Bureau Director Bob Lang told us he didn’t verify Walker’s numbers but said they don’t appear unreasonable.

We’ll know the size of the actual deposit, if there is one, when the state completes its annual financial report once accounts are settled, in late summer. It’s also possible the deposit could exceed the projected $45.4 million.

Who deserves credit?

While 2011 was Doyle’s final budget year, it was Walker who brought the budget back into balance with his budget-repair bill in early 2011.

You may recall that little old bill -- the one that included higher pension and health-insurance payments from state and local government employees, and curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees.

Likewise, the expected 2012 surplus would clearly be on Walker’s watch.

But it’s arguable how much a governor has to do with rising tax collections. Walker’s administration attributed the brighter tax-collection forecasts in large part to improved job-creation figures and personal income growth, which are subject to economic cycles.   

Additionally, putting money in the stabilization fund is not a matter of choice. By law, 50 percent of any surplus from higher-than-expected income and other tax collections must be transferred to the rainy day fund. That’s exactly what Walker is saying he would deposit.

""I believe that both the Doyle deposit and pending Walker deposit were not done by volition or predetermined plan but by a state law requirement when excess funds appear,"" said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.

But we attribute budget deficits to elected officials, so they must also get some credit for surpluses.

Our rating

Walker’s took credit for what the campaign said was a historic double-up of surplus tax funds into a rainy day fund for stabilizing future state budgets. The chances for a second straight transfer into the fund appear good, but it’s premature to say the money is in the bank.

Walker gets the bulk of the credit, but his campaign claim is just partially accurate, because it skips over the important fact that the deal’s not done yet.

We rate it Half True.

"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Pundits', 'Paul Krugman']","
Chris Christie’s “Jersey Comeback” challenged by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman
","New York Times columnist Paul Krugman isn’t feeling Gov. Chris Christie’s ""Jersey Comeback.""

In his May 28 column, Krugman chastised the Republican governor as a ""fiscal phony,"" suggesting that Christie’s comeback message is at odds with job growth in New Jersey since he took office in January 2010.

According to the liberal columnist, ""there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison.""

We’re not sure if that ""McMansion"" nickname will stick, but as for job growth, Krugman’s analysis is spot on, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

In terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey’s growth since the beginning of Christie’s tenure has been less than the growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak argued that the state’s ""economic policies have us headed very much in the right direction in terms of job growth.""

Drewniak added, ""Do keep in mind that it was under this Governor that New Jersey had the best single year of private sector job growth in the last 10 years. That’s over 71,000 private sector jobs created since the Governor took office.""

First, let’s talk about total job growth, including public- and private-sector employment.

As with previous stories, there’s two ways of analyzing job growth figures: the net increase in jobs and the percentage increase. Our analysis is focused on the percentage increase, because that metric accounts for the differences in size between New Jersey and the other two states and the nation as a whole.

While New Jersey’s total jobs grew by 37,100, or roughly 1 percent, between January 2010 and April 2012, New York increased its total jobs by 298,700, or about 3.5 percent, and Connecticut saw growth of 33,500, or about 2.1 percent.

As of April, there were 132,989,000 total jobs in the nation as a whole, representing a roughly 2.9 percent increase since January 2010. The April figures for the nation and the states are preliminary.

Looking at total job growth since February 2010 -- Christie’s first full month in office -- we found similar results.

Between February 2010 and April 2012, the nation saw an increase in total jobs of about 2.9 percent. During the same time period, New York and Connecticut increased total jobs by about 3.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.

Meanwhile, New Jersey’s total job growth was about 1.2 percent. The following chart lays out the changes in total job growth as of April 2012: 
Now, let’s review private-sector job growth -- a statistic frequently touted by the Christie administration.

Between January 2010 and April 2012, New Jersey gained 65,600 private-sector jobs for an increase of about 2 percent. Starting in February 2010 and continuing through April 2012, the state’s private-sector jobs grew by 71,200, or roughly 2.2 percent.

But those figures fall behind private-sector job growth in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole.

New York increased its private-sector jobs by about 4.6 percent since both January 2010 and February 2010, while Connecticut’s growth was roughly 3.2 percent since January 2010 and nearly 3.3 percent since February 2010.

The nation’s private-sector jobs increased by about 4 percent during the same time periods. Here’s the chart showing private-sector job growth as of April 2012: 
Our ruling

In his May 28 column, Krugman claimed ""there have been some job gains in the McMansion State since Mr. Christie took office, but they have lagged gains both in the nation as a whole and in New York and Connecticut, the obvious points of comparison.""

Krugman’s analysis is correct. In terms of the percentage increases in total jobs and private-sector jobs as of April 2012, New Jersey’s growth since the beginning of Christie’s tenure has been less than the increases in New York, Connecticut and the nation as a whole.

Josh Mandel campaign claims he 'earned the highest possible crediting ratings as state treasurer'
","
Josh Mandel's new campaign ad ""Change"" uses about half of its 30 seconds to attack Sherrod Brown, the incumbent Democratic senator he hopes to unseat. 
For the remainder of the time, the ad touts Mandel’s record as the Republican state treasurer.

Mandel, the ad says, ""earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer.""

That had a familiar ring to it, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. This is the second claim PolitiFact Ohio has looked at from this ad. We previously rated as False a claim that Brown ""cast the deciding vote on a government takeover of health care.""

One of the treasurer's responsibilities is to invest money for local governments through the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio investment fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion. The Mandel campaign confirmed that the claim in the ad refers to the AAA rating that Standard & Poor’s gave the STAR Ohio fund. It confirmed that rating in a letter to the state last August.

Mandel made a similar claim in an email to supporters last October, saying then that the fund ""just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive.""

PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim Half True. We found that the statement's wording, especially that the fund ""just"" received its rating, gave the impression that the rating had improved under Mandel.

In fact, the rating had been in place for 16 years -- since 1995, the first year the fund was rated by S&P.

Public finance experts said the treasurer did deserve some credit for maintaining that rating.

Kevin O’Brien, executive director at the Center for Public Management in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University, noted then that the highest praise should be reserved for the fund managers who maintained the rating during the financial crisis in 2008.

Mandel deserves credit for maintaining the rating his staff inherited when he took office in January 2011, said O’Brien, a former financial analyst for Moody’s Investors Service, another credit rating agency. ""They maintained the bond rating; they didn't achieve the bond rating.""

The claim in the new ad, though similar to the email claim, is more carefully worded. It does not imply that the state’s rating had ""just"" improved. But knowing the credit rating has been at that level for more than a decade and a half provides a clearer picture.

Mandel’s statement is accurate but needs additional information to provide clarification.

West says 'ObamaCare Slush Fund' was used to spay dogs, cats as an anti-obesity campaign
","Correction: We mistakenly published this item May 29, 2012, as a Mostly False when we had concluded it was False.  We have corrected the ruling below. The item is otherwise unchanged. Put down your hot dogs and doughnuts and listen up: Americans have gotten fat. And we’ve heard advice from that fit First Lady about how to lighten up -- eat our veggies and get moving.

But U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., has gotten wind of a wacky federally-funded strategy to slim our bulging waistlines: spaying dogs and cats.

West listed examples of fiscal ""absurdity"" in a mid-May newsletter. ""ObamaCare Slush Fund Money Being Use To Spay Stray Dogs And Cats – Counts As An Anti-Obesity Campaign,"" the newsletter stated, and then quoted a few sentences from an April 30, 2012, Washington Examiner story about a program in Nashville.

The article said an anti-obesity ""slush fund"" under ""Obamacare"" was used in Nashville to promote spaying dogs and cats, because stray dogs were scaring people from exercising outdoors.

The newspaper’s story prompted comments from readers angry about the reported misuse of federal dollars, one defending the right to be obese, and another predicting that pets will want the right to marry each other.

This claim was spreading on the Internet faster than fleas on a dog, so we decided to check it out: Was any money from the federal health care law used to spay dogs and cats and billed as an anti-obesity program for people?

Federal program helped Nashville hire animal control officers

The story begins in 2010, when the federal government granted stimulus money to communities to decrease obesity and improve levels of nutrition and exercise. An initial 44 programs got money through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included a health care prevention and wellness component.

The Nashville/Davidson County Metro Health Department was one of the groups that received money through the federal program, called Communities Putting Prevention to Work (CPPW). Nashville received about $7.5 mllion. More than one-quarter of adults there are obese.

The grant helped pay for free bikes in city parks, hiring a coordinator for urban gardens, and ensuring Head Start children had access to healthy food and exercise. Some projects are still in the works, including adding kiosks in urban areas for people to rent bikes, said Alisa Haushalter, Nashville’s project director.

A small portion of the grant related to animals. Haushalter said that the federal grant included about $175,000 for two animal control officers and a program specialist. The goal was to decrease loose dogs and educate the public about animal care. Nashville targeted two low-income zip codes that generated the highest numbers of complaints to animal control.

Around the same time, the Nashville Humane Association received a $35,000 grant for spay/neuter clinics in those areas from PetSmart Charities. Humane association executive director Joy Beach told us that the association doesn’t get money from the city of Nashville and gets most of its money from private donations plus a $1,000 state grant.

The association did not receive any money from the federal Communities Putting Prevention to Work grant for the pet clinic, Beach said. So no federal money went to pet spaying and neutering.

There is a connection, though, between the stimulus grant and the clinics. The animal control officers hired through the grant attended the clinics -- similar to how police officers attend community events. The grant also covered the salary of a program specialist who initially helped promote the clinics, said health department spokesman Brian Todd.

We asked the Centers for Disease Control, which oversees the grant program, if any stimulus money went to spay or neuter pets in Nashville and we received a succinct response: ""No,"" wrote Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman.

If the money for the pet clinics came from PetSmart Charities and the humane association, what fueled this rumor that an Obamacare slush fund was paying for it?

Promotional materials were unclear

When officials in Nashville promoted the program, their information wasn’t always clear about the funding. Some of the publicity omitted that the pet clinics were paid for through a PetSmart Charities grant. Other documents listed multiple partners, including the stimulus project, making it appear that it did pay for the clinic. Some information was vague -- the city’s website said that the stimulus program would help Nashville ""address loose dogs.""

Not surprisingly, some of the news coverage stated that the stimulus grant would pay for the pet clinics. The Tennessean wrote in March 2011: ""A free clinic for dogs and cats is opening in East Nashville — but the goal is improving people's health."" It was the Washington Examiner article that helped make dog clinics into a hot topic beyond Nashville. ""A controversial anti-obesity ‘slush fund’ under Obamacare was used in Nashville, Tennessee, to promote spaying dogs and cats,"" the report said. ""The reasoning: stray dogs scare people from exercising outdoors.""

Todd, the health department spokesman, sought a correction from the newspaper. Todd told the reporter in an email (which he forwarded to PolitiFact) that as part of the stimulus grant, the health department partnered with the humane association, and that the federal grant paid for the animal control officers who attended the clinics to provide education. But the spay/neuter services were provided by the humane association and PetSmart charities, he said.

The Examiner article included this correction on May 7: ""The Nashville Health Department said that the funding did not pay for the spaying, but instead was used to promote the anti-obesity effort that included the neutering campaign. Also it funded the hiring of two animal control officers ‘for the purpose of increasing animal control presence and enforcement in neighborhoods where we knew there was a loose dog problem.’""

Republicans cry foul about pet clinics

Shortly after the Examiner article, the claim about an ""ObamaCare slush fund"" being used to spay and neuter animals started spreading.

The U.S. House of Representatives Education and Workforce Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee issued press releases that cited the Nashville pet clinic as an example of misguided spending:

""Bearing out the infamous declaration that we would have to pass the health care law to find out what was in it, Congress and the American people have recently begun taking a closer look at a massive new spending program known colloquially as the Obamacare ‘slush fund,’ "" stated the energy committee’s press release.

The dollars for doggies claim led to a spat between lawmakers at a May 9 committee hearing.

""Incredibly, this same program also funded free pet spaying and neutering,"" said Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Ocala. ""While a laudable goal, the Department of Health and Human Services should focus its limited resources on human health.""

Stearns pointed to the Recovery.gov website, which included two updates about Nashville’s grant that included pet clinics. ""Services to a high-need area occurred to provide free spay/neuter and wellness clinics for dogs and cats in order to curb animals running at large,"" stated one update.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., told Stearns that the pet clinic claim was wrong and cited a blog by The Hill that stated that the clinic was paid for with the PetSmart Charities grant. We contacted West's office for comment on this report, but we didn't hear back.

Haushalter told us in an email: ""Since this project was comprehensive and leveraged partner resources, we reported on the entire project. In retrospect, and upon review of a variety of documents/reports, I understand that there are several communications that may be vague or less clear than desired. However, I can assure you ARRA funds were not used to pay for spay/neuter or vet services.""

Our ruling

West said in a May 14 newsletter that among examples of ""absurdity"" in our country was this: ""ObamaCare Slush Fund Money Being Use To Spay Stray Dogs And Cats – Counts As An Anti-Obesity Campaign.""

Publicity information, news coverage and even the federal government’s own website about the stimulus did suggest that taxpayers paid for pets to get spayed or neutered as part of an effort to help people exercise outdoors free from the threat of stray dogs.

There is a connection between the federal money and the clinics. A program specialist whose salary was paid for through the grant promoted the clinics, and the grant-funded animal control officers were on hand at the clinics. But it’s not accurate to say that the money was used to spay or neuter the animals. And the money did not come from an ""Obamacare slush fund"" -- it wasn't part of the health care law. Calling it a ""slush fund"" could lead readers to view it as a secretive stash of money, when in reality Congress approved the stimulus act that included money for community-based prevention. Information about the communities that got the grant is publicly available online. Finally, by the time West made his claim, The Hill and Congressional Quarterly had both reported that the initial claims were wrong. In fact, PetSmart Charities gave the humane association $35,000 to pay for pet neutering and spaying. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097546F80>],/factchecks/2012/may/30/allen-west/allen-west-says-obamacare-slush-fund-was-being-use/

Michelle Obama understates percentage of high schools with physical education
","
As first lady, Michelle Obama has promoted exercise and healthy eating to combat teen obesity, a project she calls Let's Move. During a recent interview with NPR to promote American Grown, a diary about her White House vegetable garden, she lamented the decline in physical education in schools.

""Kids aren't playing outside as much,"" she told NPR. ""The statistics show that kids are spending an average of 7.5 hours a day in front of some kind of screen, a TV, computer, what have you. Fewer schools are offering PE. Only 2 percent of high schools -- public high schools in the country offer PE classes. Two percent.""

A reader asked us to check the claim that ""only 2 percent of public high schools in the country offer PE classes"" because the number sounded low.

In October 2007, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the School Health Policies and Practices Study, which tabulated statistics for 2006. It’s summarized here, but these are the key findings as they relate to Obama’s comment:

• Overall, 69.3 percent of elementary schools, 83.9 percent of middle schools and 95.2 percent of high schools required PE in 2006.

• However, only 3.8 percent of elementary schools, 7.9 percent of middle schools and 2.1 percent of high schools provided daily PE or its equivalent.

We checked with the CDC and a spokeswoman confirmed that the 2006 figures were the most recent ones available.

A subsequent report conducted by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education and the American Heart Association found that 46 states (out of 50 states plus the District of Columbia) mandate PE for high school students.

A spokeswoman for Obama confirmed that she had misspoken. Obama was referring to the 2007 CDC study, and her mistake was to say that only 2 percent of public high schools offer PE classes. In fact, 2 percent of public high schools offer daily PE classes.

Our ruling

Official federal data show that more than 95 percent of high schools in 2006 required PE -- a far cry from the 2 percent Obama cited. We rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809788AAC0>],/factchecks/2012/may/30/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-understates-percent-high-schools-ph/

""We have Planned Parenthood under attack,"" the state firefighters union president told Wisconsin Public Television, ""12,000 women that used to go to Planned Parenthood -- not for the woman’s right to choose, mind you, but for basic health care -- that's been taken away.""

Mitchell was referring to a provision in the 2011-2013 state budget, which Walker and Kleefisch ""have control over,"" said Mitchell campaign spokesman Kevin Benish.

The program

Walker’s budget proposal would have eliminated the Family Planning Funding program, which was slated for $1.94 million per year in state money, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper.

But before the final budget was approved, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee restored the program, with a 10 percent funding cut, and gave it a new name: the Women’s Health Block Grant program.

The new name was more accurate in that the funding provides more than family planning services (contraceptive services and supplies, pregnancy testing and perinatal care services). It also covers cervical cancer screening, sexually transmitted disease treatment and general health screenings.

Mitchell’s evidence

To back Mitchell’s statement, Benish cited a January 2012 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau that said the state budget made Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin -- because of its involvement in abortion-related services -- ineligible for the block grants.

Benish also cited a June 2011 Planned Parenthood memo, which said the agency used its 2010 allocation to serve 12,000 women in nine counties.

Kleefisch campaign spokeswoman Rachel Pecor agreed Planned Parenthood was made ineligible for the block grants, but said women in the nine counties who had used Planned Parenthood could still get services from other agencies. The fiscal bureau told us, however, that the state budget reallocated to other counties the $800,000 that Planned Parenthood was slated to receive for the first year of the two-year budget for the nine counties it served. In other words, the money was not simply given to other women’s health agencies in the nine counties that Planned Parenthood had served. As for the claim that 12,000 women were served with the money Planned Parenthood received in 2010, it roughly squares with information provided to PolitiFact Wisconsin by the state Department of Health Services. Planned Parenthood said it used its 2010 state funding to leverage additional funding and served a total of 14,350 women in the nine counties. Our rating

Citing the state budget backed by Walker and Kleefisch, Mitchell said ""12,000 women that used to go to Planned Parenthood -- not for the woman’s right to choose, mind you, but for basic health care -- that's been taken away.""

The budget did take away money Planned Parenthood said it used to serve 12,000 women in nine counties. Women can still use the clinics, but clearly Planned Parenthood is less able to provide services.

As for the money not being for ""the woman’s right to choose,"" it did not fund abortions, but did fund family planning services as well as basic health care.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. accuses congressman of never attending NASCAR races
","
A proposal from U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah poses a conundrum that may be as tough for some as choosing between God, America and apple pie.   

Fiscal conservatism or NASCAR?

Kingston recently backed a successful amendment to a defense bill that would block the military from spending millions of federal dollars on sponsorships for pro sports teams. He thinks the money should support service members instead.

If the defense bill passes as amended, it would end the U.S. National Guard’s sponsorship of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr.

Earnhardt resorted to fightin’ words.

The day after the amendment passed, he told reporters that Kingston needed to do his ""homework"" on how sponsorships attract military recruits.

""The Republican from Georgia, he hasn’t even been to a NASCAR race,"" Earnhardt told reporters May 18 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, according to an article in The Sporting News. Other news outlets posted similar accounts of his statement.

That’s almost as bad as calling Kingston a ""Yankee."" Could this be true?

The effort to end military sponsorships of professional sports is a bipartisan affair. Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota offered the amendment, which passed May 17, alongside Kingston.

According to Kingston’s office, the Defense Department plans to spend as much as $80.3 million on this type of recruitment advertising this fiscal year.

Other NASCAR drivers are on the military payroll. The U.S. Army backs Ryan Newman. The Air Force sponsors Aric Almirola.

To Earnhardt, these partnerships are a no-brainer. Kingston is out of line.

Watching NASCAR is as essential to being a Republican politician from the South as going to church or kissing babies.

A reporter at Charlotte Motor Speedway asked Earnhardt whether he would invite Kingston to a NASCAR race.

""Yes, because he’s a Republican from Georgia,"" Earnhardt said, according to The Sporting News article. ""He ought to have seen a NASCAR race by now.""

We called Kingston’s offices repeatedly for more than a week but received no response. Earnhardt’s office didn’t return our calls either. We therefore searched far and wide for evidence that Kingston had attended a NASCAR race.

Maybe we’d find a photograph of the gentleman from Georgia shaking hands with Jeff Gordon or watching the Daytona 500 from the infield, perched on a folding chair atop an RV.

Instead, we found him at just about everything but NASCAR.

We spotted Kingston on HBO’s ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" last year, being berated by the liberal comedian for being a creationist.

One year before that, Kingston rubbed elbows with President Barack Obama in Air Force One as they flew from Savannah to Washington.

And three years ago he appeared on the set of the Miley Cyrus movie ""The Last Song."" He was an extra for the film, which featured scenes on Tybee Island.

To our surprise, we also found three news accounts that said Earnhardt was right.

The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, said in a May 18 article that Kingston’s office confirmed that he has never attended a NASCAR race. A May 17 article in USA Today said Kingston himself acknowledged it.

A May 22 story in the Savannah Morning News says that Kingston’s never been to a race, but he did display an Earnhardt license plate on the front of his pickup for five years.

It’s strange but true. Kingston has never been to a NASCAR race.

Josh Mandel says Sherrod Brown cast the deciding vote for a government takeover of health care
","
Republican Josh Mandel, the Ohio state treasurer hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from his U.S. Senate seat in November, makes the most of the 30 seconds in his TV ad ""Change."" The campaign spot makes at least five separate claims about the two candidates.

PolitiFact Ohio will take a look at several of them in the days ahead. For this factcheck item we’ll look at the statement that Brown ""cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care.""

The statement claim caught our attention because it combines two claims we've examined before.

To back it up, the commercial cites the Senate's roll call vote of Dec. 24, 2009, on H.R. 3590, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the health care reform law commonly known as Obamacare.

Did Brown cast the deciding vote? That depends on how you define ""deciding.""

Mandel's campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee both have explained their logic in crediting or blaming Brown for the deciding vote: The measure passed with the 60 votes that were required. Anything short of that would have effectively killed the legislation through the equivalent of a filibuster.

Every vote is decisive, therefore every vote is ""deciding,"" they say. The NRSC has made the same claim about other Democratic senators, too.

There is, however, also this to consider: Before the votes were taken, Democrats and Republicans kept a count of supporters and opponents, and Democrats could only round up 59 proponents to end debate -- until Ben Nelson of Nebraska agreed to join in. News coverage on that day, Dec. 19, 2009, described Nelson as the crucial 60th vote to break the filibuster.

Brown’s vote was actually the seventh ""yes"" among the 60 senators who supported a Senate bill that had to be reconciled with a House version on Christmas Eve 2009. His vote was cast early in the roll call, which is done in alphabetical order. When the two sides came together and the Senate voted on the final version, on March 25, 2010, Brown voted eighth.

Both measures passed with exactly 60 votes. Brown's vote was crucial. Following the rationale of the Mandel camp and of the NRSC, any of those 60 votes could be called a deciding vote. But Brown did nothing (such as holding his support until the last moment) that would justify singling him out.

What about the other part of the claim, where Mandel's ad refers to the health care act as ""the government takeover of health care""? Mandel’s ad repeats a claim that has been reviewed numerous times by PolitiFact and rated False or Pants on Fire.

PolitiFact national recognized it as the 2010 ""Lie of the Year."" FactCheck.org called it ""nonsensical"" and a ""whopper,"" saying the reform plan is neither ""government-run"" nor a ""government takeover."" The Washington Post Fact Checker classified it as myth.

It is true that the law does significantly increase government regulation of health insurers. But it is a system that relies on private companies and the free market. Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers.

Brown’s vote for the health care reform legislation was crucial, but was it the deciding vote? A listener hearing the Mandel ad could be lead to believe Brown’s vote had more weight than other votes. Yet, he certainly did not cast the 60th vote, and he did not have to be wooed for support.

And it is not accurate to state that he voted for a ""government takeover of health care.""

Jim Moran says 70 percent of traced firearms in Mexican drug crimes come from U.S.
","
U.S. Rep. Jim Moran made a recent plea on the House floor to preserve requirements that licensed gun dealers in four states bordering Mexico report customers buying multiple assault rifles to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Funding for the program was a small but controversial part of a House appropriations bill setting the budget for the departments of Commerce and Justice for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

Moran, D-8th, said the gun-reporting program -- begun in summer 2011 -- has helped the ATF investigate illegal gun trafficking by Mexican drug cartels. ""According to ATF data, 70 percent of firearms recovered and traced in drug cartel crimes in Mexico originated from the United States,"" he said in a May 9 floor speech.

The reporting requirement, strongly opposed by the National Rifle Association, was stripped from the House budget on March 10. The appropriations bill, which was subsequently passed by the chamber, is pending in the Senate.

We wondered if Moran is right that 70 percent of the known firearms used by Mexican drug cartels have been traced to the U.S.  His spokeswoman, Anne Hughes, pointed us to an ATF report on the guns recovered from 2007-11 that the agency had traced at the request of the Mexican government.

In 2011, Mexico asked the ATF to check the origin of 20,335 firearms. The agency determined that 14,504, or 71.3 percent, had been made in or legally imported to the U.S. before getting to Mexico.

Over the five years included in the report, ATF traced 99,691 firearms for Mexico. Of those, 68,161 came from the U.S., or 68.4 percent.

An ATF news release announcing the data said all of the weapons were crime guns that were recovered in Mexico. The agency, however, did not specify the types of crime.

Moran, in describing the findings, misfired. He specifically tied the guns to ""drug cartel crime.""

But that doesn’t mean his statement is invalid. There are compelling reasons to believe U.S. guns play a major role in the Mexican drug trade.

Private sales of firearms are illegal in Mexico. All gun sales must go through the federal government. The license and sale application process is lengthy and only smaller-caliber pistols and rifles are available through legal means.

The ATF news release said Mexican government reports that drug trafficking organizations are increasingly using assault and sniper rifles. The agency said the guns Mexico is asking it to trace are trending away from pistols and revolvers to rifles.

Until recent years, poor record-keeping by Mexico has made it impossible to estimate the impact of drug cartel offenses on the nation’s overall crime rates.

In 2009, the Mexican government started a system for reporting drug-related homicides, but there’s not absolute faith in its data. A 2011 study by The Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego noted that many local Mexican police departments lack the resources to investigate whether a murder was drug related.

In 2010, the Mexican census reported 24,374 murders in the nation. The Mexican government tied 15,273 to the drug cartels. In 2009, the census reported 19,803 homicides and the government said 9,614 were caused by the cartels.

A U.S. Government Accountability Office report, conducted June 2008 through June 2009, found a close correlation between the ATF data and the percentage of guns in Mexico that originate in the U.S.

The study said, ""U.S. law enforcement officials who had worked on arms trafficking in Mexico and along the U.S.-Mexican border told us their experience and observations corroborated that most of the firearms in Mexico had originated in the United States.

""Furthermore, U.S. and Mexican government and law enforcement officials also stated this scenario seemed most likely, given the ease of acquiring firearms in the United States; specifically, they told us they saw no reason why the drug cartels would go through the difficulty of acquiring a gun somewhere else in the world and transporting it to Mexico when it is so easy for them to do so from the United States.""

Our ruling 
Moran said ATF statistics show ""70 percent of firearms recovered and traced in drug cartel crimes in Mexico come from the United States.""

He muffed his statement; the U.S. guns were involved in Mexican crimes, not necessarily drug trafficking. But officials in both governments say U.S. -sourced guns make up a large proportion of guns carried by drug traffickers.
