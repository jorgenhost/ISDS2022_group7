"['Transportation', 'Virginia', 'Ward Armstrong']","
Del. Ward Armstrong says Gov. McDonnell didn't consult GOP on transportation plan
 ","
The chairman of Virginia’s Republican Party recently sent a letter to all the state’s Democrat legislators soliciting ideas for how to address state road needs.  

""If for some reason you feel uncomfortable reaching out to the Governor, just drop by our
Headquarters on Grace Street,"" Pat Mullins wrote. ""You don't even have to come in the front door. We're putting a drop box in the atrium. Just open the door, and drop your plan. Any format you like.""

Mullins even offered  to carry each idea to the Governor’s office himself.

The missive was not well-received by a number of Democrats, House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong among them.

On Monday, Armstrong fired a response saying Mullins’ letter ""reveals a certain desperation by the Republican Party of Virginia."" He also took aim at the Governor’s recently released $4 billion transportation plan.

""On Monday we learned that the Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan to borrow $3 billion and take another $1 billion out of the general fund to pay for transportation,"" Armstrong wrote. ""Despite your entreaties, that revelation makes it difficult to believe that the Governor is inclined to listen to the Democrats if he didn’t even run this plan by the Republican majority in the House of Delegates before sending it out.""  

It would seem remarkable if the Governor hadn’t consulted with fellow Republicans before trotting out the plan, so we thought we’d look into that.  

Asked for a source, Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, pointed us to a Washington Post blog. It reported unnamed legislators were miffed that House and Senate Republican legislative caucuses were not briefed prior to the announcement of the plan.

Is briefing the caucuses common protocol before making such an announcement?

""It’s a best practice, but not as commonly done as one might assume,"" said Bill Leighty, who was chief of staff to former Govs. Mark R. Warner and Timothy M. Kaine.

It’s accurate the governor did not collectively brief the 78 lawmakers who belong to either the House or Senate Republican caucus. Armstrong seemed to take it one step further by saying the governor ""did not consult members of his own party"" before releasing the plan.

McDonnell spokesman Tucker Martin said Armstrong is wrong.

""The governor’s transportation proposals were all derived from transportation work groups that included Republican lawmakers,"" he said. ""Every proposal was discussed. Further, the governor and staff are in constant communication with Republican leaders in both houses regarding all policy proposals made by this office.""

We talked to talk to a few Republicans to make sure.

Del. Glenn Oder, R-Newport News, said he helped shape and vet the proposal as part of a 12-person transportation work group that included Republicans from the House and Senate as well as the administration.

Read the quote from Armstrong’s letter, Oder responded: ""Who in the world would have told him that? He (Armstrong) didn’t call and ask me.""  

Oder said everyone in the group was aware of everything in the governor’s announcement.

""I can’t emphasize enough how extensive the discussions have been on these issues,"" he said. ""To say that no one was aware just isn’t anywhere close to accurate.""   

What about Republican leadership?

""I don’t know where he gets that kind of stuff,"" said G. Paul Nardo, chief of staff to House Speaker William J. Howell, R-Stafford. ""There’s a lot of things you could probably criticize the administration for, but communication isn’t one of them.""

Nardo noted the Post blog didn’t name or quote any Republicans complaining that they weren’t consulted.

""It’s just ridiculous. The speaker was involved with it in specific discussions early on and certainly kept abreast,"" he said, adding that Howell was made aware of the announcement days beforehand and knew ""the broad contours"" of the plan.

""We didn’t see a press release beforehand or anything like that,"" Nardo said, noting that sending out a mass email to legislators in advance wouldn’t be prudent since specifics might leak.  

House Majority Whip Bill Janis, R-Henrico, echoed Nardo.  

""I am aware that the Governor directly or representatives of the Governor spoke to House leadership beforehand,"" Janis said.

""The notion that they’re not making us aware of stuff beforehand is just flat out wrong,"" he said. ""Whether we’re having detailed three-hour long meetings about each and every policy initiative they have...that’s just not a realistic expectation.""

Let’s recap.

Armstrong wrote the ""Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan."" Clearly, not every Republican legislator was in the loop.

While not every GOP legislator was in the loop, plenty were involved in shaping the plan and the Republican leadership says they were kept informed along the way.

We find the claim False.    ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9DAA00>],/factchecks/2010/dec/24/ward-armstrong/del-ward-armstrong-says-gov-mcdonnell-didnt-consul/
"['Education', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'Boyd Richie']","
Democratic chairman says Republican leaders are calling for thousands of teacher layoffs
","
Boyd Richie, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, voiced dismay when an East Texas state representative re-elected as a Democrat in November signaled plans to join the Republican Party.

Richie said in a Dec. 13 press release that Rep. Allan Ritter of Nederland would be joining the party ""whose leaders have proposed laying off thousands of teachers and slashing the budgets of institutions like Lamar University in Beaumont.""

The budget guidance to state agencies has been widely reported. For this article, we’re zeroing in on whether GOP leaders have proposed laying off thousands of teachers.

Democratic spokeswoman Kirsten Gray pointed to news reports on recommendations that lawmakers ease the longstanding class-size mandate for the five earliest elementary-school grades.

On Dec. 8, the Dallas Morning News reported that the Senate Education Committee, chaired by Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, wants the Senate to consider modifying the 22-pupil class-size cap, which is a change championed by state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston. The cap was put in place by lawmakers in a 1984 special session on education that also raised teacher pay and launched the requirement that students pass classes to participate in extracurricular activities.

A day later, the newspaper said a fresh recommendation by State Comptroller Susan Combs would require schools to average 22 students in the early grades, compared to the current average of 19.3 students. The News’ story says that with the change, nearly 12,000 elementary teaching jobs would be cut, saving the state $558 million a year.

Teacher groups objected. Richard Kouri, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, told the News: ""It’s no surprise that if you put more kids in classrooms and fire a bunch of teachers, you’ll save money. And you don’t save $558 million a year without firing thousands of elementary school teachers.""

How did Combs propose teacher layoffs?

She didn’t, in so many words. But the comptroller’s December report, Connecting the Dots: School Spending and Student Progress, says the state would save $159 million annually if Kindergarten-Grade 4 class sizes were told to average 20 students or nearly $558 million if the permitted average was 22 students.

The report bases the projected savings on the average state salary for K-4 teachers of $46,904. By our math, Combs’ recommendation could eliminate the need for 3,390 to 11,886 teaching positions.

Combs’ spokesman, Allen Spelce, didn’t quibble with our math, yet said by e-mail that the recommendation ""does not necessarily imply layoffs."" Other ways to cut teaching costs without teachers losing jobs: ""Enrollment growth could help increase"" the average number of students per classroom and ""simple (employee) attrition could help too,"" Spelce said.

His e-mail closes: ""The recommendation was simply to give districts more local control and flexibility"" in tight budget times.

Kouri reaffirmed to us there’s no way to achieve big savings without thousands of layoffs though Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, said there could be layoffs, but not in the thousands, adding that normal attrition in the teaching ranks could soften the impact.

Next, we read the Senate panel’s recommendation, which says ""options to explore"" include modifying class-size limits. The report, signed by the committee’s five Republicans and four Democrats, has no additional details or any indication the committee even favors modification.

In an interview, Shapiro agreed that changing the 22-1 ratio could lead to teacher job losses, but she cautioned against assuming that means thousands of layoffs. Shapiro said: ""What I hope to see, (districts) will start utilizing those teachers in a different way... Maybe they stop hiring new teachers.""

Shapiro also said the idea didn’t originate with Republican leaders; school superintendents have sought flexibility in the class-size standard.

Spokeswomen Jackie Lain of the school boards’ association and Jenny Caputo of the Texas Association of School Administrators told us districts consider the class-size cap a major cost driver and administrators would welcome more sway over class size. However, neither group has declared a position on changing the law.

Lain said how each district handles a revised cap would vary and districts would look for ways to avoid layoffs. ""School boards don’t want to fire teachers,"" she said.

Lain, Caputo and other school experts said school enrollment growth, which averaged 2 percent statewide in the decade through 2008-09, affects teacher hirings; so does teacher turnover.

Statewide, the number of teachers in public schools increased 5,300 from 2008-09 to 2009-10, according to the Texas Education Agency, whose spokeswoman, Debbie Graves Ratcliffe, said it’s reasonable to assume the additions resulted from increased student enrollment. Teacher turnover averages 12 percent, Ratcliffe said, which for 2009-10 would amount to nearly 40,000 of more than 330,000 teachers.

Whew.

We ran the fact that no one has directly proposed laying off teachers past the Democratic spokeswoman. Gray replied by e-mail: ""Obviously no lawmaker is going to stand up and say ‘we should lay off 12,000 teachers,’ but that is the practical effect of the proposal. If someone proposes an idea that has an understood cost, they must take ownership of not only the idea, but the cost that is inherently tied to it.""

Our sense: One Republican leader -- Combs -- has recommended that lawmakers ease the class-size limit, which she projects would produce significant savings in teacher salaries. But no one has pitched a proposal calling for thousands of teacher layoffs. That’d be political hari-kari.

Nevertheless, it stands to reason that larger classes leads to fewer teachers, which gives Richie’s statement an element of truth. We rate it Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAA29C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/24/boyd-richie/democratic-chairman-says-republican-leaders-are-ca/
"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Dean Cannon']","
Dean Cannon says a majority of the state House has two years experience or less
","
Term limits for Florida's state representatives and senators result in a lot of turnover in Tallahassee after an election.

So after the Nov. 2, 2010, election, just how many freshmen House members will there be in 2011?

Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon quantified it this way in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times, which was posted on its political blog The Buzz on Dec. 8, 2010. The paragraph starts with a paraphrase:

""Cannon pointed out that freshmen lawmakers account for one-third of the 120-member House, and that two-thirds of the chamber have two years or less experience,"" The Buzz wrote, and then quoted Cannon: ""One of the things I'm really focused on is trying to put people where they can best get up to speed and hit the ground running once we start committee meetings in January.""

If Cannon's math is right, that means the majority of the incoming House would have two years of experience or less -- a high number. Those are the numbers we're checking.

First, some background on term limits.

A Feb. 7, 2010, article in the St. Petersburg Times and Miami Herald contains some useful background about milestones in Florida's political history, including the vote in favor of term limits in 1992:

""A string of scandals in Congress spurred a national movement known as term limits aimed at driving career politicians from office. The Florida campaign is known as 'Eight is Enough' and limits Cabinet members and legislators to eight years in office; it passed with a whopping 77 percent in favor. (Ironically, it does not apply to members of Congress). The full effect wouldn't be clear until eight years later, when the eight-year clock kicked in and the state House saw rampant turnover -- 63 of its 120 members were freshmen. Term limits are blamed today for an assortment of ills, from myopia among legislators to the exaggerated influence of special interest money, lobbyists and even the media.""

We should note here some benefits to term limits: fresh faces may provide new ideas and at least initially could be more in touch with constituents back home.

For some national perspective on term limits we turn to the National Conference of State Legislatures that provides this background on its website:

""Proposals to limit the terms of state legislators have been the subject of public policy debate since 1990, when citizen initiatives limiting the terms of legislators were passed by voters in California, Colorado and Oklahoma. Subsequently, 18 other states adopted term limits, but in four -- Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming -- term limits were thrown out by the state supreme courts, and they have been repealed by the legislatures in Idaho and Utah. That leaves 15 states with term limits for legislators. See our current list of states with term limits for legislators.""

Now back to the new faces -- and relatively new faces -- in the 2011 Legislature.

First we turned to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta on Dec. 20, 2010, who told us she counted 82 freshman or sophomore legislators -- 44 of those freshmen -- among the 120 state representatives. Betta directed us to the state House website to check her figures. We clicked on the page of each of the 120 members of the House. Each page has some basic biographical information -- heck, even an occasional interesting tidbit such as the recreational interest of newly elected Republican member James W. ""J.W."" Grant of Tampa: ""Most sports and anything in the woods or on the water."" The pages also state when each member was first elected to the House, including past service.

Here are the totals we found that we will explain in more detail below:
 
Elected in 2007: 5
Elected in 2008: 33
Elected in 2009: 1
Elected in 2010: 43

That puts the total elected between 2007 and 2010 at 82, so we're at the same starting point as Betta's number. 
Of the 43 elected this year, three had served in the House previously: Dennis Baxley (R-Ocala), 2000-2007; Gayle Harrell (R-Stuart), 2000-2008; and Irv Slosberg (D-Boca Raton), 2000-2006. Also, two of the 43 were elected in special elections: Janet Cruz (D-Tampa) on Feb. 23 and Matt Gaetz (R-Fort Walton Beach) on April 13. (Cruz and Gaetz then won re-election to full terms this fall.)

We define ""freshmen"" as ""first-year beginners,"" like high school or college. If we count as freshmen all 43 members elected at any time in 2010, we get a freshmen class that represents about 36 percent of the House. If we don't count Baxley, Harrell and Slosberg as freshmen -- since they've already worked through several sessions each -- then the freshmen class represents 33 percent.

But wait, how should we count Cruz, who was elected Feb. 23 just before the regular two-month session started in March? And Gaetz, who was elected April 13 when that regular session only had about two weeks to go? Should they be counted as freshmen in 2011 even though they participated in votes and had their names attached to several bills in 2010?

If we omit both of them as freshmen -- as well as the three who had previously served -- that would drop the percentage to about 32 percent. 
 (For the record, Betta says Cannon also counts Mack Bernard (D-West Palm Beach), who won a special election on Sept. 22, 2009, as a freshman, even though he was active in the 2010 session -- bringing her total to 44, or about 37 percent.)

Using any of those four figures -- 32 percent, 33 percent, 36 percent or 37 percent -- we are at or very close to the one-third cited by Cannon. 
Now what about the other part of Cannon’s description, that two-thirds of the members have two years of experience or less? We counted 33 who were elected in 2008, one elected in 2009, and 43 in 2010. That brought our total since 2008 -- two years -- to 77 members, or 64 percent. (Again, if we don’t count the three lawmakers who served previously and easily have more than two years of experience, the percentage drops to 62 percent. Either way, that's close to two-thirds.)

Betta wanted us to count five lawmakers who won special elections in 2007 as sophomores because they would be starting their second two-year terms in 2011. But those five have already worked through the legislative sessions of 2008, 2009 and 2010, and we don't see them as sophomores. 
So is Cannon correct? He was paraphrased as saying that one-third of the 120-member House are freshmen and two-thirds have two years or less experience. We can split hairs on the experience level of  a few of them, but not enough to change his math. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB987840>],/factchecks/2010/dec/23/dean-cannon/dean-cannon-says-majority-state-house-has-two-year/
"['Elections', 'Crime', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Fitzgerald']","
Wisconsin state Sen. Scott Fitzgerald says some people have been found to be voting five or six times a day
","
Wisconsin Republicans have long pushed unsuccessfully for a photo identification requirement at the polls, citing the need to guard against voter fraud.

So it was not a surprise when the incoming Senate majority leader, Republican Scott Fitzgerald, told reporters a photo ID bill would be the first introduced in 2011. But a recent Fitzgerald statement in defense of photo ID, made to a Green Bay journalist, was an eyebrow raiser.

A Green Bay Press-Gazette editorial on Dec. 9, 2010 quoted Fitzgerald saying: ""We continue to see these isolated incidents of people trying to vote five, six times a day; people voting based on some sort of fraudulent documentation that's offered…People think it's important they have open, good, solid, free elections.""

Fitzgerald’s allegation that people are voting up five or six times in one election is one we have not heard before.

Is that really going on?

We turned to Fitzgerald’s office, where spokesman Andrew Welhouse couldn’t cite a specific case. Instead, he said there might be cases in other states. But those cases, an anonymous allegation in Oregon and a claim in Alabama, have not been proved.

As for Wisconsin, Welhouse mentioned the episode in the 2000 presidential election when a Marquette University student claimed he voted four times. But he said Fitzgerald was not necessarily referring to that -- though he offered that it’s the ""strongest case.""

Finally, Welhouse referenced a Milwaukee Police Department report on the 2004 elections in the city of Milwaukee -- an election plagued by vote-count discrepancies, documented by the Journal Sentinel, and allegations of voter-registration fraud.

Let’s pause for some context.

Wisconsin’s system, which does not require voter ID and allows same-day registration, is one of the most open in the country. Supporters say this helps Wisconsin consistently rank among the states with the highest voter turnout. Critics say that leaves the system more vulnerable to fraud.

Republicans have pushed photo ID as a solution, but Democrats say its overkill and could discourage voting. We are not analyzing that argument here.

Additionally, law enforcement officials say cases of fraud are easier to establish than to prosecute. That is, they may identify suspicious cases, but not be able to determine who was responsible. Thus, measures based on how many cases of fraud are ultimately prosecuted, or lead to convictions, give only a partial picture of what may be happening.

Conversely, investigators emphasize that in many cases where documents show an irregularity, the problem turns out not to be multiple voting but routine recording errors by clerks.

This item is not aimed at establishing how much or how little fraud there is. Rather, it is looking strictly at Fitzgerald’s statement about people who attempt to vote five or six times.

Let’s look first at the 2000 incident involving the MU student, since Fitzgerald is hanging his hat mostly on that -- to the degree he has evidence to hang his hat on.

The episode, which drew national media attention, started on campus after scores of students responding to a Marquette Tribune survey claimed they had voted at least twice. One student’s name emerged: Rob Bosworth, 18, told reporters for the Journal Sentinel that he voted four times at the same polling place in Milwaukee.

But Bosworth’s claims did not hold up when examined by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

And after a five-week investigation, the Milwaukee County district attorney’s office found no evidence supporting it. Bosworth, who had gained national publicity, later recanted his story.

The DA’s inquiry examined voting records for hundreds of MU students and found no double voting. McCann concluded that the student survey had drawn ""apparently unfounded, spoof responses.""

No one was charged.

Another piece of evidence cited by Welhouse was the Milwaukee Police Department report on the flawed 2004 election. It outlined absentee ballots never counted and poll workers allowing people clearly from outside the city to vote in Milwaukee.

Police investigators, though, found almost no evidence supporting the GOP’s claims of double voting and invalid addresses in that election.

There are, however, well-documented if isolated instances of double-voting -- or alleged double voting -- in Wisconsin.

Perhaps most memorably, Donovan Riley, a retired attorney running for state Senate, voted in Chicago and in Wisconsin in the 2000 presidential election. He was convicted in 2006.

More recently, a Milwaukee couple, Herb and Suzanne Gunka, were charged with voting by absentee ballot and at a polling place in the 2008 presidential election. They have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial; Herb Gunka says he voted on election day because he feared that his absentee ballot was not being counted.

Currently, investigators in Minnesota and Wisconsin are checking into possible cross-state double voting from 2008. And a task force set up by local, state and federal officials in 2008 has filed double-voting allegations in two cases, including the Gunka case.

Most of the election-fraud cases charged in recent years involve voting by felons who are ineligible, or voter-registration fraud by groups, officials say. Not cases where individuals voted repeatedly, which is what Fitzgerald focused on.

To make sure we weren’t missing any cases of people voting more than twice, we talked to 10 state, county and local elections officials, and law enforcement officers at the local and federal level.

None of the officials reported a case of voting more than two times. They said they couldn’t be totally sure that a local case had escaped their attention, but Reid Magney, a spokesman for the state office overseeing elections, said it was extremely unlikely.

In Fitzgerald’s home base, Juneau in Dodge County, election official Jane Fude said vote fraud was not a problem in a small town.

""We know who you are, where you live, where your parents live and what time you got home last night,"" Fude said.

It’s too early to say what fraud cases may emerge from the fall 2010 elections because records are still being checked, officials said.

Time to decide.

In trying to bolster the case for photo ID, the state Senate’s top Republican asserted that people have voted five to six times in the same election. His office couldn’t provide any evidence -- from Wisconsin or elsewhere -- to back that up. The one Wisconsin episode they mention as a possibility, the Marquette student, was disproved after extensive investigation. Election officials are unaware of anything on the level of serial voting that Fitzgerald refers to. And we were unable to turn up such a case in our research.

We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB7EC80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/23/scott-fitzgerald/wisconsin-state-sen-scott-fitzgerald-says-some-peo/
"['Oregon', 'Crime', 'Guns', 'Sam Adams']","
Portland Mayor Sam Adams says “four out of 10 homicides in this city are committed by gun.”
","
Portland Mayor Sam Adams has thrown out a number of statistics in pitching his five-point plan to reduce gun and youth violence in the city. But this number stuck out: He said at a council  session that ""four out of 10 homicides in this city are committed by gun.""

PolitiFact Oregon would think the number higher.

We checked with Roy Kaufmann, the mayor’s spokesman, who responded with a 39-slide PowerPoint presentation by the Portland Police Bureau. Slide 4 shows that from 2007 to 2010 there were 101 homicides in the city. Of those, 42 involved firearms. On-the-job officer-related shootings are not included. Here’s the breakdown by year, according to police:
  
2007: 29 homicides, 13 involved firearms. 
2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms. 
2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms. 
2010: 24 homicides, 11 involved firearms. 
  
Because we were curious to know how others died in those years, we decided to check The Oregonian’s in-house library for our own list of homicides. And we came up with this rendering, again, excluding officer-related shootings: 
2007: 29 homicides, with 13 involving firearms, four were stabbed, three died of head injuries. 
2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms, a dozen were stabbed. 
2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms, six were stabbed, and the remaining     six died of strangulation, drowning, head trauma, bludgeoning, vehicular     homicide and a stopped heart. 
Finally, we checked the Portland Police Bureau’s news releases to track this year’s homicides so far. 
2010: 25 homicides to date, 11 involved firearms, seven people were     stabbed and two were strangled. 

The deaths reported in our review adds up to 102 homicides, of which 42 involved firearms, or a ratio of 4.1 out of 10. All figures back up the mayor’s claim. About four of 10 homicides in the city involve guns. Knives and other cutters come in second, with nearly three of 10 homicides.

Here’s the takeaway point: Portland is different from the rest of the country. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, firearms accounted for 67 percent of 13,636 homicides in 2009. Knives and other sharp cutting instruments accounted for 13 percent.

We also asked Jeff Bock, the Oregon Uniform Crime Reporting manager with the Oregon State Police, to check homicide causes in other cities in the state. Again, firearms led the way, with knives and other sharp tools trailing behind. Of 373 homicides 2006-2009 in Portland, Gresham, Beaverton, Hillsboro, Eugene and Salem, nearly half involved firearms and 25 percent involved knives or other sharp-edged instruments.

We find the statement made by Adams to be True.

"['LGBTQ', 'Military', 'Texas', 'Louie Gohmert']","
Louie Gohmert says those who don't answer directly to president call repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' a ""terrible idea""
","
Objecting to a proposal repealing the law preventing gays and lesbians from serving openly in the U.S. military, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, said he had received hundreds of letters from military personnel vowing not to re-enlist if the change went through.

""The hundreds I've heard from, that I didn't bring their quotes down here, have said, you pass this and I will tell you personally, but I will not say it in the presence of my commander, you pass this, I will not re-enlist,"" Gohmert said on the House floor Dec. 15. ""...Because we know what this president, this commander in chief, wants, just as does the secretary of defense, the two people that the president appoints said let's do it, because they know the president appointed, he's their boss, and all those who do not answer directly to the president, they've said this is a terrible idea.""

The House subsequently voted to repeal the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" law and the Senate followed suit. President Barack Obama signed the change into law Wednesday.

Regardless, was Gohmert correct that the two people the president appointed supported the change in law, but that everyone who doesn't answer to Obama gave the idea thumbs-downs?

To our request for back-up evidence, Gohmert sent this statement: ""The top officers in the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps have voiced grave concerns with ending the DADT policy during a time of war. Any disruption to our military at a time when our troops are in harm’s way is dangerous and could cost lives. One single life lost to a degradation of combat-unit cohesion on the front lines is one life too many.""

That sent us scrambling for testimony.

To recap: On Feb. 2, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each told the Senate Armed Services Committee he favored dropping the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law put in place in 1993.

Mullen testified: ""No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens.""

According to a Feb. 2 New York Times news article, Mullen was the first sitting chairman of the Joint Chiefs to support repealing the law, saying it was his belief that ""allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do."" According to the Times, Gates ""was more cautious, even as he acknowledged that the question was not whether the law would be repealed, but how the Pentagon might best prepare for the change.""

Next, we turned to news articles on testimony about the change posted online by the American Forces Press Service.

On Dec. 3, the joint chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee; Gen. James Cartwright, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said he favored repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.

Adm. Gary Roughhead, chief of naval operations, is quoted saying: ""With the exception of the moderate risk associated with projected retention and some Navy irregular warfare specialties, I assess the risk of readiness, effectiveness and cohesion to the Navy to be low. Based on my professional judgment and informed by the inputs of our Navy, I recommend repeal.""

Gen. George Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, is quoted saying he supports repealing the law, but not during wartime. Gen. Norton Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff, and Gen. James Amos, the Marine Corps' top officer, also recommended not repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell while the United States is at war.

Scorecard?

The defense secretary, chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in favor of repealing the law. So too did the Navy's Roughhead.

However, three of the four joint chiefs — the top officers Gohmert refered to in his statement to us — recommended not repealing the law now.

According to federal law, members of the joint chiefs of staff are military advisers to the president, with the chairman — Mullen — being the primary adviser. The chairman is appointed by the president, with advice and consent from the Senate.

Next, we turned to the results of a nine-month Pentagon study on the effects of repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell. According to the results, released Nov. 30, the study amounted to one of the largest in the military's history, drawing 115,052 responses to a survey issued to nearly 40,000 active-duty and reserve service members.

From the study: ""When we asked about how having a service member in their immediate unit who said he or she is gay would affect the unit's ability to 'work together to get the job done,' 70 percent of service members predicted it would have a positive, mixed or no effect... when asked about the actual experience of serving in a unit with a coworker who they believed was gay or lesbian, 92 percent stated that the unit's 'ability to work together' was 'very good,' 'good,' or 'neither good nor poor.'""

According to the study, 15 to 20 percent of service members said repeal would have a positive effect, while 30 percent said it would have a negative effect.

"['Retirement', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Gov. Bob McDonnell flip-flops on state employees pension contributions
","
On his way to the Executive Mansion, Bob McDonnell emphatically pledged not to reduce the state’s level of contribution to the retirement benefits of state employees.

Back In September 2009, then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine proposed having employees contribute a portion of their salaries toward their pensions as part of an effort to close an anticipated $1.35 billion revenue shortfall in the state’s recession-wracked budget.

McDonnell didn’t like that idea, as documented on his campaign website.

""The tough fiscal climate...is no excuse for breaking a longstanding commitment to the men and women who have dedicated their careers to the service of Virginia’s people"" the Republican gubernatorial candidate said.

In the release, McDonnell noted the state has paid its workers’ pension contributions since 1983 as a compromise for not offering workers a pay raise that year.

""The compromise represents a promise made by the Commonwealth to state workers,"" McDonnell said. ""That promise cannot be broken.""

As governor, McDonnell reinforced that commitment in April 2010.

""Current state and many local employees took their jobs with the expectation that their retirement contributions would come from their employer,"" McDonnell said. ""We cannot turn our back on that agreement.""

Ultimately, the General Assembly did require new employees hired after July 1 to pay the 5 percent toward their pensions, but not those working the state before that date.  

Fast forward to last week when McDonnell announced that he will ask the remaining 86,000 state employees to pay 5 percent of their salaries toward their pensions.

The governor’s proposal eases the pain by raising pay 3 percent for state employees hired before new retirement rules took effect, meaning the changes would leave them with 2 percent less in take-home pay.

McDonnell said the measure was essential to prop a retirement system underfunded by $17.6 billion. The pension plan, like many public retirement systems, has been hurt by the low investment performance and inadequate support from the state government.

A year ago, before McDonnell took office, VRS was underfunded by $11.9 billion.

Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, acknowledged the governor’s position on employee pension contributions has changed since his candidacy. ""Since that time, everyone has learned additional, significant details regarding VRS and the need significant new investment in the immediate future,"" she said.

McDonnell last week told reporters, ""The system is broken and badly in need of repair. I will not pass on a broken system to another governor.""

That’s a noble goal, but a reversal nonetheless. Full Flop!

"['Iraq', 'Texas', 'George W. Bush']","
Former President George W. Bush says that as a senator, Joe Biden recommended partioning Iraq
","
In his memoir Decision Points, President George W. Bush says that he declined to announce plans to increase troop levels in Iraq in 2006 until after the midterm elections. 
""The rhetoric on Iraq was hot,"" he said. ""Sen. Joe Biden, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, recommended partitioning Iraq into three separate entities. Republicans were anxious, too. Mitch McConnell (the Senate minority leader from Kentucky) made it clear with his Oval Office request for a troop reduction."" 
Before he was elected Vice President in 2008, Biden called for boundaries to be drawn for the Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite populations. But is that the same as partitioning a country? The word can hold some heavy implications: think India, Korea and Vietnam — previously unified territories that were divided into two countries. 
Seeking an answer to that question, we turned to the May 2006 op-ed article published in The New York Times that then-Delaware Sen. Biden penned with Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. In it, they drew a parallel between conditions in Iraq and Bosnia's recent ethnic turmoil. 
""A decade ago, Bosnia was torn apart by ethnic cleansing and facing its demise as a single country,"" the article says. ""After much hesitation, the United States stepped in decisively with the Dayton Accords, which kept the country whole by, paradoxically, breaking it into ethnic federations, even allowing Muslims, Croats and Serbs to retain separate armies. With the help of American and other forces, Bosnians have lived a decade in relative peace and are now slowly strengthening their common central government, including disbanding those separate armies last year."" 
A similar plan for Iraq, the Biden-Gelb article says, would ""maintain a united Iraq by decentralizing it,"" establishing ""three largely autonomous regions with a viable central govetrnment in Baghdad . . .The Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws, administration and internal security. The central government would control border defense, foreign affairs and oil revenues. Baghdad would become a federal zone, while densely populated areas of mixed populations would receive both multi-sectarian and international police protection."" 
And as to the ""p"" word? The article says: ""Some will say moving toward strong regionalism would ignite sectarian cleansing. But that's exactly what is going on already, in ever-bigger waves. Others will argue that it would lead to partition. But a breakup is already under way. As it was in Bosnia, a strong federal system is a viable means to prevent both perils in Iraq."" 
In 2007, Biden — who by then had become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, shepherded a nonbinding ""sense of the Senate"" resolution that proposed separating Iraq into three semi-autonomous regions while maintaining a federal government. The resolution passed the Senate 75 to 23.
According to a C-SPAN video, Biden told colleagues on the Senate floor in April 2007: ""You make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives. . . Let them control their local police, their education, their religion, their marriage. That's the only possibility. Change the focus to a limited central government and a federal system that their Constitution calls for."" 
But when news articles used ""partition"" or ""soft partition"" to describe Biden's proposal, the senator took exception to the label, mindful that in foreign policy, it is a loaded term. 
A June 2007 paper from the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution making the case for ""soft partition in Iraq"" says it would divide the ""country into three main regions. Each would assume primary responsibility for its own security and governance... it would require new negotiations, the formation of revised legal framework for the country, the creation of new institutions at the regional level, and the organized but voluntary movement of populations."" 
""Such a plan for soft partition (as opposed to hard-partition which involves outright division of Iraq) is consistent"" with the Biden-Gelb plan, according to the paper. 
Michael O'Hanlon, the paper's coauthor and a Brookings' foreign policy fellow, told us in an e-mail that ""Biden called it enhanced federalism. He did not say that it would be formal partition into three states."" O'Hanlon described ""enhanced federalism"" as ""three regions with lots of autonomy."" 
In an October 2007 op-ed (again co-written with Gelb) for The Washington Post, Biden wrote: ""Our plan is not partition, though even some supporters and the media mistakenly call it that. It would hold Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution. A federal Iraq is a united Iraq but one in which power devolves to regional governments, with a limited central government responsible for common concerns such as protecting borders and distributing oil revenue."" 
And during a July 18, 2010 interview on ABC's This Week, Biden said: ""I don't want to debate history here, but I never called for a partition. I called for a central government with considerable autonomy in the regions."" PolitiFact National rated his statement True. 
But is a rose by any other name still a rose? We wondered whether what Bush calls a partition and what Biden calls, well, not a partition, shakes out the same way. 
O'Hanlon said ""the word 'partition,' by itself, tends to mean separate states. 'Soft partition' or 'enhanced federalism' or 'autonomous regions' are fairer ways to characterize Biden's thinking. I would say partition is inaccurate as a depiction,"" he said. 
Long story short, Biden proposed dividing the country into three separate and semi-autonomous regions while retaining a federal system to handle border security and other common concerns. Bush calls that partitioning. Biden does not, pointing to his support for a central government in Iraq. 
But both are talking about creating new geopolitical entities in Iraq. We rate Bush's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBD79C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/22/george-w-bush/former-president-george-w-bush-says-senator-joe-bi/

'Simple' solution to the economic crisis would cost more than three times the national debt
","
Sometimes it's the simple, overlooked solution that's the best.

One proposal for fixing the U.S. economy, known as the ""Patriotic Retirement Plan,"" is making the rounds in e-mail inboxes, along with a notation that says, ""I think this guy nailed it!"" In some variations, it takes the form of a letter to the president:

""Instead of giving billions of dollars to companies that will squander the money on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, use the following plan. You can call it the 'Patriotic Retirement Plan':

""There are about 40 million people over 50 in the work force. Pay them $1 million apiece severance for early retirement with the following stipulations:

""1.) They MUST retire. Forty million job openings -- Unemployment fixed.

""2.) They MUST buy a new AMERICAN car. Forty million cars ordered -- Auto Industry fixed.

""3.) They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage -- Housing Crisis fixed.

""It can't get any easier than that!!  
""P.S. If more money is needed, have all members in Congress pay their taxes. Mr. President, while you're at it, make Congress retire on Social Security and Medicare. I'll bet both programs would be fixed pronto!

""If you think this would work, please forward to everyone you know.""

Apparently a lot of people are buying it.

This e-mail, written and passed along by the mathematically challenged, has been going around since 2009, helped by the note that it was published Feb . 8, 2009,  in The St. Petersburg Times. (The newspaper asked readers for their suggestions to fix the economy. This was one of more than two dozen responses.) 

Even though the plan was debunked by Snopes.com in April 2009, it continues to thrive on the Internet. A quick Google search shows that it has popped up on blogs as recently as last month, with supporting comments such as this one on Nov. 27 on Tech Support Forums: ""That's so simple, and yet such a good idea ... I'm in, I'm only 47 give me a million I'll retire tomorrow, pay off my house keep my American cars I already have, split the rest in half and put half in the bank, invest the other half and live the rest of my life in comfort, and with the security the govt PROMISED me when I first joined the Navy.""
 
But as soon as you look at the numbers, the plan disintegrates.

Giving 40,000,000 people $1,000,000 each would cost the United States $40,000,000,000,000, or $40 trillion.

In contrast, the controversial TARP bank bailout package passed by the federal government was worth about $0.7 trillion (or $700 billion). That's just 1.8 percent of what this e-mail proposes to spend.

To put this in perspective, the national debt as of Dec. 17 was nearly $14 trillion dollars. That's $44,648 for every man, woman and child -- legal and illegal -- in the United States.

Getting 40 million Americans to retire early and spend money on a car and home would certainly help out the housing and automotive industries. But saying that our economic problems would be solved by nearly quadrupling our national debt to $173,000 per person is a ridiculous statement.

Personally, we don't have that kind of money to burn. So, instead, we'll take a match and lighter fluid to this e-mail and declare it Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAABF100>],/factchecks/2010/dec/22/chain-email/simple-solution-economic-crisis-would-cost-more-th/
"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Ellen Freidin']","
Reform advocate says ""dozens'' of Florida political districts split counties and splinter cities
","
  
Following a polarizing midterm election, and with intensifying partisan bickering over everything from taxes to health care, a group dubbing itself No Labels is hoping to start an earnest discussion about policy over politics. The group, comprised of Democrats, Republicans and independents, launched its website on Dec. 13, 2010, in the hopes of starting a movement that ""encourages leaders to ‘put the labels aside’ in an effort to seek common sense solutions to our nation's problems.""

The launch brought out independents like outgoing Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who both spoke at a kickoff event in New York City that was live-streamed on the No Labels website.

Also speaking was Ellen Freidin, chairwoman of Fair Districts Florida, a group behind the passage of two  constitutional amendments that set new guidelines for how legislative and congressional districts are drawn up. Freidin used the occasion to note: ""We have dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common.""

We decided to take a closer look at Freidin’s statement. The Fair Districts Florida website cites two examples of such districts, but we were curious to see if there were dozens of examples, as Freidin stated. 
About redistricting

First, some background on how Florida’s districts are created. It’s an issue bound to be back in the limelight as state legislators restart the process of translating those numbers into political boundaries on a map.

Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. Occasionally, new congressional districts are added when a state gains population. For example, Florida gained two House seats this time. 
The civics book reason for periodic redistricting is to protect the value of each voter’s ballot by preventing it from being diluted by a population surge -- the goal being for each person's vote to carry relatively equal weight in elections. But the process of redistricting is never without accusations of ""gerrymandering"" often brought up against the party in power. 
The term dates back to 1812 when Massachusetts Gov. Eldbridge Gerry signed a bill to redistrict Massachusetts. A newspaper noted that the contorted districts on the map resembled salamanders, and the term ""gerrymander'' has since come to mean creating districts for political motive over geographical proximity. 
The Florida website for the redistricting that was carried out in 2002 gives a sense of the process and numbers involved. 
The Legislature divided the state’s population evenly into 120 state House districts, each containing a little over 130,000 people. Records show the number of registered voters per district ranged between 45,000 and 98,000. 
The same population is divided evenly into 40 state Senate districts. Each district's population hovered around 399,000, with the number of registered voters varying from about 134,000 to 280,000. 
Florida's Congressional districts contained a uniform population of 639,295, give or take a few people, and had voter registration ranging from about 232,600 to 418,700.     
During the November 2010 election, Florida voters approved two amendments to the state constitution that set specific guidelines in the creation of such districts. Amendment 5 was geared toward state districts and Amendment 6 was to be applied to congressional districts.

Both amendments say districts should not be drawn to favor incumbents or a particular political party. Districts must be contiguous, compact and follow local and geographical boundaries. The districts shall also not be drawn to interfere with minority representation as provided for in the Voting Rights Act.

The amendments were brought forth by Fair Districts Florida, a group that collected 1.7 million signatures to get the questions on the state ballot. 
A look at our districts 
So, do the districts created in 2002 ""go on for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common?''    

Here, with the distances for the larger districts approximated by plugging cities into Mapquest, are some examples we found of both state and congressional districts that speak to the issue at hand: 
The 2nd Congressional District  
This Panhandle district represented by newly elected Republican Steve Southerland contains the largest number of counties in the state's delegation -- 16. It takes in some or all of Bay, Calhoun, Dixie, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Okaloosa, Suwannee, Taylor, Wakulla and Walton counties. Approximate distance covered: 240 miles.   

The 3rd and 4th Congressional Districts  
The 3rd District, represented by Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown, contains portions of larger cities like Jacksonville and Orlando, while also taking in smaller communities like Gainesville and Apopka. The 2010 edition of the Almanac of American Politics notes that the district has three sets of borders. Designed in 1992 to be North Florida's black majority seat, from a partisan point of view it was also created ""to shift as many Democrats as possible to the 3rd District to strengthen Republicans elsewhere,'' the Almanac says. It taps Democratic voters in the center of Jacksonville, then picks up voters in Orlando and Gainesville, with stops in Sanford and smaller communities. Approximate distance covered: 210 miles. 
Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw's 4th District stretches across the northern border of the state from the Atlantic shore in Nassau County to Tallahassee in the center. It includes, as the Almanac notes, ""much of Jacksonville, minus the African-American neighborhoods,'' and runs west through Baker, Union, Columbia, Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson and Leon counties. Approximate distance covered: 165 miles.   
The 5th Congressional District  
Carved from west-Central Florida, this district represented in the upcoming Congress by Republican Rich Nugent stretches from the northern tip of Polk County to include nearly all of distant, rural Levy County, large portions of Lake, Marion and Pasco counties and all of Sumter, Citrus and Hernando counties. Approximate distance covered: 140 miles. 
The 6th Congressional District  
Republican U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns' district is another that takes a bite out of the metropolitan Jacksonville area. From there it wobbles south through wooded north-central Florida, shaving off part of Gainesville and stopping in Lake County, a short drive from Orlando. In the process it takes in some or all of Duval, Clay, Bradford, Alachua, Gilchrist, Levy, Marion and Lake counties. Approximate distance covered: 146 miles.     
The 10th and 11th Congressional Districts  
Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor's 11th District used to be entirely in Tampa and Hillsborough County, but during the 2002 redistricting, a sizable pocket of Democratic voters in South St. Petersburg were frog-marched across Tampa Bay, electorally speaking, to be joined with Democratic kindred spirits. The district also picked up a piece of Manatee County. The effect boosted the GOP margins in Pinellas County, where Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young holds the 10th District, which voted for Bill Clinton in 1996 and Al Gore in 2000. Young's district is the only one in Florida contained wholly within a single county's borders.          
The 16th Congressional District  
Represented by Republican Tom Rooney, the district stretches from the Atlantic coast on the east almost to the Gulf of Mexico, and was described in the 2010 edition of the Almanac of American Politics as ""one of the most oddly designed districts in the nation.’’ The district spans parts of Charlotte, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties. Approximate distance covered: 155 miles.
  
The 22nd Congressional District  
While the district was once a Democratic stronghold, it recently traded hands into the Republican party when Allen West defeated Democrat Ron Klein. the narrow coastal district, which stretches from Palm Beach Gardens down to Cooper City Broward County, may be a straight shot down the coast, but the western portion of the district is a series of electoral cul-de-sacs. 





  The 25th Congressional District 
The needs of voters in the largely Hispanic enclaves of West Miami-Dade County like Hialeah Gardens may have little in common with the needs of older rural voters in Collier County, but the two Republican-leaning areas are linked in the same congressional district. The 25th District was one of two new districts carved out by the Legislature in 2002. Mario-Diaz Balart, who was Florida House majority leader at the time, also chaired the redistricting committee that created the district. Diaz-Balart, a Republican, was subsequently elected the district’s first congressman in 2002. It is about to pass to newly elected U.S. Rep. David Rivera, also a Republican.  
State Senate District 1 
Sen. Tony Hill's district cascades south through Duval County, spreading out in central St. Johns, and sending a spur line into Putnam County, and dips south to take in a large swath of Flagler County and a looping portion of Volusia County. Approximate distance covered: 108 miles. 
 


State Senate District 3 
State Sen. Charlie Dean’s district covers Baker, Dixie, Hamilton, Lafayette, Suwannee and Taylor counties, in addition to parts of Citrus, Columbia, Jefferson, Leon, Levy, Madison and Marion counties. Approximate distance covered: 272 miles.
  
  
  
State Senate District 7 
Represented by Republican Sen. Evelyn J. Lynn, this district snakes from Clay County down to Putnam and Marion counties and covers most of Volusia County. Approximate distance covered: 165 miles.
 
  
 
State Senate District 8 

Republican Sen. John Thrasher’s district is spread along the Atlantic coast, running through Nassau, Duval, St. Johns, Flagler and Volusia counties. Approximate distance covered: 144 miles. 



State Senate District 14 
Republican Sen. Steve Oelrich's district covers Alachua, Bradford, Gilchrist and Union counties with portions of Columbia, Levy, Marion, and Putnam counties in the fold. Approximate distance covered: 85 miles. 
  
   
State Senate District 15 
Republican Sen. Paula Dockery's district is carved where four counties converge -- Hernando, Sumter, Lake and Polk, throwing in a piece of Osceola County to fill it out. Approximate distance covered: 159 miles.    
 
State Senate District 18 
The district, represented by Democratic Sen. Arthenia Joyner, covers parts of East and South Tampa, South St. Petersburg in Pinellas County and a sliver of Manatee County. Approximate distance covered: 57 miles.


  
State Senate District 21 
Republican Sen. Mike Bennett's district covers nearly all of Manatee County, plus pieces of Sarasota, DeSoto, Charlotte and Lee counties (and the Senate misspells Charlotte on its website map). Approximate distance covered: 124 miles.   
  
 
  
State Senate District 26 
The district represented by Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos covers coastal areas of Brevard County, but also covers portions of Osceola and Indian River counties. Approximate distance covered: 164 miles. 
  
    
State Senate District 27 
The district, currently represented by Palm Beach County Republican Lizbeth Benacquisto, spans five counties (Palm Beach, Glades, Hendry Charlotte and Lee) and travels nearly coast to coast from West Palm Beach in the east to Fort Myers in the west. Approximate distance covered: 140 miles.

  
  
State Senate District 28 
Republican Sen. Joe Negron's district hugs the highly developed southeastern coast, except when it veers deep into the state to pick up portions of Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties. Approximate distance covered: 109 miles.     
 
State Senate District 39 
Democratic Sen. Larcenia Bullard’s district covers a vast geographic terrain from Hendry County to rural Immokalee in Collier County, plus urban areas in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties and down to the Florida Keys in Monroe County. Approximate distance covered; 268 miles. 

  
State House districts are more compact because they take in a smaller population, but they do meander from time to time, with electoral ramifications for the counties and towns affected. Here are a few notable clusters: 
State House Districts 29, 30, 31, 32 
This Atlantic coast region is solidly Republican, with Tom Goodson in district 29, Ritch Workman in district 30, John Tobia in district 31 and Steve Crisafulli in district 32. Despite the GOP nature of the territory, it is still carved into byzantine interlocking connections of neighborhoods and towns around Melbourne and the beach communities to the north and south.  
State House Districts 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 49 
These districts, taken together, are a case study of the political legerdemain when district lines are drawn.     
Districts 36, 39 and 49 rub shoulders in the urban Orlando area, and present three faces of the Democratic Party -- white liberal, African American and Hispanic. The state House district interactive map puts them in political perspective. District 36, represented by liberal Democrat Scott Randolph, is shaped vaguely like a lobster, with its claws in northern and eastern Orange County and its body in the center of Orlando.  
District 39, represented by African American Rep. Geraldine Thompson, is a more solid, cohesive block of voters.  
District 49, represented by Darren Soto, tracks the Hispanic population through west Orlando, down to Kissimmee and elsewhere, spreading across Orange and Osceola counties. 
All around them are Republican districts enjoying a carefully crafted symbiotic relationship. Between the lobster's claws rests the wealthy enclave of Winter Park, in district 35, home to Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon. Nearby is the southern edge of Apopka Republican Rep. Bryan Nelson's district 38, which picks up voters in the gaps between Democratic districts 36 and 39.    
District 40, represented by Republican Eric Eisnaugle, is another odd configuration, cobbling together disparate suburbs in lumps and bulges constituting southern GOP border of this political nexus. 
Neighboring district 41, represented by Republican Stephen Precourt, is where the tidy urban divisions really begin to break down. With districts 36 and 39 holding large groups of Democrats across the border, this Republican district sprawls west from Orange County into the old Florida region of south Lake County, and dips into Osceola County to the south.    
 State House Districts 55, 67, 68 and 69 
With its southern end sandwiched narrowly between three Republican districts, district 55, represented by Democrat Darryl Rouson, combines voters in Sarasota, Manatee, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Greg Steube's district 67 takes eastern chunks of Sarasota and Manatee counties along with an oddly shaped section of southern Hillsborough County. Republican Rep. Jim Boyd's district 68 covers the more affluent beach communities around Bradenton, and district 69, represented  by Republican Jay Pilon, takes in south Manatee and Sarasota, enveloping the southern tip of Rouson's district.    
State House Districts 78, 79, 80, 84 
District 78, represented by Democrat Stephen Perman, contains a large portion of western Palm Beach County, plus odd pieces of Martin, St. Lucie and Okeechobee counties, including what looks like a surgical sliver of metropolitan Fort Pierce. It also wraps around district 84, represented by Haitian-born Democrat Mack Bernard, whose district includes Belle Glade and the surrounding area, then tracks along a road east to pick up more voters in neighborhoods around West Palm Beach. North of this oddly shaped pair of Democratic districts it is solidly Republican. Mike Horner's district 79 runs north from Okeechobee County through Osceola County and picks up chunks of Orange and Polk counties. And Debbie Mayfield's district 80 tracks the jagged edge of Perman's district to the Atlantic Ocean.    
State House Districts 101 and 112 
Naples Republican Matt Hudson's district is a political oddity with two nodes of urbanization separated by thousands of square miles of swamp, farms and open land. To the east it picks up a little of urban Broward County along the edge of Pembroke Pines, then it slides west through a long, narrow passage that includes the Everglades and Big Cypress swamp, emerging amidst a host of suburban neighborhoods around Naples, in Collier County. Approximate distance covered; 108 miles. The same strange geography and approximate distance applies with district 112, represented by Miami Republican Jeanette Nunez.    
Winnowing people by party alliance does raise a basic question about representative government -- Should a politician be given carte blanche to discard certain voters, or would the public good be better served if the offfice-holder were required to take divergent views into account? But that discussion is not why we're here.   
So, back to the question at hand. Was Freidin accurate in stating that Florida has ""dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common?""   
Florida has a total of 185 legislative and congressional districts -- 120 in the state House, 40 in the Senate and 25 in Congress. Of those, 67, or 36 percent, are contained within the borders of a single county. In less populated regions, a district must, of necessity, spread out to meet its population number. But, as the maps above show, that's not always the reason for the shifting lines.  
The state's major cities are carved into all manner of peculiar bits and pieces to assemble state House, Senate and even Congressional districts. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando are each divvied up into four congressional districts, often being grouped with smaller rural communities that share little common interest. 
 It is also clear that the integrity of county lines is not a concern when district lines are drawn. As we mentioned before, only one of the state's 25 congressional districts is wholly contained in one county. Among the rest, one includes some or all of 16 counties, and the average number of counties per district is 4.8. Miami-Dade and Broward counties are in five congressional districts. Hillsborough, Pinellas and Duval counties are in three.   
The state House and Senate are not much better. In the House, 59 -- slightly less than half -- of the districts fall within one county. One district takes in portions of 10 counties, and the average number of counties included wholly or partially in a state House seat is 1.96. Only seven of the 40 state Senate seats fall within one county, and on average, senate districts spread over three counties. 
What about the claim that districts ""go for 150 to 200 miles?'' 
Many do, as our rough approximations illustrate. Strictly speaking, there are not ""dozens'' that run over 150 miles, but there are at least nine on our list, and if you loosen the standard slightly to take in those over 140 miles, we found 13. One might argue that districts should be measured not just from end to end, but by the sprawling territory they take up, which would likely add to the list. Whether it would get it to ""dozens'' is debatable.

State Rep. Marty Kiar says teachers in Georgia earn $6,000 more than Florida
","
No public school teachers in Florida expect to get rich when they start their careers, but could they earn a bigger paycheck if they moved to Georgia?

That's what Florida state Rep. Marty Kiar suggested in a Dec. 14, 2010, meeting between South Florida state legislators and Republican Gov.-elect Rick Scott -- a meeting attended by this PolitiFact Florida reporter. Kiar, a Democrat who represents part of South Florida, serves on the PreK-12 appropriations subcommittee. So he should know his facts and figures on public school education.

During the meeting where legislators expressed their hopes and concerns for the upcoming year, many talked about public schools. Kiar made a plea to support public schools -- throwing in his criticism of last year's Senate Bill 6, which would have dramatically changed the teacher pay and tenure system and was vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist. During the campaign, Scott said he favored eliminating tenure for new teachers and expanding school options such as private schools, virtual schools and home schooling.

Kiar made a plea to not focus on ""punishing teachers,"" to keep the arts and physical education, and then made a comment about teacher pay:

""You can go to Georgia and make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher.""

That sounds like a hefty chunk of change when talking about a public school teacher's salary. We wanted to know -- is the pay difference that large? And was Kiar talking about starting pay? Average pay? Or perhaps some other measurement?

When we spoke to Kiar legislative assistant Scott Barrocas on Dec. 20, 2010, he said that Kiar was on a cruise. Since we could not reach Kiar directly by e-mail or cell phone, we decided the most fair measure of teacher pay and best comparison among states would be statewide average pay. That would reflect salaries for a range of teachers in terms of where they live in the state, experience, degrees held and subject matter.

A word of warning: Comparing teacher pay isn't a simple task. Even within the state, there are differences in pay and cost of living among school districts, and paychecks vary widely from small towns to urban centers to affluent beachfront communities. Also benefits vary between states, which makes a difference in take-home pay. And Florida doesn't have a state income tax while many other states -- including Georgia -- do. But Kiar's claim was about salaries, so we are limiting this Truth-O-Meter item to examining that measure.

The National Education Association, which describes itself as the nation's largest teachers union, showed that the average teacher pay in Florida was $46,912 compared to $54,274 in Georgia -- or a $7,362 difference during the 2009-10 school year. The chart showed an asterisk next to Georgia because the state's Department of Education did not supply the information in time for the report, said Ed Hurley, who works in research at the National Education Association. The NEA came up with an estimate based on pay in previous years and inflation, Hurley said.

Since it's difficult to obtain salary information from DOEs for the current year, Hurley suggested we look back at the NEA's chart for the 2008-09 year on Page 92. That chart showed average teacher pay for Florida was $46,921 and $52,879 for Georgia -- or about $5,958 more for Georgia.

We contacted Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education, to ask if he had average teacher pay data for Georgia. Cardoza responded in an e-mail that the average overall teacher salary is $53,138.40 for 2008-09 -- the most recent year of data available for Georgia.

We checked the Florida Department of Education for data about average teacher pay across the state. The DOE's Education Information and Accountability Services Data Report on Table 8 showed that the statewide average teacher salary for 2008-09 was $46,938. (Florida's statewide average for 2009-10 decreased slightly to $46,696 but Georgia could not supply that year's data yet and we wanted to compare for the same year.)

If we use the data from the Florida and Georgia DOEs, it shows teachers in Georgia earning about $6,200.40 more than in Florida in 2008-09.

Note that for the 2008-09 school year the NEA has slightly different figures than the states gave us -- about a $17 difference for Florida and about a $259 difference for Georgia. But the NEA shows nearly $6,000 higher pay in Georgia for 2008-09. The NEA shows more than a $7,000 difference for 2009-10, but the NEA used an estimate for Georgia for that year so it's not as valid of a comparison. 
Let's summarize all those numbers, with the difference showing how much higher the pay is in Georgia:

                                   FL                GA                Diff    
NEA 2008-09:     $46,921       $52,879          $5,958
NEA 2009-10:     $46,912       $54,274*        $7,362
DOE 2008-09:     $46,938       $53,138.40    $6,200.40
DOE 2009-10:     $46,696       N/A                  N/A
* Estimate

Still we wondered: Is a straight salary comparison meaningful if we don't compare other factors such as tax policies, health care plans or other criteria?

""It's just one factor in the total compensation package,"" Hurley said. ""It is meaningful, but it doesn't tell the whole story on being compensated for their work.""

Katie Betta, spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon, said in an e-mail that the ""bare numbers are not accurate in apples-to-apples comparisons. For example, GA has an income tax, FL does not. FL has class size requirements, meaning many new teachers have been hired, which is not the case in GA. To accurately compare teacher salaries, you must compare among teachers who have been teaching for the same period of time and disaggregate for taxes, health insurance, retirement benefits, etc.""

She suggested we try the Southern Regional Education Board which sent us a chart of average teacher salaries (click on the ""averages for all"" tab in the spreadsheet to see the numbers). The most recent year of the chart -- 2008-09 -- showed $46,921 for Florida and $52,879 for Georgia -- the same figures as NEA. The chart states that the sources are NEA and state education agencies. SREB also sent us a 2001 report comparing other benefits such as pensions and health care, but those figures are about a decade old.

So are teachers raking in $6,000 more a year in Georgia than Florida? We are using average teacher pay in both states because we found that the best single figure for comparison. By looking at the 2008-09 data from the states' education departments, we find that teachers in Georgia earn about $6,200 more than in Florida. If we look at the most dependable NEA data published, for 2008-09, we find a difference just shy of $6,000. Kiar said ""about $6,000,"" so we rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAAD240>],/factchecks/2010/dec/21/martin-kiar/state-rep-kiar-says-teachers-georgia-earn-6000-mor/

Bumper sticker says CEOs rake in the equivalent of a worker's yearly pay every two days
","
Most bumper stickers don’t lend themselves to fact-checking. So many are simple statements of support for candidates or opinions. After all, how can you fact-check ""I believe in whirled peas?""

But we came across one in downtown D.C. the other day that made us go, Hmm.

""CEOs now earn 431 times what their workers earn. Support unions.""

431 times? Really?

It wasn’t hard to find the source of the number at the heart of the bumper sticker’s claim. For many years the liberal Institute for Policy Studies and the non-profit group United for a Fair Economy have produced ratios of CEO pay to worker pay.

On its website, United for a Fair Economy says it ""raises awareness that concentrated wealth and power undermine the economy, corrupt democracy, deepen the racial divide and tear communities apart."" We found a chart on the site that showed CEO pay at 431 times the average worker’s pay. But the number was out of date: It was the number for 2004.

The car, a Volkswagen, looked like a more recent model than 2004, but maybe the bumper sticker was printed before the car rolled off the assembly line.

We wanted to look at fresher numbers, and we found them in a Sept. 1, 2010, annual compensation survey, now produced by the IPS alone but still using pretty much the same sources of data as earlier studies. This survey found the ratio had dropped to 263 times the average workers’ pay by 2009.

IPS took CEO data from an Associated Press online survey for the S&P 500 companies that included salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest on deferred compensation and the value of stock and option awards measure by their fair value on the day of the grant in its definition of total compensation.

Their data on worker pay came from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics ""Average Hourly Earnings of Production and Nonsupervisory Employees"" and on the average weekly hours for those same workers. According to Gary Steinberg of BLS, that category includes everyone except those whose principal work is supervisory and covers 80 to 85 percent of all workers.

Other studies also have found a considerable gap between executive and worker pay. A Financial Times story from Aug. 30, 2010, noted: ""S&P 500 chief executives last year received median pay packages of $7.5 million, according to executive compensation research firm Equilar. By comparison, official statistics show the average private sector employee was paid just over $40,000.""

Recent legislation passed by critics of high corporate compensation has guaranteed that the ratio of corporate chieftain pay to worker pay will continue to be a high-profile issue. U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd and Rep. Barney Frank's financial reform law requires all United States corporations to report CEO pay compared to the median pay for all other employees. With the rules in the works, the business community has raised concerns about the difficulty of carrying them out.

Barbara H. Franklin, chairman of the National Association of Corporate Directors, noted in the NACD’s comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission: ""The median pay figure can be highly misleading for a global company operating in regions where there is a low cost of living and hence a lower level of wages. Indeed, there is simply no way to calculate this with any utility or accuracy. It would take global companies months and thousands of hours to come up with a completely useless number. We would urge the SEC to implement this provision with extreme care.""

Do these types of comparisons make any difference? We turned to Graef Crystal, an expert in executive compensation and a frequent critic of CEO pay, for his views. ""These numbers get thrown around a lot by people to prove whatever,"" he said. Some CEOs might be surprised by the numbers, he said, but generally what matters most to executives and those who set their pay is how they compare to their peers, he said. ""They don’t look down, and they don’t look across at China.""

In fact, he said, as proxy statements disclose details about pay that may now be opaque, it could ratchet up pay.

He also noted that there is a ""significant correlation between sales volume and the pay of CEOs."" Crystal has his own database of companies, which produced an average pay rate of $10.1 million in 2009, he said. But if you sort it by sales volume, the top 100 companies average $14.4 million, Expand it to the top 200, and the average drops to $11.7 million.

The S&P 500 is only part of a much larger universe of publicly traded firms. It is made up of 500 firms which have market capitalization (number of shares multiplied by stock price) of $10 million or more. In contrast there are nearly 6,000 publicly traded firms on the nation’s two largest stock exchanges. So comparing the compensation of CEOs at only the select companies in the S&P 500 to the pay for all nonsupervisory production workers is not an apples-to-apples comparison.

Turning back to the bumper sticker, is it true that corporate executives earn 431 times as much as the average worker? Not any more, since the most recent study in the same series found the figure in 2009 was 263 times the average worker pay. But, having gone through the pain of removing outdated bumper stickers ourselves, we’ll allow a little leeway for the figure’s lack of currency. And, leaving aside the question of whether it is warranted or not, there is still a sizable gap between corporate executive pay and worker pay, although probably not as large as the gap between S&P 500 CEOs and the average of all nonsupervisory production workers, some of whom work at much smaller companies. So we’re rating the bumper sticker Half True. 
CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story said the bumper sticker was on a Volkswagen VR6, suggesting that was a VW model. It is an engine model on the car, so the reference to the VR6 has been deleted for clarity.

"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Charlie Sykes']","
Charlie Sykes says the University of Wisconsin will spend most of its Rose Bowl money on a junket for politically connected officials
","
Taking hard shots at the world of academia is nothing new for conservative Charlie Sykes, who wrote a scathing book about university professors back in the 1980s.

Sykes, the longtime WTMJ-AM (620) talk radio host, was at it again recently when he riffed on the University of Wisconsin Badgers and the team’s upcoming trip to the Rose Bowl, the team’s first to the Pasadena, Calif., event since 2000.

His target: UW’s plan to pay trip costs for outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle, UW Chancellor Carolyn ""Biddy"" Martin, members of the UW Board of Regents and other university officials as part of the official Rose Bowl traveling party.

""Jim Doyle is getting one last junket out of it,"" Sykes said on the air Dec. 15, 2010.

Sykes mocked UW’s $2.2 million Rose Bowl budget, suggesting it was inappropriate when deficits loom over the state budget. He read aloud from a Journal Sentinel story on the trip costs, reciting that the $2.2 million would cover expenses for players, coaches and the UW band -- plus an estimated 43 people in the ""official"" traveling group including Doyle.

He then noted that UW expected to get a $2.7 million payout from bowl games, including the Bowl Championship Series, of which the Rose Bowl is a part.

Sykes then made a leap worthy of Badgers wide receiver Nick Toon:

""So basically,"" he said, ""they are using almost all the payout for a junket for the politically well connected types.""

Sykes then moved on to another topic.

But this one is interesting in its own right.  And PolitiFact doesn’t just look at politicians or elected officials. It will take on anyone who speaks up in the civic discourse, even if their radio station is owned by the same company (Journal Communications Inc.) that owns the Journal Sentinel.

So, is Big Red really blowing most of its bowl take on well-connected suits?

In a word: No.

When we asked Sykes for support for his claim -- a standard first stop in the items we do -- he quickly backed off.

""The only politically connect(ed) hack I know is going is Jim Doyle (and maybe some of the regents),"" Sykes wrote in an e-mail that he also posted on his SykesWrites blog.  ""My ‘evidence’?  Absolutely none.""

Sykes went on to label his remark ""an off-hand wisecrack"" -- ""You know, humor, hyperbole, joke.""

UW Athletic Department officials weren’t amused.

They said it was way off to suggest that most of the bowl money would pay for officials and high rollers. They are still formulating the trip budget and don’t have precise figures, but it will closely mirror last year’s trip to the Champs Sports Bowl in Orlando, according to Justin Doherty, an assistant athletic director.

For that trip, some 700 people were involved, about 100 players and 275 band members, plus spirit squad members, coaches, trainers, security, support staff and family members. Various UW administrative officials also were in that group. Doyle did not go.

To be sure, that’s a huge crew for a football game -- and this year’s group will likely swell because the Rose Bowl requires a bigger band.

So let’s say it’s 750 for Pasadena, of whom 43 are officials from the regents, the UW Athletic Board, the chancellor’s office and elsewhere.

That means the ""official"" traveling party is about 6 percent of the total group, which would translate into about $132,000 of the Rose Bowl budget of $2.2 million.

It’s a rough calculation, but by anybody’s math that’s not close to burning up the Badgers’ $2.2 million Rose Bowl budget, much less the larger bowl-game payout from the Big Ten.

And that amount may even far more than those Sykes cited. He narrowed his attack to ""political types"" on the Doyle-appointed Board of Regents (12 are signed up to go) and the governor himself.

Plus the suits will not be in Pasadena as long (four nights) as the jocks (eight or nine nights).

Sykes’s remarks also suggested taxpayers would suffer because of the ""junket."" But the Rose Bowl funds flow from revenue generated by bowl games that feature teams from the Big Ten conference -- not tax dollars.

Here are the X’s and O’s on the money flow:

Eight Big Ten teams made it to the postseason this year. That’s expected to generate $44.5 million for the conference, according to Scott Chipman, the conference’s assistant commissioner of communication. The Rose Bowl alone brings $21.2 million.

From that $44.5 million pot, the Big Ten will pay the bowl schools -- collectively -- $14 million in traveling expenses. (Bucky gets $2.25 million for Rose Bowl expenses, a figure that’s set by the Big Ten).

Split the remaining $30.5 million among all 11 conference teams and that means each team gets about $2.77 million over and above their expenses. That means that between the $2.77 million and the expenses of $2.25 million for the Rose Bowl, there is $5 million coming in from bowl-related payments.

So the Badgers could clear $2.77 million from the bowl season, unless they blow their budget. That has happened before -- at UW’s 1999 Rose Bowl appearance, when the athletic department shelled out $200,000 due to cost overruns. Then-Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, UW officials and alumni were part of the entourage that year.

Normally we sum up before turning loose the Truth-O-Meter, but it hardly seems necessary in this case.

Sykes told his listeners and followers of his blog Friday that he thought the Journal Sentinel would have bigger fish to fry than a ""tidbit"" on the Rose Bowl. But he didn’t fight the facts, or lack thereof.

""Politifact busts me (sort of)"" Sykes posted on Twitter.

And he cheerfully e-mailed us to have at it: ""All I want for Christmas is a ""Pants on Fire!"" in my stocking!""

Your Christmas wish is granted, Charlie. The Truth-O-Meter is glowing Badger red.

Gingrich: Obama got a 'pass' on Rev. Wright controversy
","News that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., allegedly gave a speech to a white supremacist group a dozen years ago is pulling attention away from the game plan Republicans had in mind as they take charge of Congress. While Scalise says he didn’t know the group’s ideology when he spoke about tax policy in 2002, some are calling on him to step down from his leadership post or resign altogether. Newt Gingrich, on the other hand, said the entire matter has been blown out of proportion. Speaking on CBS' Face the Nation Jan. 4, 2015, Gingrich compared Scalise's situation to what happened in 2008 when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama was confronted with his association with Rev. Jeremiah Wright.  ""The fact is, you have a president who for years went to a church whose pastor said stunningly hateful things about Americans,"" Gingrich said. ""The president explains he didn't hear any of them. Okay? And we all gave him a pass. He gave a great speech in Philadelphia as a candidate. We said, okay, we got it."" Gingrich went on to paint a picture of a ""one-sided view of reality"" where the left and its supporters ignore mistakes made by its allies but pounce on conservatives for similar trangressions. As for Scalise, Gingrich said, ""To the best of our knowledge, (he) gave a speech on taxes 12 years ago. Now, for a 12-year-old speech to be blown up into a national story, I think, is frankly one more example of a one-sided view of reality."" We wondered about Gingrich's description that Obama got ""a pass"" in the context that Scalise's problems have ""blown up into a national story."" We reached out to Gingrich through his production company to learn more and didn’t hear back. A Wright recap Obama credited Wright with introducing him to his Christian faith. Wright officiated Obama’s wedding to Michelle and baptized both of their children. The couple attended Trinity United Church of Christ where Wright preached. On March 8, 2008, ABC News aired a report that included excerpts of Wright’s sermons against racism. In the most controversial video, which was played on network and cable news, Wright exhorted blacks to reject the government that had treated them so badly. The government ""wants us to sing ‘God Bless America.’ No, no, no, not ‘God Bless America.’ God damn America — that's in the Bible — for killing innocent people,"" Wright said. ""God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America, as long as she tries to act like she is God, and she is supreme. The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent."" Following the news reports, Obama called Wright’s views ""completely unacceptable and inexcusable."" Wright resigned from a committee of African-American clergy who supported Obama. The candidate continued to distance himself from Wright, but the story grew and on March 18, Obama delivered an extended speech on race in America at Independence Hall in Philadelphia (the speech referenced by Gingrich in his comments). The level of news coverage We used the Nexis news database to search for newspaper articles that mentioned Wright. In the week before the ABC News broadcast, Wright’s name appeared 15 times, most of them focused on whether his political work endangered his church’s tax status, or on his ties to Louis Farrakhan, the head of the Nation of Islam. After the ABC News story, the number skyrocketed, more than doubling every two days. By the time Obama spoke in Philadelphia, there had been over 250 stories and editorials in U.S. publications. On top of that, the topic was on every network and cable news channel. By the end of that month, the number of articles topped 2,000. This chart, which measures two-day periods in March 2008, shows how the story grew. Voter awareness According to polling by the Pew Research Center, Obama’s relationship with Wright dominated the news. Less than a week after the ABC News broadcast, Pew found that two-thirds of Americans said that they had heard at least a little about Wright’s inflammatory comments. In a follow-up survey after Obama’s speech on race, about half of the public said they had seen video of Wright’s sermons, and about half said they had watched Obama’s speech itself. It was far and away the most visible event of all the campaign coverage, with 85 percent of the public saying they had heard at least a little about it. Pew’s Project on Excellence in Journalism wrote at the time, ""The high-risk Philadelphia speech came after several days of what one network correspondent described as Obama ‘damage control’ to try and counter political fallout from the Wright sermons."" While the speech earned Obama much praise, the headlines a few days later show that it was hardly universally well received. The Buffalo News had ""Wright's hate speech spurs serious questions."" In Florida, the Naples Daily News wrote, ""Obama's disavowal of minister's anti-America rant unbelievable."" The Charleston Daily Mail said, ""Obama's denials just don't ring true."" Our ruling Gingrich claimed Obama got a pass on his association with the controversial Wright, while saying a 12-year-old speech by Scalise has blown up into a national story. You can argue that the Wright controversy didn't sway the majority of people's opinions about Obama -- he won election in 2008 and 2012 -- but it's wrong to claim the Wright story wasn't covered the way Scalise's troubles have made national news. In the days after ABC News first reported the Wright-Obama connection in 2008, the story littered print and TV media. Meanwhile, a poll found that 85 percent of Americans had at least some knowledge of the matter.

Jeb Bush opposes gay marriage and gays adopting, DNC says
","When former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he was exploring a bid to run for president, the Democrats let loose their opposition research. The Democratic National Committee released talking points it wanted Democrats to use against Bush; Politico published a leaked copy on Dec. 19. Bush then posted the talking points on his own Facebook page, denouncing the attacks as ""silly"" and ""misleading."" The DNC attacked Bush’s statements and positions on a long list of topics, saying that another Bush presidency would mean policies ""that wreck the economy, that give massive breaks to the wealthy and corporations, and that are out of step with American people including women, LGBT Americans, Latinos and people of color. The reality is that Jeb Bush is no different than almost all Republicans on issue after issue."" Among the talking points was this one: ""Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children."" The timing of that particular attack caught our eye, because in recent months plaintiffs have filed lawsuits to overturn Florida’s gay marriage ban, which voters approved in 2008. Federal Judge Robert Hinkle ruled in August that the ban is unconstitutional, but he stayed his order to allow for appeals. After the U.S. Supreme Court rejected requests to extend the stay, Hinkle told county clerks they will be violating the U.S. Constitution if they don’t issue same sex marriage licenses on Jan. 6. A Miami-Dade judge allowed gay marriages to proceed in that county Jan. 5. Here, we’ll look at whether the DNC was accurate in saying that Bush opposes same-sex marriage and believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children. Same-sex marriage While in office from 1999 to 2007, Bush consistently opposed gay marriage, though he was not a leading crusader against it. In 2004, Bush’s brother President George W. Bush proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban gay marriages. At the time, Florida law did not allow for same-sex marriage, though there was no specific ban on it in the state Constitution. In 2004, 11 states approved their own gay marriage bans. A spokeswoman for the DNC pointed to an article in the Tallahassee Democrat that stated: ""Bush supports his brother, President George W. Bush, in seeking a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman."" Over the next few years, religious conservatives in Florida worked to get a question on the ballot banning gay marriage in the state constitution, and they succeeded in 2008. Bush faced questions about it while in office. At times, he showed some support with caveats for a state constitutional ban, but he also often said that he was reluctant to change the Constitution. ""If there was a threat that gay marriage would be accepted in our state, then I might be supportive of it,"" Bush said in November 2004, according to the Orlando Sentinel. ""I'm not sure it's necessary to do this in a pre-emptive fashion."" It’s worth noting that when Bush was in office, he had plenty of company among both Republicans and Democrats in opposing gay marriage. It wasn’t until May 2012 that President Barack Obama made a Full Flop in favor of gay marriage. And it wasn’t until March 2013 that Hillary Clinton announced she now supported gay marriage. That same month Bill Clinton denounced the Defense of Marriage Act that he had signed in 1996. Gay adoption In 2001, a federal judge upheld Florida’s ban on gay adults adopting. The state argued that married heterosexuals provided a more stable home (even though the state allowed single people to adopt). Bush supported that ruling. As Bush faced re-election in 2002, the ban remained a hot topic as a challenge winded its way through federal appeals court. Bush said he was reluctant to take a stand since the issue was in court. ""I think it's an issue that is marginal to the bigger issue, which is, how do we get children in loving homes?"" Bush said. Bush’s position on gays adopting came up during an October 2002 debate when he faced re-election against Democratic rival Bill McBride. ""If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is a man and a wife. That is the law of this land, it's in the courts, but I also believe that personally,"" Bush said. A poll done for the Orlando Sentinel during that race showed that a majority of Floridians at the time opposed gays adopting and same-sex marriages. In January 2004, a federal appeals court upheld the ban. ""The decision validates Florida's conclusion that it is in the best interest of adopted children, many of whom come from troubled and unstable backgrounds, to be placed in a home anchored both by a father and a mother,"" Bush said in a news release. In 2010, a state appeals court struck down the ban. Bush’s comments since he left office Bush has made a few statements since he left office defending ""traditional marriage"" but has said little about gays adopting. In an interview with CBS’ Charlie Rose in 2012, he seemed to express some tolerance for gay parents and used softer language to talk about gay couples. ""I think traditional marriage is what should be sanctioned and not at the expense of discriminating in other forms of family structure."" Bush said. ""So I don’t support it, but I would say that wholesome loving family life ought to be kind of the organizing principle in a free society. If we don’t want to have government overwhelm us, then we have to be self-governing. ... And if people love their children with all their heart and soul, and that’s what they do, and that’s how they organized their life, that should be held up as examples for others to follow, because we need it. We desperately need it, and that can take all sorts of forms. It doesn’t have to take the one that I think should be sanctioned under the law."" In a statement to reporters at an event at Mississippi College in March 2013, he said the U.S. Supreme Court should not decide the issue: ""I am a supporter of traditional marriage. I do think that these decisions should be made at the state level, so I hope the constitutional amendment in California is not overturned."" (He made his comments a few months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act and dismissed a case on Proposition 8, California’s law that banned gay marriage.) Bush told the Miami Herald on Jan. 4 in a brief interview, ""It ought to be a local decision. I mean, a state decision. The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it’s been overturned by the courts, I guess."" We asked a spokeswoman for Bush about his stance on gay adults adopting and marrying. Initially, we did not get a reply. But soon after we published this report, a spokesperson sent us two comments from Bush. On gay couples adopting: ""Previously, I opposed gay adoption, but it has since become the law in our state, and I respect that decision."" On same-sex marriage: ""We live in a democracy, and regardless of our disagreements, we have to respect the rule of law. I hope that we can also show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue – including couples making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections and those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament and want to safeguard religious liberty."" Our ruling The DNC said that ""Bush not only opposes marriage equality, he’s said he ‘personally’ believes gay couples should be banned from adopting children."" As Bush continues to explore running for president, he may provide more specific comments about his current views, but for now we are rating the DNC’s statement based on the evidence that was available at the time they made the statement. While in office, Bush repeatedly said that he opposed gay marriage, although he was reluctant at times to amend the state Constitution since it was already banned in state law. He also opposed gay adults adopting children. Since leaving office, Bush said that he supports ""traditional marriage,"" though he has used a softer tone when asked about it, and did so again when we asked about it. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate this statement Mostly True. Update: Several hours after this item was first published, we received a reponse from Bush's staff, and this report has been updated to include his comments. The ruling remains the same. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EA9FA300>],/factchecks/2015/jan/06/democratic-national-committee/jeb-bush-opposes-gay-marriage-and-gays-adopting-dn/

What will happen to taxes on Jan. 1, 2015? Chain email gets tax rates all wrong
","The start of a new year traditionally offers the possibility of rebirth. Apparently, that goes for chain emails, too. It was last May when we first encountered a chain email that purported to list a wide variety of taxes that went up on Jan. 1, 2014. The email was littered with errors, so we rated it Pants on Fire. Now, readers are flooding the PolitiFact inbox asking whether a new version of the email -- keyed to a new date, Jan. 1, 2015 -- is accurate. It isn’t, and we’ll explain why. Here’s the text of the email that’s currently circulating: Reminder for those who forgot or for many that didn't know  Here is what will happen on January 1, 2015 : Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%    Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%    Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%    Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%    Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%    Estate tax went from 0% to 55%    Remember this fact:    These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes.    These taxes were all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.  If you think that it is important that everyone in the U.S. should know this, pass it  on. If not, then delete it. We’ll take these claims in order: ""Here is what will happen on January 1, 2015"" To the extent that these tax rates were changed -- and as we’ll see most of them didn’t change in the way the email says -- the changes didn’t take effect on Jan. 1, 2015 (or, for that matter, on Jan. 1, 2014). They took effect on Jan. 1, 2013. That may seem like a minor difference, but in this case, it makes all the difference. The tax rates that changed on Jan. 1, 2013, were all passed as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. That was a bipartisan deal -- we’ll discuss just how bipartisan in a bit -- that passed after the 2012 presidential election to avoid the ""fiscal cliff."" The ""cliff"" refers to the expiration of tax cuts originally passed under President George W. Bush. The law made permanent many but not all of the Bush-era tax cuts that were set to expire anyway. So some people did see their tax rates go up, primarily upper-income taxpayers. That’s what the email is attempting to spotlight, but it does so in a way that introduces a host of inaccuracies. ""Top Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35%"" This tax hike, unlike the others, did indeed stem from the Affordable Care Act, and the tax rates listed in the email are accurate. (Oddly, this line wasn’t included in the previous version of the email.) However, this hike, like the others, took effect on Jan. 1, 2013, not on New Year’s Day 2015. It’s also worth noting that most Americans won’t be affected -- it hits individuals earning $200,000 annually or married couples earning $250,000. ""Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%"" The timing is wrong, but the numbers are correct. For 2015, the 39.6 percent rate is for individuals earning over $413,200 in taxable income or married couples earning at least $464,850. ""Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%"" Usually, people think about income taxes and payroll taxes separately. But it’s not uncommon for tax experts to look at the combination of income and payroll taxes together, because they give a sense of the overall burden of direct taxation on individuals. That’s what the email did here. On Jan. 1, 2013, the top combined rate for the income and payroll tax went from 37.9 percent to 42.5 percent, or 43.4 percent due to the additional Medicare tax in the health care law. So if you just look at the federal rates, the email overstates the current top rate. If you take state taxes into account, the email is closer, but still inaccurate. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, calculated 2013 combined tax rates for each state. The group found that the top marginal tax rate, averaged across all states, is 47.9 percent. Of course, any state taxes would have been imposed by state governments, and thus were not part of the Affordable Care Act. And this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison; to make the comparison fair, the initial tax rate would need to be adjusted upward for state and local taxes as well. ""Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%"" On Jan. 1, 2013, the highest capital gains tax rate rose from 15 percent to 20 percent. The Affordable Care Act’s additional 3.8 percent Medicare tax for high-income earners can be added to make it 23.8 percent. Either way you calculate it, the email exaggerates the amount of the increase. (And most households still pay nothing or 15 percent for capital gains, depending on their income.) If you add in state and local capital gains taxes, the Tax Foundation says the current rate, averaged across the 50 states, is 28.7 percent, but Tax Foundation economist Kyle Pomerleau told us this is ""sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison."" ""Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%"" This line would have been correct if the Bush tax cuts had expired the way they were initially supposed to. But the December 2012 deal ended up going with a top marginal tax rate of 20 percent on dividend income instead of the pre-Bush rate of 39.6 percent on dividend income. It rose to 23.8 percent due to the high-income added Medicare tax under Obamacare. So the final rate cited in the email is far higher than the current rate. ""Estate tax went from 0% to 55%"" Both ends of this claim are wrong. The estate tax was gradually wound down by the Bush-era tax cuts, disappearing entirely, for one year, in 2010. For 2011 and 2012 it was reimposed at 35 percent, then raised to 40 percent on Jan. 1, 2013 as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" bill. Also, it’s worth noting that the estate tax is heavily targeted at the very richest Americans. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, in recent years, the top 10 percent of income earners paid virtually all of the tax, with over half of that paid by the richest 0.1 percent. Indeed, estates with a gross value under $5.25 million don’t even need to file a form with the Internal Revenue Service, and typically more than half of those who do have to file one are ultimately determined not to owe any estate tax. ""These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare."" Most of these changes were passed as part of the 2012 fiscal cliff deal, which was enacted with bipartisan support. Facing expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would have meant a massive tax increase up and down the income scale, both parties felt compelled to strike a deal that neither side was really enthusiastic about. In the Senate, the measure passed by an 89-8 margin. Forty Republicans voted for it, and just five Republicans voted against it. In the House, it passed by a 257-167 margin. While a majority of Republicans (151) voted against the bill, 85 Republicans did vote for it. So the email is flatly wrong to say that no Republicans voted for these taxes. It’s also incorrect to say that these taxes were all raised by Obamacare. The health care law did add marginally to three of the five taxes -- it was the source of the Medicare tax hike from from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent, and it added 0.9 percentage points to the top payroll tax rate and 3.8 percentage points to the the capital gains and the dividends tax. But the bulk of the increases came from the fiscal cliff deal. Less than a third of the total percentage-point increases cited by the email came from Obamacare. Our ruling The chain email said that new tax increases went into effect on Jan. 1, 2015, ""all passed under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare."" The email gets many things wrong, most notably scaring people by saying their tax rates will go up on New Year’s Day 2015. In addition, most of the rates cited are wrong in some way, and are uniformly higher than the actual rates. And the email is flat-out wrong when it blames Democrats, and Obamacare for the increases. The bulk of the tax hikes stem from a different bill entirely -- one that received support from a large majority of Senate Republicans and a significant minority of House Republicans. Despite some minor changes since the last version of the email that circulated, this one is so riddled with errors -- and gets so few things correct -- that we continue to rate it Pants on Fire.

Thune says Keystone XL pipeline has minimal impact on environment
","Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said one of the first acts of the new Senate will be to force President Barack Obama’s hand on the Keystone XL pipeline. The controversial project has been in the works since 2008 and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs. Opponents say the pipeline will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Speaking about the pipeline on Fox News Sunday, Thune said, ""We think the president ought to sign that into the law. His administration has done five environmental impact statements, all of which have said it would have a minimal impact on the environment, and his own State Department said it would support 42,000 jobs."" We’ve looked at the jobs claim several times (the number of permanent jobs is about 50) and in this fact-check, we’re focusing on Thune’s comments about the environmental impact statements. Thune’s office sent us a list of five studies. All were conducted by the U.S. State Department, which has jurisdiction because the project crosses the border between Canada and the United States. Whether you see them as five separate studies depends on how you look at the environmental impact statement process. Before an agency issues a Final Environmental Impact Statement, it first releases a draft version. Citizens, businesses and interest groups then submit comments that may or may not shape the final report. The State Department ultimately produced two final reports on the Keystone XL pipeline. The first one from August 2011 was preceded by two drafts. The department wrote a second report, partly because it couldn’t meet a legislative deadline to grant final approval, but more fundamentally, because the pipeline project changed. It became shorter and took a different route to avoid a particularly environmentally sensitive area. That second report, released in January 2013, also initially appeared in draft form. So we have two final environmental impact statements, and three other draft reports. Thune’s office sees that as five studies. Others take a more nuanced view. James Coleman, a law and business professor at Calgary University told PolitiFact that while there were five documents, ""they're all really draft and finalized versions of the same analysis."" A divided administration So that’s the reasoning for or against five statements. Now, what do they say? Thune contended that Obama’s administration found that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. That is a fair paraphrase of the State Department’s findings. On the key issue of greenhouse gas emissions, the State Department’s final word was that the project was ""unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands"" in Canada. In short, one way or the other, companies in Canada would continue to extract oil  -- meaning the rate of pollution was unlikely to grow simply due to the pipeline alone. But the administration has not spoken with a single voice. The Environmental Protection Agency tagged the State Department’s draft from April 2013 with the label ""Environmental objections -- insufficient information."" The EPA said, among other things, that the pipeline might have a bigger impact on greenhouse gas emissions than the State Department concluded. The focus here was on how fast oil would come out of the Canadian fields. Pulling oil from the tar sands is costly and even more so when you tack transportation costs on top. The EPA felt that the State Department had not looked carefully enough at the impact of the pipeline if oil prices fell. When oil prices fall, the lower shipping costs that come with the pipeline matter a whole lot more to keeping the enterprise viable. The State Department found that with high oil prices, the tar sands would be mined for oil, pipeline or no. Coleman told PolitiFact that finding is now in question. ""The State Department’s analysis was predicated on its assumption that West Texas Intermediate would not fall under $75 per barrel and it is now under $55. At that level, State said things could change,"" Coleman said. The State Department concluded that with prices between $65 and $75 per barrel ""higher transportation costs could have a substantial impact on oil sands production levels, possibly in excess of the capacity of the proposed Project."" But with the pipeline, transportation costs drop and production would be higher. That would affect greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA also raised objections to the State Department’s examination of potential oil spills. Our ruling Thune said that the administration had done five studies that all found that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. The State Department produced five documents, but in reality, all were versions of the same analysis. The State Department did conclude that the pipeline by itself would have no significant impact on the extraction of oil from Canada. However, that was the finding of one government department. The Environmental Protection Agency raised questions, based on the price of oil. The State Department’s final analysis also included the caveat that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on tar sands extraction only if oil prices remained above $75 per barrel. Since then, oil prices have fallen well below that point. Thune’s claim overstates the number of separate studies the administration has done, glosses over the differences of opinion within the administration, and fails to account for the caveat included in the State Department’s analysis. We rate the claim Half True.

Klobuchar says U.S. is world's No. 1 oil producer
","Considering the United States’ strength in energy production, the debate over building the Keystone XL pipeline has become a symbolic one, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. On NBC’s Meet the Press on Jan. 4, 2015, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said the new Republican Congress’ first priority in 2015 will be to pass a bill approving construction of the oil pipeline, which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to the coast of Texas. Klobuchar responded by saying the project ""has merit"" but that the decision to build the pipeline should rest with President Barack Obama, not Congress. She said the debate has become a ""symbolic"" one that ignores America’s healthy energy market. ""We're now the no. 1 producer of oil in the world,"" she said. ""We've surpassed Saudi Arabia."" We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil producer. As it turns out, the United States passed over Saudi Arabia about two years ago. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, the United States has produced more oil than Saudi Arabia since the fourth quarter of 2012. American oil production surpassed Russia in 2011. Here’s a chart showing the trend from the Energy Information Administration:  In the third quarter of 2014 -- the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels of oil per day; Saudi Arabia produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production. This production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices. Total oil production figures include crude oil, natural gas liquids and other liquid energy products. On top of oil, the United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum. The majority of the United States’ oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D., Eagle Ford, Texas, the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest, and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all United States crude oil production. In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production. There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared to Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market. ""In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.,"" Maugeri said. Our ruling Klobuchar said the United States is ""now the No. 1 producer of oil in the world."" The latest global oil production statistics back up Klobuchar’s claim. The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since late 2012. We rate her statement True.

Warner on sexual assault: It's safer for women not to be in college
","U.S Sen. Mark Warner says women in college have a greater risk of being sexually assaulted than those who don’t go. Warner made that statement in a television interview while weighing in on a Rolling Stone article that detailed allegations of a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity. The magazine has since backed away from the story. ""Statistics show that one out of every five women are victims of sexual assault when they’re on college campuses,"" Warner said on Fusion. ""It’s actually safer not to be in college than it is to be in college."" PolitiFact Virginia examined the one-in-five statistic recently while looking at a statement made by State Sen. Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax. We found debate among analysts over that figure. What piqued our interest this time is Warner’s claim that women college students are at a greater risk of being sexually assaulted than their non-college peers, a statement he’s made several times. Warner’s proof Warner spokesman, Kevin Hall, said the senator’s comment was based on a pair of Department of Justice reports as well as a statement from the American Association of University Professors about sexual assault. ""Schools are not the safe havens they once appeared to be; college women are at higher risk for sexual assault than their non-college-bound peers,"" said a 2005 report on campus sexual assault by the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice. NIJ based its conclusion on an early 1997 survey when it asked 4,446 female college students in the U.S. whether they’d been sexually victimized since the start of that school year. Almost 16 percent of the women said they had experienced ""victimization,"" a term that was defined as anything from unwanted touching to forcible rape. But the researchers never surveyed women who were not students. To support their finding that college women are at greater risk of experiencing a sexual crime, they cited academic studies in the late 1980s and 1990s that examined sexual assault on campuses in the U.S. and Canada. One of the studies, published in the journal Criminology, surveyed 3,472 women students at 12 U.S. colleges about sexual victimization during the 1993-1994 academic year. They found that the rate of rape and sexual assault among students on campus was about three times higher than that of all women age 20-24. The researchers -- professors at three universities -- said their results ""were suggestive"" of a higher rate of sexual assault among college females. But the researchers cautioned that firm conclusions couldn’t be drawn without a systematic study of sexual assault among college students as well and their non-student peers. They, too, did not survey non-students, instead relying on information from the National Crime Victimization Survey. This produced uneven comparisons. And the age range of the women students interviewed by the professors didn’t exactly match the available national data for women ages 20 to 24. What Warner overlooks   Warner’s office didn’t mention two studies by another branch of the Justice Department -- the Bureau of Justice Statistics -- that contradictorily concluded college women are safer than their non-college peers. These reports are somewhat more current than the research Warner cited and surveyed identically-aged women, from 18 through 24, attending college and not. The bureau, in a 2003 study, found that from 1995 to 2000 the rape and sexual assault rate among female college students was 6.2 per 1,000 women. The rape and sexual assault rate among female non-students was 7.9 per 1,000. In a follow-up study in 2005, the bureau found that from 1995-2002, the rate of rape and sexual assault was 6.0 per 1,000 women students compared to 7.9 per 1,000 for female non-students. We should point out that on Dec. 11, 2014 -- about a week after Warner made his statement --  the Bureau of Justice Statistics released its first report since 2005 examining sexual assault among women in college and their non-student peers. That report found that from 1995 to 2013, the rate of rape and sexual assault for students was 6.1 per 1,000 compared to 7.6 per 1,000 for non-students. We won’t hold Warner accountable for information released a week after he made his statement. But the previous bureau reports from 2003 and 2005, that contradicted Warner’s claim, were available when he made his statement. You may note that the incidences of campus rape and sexual assault in the bureau studies are lower than those found in other research we’ve mentioned. The bureau says that’s because it conducts a crime survey and its definitions of an offense are narrower than those used in other surveys. The bureau says participants in its survey may not report incidents they don’t think rise to the level of crimes. A statistician at the bureau said the tighter definitions do not diminish its findings. ""It’s the only national survey where you can look at the comparison between the students and non-students in terms of violent victimization and sexual assault victimization,""  said Lynn Langdon, co-author of the recent report. Why would non-college students have higher rates of sexual assault than colleges students? ""A likely culprit is disadvantage,"" emailed Callie Rennison, a former statistician at the bureau who is co-director of the Criminology and Justice Research Initiative at the University of Colorado’s School of Public Affairs. ""In general, individuals who have more income, greater education, live in better-off communities (among other things) tend to be characterized by lower rates of violence,"" she wrote. ""I believe this translates to university attendance. That is, those who come from more advantage are also more likely to attend university."" A final note: Warner, who has three college-aged daughters, voiced concern about sexual assaults on campuses prior to the publication of the Rolling Stone’s article in November. The senator announced in July that he was cosponsoring a bill that seeks to crack down on campus sexual assault. The measure would require colleges to designate confidential advisors to help victims report crimes. It would mandate an annual anonymous survey in which students at every university would be asked about the prevalence of sexual assaults at their campuses. Our ruling Warner says women students on college campuses are more likely to be sexually assaulted than their peers who don’t seek a higher education. He backs his statement by citing Department of Justice studies that make that same observation based on research from the 1980s and 90s. The researchers acknowledged shortcomings with their methodology and said their conclusions were ""suggestive."" Warner’s statement ignores a credible and more current body of research that offered an opposite conclusion to his. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE14480>],/factchecks/2015/jan/04/mark-warner/warner-sexual-assualt-its-safer-women-not-be-colle/

Former R.I. Atty. Gen. Patrick Lynch says power lines have been linked to leukemia, other diseases
","sFormer Rhode Island Attorney General Patrick Lynch wants the power lines stretching along the waterfront from East Providence to Providence to be relocated underground, a plan that has been shelved because the projected costs have skyrocketed from $19 million in 2007 to at least $34 million now. In a Nov. 24 commentary in The Providence Journal, Lynch said there were several reasons for burying the lines and predicted that it would boost economic development and encourage tourism. But he also said burial would, ""improve public health and safety by eliminating exposure of nearby residential development projects to electro-magnetic fields, which has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases."" We were interested in whether there are any links between exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and disease, particularly childhood leukemia? We contacted Lynch's office to ask for his evidence. Meanwhile, we started looking for some ourselves. But first, a point of information. Electromagnetic fields are everywhere. Turn on a toaster and you'll be exposed to EMFs. And burying the lines will only partially shield residents from this particular source. ""The fields are always there. If you send current over a wire it generates electromagnetic fields,"" said Tao Wei, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Rhode Island. Burying power lines might reduce the field somewhat but ""there's no way to eliminate it all."" Whether such fields cause disease, particularly childhood leukemia -- is more complicated. In our emails and in cell phone conversations with Lynch, he repeatedly argued that he never claimed that there was a link between EMFs and childhood leukemia (or other diseases). He only said that the two are ""associated."" What's the difference? Just because two things are ""associated"" -- occurring at the same time -- doesn't mean that one thing causes another. For example, wearing lipstick is associated with breast cancer because women wear lipstick and have much higher rates of breast cancer than men, who don’t. But lipstick doesn't cause breast cancer. Lynch didn't make that distinction between association and causation. So we believe the average reader would come away thinking that he was suggesting that EMFs cause disease. Otherwise, why raise the issue? Thus, we will judge his statement on that basis. It turns out that even the reported association between power lines and health problems is debatable, according to the reports we examined. While some studies have suggested that leukemia might lurk as a risk, other evidence argues against such a link, which is why a few groups have made statements hedging their bets, keeping the door open just in case new evidence comes along. And when it comes to the ""other diseases"" that Lynch refers to, the consensus is that there is no convincing evidence that EMFs pose such a danger. Some history Many people came to believe such fields are hazardous thanks to a 1979 study in Denver, which never actually measured electromagnetic fields, and a three-part series in The New Yorker by journalist Paul Brodeur that sparked a wave of fear about electric blankets, video display terminals and power lines. That prompted decades of research that has failed to prove anything conclusive. There has been reason to doubt the risk for a long time. One of the larger studies was done by the National Cancer Institute and published in 1997 in the New England Journal of Medicine. It found no evidence of a higher risk of leukemia among the children who had received the highest exposure of EMF. Researchers tend to focus on leukemia because it is a type of cancer that is particularly sensitive to radiation. Dr. Edward Campion, a Journal editor, noted that, ""In recent years, several commissions and expert panels have concluded that there is no convincing evidence that high-voltage power lines are a health hazard or a cause of cancer. And the weight of the better epidemiologic studies . . . now supports the same conclusion."" Ultimately, the reaction to the concerns developed into a strategy known as ""prudent avoidance,"" where efforts are made to avoid strong electromagnetic fields just in case they might pose a health hazard. With our use of electronic devices mushrooming, one might have expected a sharp increase in health problems if the fields were dangerous. That hasn't been seen. (Meanwhile, fears have shifted to the higher-frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless Internet and cell phones and, once again, despite all the studies, there's been no definitive evidence of danger.) Newer research The closest any health authority has come to saying the fields are dangerous came in 2002 when the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer characterized them as ""possibly"" causing cancer. But the agency said the evidence that extremely low frequency magnetic fields of the power line variety cause childhood leukemia was limited, and evidence linking the fields to any other type of cancer was inadequate. The group declined to classify EMFs as a ""probable"" carcinogen. In the intervening years, the link -- if there is one -- has remained tenuous. A large 2005 study uncovered a slightly higher risk of leukemia for children living near overhead power lines, but the researchers said the findings appeared to be a fluke because the risk was seen in places where the magnetic field produced by the power line was lower than background levels. One theory is that the risk is linked to a family's income and poorer people tend to live near large power lines. A Danish study published in 2014 came up with similar conclusions. It logged leukemia cases, but none within 200 meters -- about 656 feet -- from power lines. If the power lines were causing cancer, you would expect the cases to be closest to the lines. In 2013, a study of 2,779 cases of childhood leukemia diagnosed in France from 2002 to 2007 found that a child had to live within 55 yards of power lines to have a risk, but only if those lines were classified as very high voltage power lines. Beyond 55 yards posed no risk. Neither did living near other types of power lines.     A study published in 2014 also failed to show a consistent link to childhood leukemia. In places where researchers think they have seen cancer, it may be due to chance. In some instances, the risk was seen in areas adjacent to power lines where EMF levels were no higher than what you would get from Earth's magnetic field. Animal studies have shown no consistent risk, which is another reason scientists are skeptical of a link. Lynch's evidence Lynch, who has been interested in the EMF issue for years, sent us several documents, some from more than a decade ago, including a National Grid brochure and a New York Times story from July in which one expert, who has long been concerned about EMFs and wants to keep WiFi out of schools because he fears it might be risky, thinks the evidence supporting a hazard has only grown stronger. And he pointed us to a September 2012 report by Michael Kundi, who heads the Institute of Environmental Health at the Medical University of Vienna, in Austria, and argues that, based on the research, power lines pose a much greater risk of leukemia than previously assumed and the evidence is so strong that it doesn't matter that animal studies have shown no problem. He is part of a group of researchers who believe cellphones, wireless laptops, WiFi transmitters, cell towers, power lines and electronic baby monitors probably pose a long list of health hazards that include various cancers, sperm damage, autism and Alzheimer's disease. They also want WiFi removed from schools. That would support Lynch's contention that ""other diseases"" might be involved. Broader consensus Yet what do major science and medical organizations say? The American Cancer Society lists ""Exposure to electromagnetic fields (such as living near power lines)"" as an ""uncertain, unproven, or controversial"" risk factor for childhood leukemia. Studies of electric fields have not shown any risk. The only hint of a leukemia problem has been for magnetic fields and only in children exposed to the highest fields. The National Cancer Institute's website concludes, ""there is little evidence that exposure to ELF-EMF from power lines causes leukemia, brain tumors, or any other cancers in children.""  Among adults, the evidence continues to show no danger, or has produced inconsistent results. Cancer Research UK, a United Kingdom group similar to the Cancer Society, reports that even if a link were confirmed, ""the impact would be small -- only around one percent of childhood leukemias."" And WHO, which cautiously classified the fields as ""possibly"" carcinogenic a dozen years ago, currently says ""the evidence for any effect remains highly controversial. However, it is clear that if electromagnetic fields do have an effect on cancer, then any increase in risk will be extremely small. The results to date contain many inconsistencies, but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults."" Lynch also referred us to a very recent analysis from the nonprofit Institution of Engineering and Technology. He focused on the wording suggesting that there might be a leukemia risk above a certain exposure level. But we noted that the report concludes that despite decades of research, ""the existence of harmful health effects"" from such power lines ""remains unsubstantiated."" Lynch said that the institution's analysis was a case where you ""hide the conclusion in the middle and turn back 'unswervingly' to [power] industry messaging at the end.""   Our ruling Lynch said exposure to the electromagnetic fields from power lines ""has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases."" Lynch, when questioned, says he's saying there is just an association, and he's not asserting that EMFs cause cancer and other diseases. We believe the average reader would come away believing that Lynch was saying there is a direct link and a real danger, which would be a striking assertion. When it comes to health effects, the grain of truth in Lynch's statement is that there have been some studies suggesting a link. But he's ignoring the fact that other studies and experts have concluded that there is little or no effect, and major health organizations have not found the evidence to be convincing despite decades of efforts to demonstrate a danger. Because his claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Stephen Hayes: Iran cheated on the interim nuclear deal
","As the pundits look ahead to 2015, they know that time is running out for the United States to reach a permanent deal with Iran over its nuclear program. The five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States — along with Germany, have until mid March to come to terms on a deal with the Islamic republic. If all goes the way the United States hopes, a signed agreement will keep Iran out of the nuclear weapons club. For now, the two sides are operating under an interim agreement, which rolls back Iran’s stock of enriched uranium and freezes the country’s capability to produce nuclear materials that could be used to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can sell its oil more freely and gain access to millions of dollars in frozen assets. On Fox News Sunday Dec. 28, 2014, Stephen Hayes of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine spoke skeptically about what lies ahead. Hayes believes a final deal is likely, but he doubts the Obama administration will drive a hard bargain. ""They want the deal for the sake of having the deal,"" Hayes said. ""We basically caught -- we've caught Iran cheating on the interim deal and rather than saying, ‘Look, we're done, you've proven that you're not an effective partner, that we can't trust you,’ they say, ‘We'll give you more time because we're going to get to a deal.’ "" We decided to check whether Iran was caught cheating on the interim agreement. Hayes told us he had two violations in mind. The one most tightly tied to Iran’s nuclear program had to do with Iran’s work with a new model of centrifuge. Centrifuges are key to enriching uranium and enriched uranium is key to making a bomb. The other violation had to do with Iran selling more oil than it is allowed. In our research, we found a third possible violation involving Iran buying parts for its heavy water reactor in Arak. What we discovered is that while Iran isn’t squeaky clean, no point is definitively in violation of the interim agreement. Importantly, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. We’ll deal with each potential violation in turn. Work with a new model of centrifuge One of the pillars of the interim agreement, the Joint Plan of Action, was to freeze Iran’s centrifuge facilities. It could keep the tens of thousands of centrifuges it has and could repair any that were broken, but it couldn’t expand its capacity. As part of the agreement, Iran could continue some limited research and development work. A problem emerged in November when the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that in the ""R&D area,"" Iran ""has been intermittently feeding natural UF6 (uranium fluoride) into the IR-5 centrifuge."" Agency inspectors said that no enriched uranium emerged because the Iranians recombined everything back together at the end of the run. This set off red flags because, until then, the Iranians had not fed uranium fluoride into that particular centrifuge. ""Iran was caught red-handed engaged in centrifuge activities,"" Hayes said. ""When confronted by the State Department, Iran stopped feeding the IR-5."" Hayes relied on an assessment from the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. In November, the institute initially said, ""The feeding of the IR-5 centrifuge is an apparent violation of that commitment to freeze centrifuge R&D activities."" Hayes told us that he took an ""apparent violation"" to be the equivalent of cheating. But David Albright, the institute’s president, said that after a closer look, it wasn’t that cut and dried. ""It’s hard to say definitively one way or the other on the question of a clear violation,"" Albright told PunditFact. Albright and his group’s latest assessment is that the Joint Plan of Action didn’t specifically allow the Iranians to feed the uranium into the IR-5 centrifuge. But it’s not clear if that constitutes a violation. Albright said that an administration official told him that the action was ""inconsistent with the United States’ understanding of the Joint Plan of Action."" That could be a diplomatic way of saying there had been a violation, or it might mean that the original agreement was unclear, a lawyer told Albright. What is clear: The Americans asked Iran to stop, and Iran did. Adam Mount, a nuclear security fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said as far as anyone can tell, the interim agreement has achieved what it set out to do. ""There is no publicly available evidence that Iran has violated the terms of the Joint Plan of Action,"" Mount said. ""Progress on the Iranian nuclear program is frozen and in some of the most important areas, it has been rolled back."" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that hopes to see a final nuclear agreement with Iran, said it would have been better if Iran hadn’t fed the uranium into the IR-5 centrifuge. ""Was it useful or helpful?"" Kimball asked. ""No. Was it specifically prohibited by the Joint Plan of Action? Also no. There is a big difference between the Iranians have been caught cheating, and a dispute about the one centrifuge."" In sum, the weight of the evidence says that it would have been better if Iran had not fired up that IR-5 centrifuge, but doing so didn’t rise to the level of violating the interim agreement. Iran sold too much oil Hayes’ second contention is that Iran sold more oil than allowed as part of the interim agreement. ""Iran violated the terms of the Joint Plan of Action by exporting more crude than the agreement allowed, specifically to China, India, Japan and South Korea,"" Hayes told us. For evidence, Hayes pointed us to a Reuters article that reported that in the first nine months of 2014, sales to those countries had risen nearly 20 percent from the year before, to about 1.14 million barrels per day. But again, things aren’t so cut and dried. The Joint Plan of Action says that the five Security Council countries and Germany would stop trying to reduce the amount of oil that Iran could sell. It also says that countries can continue to buy ""their current average amounts of crude oil."" There are no specific caps, however, and no clear explanation of what would constitute a violation. We spoke to Mark Dubowitz, who is executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group that monitors enforcement of sanctions against Iran. Dubowitz said he believes both Iran and the countries that bought its oil skirted the deal. But ultimately, Dubowitz said we can’t know for sure whether Iran’s oil sales violate the terms of the agreement because we lack access to a critical piece. Behind the public summary of the Joint Plan of Action is a much more detailed implementation agreement. Only people with a certain level of security clearance can see it. ""We don’t know what that says,"" Dubowitz said. ""Iran’s sales might be a violation. Or they might not."" Also, several of the countries that are buying Iran’s oil, such as India, Japan and South Korea, didn’t sign the interim agreement and thus wouldn’t be bound by it. And lastly, while the United States has set limits on the amount of oil Iran can sell, those are not written into the Joint Plan of Action. Buying parts for a heavy water reactor Some analysts we reached thought Hayes might have been thinking of another potential problem with Iran. According to some reports, it has continued to buy parts that could be used in its heavy water reactor, which is another means to produce fuel for a nuclear bomb. However, even if those reports are accurate, the activity falls outside the interim agreement. Matthew Kroenig is a professor of international relations at Georgetown University. Kroenig would not call these purchases a violation of the Joint Plan of Action. On the other hand, Kroenig said that shouldn’t make anyone feel any better. ""It is in violation of U.N. sanctions prohibiting Iranian procurement of sensitive nuclear technology,"" Kroenig said. ""It also might reveal something about how sincere Iran is about shutting down or converting the reactor as part of a final deal."" Our ruling Hayes said Iran had been caught cheating on the interim deal to rein in Iran’s nuclear program, called the Joint Plan of Action. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. That said, there are some actions by Iran that certainly cut near the boundaries of the terms of the agreement. Iran has worked with a new kind of centrifuge that, while perhaps not a formal violation, does seem to contradict the United States’ understanding of the deal, an expert told us. When confronted on the matter, Iran stopped its work. Also, there is some question about the amount of oil Iran is exporting. But an expert said we just don’t have enough information to determine whether that constitutes a violation of the agreement or not. Hayes said we caught Iran cheating. You can say some allege that, and you can say there’s some evidence that might suggest that. But we found no hand in the cookie jar. As such, we rate this claim Mostly False.

"['Education', 'Sports', 'Virginia', 'Jim Moran']","
Moran says college football players have low graduation rates
","U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is trying to clean up college sports as he finishes his 24-year congressional career.   Moran, who retires Jan. 3, introduced legislation this fall that would create a commission to look into the policies of the NCAA after myriad college sports scandals. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve ""the interaction of athletics and academics"" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes’ abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs. ""The graduation rates of players in the Football Bowl Subdivision are still twenty points below their male campus peers and worsened in the past three years,"" Moran wrote in a Facebook post. We’ve already fact-checked two Moran statements about big-time college sports but we thought this was worth a look, too. We gave Moran a True rating for to his claim that only 20 colleges athletic departments generate bottom-line profits. We gave him a Mostly True for his claim that a college coaches is the highest- paid public employee in 40 states. We’ll start our look at Moran’s statement about graduation rates with a definition of Football Bowl Subdivision -- the term the congressman used to qualify his statement. There are 1,083 colleges and universities competing in sports that fall under the NCAA’s governance. The Football Bowl subdivision is the top tier of college sports competition, comprised of 123 schools that are eligible to compete in bowl games and have average attendance of at least 15,000 at their home games. Moran’s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, said the congressman’s statement was based on 2011 and 2014 reports from the College Sport Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. The institute has published reports on the graduation rates of students and athletes since 2010-11. The institute analyzes two sets of graduation data -- one from the federal government for all students and one from the NCAA for college athletes -- and adjusts them into comparable statistics. The greatest difference is that the federal graduation rate tracks part-time as well as full-time students. All school athletes are required to carry a full-time load. The institute computes the percentage of athletes and regular students who complete their undergraduate degrees in six years. The 2011 report compares football players to other male students who started college from 2000 to 2003. The study focused on FBS schools that belong to Power 5 conferences -- the Big XII, Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten and Pac-12. FBS football players graduated at a rate 17.8 percentage points below other male students -- 55.1 percent for the players compared to 72.9 percent for the others. The 2014 report compared male students and football players who started college between 2003 and 2006 and found the numbers had not changed dramatically. The athletes graduated at a rate 17.5 percentage points below other male students -- 57.4 percent for the athletes compared to 74.9 percent for the others. Scanlon acknowledged Moran erred in saying the graduation gap between the football players and other students had widened. ""It’s been pretty static,"" said Richard M. Southall, director of the institute. ""One of the more troubling findings is that the gap for black players at the Power 5 conferences is negative 26 percent while for white players it is negative 7 percent. Football is driven a great deal by African American males at the FBS level and the gaps are very pronounced for black players. The same is true for Division I basketball."" Southall said the demands of playing FBS football are equivalent to having a full time job and leave athletes limited time for study. He said that academics and athletic success have an inverse relationship. ""There’s a strong relationship between athletic success and a greater graduation gap,"" he said. ""This makes sense because the demands on the athletes are greater. For example, for the FBS teams now in the playoff format, they are playing more games and the season takes more time … The demands are greater."" Our ruling Moran said that FBS football players graduate at a rate 20 points below male students and that it has worsened. Moran is close enough on the graduation rate. But the gap hasn’t gotten worse, it’s pretty much stayed the same. So Moran gets a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC66CA80>],/factchecks/2014/dec/30/jim-moran/moran-says-college-football-players-have-low-gradu/

Goodlatte says Obama has flip-flopped on his power to order immigration reform
","U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte says President Barack Obama exceeded his authority last month when he bypassed Congress and unilaterally extended legal status to millions of immigrants. The evidence lies in the words of the president himself, Goodlatte said. ""It’s both perplexing and alarming that the president has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take,"" Goodlatte, R-6th, said in a news release. Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he will delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have greencards. If applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they can qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which will be open for applications this spring. Obama also expanded a program he began by executive action in June 2012 to halt the deportation of students -- known as ""dreamers"" who were brought to the U.S. as children when their parents entered the country illegally. Obama’s action came after the House of Representatives failed to approve a comprehensive immigration reform bill that had cleared the Senate. We asked Goodlatte’s office to back his claim that Obama had repeatedly said he lacked the power to order sweeping immigration reform. Beth Breeding, Goodlatte’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a Nov. 19 news release by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, citing 22 instances of Obama saying he couldn’t act unilaterally on immigration. Some of the items on the list don’t affect immigration at all, but are general statements that Obama made as a candidate about cutting down on executive orders. But there are some comments on the speaker’s list get to the heart of Goodlatte’s statement. Let’s take a look: March 28, 2011 During a town hall meeting at the Bell Multicultural High School in Washington, Obama  was asked if he could issue an executive order to stop deportation of undocumented high school students. The president dismissed the idea. Obama said, ""With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive orders, that’s just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed -- and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard so you know that we’ve got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch’s job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws. ""There are enough laws on the books that are very clear in terms of how we enforce our immigration system that for me to, simply through executive order, ignore these constitutional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president. That does not mean, though, that we can’t make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity."" Jan. 30. 2013 During an interview with Univision, a Spanish-language television network, Obama was asked if he would consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminal immigrants. The president said, ""Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law. And that’s what we’ve done. But what I’ve also said is, let’s make sure that we’re applying the law in a way that takes into account people’s humanity. That’s the reason that we’ve moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here, for example."" Feb. 14, 2013  Obama was asked  During a Google+ Hangout, by a woman named Jackie, if he would be willing to take executive action on immigration to ensure ""families are not split apart."" Obama said, ""Well look Jackie, this is something I’ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed and Congress, right now, has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system and what that means is we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think in many cases the results may be tragic. ""And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we are focusing our enforcement resources on criminals as opposed to someone who is just here and trying to work and look  after their families. What we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated, and what we’ve done is obviously passed a deferred action which made sure the dreamers -- young people who were brought here and think of themselves as American -- are American except for their papers, that they are not deported. Having said all that, we’ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can. That’s why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important."" Sept. 17, 2013 Obama was interviewed by Jose Diaz-Balart, anchor for Noticias Telemundo. The broadcaster asked the president if he would ""consider unilaterally freezing deportations for the parents of deferred action kids."" Obama said, ""Here’s the problem that I have, Jose, and I’ve said this consistently. My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said here’s the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement, and what I have been able to do is make to a legal argument, that I think is absolutely right, that given the resources that we have, we can’t do everything that Congress has asked us to do. ""What we can do is then carve out the DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown up here are Americans,that we should welcome. We not going to have them grow up under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I feel would be very difficult to defend legally."" Obama’s order does not specifically protect parents of dreamers from deportation. But many of them, if they can pass background checks and pay a fee, will still be able to delay their deportation under general provisions of the executive action. Still, in this interview, Obama casts doubt that his executive powers to shield people from deportation extends beyond the dreamers. In a Nov. 18 press conference, White House spokesman Josh Earnest was asked about the president’s 2013 comments that broadening protections beyond the dreamers ""would be very difficult to defend legally."" ""Since this interview aired, the president did direct the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review of the law to determine what, if any, authority he could use to try to fix some of the problems that House Republicans have refused to address,"" Earnest said. In announcing his executive actions, Obama said he was well within his legal authority to take them. Twenty-five states -- but not Virginia -- have joined a suit challenging the president’s power to issue the immigration order. Our ruling Goodlatte said, ""The President has decided to move forward with executive actions on immigration that he has said on numerous occasions that he didn’t have the constitutional power to take."" The record supports Goodlatte. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB83FC80>],/factchecks/2014/dec/29/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-obama-has-flip-flopped-his-power-or/

Kevin Brady says sales tax deduction has saved Texas families more than $10 billion
","A declaration about how Texans have benefited  from a federal tax deduction led Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to call for the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Greenfield asked us about the accuracy of a statement by U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Houston,  in a Dec. 17, 2014, press release issued after the U.S. Senate agreed with the House to extend the ability of Texas taxpayers to deduct sales taxes on federal income tax returns. Brady, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said: ""Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago."" Greenfield speculated the $10 billion figure was an overstatement. Congressman’s back-up information To our inquiry, Brady spokeswoman Tracee Evans pointed out a news story posted online Sept. 22, 2014, by the Dallas Morning News. That story said that according to the Texas state comptroller’s office, if Congress failed to extend the option of deducting state and local sales taxes, Texans would owe an extra $1.2 billion to the IRS in April 2015. Evans emailed us: ""If it’s $1.2 billion a year, extrapolate that over ten years and what do you get?"" In most states, the News’ story noted, taxpayers can deduct state income tax payments from their federal tax bill. And since 2004, Congress has let taxpayers in states with no income tax — Texas and six others — deduct state and local sales taxes instead. In 2012, the story said, 2.3 million Texas filers (about one in five) used the sales tax deduction with the average deduction for those who claimed it being $1,906, according to a September 2014 Pew Charitable Trusts report. We asked the comptroller’s office about the cited estimate. By phone, spokesman Chris Bryan said its revenue-estimating experts reached the $1.2 billion figure by taking the total amount deducted by Texans for sales tax in 2012 -- $4,353,996,000 -- and multiplying that by what its experts calculated to be the average marginal tax rate that year, 27 percent. So, the calculation suggests, Texans who took the deduction in 2012 reduced their federal income taxes by an estimated $1.18 billion all together. (We ran the same numbers, starting from an IRS chart showing federal taxes paid by Texas residents in 2012, reaching the same result.) In October 2007, Evans pointed out, State Comptroller Susan Combs estimated the deduction was saving Texans $1 billion a year. Bryan told us, though, the office doesn’t routinely estimate the effect of the deduction and doesn’t have a 10-year impact figure. Greenfield, apprised of the comptroller’s approach, said its methodology and Brady’s cumulative figure seemed to add up after all. Texas tax expert: Beneficiaries tend to be higher-income earners Separately, Dick Lavine, a tax analyst for the liberal Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, stressed by email that Texans at higher income levels disproportionately enjoy the deduction, which only helps taxpayers who itemize deductions. In 2012, 39 percent of Texas filers with adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 to $100,000 took the deduction; 14 percent of filers with earnings of $25,000 to $50,000 did so. Lavine pointed out, too, that Texans deducted $3.2 billion in 2004, the first year the deduction was restored, which might indicate the value of the deduction in reduced taxes over 10 years might be less than $10 billion, he said, especially if the marginal tax rate on average was 25 percent. PolitiFact estimate To reach a savings estimate of our own, we added up all the sales tax deductions claimed by Texas residents for 2004 through 2012, as reported by the IRS. A figure for 2013 has yet to be posted by the agency so we reached an estimate for that year based on averaging what Texans deducted in 2010, 2011 and 2012. All this ultimately led us to estimate the Texas deductions over the decade totaled nearly $40 billion. Next, we calculated the likely tax savings -- that is, money not paid by Texas residents to Uncle Sam thanks to these deductions. Assuming the 27 percent marginal tax rate applied by the comptroller’s office to 2012, the deduction would have left $10.8 billion in Texas pocketbooks over the 10 years. At a 25 percent marginal rate, Texans’ money not spent on federal taxes would have amounted to nearly $10 billion ($9.998 billion, by our calculation.) Asked to comment on our calculations, Alan Cole, an economist for the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a non-partisan tax policy research organization, emailed that he would have taken a similar tack. He also cautioned, though, that individuals who take the deduction tend to earn more and hence have higher marginal tax rates, which could justify a larger 10-year savings estimate. Our ruling Brady said: ""Texas families have kept more than $10 billion in their family budgets since we successfully fought to restore Texas' sales tax deduction a decade ago."" While that’s a squishy figure -- an estimate that can’t be pinned as a fact unless you somehow divine every Texan’s marginal tax rate for each of the 10 years, for starters -- it appears to be reasonable. It’s also so that families that had these savings were mostly better off; lower-income taxpayers tend not to itemize deductions. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

In 2008 Obama said normalization with Cuba would require Democratic reforms, Mario Diaz-Balart says
","President Barack Obama’s announcement that the United States and Cuba would proceed toward normalized relations put Miami’s Cuban-American GOP Congressional delegation in the national spotlight. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Reps Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen held a press conference Dec. 18 to bash Obama’s announcement. Diaz-Balart characterized Obama’s position as a significant change from what he said during the 2008 campaign.

""Then, once again, President Obama -- breaking his own word, breaking his own pledge -- has decided to do something absolutely without precedent, and that is to give an anti-American terrorist dictatorship exactly what they have been asking for."" Is Diaz-Balart correct about what Obama, then a senator, said would be his criteria for normalizing relations with Cuba? We went back to his campaign speeches and statements to find out. Obama’s 2008 campaign position on Cuba Obama’s historic announcement to normalize relations with Cuba was announced jointly by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. Plans call for opening embassies in Havana and Washington, easing travel restrictions and increasing the amount of money that Cubans on the island can receive from relatives in the United States. and other Americans. Those traveling to Cuba from the United States will also be able use credit cards on the island, and Cuba may be removed from the State Department’s list as a state sponsor of terrorism. However, the longstanding trade embargo – strengthened in 1996 with passage of the Helms-Burton Act -- remains in place. Only Congress has the power to abolish it. Under Helms-Burton, the embargo can only be lifted when Cuba holds free and fair elections, releases political prisoners and guarantees free speech and workers' rights. While Obama promised that the United States will continue its efforts to spread democracy to Cuba, we don’t see anything in what’s been released that would require Cuba to promote democracy or establish freedom of the press, political parties and unions in order to normalize relations. Under the agreement, Cuba released 53 political prisoners, pledged to loosen Internet controls and agreed to permit enhanced access for the International Red Cross. Cuba also released USAID worker Alan Gross and an unidentified spy who had been imprisoned in Cuba for the last 20 years. The United States released three imprisoned Cuban spies in Florida. Gross was a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development who’d been held since his arrest on Dec. 3, 2009. Cuban authorities charged him with smuggling satellite communications equipment to the country as part of the USAID’s pro-democracy programs. Media outlets have identified the spy as 51-year-old Rolando Sarraff, a former Cuban intelligence agent arrested by the Castro government in November 1995. During the 2008 campaign, Obama sometimes talked about his criteria for normalizing relations with Cuba and lifting the embargo in the same breath, making it appear that his criteria overlapped. During the Democratic presidential primary in 2007, Obama wrote an op-ed for the Miami Herald in which he called for ""unrestricted rights'' for Cuban-American travel and remittances to the island. ""Accordingly, I will use aggressive and principled diplomacy to send an important message: If a post-Fidel (Castro) government begins opening Cuba to democratic change, the United States (the president working with Congress) is prepared to take steps to normalize relations and ease the embargo that has governed relations between our countries for the last five decades,"" Obama wrote. When Fidel Castro -- the island nation’s longtime dictator -- resigned in February 2008, Obama said, ""If the Cuban leadership begins opening Cuba to meaningful democratic change, the United States must be prepared to begin taking steps to normalize relations and to ease the embargo of the last five decades.'' (When he stepped down, Fidel Castro turned over power to his younger brother, Raul.) A spokeswoman for Diaz-Balart also pointed to a speech Obama gave in Miami in May 2008. ""My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word: 'libertad,' "" he said, citing the Spanish word for ""freedom."" ""The road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom of assembly, and it must lead to elections that are free and fair. That is my commitment."" Obama called for a new strategy on Cuba, and held out the possibility of a meeting with Castro ""at a time and place of my choosing, but only when we have an opportunity to advance the interests of the United States, and to advance the cause of freedom for the Cuban people."" Then Obama turned to the embargo: ""I will maintain the embargo. It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: If you take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners, we will take steps to begin normalizing relations."" We sent Diaz-Balart’s statement to a spokesman for Obama. ""I think its fair to report that there was significant progress here (regarding) the political prisoners – they released a large (number of prisoners) that we specifically requested,"" Eric Schultz said. ""The president has always been flexible on specifics (regarding) negotiations and clear there would be some give and take."" Schultz pointed to various statements by Obama in which he addressed normalizing relations with Cuba, including an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on May 20, 2008. Blitzer asked Obama about charges leveled against him by his Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain. McCain had said that Obama wanted to sit down unconditionally for a presidential meeting with Raul Castro. Blitzer asked Obama, ""Are you ready to normalize relations with Raul Castro’s regime?"" Obama replied: ""No. ... I have never said that I was prepared to immediately normalize relations with Cuba."" Obama added, ""If we could see progress on a whole host of issues, then we should move in the direction of normalization, because what we have done over the last 50 years obviously not has worked for what is the primary criteria of U.S.-Cuban policy, which is making sure that the Cuban people have freedom."" As for meeting with Castro, Obama said that ""what I have said is I would be willing to meet without preconditions, but with a lot of preparation. And this is the same argument that we've been having with respect to Iran."" Obama on embargo in 2004 Just a footnote that’s beyond the scope of Diaz-Balart’s claim: Obama articulated a more conciliatory position on Cuba when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2004 then he did four years later when he sought the White House. ""I think it’s time for us to end the embargo in Cuba,"" Obama said on Jan. 20, 2004, in a speech at Southern Illinois University. ""And the Cuban embargo has failed to provide the source of raising standards of living and it has squeezed the innocents in Cuba."" The embargo, he said, has ""utterly failed in the effort to overthrow Castro, who’s now have been there since I was born. So, it’s time for us to acknowledge that that particular policy has failed."" Our ruling Diaz-Balart said that in 2008, Obama had said that normalization with Cuba would first require ""liberation of all political prisoners, and some basic steps toward freedom, including freedom of the press, political parties, labor unions."" Obama did suggest such a linkage in 2008, though his phrasing was open to some interpretation. And on other occasions during the 2008 campaign, Obama offered a vaguer formulation for how Cuban relations could be normalized. On those other occasions, Obama said that if he saw unspecified steps toward democratic change in Cuba, he might pursue normalized relations with Cuba. Diaz-Balart’s claim glosses over these nuances, so we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC731F00>],/factchecks/2014/dec/23/mario-diaz-balart/2008-obama-said-normalization-cuba-would-require-d/

Giuliani: Obama 'propaganda' says 'everybody should hate the police'
","Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani blamed President Barack Obama for anti-police ""propaganda"" that eventually led to the shooting death of two New York City police officers. The Dec. 20 shooting happened amid rising tension between the black community and law enforcement across the country over racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Commenting on the shooting on Fox News, Giuliani said politicians’ rhetoric, as well as protests, exacerbate the tension. ""We’ve had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police,"" Giuliani said. ""The protests are being embraced, the protests are being encouraged. The protests, even the ones that don’t lead to violence, a lot of them lead to violence, all of them lead to a conclusion: The police are bad, the police are racist. That is completely wrong."" Giuliani’s claim that Obama said something akin to ""everybody should hate the police"" struck us as overheated right off the bat, so we decided to look into it. We asked Giuliani for a response but we didn't hear back.  Almost one month ago, Giuliani faced backlash for some controversial remarks about race and the criminal justice system. He questioned why the same Americans protesting black deaths at the hands of white police officers do not voice similar outrage about black-on-black crime. In response to his most recent comments, we sifted through Obama’s statements and interviews on the subject since August, when the situation first bubbled up after a white police officer killed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Even the most distorted readings of Obama’s remarks cannot be interpreted as encouraging people to ""hate the police."" Obama has repeatedly emphasized that the work police do is dangerous to themselves but very important to the community. He has said that although ""a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement"" (an oft-repeated talking point), the vast majority of law enforcement officers do not carry out the law in a discriminatory manner. He has also argued that improvement -- achieved through peaceful and cooperative means -- is necessary. Part of Giuliani’s point is that Obama has been empathetic to the protesters, which he has been -- though cautiously so. And he has always discouraged violent protests and excessive police response. Here’s a selection of telling passages from Obama’s comments on race and the criminal justice system since August. We fail to see how they support Guiliani’s point. Aug. 14, Obama's first statement following Brown's death: There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting.  There’s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protestors in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.... Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority. Aug. 18, Obama’s second statement following Brown’s death:  I’ve said this before -- in too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement... This is not an argument that there isn’t real crime out there, and that law enforcement doesn't have a difficult job and that they have to be honored and respected for the danger and difficulty of law enforcement. Sept. 28, speech at the Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner: In too many communities around the country, a gulf of mistrust exists between local residents and law enforcement… One recent poll showed that the majority of Americans think the criminal justice system doesn’t treat people of all races equally…. And that has a corrosive effect -- not just on the black community; it has a corrosive effect on America. It harms the communities that need law enforcement the most. It makes folks who are victimized by crime and need strong policing reluctant to go to the police because they may not trust them.   Nov. 24, remarks following a grand jury’s decision not to indict the officer who shot Brown: Understand, our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They’ve got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law…. The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color. Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country. And this is tragic, because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates…. There are issues in which the law too often feels as if it is being applied in discriminatory fashion. I don't think that's the norm. I don't think that's true for the majority of communities or the vast majority of law enforcement officials. But these are real issues. Dec. 1, remarks after meeting with community and law enforcement Ferguson laid bare a problem that is not unique to St. Louis or that area, and is not unique to our time, and that is a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color…. We also heard law enforcement and were reminded of what a tough job it is to be in law enforcement. Whether you’re in a big city or in a small community, as (Attorney General) Eric Holder put it, police officers have the right to come home. And if they’re in dangerous circumstances, we have to be able to put ourselves in their shoes and recognize that they do have a tough job. Dec. 3, remarks after grand jury decision not to indict New York City officers involved in death of Eric Garner  I say that as somebody who believes that law enforcement has an incredibly difficult job, that every man or woman in uniform are putting their lives at risk to protect us, that they have the right to come home, just like we do from our jobs, that there’s real crime out there that they’ve got to tackle day in and day out -- but that they’re only going to be able to do their job effectively if everybody has confidence in the system. And right now, unfortunately, we are seeing too many instances where people just do not have confidence that folks are being treated fairly. And in some cases, those may be misperceptions; but in some cases, that’s a reality.  Dec. 8, interview with BET And one of the things that I want us to make sure we understand is that, communities of color need good law enforcement. I mean, there’s a lot of crime, and one of the things that we talked about on Monday here was you’ve got young people who end up getting caught between police that they don’t trust and folks on the streets who are trying to rough them up…. And I’ve said it before: The vast majority of law enforcement officers are doing a really tough job, and most of them are doing it well and are trying to do the right thing.  But a combination of bad training, in some cases; a combination in some cases of departments that really are not trying to root out biases, or tolerate sloppy police work; a combination in some cases of folks just not knowing any better, and in a lot of cases, subconscious fear of folks who look different -- all of this contributes to a national problem that’s going to require a national solution. Our ruling Giuliani said Obama has said ""that everybody should hate the police."" Throughout all of his comments since August, when the latest unrest over racial disparities in the criminal justice system began, Obama has continuously encouraged working with police to find solutions and make change. He has also repeatedly emphasized the importance of law enforcement in communities of color and the fact that police officers have a dangerous job. Giuliani’s claim is an outlandish distortion of what Obama actually said. We rate this Pants on Fire.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says U.S. soldiers have been court-martialed for waterboarding
","The so-called ""CIA torture report"" has heightened debate over whether certain interrogation techniques used by the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks constituted torture. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse weighed in on Dec. 14 when he appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" with host Chris Wallace and political consultant Karl Rove. In the portion of the program that dealt with whether waterboarding, which simulates the feeling of drowning, constitutes torture, Whitehouse said there was precedent in the United States to conclude that it was. ""We decided that waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents during the Philippine revolution,"" Whitehouse said. ""We decided waterboarding was torture when we prosecuted Japanese soldiers as war criminals for waterboarding Americans during World War II, and we decided waterboarding was torture when the American court system described waterboarding as torture when Ronald Reagan and his Department of Justice prosecuted a Texas sheriff and several of his associates for waterboarding detainees."" Because the Philippine revolution, which dates back to the 1890s, is the earliest reference Whitehouse made, we decided to check out that part of his statement. While we were waiting for Whitehouse's office to respond to our request for documentation, we started poking around ourselves. There's little doubt that what is now called waterboarding -- then known as water torture or by the odd name of the ""water cure"" -- was used by Americans in the Philippines after the U.S. gained colonial authority over the islands from the Spanish in 1898 under the terms of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War. Filipinos had been recruited to help fight the Spanish but when the Spanish were vanquished, the Filipinos tried to gain their independence. The resulting guerilla war had some things in common with the U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, complete with boobytraps, suspicions that all Filipinos were guerrilla fighters, and the depiction of the guerillas as treacherous fanatics. Most accounts we found report that an infantry captain named Edwin F. Glenn was found guilty of engaging in water torture during the war. Glenn was a judge advocate at the time he was involved in waterboarding. By the time he was court-martialed, he had been promoted to major. He was specifically charged with administering the ""water cure"" to a prominent Philippine resident named Tobeniano Ealdama, whom he suspected of collaborating with insurgents. Whitehouse's office cited a detailed 1903 Senate report on courts-martial in the Philippines. The section on Glenn accuses him of carrying out ""a method of punishment commonly known in the Philippine Islands as the 'water cure;' that is, did cause water to be introduced into the mouth and stomach of the said Ealdama against his will"" around Nov. 27, 1900. Glenn admitted to the practice but defended it, arguing -- as waterboarding supporters do today -- that it saved lives. A military court didn't think that was sufficient justification. He was found guilty. But his sentence was light -- a one-month suspension and a $50 fine, which was the equivalent to more than $1,200 today. Glenn wasn't the only soldier to be court-martialed for administering the ""water cure,"" and testimony in the Senate report makes it clear that this was frequently used to extract information. First Lt. Julien E. Gaujot, of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, was found guilty of doing it to three priests in January, 1902. He was suspended from command for three months, forfeiting $50 in pay per month for that period. The military court made it clear that, in the cases of both men, the court was being lenient. Like Glenn, Gaujot admitted using water torture, saying he did it because he knew the priests were insurgents and ""I knew that they possessed information that would be valuable to the American cause."" ""It was impossible to obtain reliable information regarding the insurgents from the inhabitants, who are, as a whole, crafty, lying, and treacherous, many of them being fanatical savages who respect no laws and whose every instinct is depraved,"" Glenn told the court. Not all of the courts-martial were successful. For example, 1st Lt. Edwin A. Hickman of the First U.S. Cavalry was brought up on charges for ordering that two Filipinos be held upside down and the upper half of their bodies dunked in an open spring to extract information and to get the men to act as guides. He admitted doing it but argued that it wasn't unlawful. The court acquitted Hickman because of ""the abnormal and disgraceful methods of armed resistance to the authority of the United States; the treachery of the natives generally; the paramount necessity of obtaining information, and the belief on the part of the accused that the punishment administered was within the rules of war and under the instructions of superior military authority."" In these cases, Judge Advocate General George B. Davis said General Order #100, which dated back to 1863, ""contains the requirement that military necessity does not admit of cruelty -- that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge -- nor of maiming or wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions."" In these cases, there was no emergency that required torture, Davis argued. One might debate whether the ""water cure"" is the same as waterboarding. In both cases, the victim is lying down and restrained. With waterboarding, the face is sometimes covered by a towel with the body tilted to try to keep water in the upper airways and out of the lungs. With the water cure, water went directly into the mouth and was forced into the stomach, causing a great deal of pain. In both instances, the goal is not to drown the victim, but to make things as unpleasant as possible. Both produce the sensation of being unable to breathe. Even if the water doesn't get into the lungs directly, the victim may vomit and inhale the vomit, which can be fatal. The water cure was clearly effective in inducing fear. According to accounts in the Senate report, just the threat of repeating ""the water cure"" could be enough to break the will of recalcitrant Filipinos. ""At a minimum, the techniques are substantially similar,"" said Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said the United States ""decided waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents in the Philippine revolution."" The ""water cure"" as performed in the Philippines is not significantly different from the waterboarding done in reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Both forms of water torture -- and the risks -- are similar and the Senate report from 1903 makes it clear that military prosecutors regarded the ""water cure"" as a form of torture. We rate  the claim as True.

Jim Moran says only 20 colleges make a profit from sports
","At the end of his 24-year congressional career, Rep. Jim Moran Jr. is returning to his athletic roots. Moran, D-8th, is the son and namesake of Jim Moran Sr., who played professional football with the Boston Redskins in the mid 1930s. The congressman, himself, played football at the College of the Holy Cross in the mid 1960s. Moran, who retires Jan. 3, introduced legislation this fall that would create a commission to look into the policies of the NCAA after myriad college sports scandals. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve ""the interaction of athletics and academics"" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes’ abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs. ""We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach, and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses,"" Moran said in a Facebook post. We rated Moran’s statement about coaches’ pay as Mostly True. Now, we’ll look at his claim that only 20 athletic departments at  the nation’s largest universities are making a profit. Let’s start with a definition of the Football Bowl Subdivision -- the term Moran used to qualify his statement. There are 1,083 colleges and universities competing in sports that fall under the NCAA’s governance. They are grouped into three divisions, that are defined by athletic scholarship rules and the amount of money the schools spend on sports. For example, Division I schools -- which are typically large -- can offer many full athletic scholarships, Division II schools can offer partial athletic scholarships and Division III schools are not allowed to offer sports  scholarships. There are 346 Division I schools. Of them, 123 are classified as members of the Football Bowl Subdivision, the top tier of sports competition. These are colleges and universities that are eligible to compete in bowl games and have average attendance of at least 15,000 at their home games. So Moran is generally talking about the athletic department finances at large universities that field football teams. Moran’s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, said the congressman’s claim was based on an NCAA study on Division I athletic department budgets that was released in April. The report says, ""A total of 20 athletics programs in the FBS reported positive net revenues for the 2013 fiscal year."" The study deals in broad statistics and does not identify schools that are in the black or the red. Only two sports were profitable at FBS schools, according to the report. Football programs netted a median profit of slightly more than $3 million and men’s basketball netted a median $340,000. But the profits at most schools quickly vanished after paying for a long list of other intercollegiate teams, all of which lose money. The median loss among of athletic departments was $11.6 million. Here are some other findings from the NCAA report: According to the report, all athletic departments outside of the FBS operate in the red. In other words, only 20 of the 1,083 college sports programs in the nation are profitable. Our ruling Moran said only 20 FBS schools generate more money from athletics than they spend. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAC3200>],/factchecks/2014/dec/22/jim-moran/moran-says-only-20-colleges-make-profit-sports/

Greg Abbott: 'My wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas'
","In a limelight interview, the governor-elect of Texas responded to a question about beefing up security near the Texas-Mexico border by bringing up his wife. When Abbott appeared on the Dec. 7, 2014, broadcast of NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" to discuss immigration and border security, host Chuck Todd played a January 2005 video clip of President George W. Bush, the former Texas governor, saying ""family values do not stop at the Rio Grande… People are coming to our country to do jobs that Americans won’t do to be able to feed their families. And I think there’s a humane way to recognize that, at the same time protect our borders,"" Bush said, ""and at the same way to make sure we don’t disadvantage those who have stood in line for years to become a legal citizen."" Todd asked: ""Do you agree with that statement?"" Abbott replied: ""In a way I understand this even more powerfully because my wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas. And Texas has had a long tradition of uniting the Hispanic culture with Texas values."" Abbott, the state attorney general, talked up his wife making history for months on the campaign trail in 2014, perhaps to good effect. In July 2014, PolitiFact Texas found the state’s population was 38.4 percent Hispanic, the second biggest demographic after whites, who make up 40 percent. Notably too, the flags that have flown over Texas include the banners of Spain and Mexico. And has there previously not been a Hispanic first lady of Texas? Not since statehood, it appears. But we started our look into Abbott's claim by looking into the next first lady’s roots. The next First Lady Abbott aides didn’t respond to our inquiries into how Abbott decided his wife was breaking ground. We looked for clues on Ancestry.com, the online genealogy database, which led us to information credited to the 1940 United States Federal Census indicating Cecilia Phalen Abbott, the governor-elect’s wife, is the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants--Leonara and Augustine Segura--who settled in San Antonio before 1935. We shortly confirmed the validity of those census records on a federal website that included a chart showing Maria de la Luz Segura, Cecilia Abbott’s mother, was born in 1935 in San Antonio, where she lived with her parents, grandparents and siblings. We also uncovered census data for Cecilia Abbott’s father, William Joseph Phalen--born in Michigan in 1933 to parents from Ohio and New York and then raised in Houston. According to Ancestry.com, Phalen is an Irish family name, most common in the state of New York. Next, we turned to how best to define an Hispanic first lady. What’s Hispanic? By phone, Erika Arredondo-Haskins of the Hispanic Heritage Center of Texas in San Antonio, told us the word ""Hispanic"" describes anyone who can trace ancestry to Spanish culture, including through the Spanish colonies in the Americas that once stretched from California to the southern tip of South America. Also, Haskins suggested, Texas history predates statehood and its earlier status as as a free-standing republic to when the region was ruled by Mexico and, before that, Spain and there were numerous Hispanic first ladies. She singled out Maria Perez Cassiano, wife of the governor of the Spanish province Coahuila and Texas from 1814 to 1823. Cassiano was born in San Antonio in 1790, descended from Spanish immigrants who arrived in San Antonio in 1731, and was known for performing the governor’s duties in his absence, Haskins said. Haskins’ comments reminded us of a complicating detail: Texas fell under various successive governments since Europeans arrived in the 1500s--it’s been a province of New Spain, a Mexican province, a republic, a U.S. state and a Confederate state. According to Texas A&M University’s ""Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas,"" a Texas history research group, there were 29 governors of Texas from 1691 to 1821. Among first ladies in that period, Augustina Cantú was the wife of Alonso de Leon, the first governor of Texas who established the state’s modern eastern border at the Sabine River, according to the Handbook of Texas, a project of the Texas State Historical Association. Also, the handbook says, Ignacia Xaviera was the wife of Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo, Texas governor from 1719-1722, who drove the French from East Texas. First Ladies since Texas won independence from Mexico More Hispanic women were first ladies in the period following the Texas Revolution, when immigrants from the United States broke away from Mexico. 
 Laurie Jasinski, research editor at The Handbook of Texas, said by phone she reviewed a list of first ladies since the Republic of Texas’s independence from Mexico in 1836 and did not find mention of anyone with Hispanic roots. She also recommended we visit the Legislative Reference Library at the Texas Capitol for a full answer. At the library, we reviewed the book First Ladies of Texas, which includes biographies of Texas first ladies, born between 1836 and 1936, of the Republic of Texas, the state of Texas, and the Confederate state of Texas. (Texas became a state in 1845.) None of the 37 first ladies listed in the book had roots in former Spanish colonies. Most came from southeastern states of the United States (interestingly, less than half were born in Texas). Four recent first ladies dwelt in the governor’s mansion after the book’s publication in 1976--Rita Crocker Clements, Linda Gale White, Laura Welch Bush and Anita Thigpen Perry. Online biographical sketches for each first lady, published by Texas A&M University, Texas Woman’s University, The White House and the website of Gov. Rick Perry, respectively, revealed no Hispanic roots among them. Drawing from our research, we’ve listed Texas first ladies here. Our ruling Greg Abbott said his wife would be ""the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas."" Cecilia Abbott, with Hispanic roots through her mother and grandmother, will be the first Hispanic first lady since statehood, which we take Abbott to be saying. Other Hispanic women were first ladies only before Texas was a state. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Jim Moran says college coaches are the highest paid public employees in 40 states
","U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is ending his 24-year congressional career with hopes of reforming big-time college sports. Moran, who will retire Jan. 3, recently introduced legislation that would create a congressional commission to look into policies of the NCAA after myriad scandals involving misconduct by coaches and athletes, academic fraud and under-the-table payments. The resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve ""the interaction of athletics and academics"" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes’ abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs. ""We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach, and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses,"" Moran said in a Facebook post. Today, we’ll take a look at the claim that coaches top the payroll in 40 states. We’ll come back soon with a Truth-O-Meter on Moran’s statement that only 20 big-sport universities have athletic departments that make a profit. Moran’s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, sent us an email with three articles on coaches’ salaries. One, an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, merely repeated the 40-state statistic as fact. The other two are graphics created by USA Today and Deadspin, a sports website. USA Today compiled salary information for head football and basketball coaches at major Division I schools. Deadspin’s graphic was published in 2013 and uses data from the 2011-12 school year. Reporter Reuben Fischer-Baum considered the public employee pay information for each state and media reports on coaches’ salaries. He found that 40 of the states had coaches at the pinnacle of the pay pyramid among public employees -- 27 were football coaches and 13 were basketball coaches. We ran our own check and also found that coaches, when all of their annually guaranteed compensation is totaled, are the highest-paid public workers in 40 states -- often by a longshot. We compared the 2014 football and basketball head coaches’ salaries listed in USA Today -- showing 107 of them are making at least $1 million a year -- with either salary data bases or the most current news report we could find on each state’s payroll. But there’s a caveat to these raw figures. Many states don’t list coaches as their top earners, even though the coaches’ guaranteed pay may be many times higher than the next-highest paid public employee. That’s because, as a general rule, only a small portion of coaches’ earnings comes from taxpayers or a university’s general fund. The lion’s share comes from money raised by school-affiliated athletic foundations, personal appearance fees, product endorsements, broadcasts and cuts of team revenues. In addition, most coaches are eligible for sizeable bonuses based on their team’s performance. For example, although Virginia Tech football coach Frank Beamer’s $2.6 million base salary outstrips anyone on the state payroll, he was not included in a list of top-paid public workers published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch in September. The reason: Beamer receives no state money and is not in the state salary database of public employees. Virginia’s highest-paid state employee, according to the database, is Ronald Schmitz, chief investment officer of the Virginia Retirement System. He made $786,596 in salary and bonuses during the budget year than ended on June 30. Two years ago, George Mason University basketball coach Paul Hewitt topped the salary list, receiving state pay of $744,750. As for some other high-profile coaches in the state during the last budget year:: We should note that there are other state employees, often hospital physicians, who whose total pay packages are also supplemented by outside earnings. Identifying the top earner in each state is tricky because of inconsistent and incomplete data. Moran and Deadspin, using guaranteed compensation packages to coaches, found 40 states whose highest-paid public employee ran a football or basketball team. The number drops to at most 34, we determined, if only direct state compensation to the coach is considered. The number could be lower because, in most states, we were unable to find online data breaking down the taxpayers’ share of their coaches’ guaranteed pay. Here’s some interesting information we turned up about taxpayers’ direct contributions to the salaries of star coaches in other states: Our ruling Moran said that ""in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university’s head football or basketball coach."" The congressman is correct if we focus on the guaranteed total pay of coaches. But there’s a caveat: State taxpayers usually pay a small share of coaches’ salaries at large universities. Most of the money comes from school-affiliated foundations, endorsements, broadcast contracts and the like. If we only consider the direct taxpayer subsidy to salaries, coaches are the highest-paid public employees in at most 34 states -- and likely less. So we rate Moran’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC05E00>],/factchecks/2014/dec/22/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-college-coaches-are-highest-paid-pu/
