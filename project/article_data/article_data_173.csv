Did conservative study show big savings for Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan?
","When a free-market think tank published its analysis of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ single-payer health care plan, Republicans took to social media to tout the report’s most eye-popping finding. Sanders’ Medicare for All would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years, an amount they framed as crushingly large. $32.6 trillion dollars. That’s how much Washington Democrats’ single-payer healthcare proposal would cost over 10 years. Even doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes wouldn’t cover this cost. It is just absurd. https://t.co/8jijG73wEw Sanders, however, found good news for his idea in the generally skeptical report. In a video he shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the report’s findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia. Sanders said, ""Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. … That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center."" Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All! pic.twitter.com/speuEL6ETC Sanders’ plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone’s medical bills. Sanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers. Skeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyone’s bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses. In this article, we’ll look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays. In a way, Sanders is right, though his assertion glosses over some caveats. The Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders’ bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, it’s not hard to find the $2 trillion in question. It’s the difference between the Department of Health and Human Services’ projection of the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal. (See Table 2.) Under Mercatus’ projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system. Specifically, total health care expenditures would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years, according to Mercatus. So there’s definitely something to what Sanders said. The Mercatus report’s author took issue with Sanders’ focus on that figure. Charles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders’ plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. However, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively (see Table 4) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. So while the number Sanders chose really does appear in the report, he’s cherry-picked the more flattering of two estimates. Sanders’ bill ""indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicare’s payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance,"" Blahous said. ""Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending."" But would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are ""not likely feasible,"" said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it’s a ""pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically."" In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. Josh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. ""Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care,"" he said. In cheekily thanking the Koch brothers, Sanders said a study they indirectly sponsored ""shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period."" The $2 trillion figure can be traced back to the Mercatus report. But it is one of two scenarios the report offers, so Sanders’ use of the term ""would"" is too strong. The alternative figure, which assumes that a Medicare for All plan isn’t as successful in controlling costs as its sponsors hope it will be, would lead to an increase of almost $3.3 trillion in national health care expenditures, not a decline. Independent experts say the alternative scenario of weaker cost control is at least as plausible. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2BEE80>],/factchecks/2018/aug/03/bernie-sanders/did-conservative-study-show-big-savings-bernie-san/

Scott Walker's claim of 'record' state spending on schools doesn't account for inflation
","Near the end of a TV ad that features an elementary school teacher from Racine, Gov. Scott Walker declares: ""With a record investment in schools … we’re putting students first."" The ad, released June 19, 2018, as part of Walker’s campaign to win a third term, has turned some heads. It’s a claim he essentially repeats on the official governor’s website. In the run-up to the Aug. 14, 2018, primary election, which pits eight candidates seeking the Democratic nomination, Walker’s spending on schools has been an issue. And it’s likely to be debated ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018, general election, as well. A record investment? That’s misleading. What does ‘record’ mean? In one of our latest fact checks, on a claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell, we reported that Walker’s first two-year state budget, for 2011-’13, cut state funding to schools by nearly $800 million. Since then, Walker has gradually put back more than $1 billion. But the initial cut certainly put him in the hole, in terms of achieving ""record"" school funding. And what does Walker -- who has a history of using different phrasing to claim exceptional funding -- mean by ""record,"" anyway? Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. In the ad, as Walker begins to speak, words on the screen cite a February 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article for support. We found it’s a news article reporting that Walker’s state budget for 2017-’19 proposed $11.5 billion over the two years for schools — a new high, before accounting for inflation, which of course is crucial in comparing dollars over time. Walker’s campaign confirmed to us the $11.5 billion figure is what Walker relies on in making his ""record investment"" claim. That figure rings a (school) bell. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Prior fact check When Walker introduced his 2017-’19 budget in February 2017, he made a claim very similar to the one in the new TV ad, saying: ""We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin."" We rated that claim Mostly False. We found that the $11.5 billion is the largest two-year tally in state history -- in raw dollars, but not so when taking into account inflation, based on figures provided to us then by the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. The alliance, which has since merged to become part of the Wisconsin Policy Forum, did calculations for us dating back more than 25 years: State budget  Inflation adjusted 2017-’19 (Walker) $11.6 billion 2015-’17 (Walker) $11 billion 2013-’15 (Walker) $10.8 billion 2011-’13 (Walker) $10.6 billion 2009-’11 $12 billion 2007-’09 $12.5 billion 2005-’07 $12.9 billion 2003-’05 $12.7 billion 2001-’03 $12.9 billion 1999-’01 $12.6 billion 1997-’99 $11.8 billion 1995-’97 $9.9 billion 1993-’95 $7.78 billion 1991-’93 $7.08 billion So, adjusting for inflation, the seven state budgets prior to Walker’s taking office spent more on schools than Walker’s current budget does. But, as we found in the earlier fact check, Walker’s statement has only an element of truth, when considering the funding without regard to inflation. His claim of a ""record"" suggests a new high mark in real terms. But with inflation, his current school funding is well below that of several other budgets. Walker says he made ""a record investment in schools."" He refers to the $11.5 billion being spent on kindergarten-through-12th grade schools in his 2017-’19 state budget. In raw dollars, that is a record in Wisconsin. But inflation, of course, is crucial in measuring dollars over time. On that score, seven state budgets spent more on schools than Walker’s current budget does. The governor’s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, making it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3142C0>],/factchecks/2018/aug/03/scott-walker/scott-walkers-claim-record-state-spending-schools-/

How Trump's State Department permitted 3D-printed gun blueprints to go live online
","A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to block the online publication of blueprints outlining how to create untraceable and undetectable 3D-printed firearms. The blueprints were originally scheduled for an Aug. 1 release after a government settlement ended five years of litigation. But word of the release prompted panic as legislators and officials scrambled to block the action. Before the federal judge’s ruling, at least 21 attorneys general filed suit to stop the blueprints from going live. As conversation heated up, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter. ""I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public,"" he said. ""Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!""  I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense! Politicians and pundits jumped at the president’s words as proof that he was unfamiliar with a decision from his own administration. ""Trump: My own administration’s latest decision ‘doesn’t seem to make much sense!’"" said a July 31 headline from Addicting Info, a liberal website. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump’s last-minute statement gave us pause, too, so we decided to look at the settlement. Was the Trump administration — or Trump — actually behind it? The White House did not respond to a request for comment (though Trump's press secretary said later that he did not get a chance to weigh in). So we searched elsewhere for our answer. On May 5, 2013, Defense Distributed uploaded blueprints online that could be used to make a working 3D-printed gun called ""The Liberator,"" as well as a 53-second video of founder Cody Wilson firing one. Wilson soon received a letter from the Obama administration’s State Department demanding that he remove the files from the internet. The letter said the ""technical data"" amounted to an illegal gun export in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations, because it could be accessed in countries where the United States does not sell weapons. The State Department instructed Wilson to take down the files until he applied for specific approval of the gun’s multiple components. By that point, the blueprints had already been downloaded 100,000 times. In response, Wilson filed a lawsuit against the State Department with the help of Second Amendment Foundation, a guns-rights organization, in which he sought a preliminary injunction to allow continued publication of the gun files online. Under both the Obama and Trump administrations, the government stuck by its assertion that the ""technical data"" constituted an illegal gun export. Wilson countered that the government’s intervention violated his First Amendment right to free speech. Ultimately, district and appeals courts both rejected Wilson’s injunction request. But as the case turned to the First Amendment claim, the government made an unexpected settlement offer. With the settlement, reached in June and announced July 10, the government waived the relevant export restrictions and allowed Wilson to post the blueprints online as early as Aug. 1. Specifically, the State Department announced that it was ""in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United States"" to temporarily modify the U.S. Munitions List to exclude the technical data for the 3-D-printed guns. Defense-related items on the munitions list face tight restrictions, because they offer a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States. The U.S. Commerce Department manages a separate export list with fewer restrictions. It is not clear what role Trump or the White House played in the settlement decision, though White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during an Aug. 1 press briefing that the Department of Justice instructed the State Department to settle without White House approval. The State Department has said that its role in this issue relates solely to regulation of exports of certain types of firearms and any related technical data. But the move to shift the 3D-printed guns’ technical data outside of the State Department’s purview was not without precedent. The government’s decision came amid a longstanding but relatively behind-the-scenes administrative project — started under the Obama administration and known as ""export control reform"" — to restructure the regulations governing exports of weapons and technologies. Just as the litigation against Wilson can be traced back to the Obama years, so, too, can the export control changes that may have opened the door for the State Department’s settlement. Beginning in 2009, the Obama administration launched an overhaul of export control in order to refine regulations for items that were subject to both the State Department’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations. The goal of the reform was to streamline export controls by transferring commercially available items — such as consumer guns — off the USML and onto the less restrictive Commerce Control List. The State Department began reviewing the munitions list, sifting through each category and removing items that were not considered military-sensitive. By 2016, it had finished reviewing all but three categories: firearms, ammunition and artillery. However, reform of those final categories stalled before it could become policy. A proposed rule would have handed jurisdiction of commercial firearms export controls to the Commerce Department in 2012, but it was delayed following the Sandy Hook school shooting. That proposed rule did not regain momentum until 2018, under Trump. On May 24, the Departments of State and Commerce simultaneously published proposals in the Federal Register to amend the final three categories of the munitions list. The proposed revisions would keep military-grade weapons under State Department jurisdiction and place commercially available firearms under the purview or the Commerce Department. According to the New York Times, these proposals strongly resemble the Obama administration’s 2012 version. CNN reported that the government is currently reviewing them. This may explain the State Department’s sudden decision to settle its case with Wilson. By recommending that commercial firearm exports move under Commerce Department oversight, the May 24 proposals would likely free Wilson’s blueprints from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that previously restricted them. ""My guess is that it was somehow wrapped up in the movement of items from the (U.S. Munitions List) to the (Commerce Control List),"" said Rachel Stohl, managing director at the Stimson Center and an expert in the international arms trade. ""If you deregulate the weapons themselves, it would follow that the technical specs could be deregulated as well."" Stohl added that the settlement was ""unexpected"" and ""the State and Commerce Departments have been less than forthcoming on these details."" For his part, Wilson has agreed to refrain from posting his blueprints for at least another month while the multi-state lawsuit travels through the courts. A headline suggested that the government settlement that would have made 3D-printable guns available for download was actually a Trump administration decision, and that Trump said that didn't ""make much sense."" We could not independently determine the extent of Trump’s involvement, although Sanders said the president was not afforded the opportunity to approve of the settlement decision. But the State Department under Trump did initiate the settlement after previously taking steps to clear a path for it. However, the Obama administration’s export control reform made those steps possible, and it is not far-fetched to consider the Trump administration’s move a continuation of that initiative. We rate this statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4CD940>],/factchecks/2018/aug/02/blog-posting/how-trump-state-permitted-3-d-printed-gun/

No, U.S. Steel is not opening six new mills as Donald Trump said
","President Donald Trump has boasted about big growth in the steel industry at campaign-style rallies this summer. ""U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills,"" Trump said July 31 in Tampa. ""And that number is soon going to be lifted, but I'm not allowed to say that, so I won't."" Trump repeated the company would open six major facilities at a roundtable in Minnesota on June 20 and again at a lunch with members of Congress on June 26. That was one mill down from when he said the company was going to open seven on July 27. That would be huge news, given the company only has four steelmaking facilities in the United States. But there’s no evidence on their website that any new mills are on the horizon. Meghan Cox, a spokeswoman for U.S. Steel, told us that Trump wasn’t privy to any exclusive information. ""All of our operational changes have been publicly announced and all information shared with the federal government has been properly disclosed and made available on our website,"" Cox said. (The White House did not respond to our request for comment.) Cox pointed to several projects U.S. Steel announced this year. That includes plans to invest $275 million to $325 million in capital projects, announced in February; to construct a new steel-coating line to help PRO-TEC, a subsidiary, make cars in Leipsic, Ohio; and to restart two blast furnaces that will create 800 new jobs at an integrated steel-making plant in Granite City. The company idled those furnaces in 2015, laying off about 2,000 workers. Mills are complex operations, so we asked William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, whether a single plant might be easily mistaken for multiple plants. ""On its face, it makes no sense,"" Reinsch said. ""A plant is a plant, not a division of something or part of a facility. I don’t see how you get to six from anything I know."" None of those are new plants, but they represent investment and job-creating activities. That said, other American steelmakers have announced new mills and re-openings this year. Nucor, a steel manufacturer, announced in November it would open a steel rebar micro-mill in Sedalia, Mo., creating 250 full-time jobs. Nucor will build another mill in Frostproof, Fla., the company announced in March. Liberty Steel bought and is preparing to reopen a steel mill in Georgetown, S.C. The mill was shuttered by its previous owners in 2015. And Big River Steel is investing $1.2 billion to expand its Arkansas steel plant. U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt did not address the mysterious six mills in a second quarter conference call with investors Aug. 2. But Burditt affirmed Trump's support for the steel industry. ""We had an incredibly exciting visit form the president, and his daughter was there as well, and I can tell you the commitment that he has to steel is unprecedented, and the notion that this guy would blink, I think, is not going to happen,"" Burritt said. ""He knows this kind of unfairness should been taken care of long ago. He’s got us, he’s with us."" Trump said, ""U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills."" Between restarts, new mills and expansions, the steel industry has seen significant investment this year. But Trump is wrong. U.S. Steel is restarting two shuttered mills. Other companies are re-opening or building a few other mills. We rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF3440>],/factchecks/2018/aug/02/donald-trump/us-steel-not-opening-six-new-mills-donald-trump/

Has gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn been consistent on position to stop Foxconn deal?
","Gov. Scott Walker’s massive deal with Taiwan-based Foxconn has created a political debate that is, well, spirited. Proponents tout the 13,000 jobs Foxconn has said the operation will create; opponents cite the $4 billion in taxpayer incentives and the potential negative impact of the $10 billion electronics factory on the environment.   Foxconn has been a central point cited by the eight remaining Democrats vying in the Aug. 14, 2018 primary for the right to take on Walker in November. In some cases, their positions are hard to keep track of. That brings us to candidate Matt Flynn, a former state party chairman. In August 2017, as the deal awaited a final vote, Flynn wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said: ""In my view, the correct approach for Wisconsin is to remove Walker's desperation from the equation and focus in a professional way. Professional negotiators who have the good of the state in mind, rather than Walker's, should reopen the dialogue with Foxconn."" A month later, during an Oct. 12, 2017, interview with WisconsinEye host Steve Walters, Flynn had this to say about the Foxconn deal: ""I will live up to all contractual commitments. I’m not looking to somehow sabotage anything."" Hmm … that seems to conflict with Flynn’s more recent pledge that he will go to court to stop the deal. So, we’re rolling out our Flip-O-Meter -- and with it, our regular reminder: The Flip-O-Meter rates a person’s consistency on an issue, not whether any change is good or bad policy or politics. Has Flynn been consistent on whether he would seek to undo the Foxconn deal? Let’s take a look. Flynn’s Foxconn positions Our starting point is that quote from Oct. 12, 2017: ""I will live up to all contractual commitments. I’m not looking to somehow sabotage anything."" After that, his position appeared to shift, or did it really? Here is a look at various statements Flynn has made since then about Foxconn: December 23, 2017: In an interview posted by the Capital Times, Flynn said if he is elected, he will stop the state's Foxconn deal ""no matter what."" April 6, 2018: In a visit to Eau Claire, Flynn declared: ""That contract is one that I will end the minute I get into office through litigation."" He criticized the size of the subsidy, made claims about the company’s track record in China, and slammed Walker and Republicans for ""letting them take water out of Lake Michigan."" June 18, 2018: In a news release, Flynn said ""Walker got taken to the cleaners in the Foxconn deal,"" and then declared: ""Here's how I'll stop it with immediate litigation."" June 28, 2018: At a protest rally on the day of the Foxconn groundbreaking, Flynn said: ""It's an illegal contract and illegal contracts are not enforceable in the state of Wisconsin."" He also claimed the deal ""over the course of 15 years will bring the state close to bankruptcy if we want to fund our public schools and University of Wisconsin. It's a very crooked deal."" July 19, 2018: In a statement on the Forward with Flynn website, Flynn said ""The Foxconn deal is the worst economic development plan in history. It is also unconstitutional. As governor, I will bring litigation to rescind the contract on Day One. Foxconn can come here, but they will have to follow our laws and they will not get our tax dollars."" If anything, Flynn’s rhetoric has become sharper and clearer as the campaign has gone on. What does Flynn say? In a telephone interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Flynn said, ""my position on Foxconn is, and always has been, that that contract must be terminated."" He noted he has even run a TV ad stating he will ""stop this contract."" Flynn then sought to reconcile his past statements: ""From my August Op-Ed piece to the present, I have made it clear that until we a get a court order terminating the contract, we will live up to our commitments and will not surreptitiously sabotage this contract. … I want to legally break the contract by filing a lawsuit in federal court. I do not want to sabotage the deal by failing to live up to our commitments."" But that statement does not entirely add up. First, the August 2017 opinion piece in the Journal Sentinel does not mention a court order for terminating a contract or the state living up to its end of the bargain until it could be undone in the courts. In fact, the piece was written before the deal was approved by the Legislature. What’s more, the ""no sabotage"" statement came two months later, in the WisconsinEye interview. In that interview, Flynn said at least three times in response to questions that he would ""live up to contractual commitments"" and would not ""breach a contract"" with Foxconn. He also said ""going forward the state should know that I won’t be entering into these kinds of deals"" and of Foxconn said: ""If they don’t abide by their commitments I’ll take action on that."" Again, no mention was made of unilaterally undoing the Foxconn deal or the deal being illegal or unconstitutional on its face. The only reference that hinted at legal action suggested it might come if the company did not follow through on its commitments. Our rating While Flynn says otherwise, his public statements on the Foxconn deal have not been consistent. Before the deal was approved, he wanted to reopen it. Once it was approved, he indicated he would ""live up to contractual commitments"" and would not ""breach a contract."" More recently, he says the deal itself is ""illegal"" and ""unconstitutional"" and that he would stop the state's Foxconn deal ""no matter what."" We give Flynn a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F6F3C0>],/factchecks/2018/aug/02/matt-flynn/has-gubernatorial-candidate-matt-flynn-been-consis/

Ad targets HHS Secretary Alex Azar for 'generosity and charity' comment about immigrant children
","An ad targeting Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar portrays him as callously describing the situation with immigrant children at the border as ""one of the great acts of American generosity and charity."" Why go after Azar? As HHS secretary, he oversees the department that cares for children who were separated from their families by other agencies under the administration’s ""zero tolerance"" prosecution policy for all immigrants who illegally enter the United States. The ad from Equity Forward, which describes itself as a watchdog of anti-reproductive health groups and individuals, opens with the sound of wailing children, a photo of a chain-link fence, and video of women in lines with children (The Washington Post Fact Checker found that the families in the video were at a way station for families paroled from detention centers). It moves on to a photo of children standing near a white tent behind tall fences, followed by a photo and video of Azar. It ends with pictures of bunk beds, of tents and of Azar with President Donald Trump. Here’s the text: Narrator: ""They are terrified. Taken from their mothers and fathers and detained in cages. In Washington, Secretary Alex Azar is now in charge."" Azar: ""It is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids."" Narrator: ""Generosity? No, Secretary Azar. This is a disgrace. Call Congress, tell them to reunite these children with their parents and hold Azar accountable."" Great acts of American generosity?No, @SecAzar, what you’re doing is a disgrace. Tell Congress to hold @HHSGov Secretary Azar accountable for his role in the family separation crisis. https://t.co/uZWTWgkLT3 pic.twitter.com/MGeJaF9JZk We looked into it. Azar did offer a rosy assessment in an interview about children separated from their parents. But the ad neglects a striking amount of context, including what precipitated Azar’s remark and singling him out as ""in charge"" of the situation without offering specifics. The framing of the ad suggests Azar said the separation and detention of children was a generous and charitable thing."" It says he is ""in charge"" right after showing video of children and saying they were ""taken from their mothers and fathers and detained in cages."" Azar’s remark came July 10 as CNN’s Wolf Blitzer questioned him about media access to facilities keeping children, which are overseen by Azar’s agency. Azar said children deserve privacy and respect and ""we’ll be as transparent as possible, consistent with that."" Blitzer: ""They deserve that privacy. I’m just saying, we would guarantee that they would blur their faces. No one would see the kids’ faces. We just want to go in and do our job. If there is nothing to hide, I don’t see what the problem would be."" Azar: ""Wolf, we are happy to work, we want to be transparent. We have nothing to hide about how we operate these facilities, our grantees. It is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids who are smuggled into our country or come across illegally. So, we don’t have anything to hide about it. We just have to protect privacy."" ""We have nothing to hide about how we operate these facilities … it is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity, what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids"" HHS Secretary Alex Azar says https://t.co/FMtVbt3AsB pic.twitter.com/YEfLIpgMRg Azar lauded workers caring for the children and said the kids were ""happy,"" ""loved"" and in a ""compassionate environment."" Azar wasn’t lauding the charity of family separations. ""What they have done is conflate the secretary's statement with the policy,"" HHS spokesman Mark Weber said. ""The secretary's statement was in the context of the care HHS provides to the children once they get to us."" Equity Forward executive director Mary Alice Carter said the point of the ad was to show administrative failures with Azar as secretary. The group also said there were reports of children going hungry at some facilities and of children ""subject to other harsh rules and conditions."" ""During his CNN interview, Azar claimed that all of these locations have kids that are ‘happy’ and ‘getting snacks,'"" Carter said. ""With this ad, Equity Forward is highlighting the fact that some of these facilities are tents on military bases behind massive fence enclosures. Azar and the administration never had a plan to reunite the children with their families."" The ad's narrator also said children were ""detained in cages,"" but the ad did not illustrate that. (See our coverage offering context on claims about caged children.) Claims about cages holding children have generally being in reference to detention centers operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security — not HHS, which Azar oversees. Instead of cages, the ad used photos of tents. Tents in Texas are being used as temporary shelters for teen minors who were separated at the border and who arrived alone, Weber said. For a small proportion of children in HHS care, Weber said, tents in Tornillo, Texas, are the last stop before reunification or release to a suitable sponsor.  ""To suggest (separated children) were all sent to a tent city is false,"" Weber said. Overall, HHS currently has more than 11,000 children in its custody across 100 facilities in 17 states. The number of children in its custody fluctuates as they are transferred in and out of HHS care, but the overwhelming majority came alone without their parents.

Azar made that comment in reference to the care provided at facilities. He wasn’t saying that specifically about the ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy or family separations. Equity Forward told PolitiFact the point of its ad was to highlight shortcomings in the policy’s implementation and issues at some facilities, and the fact that some facilities are tents. Yet the ad said children were in cages and insinuated that Azar was in charge of the separations and the treatment of children. Azar does lead the department that has custody over the children, but the separations are a result of prosecution referrals from Homeland Security to the Justice Department.

Gwen Graham lacks proof that Florida Gov. Rick Scott covered up Mosaic sinkhole
","Gwen Graham says Florida needs a governor who will fight to protect clean water, unlike, she said, Gov. Rick Scott. ""When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up. I worked with the press to expose the secret sinkhole and hold Scott accountable,"" she tweeted July 18. Graham is one of five Democrats seeking the party’s nomination in the Aug. 28 primary to replace Scott, who is term-limited and running for U.S. Senate. Graham’s tweet linked to a 2016 Politico article in which Graham, then a congresswoman, was quoted blasting the state over its handling of a sinkhole at Mosaic’s Polk County phosphate plant. Here’s what Graham’s tweet has a point about: Scott’s administration, more specifically the Department of Environmental Protection, kept quiet about the sinkhole for weeks, later saying it didn’t know it was a sinkhole. But she went too far in stating that Scott himself ""tried to cover it up."" Her tweet also leaves out the actions Scott took once he did learn about the sinkhole. On Sept. 15, 2016, WFLA-Channel 8 broke the story about the sinkhole, which was the first time Mosaic commented about it publicly. The next day, WFLA reported that the Florida Department of Environmental Protection knew about the sinkhole but did not disclose it to the public. The 45-foot-wide sinkhole opened underneath a gypsum stack at a Mosaic phosphate fertilizer plant, dumping at least 215 million gallons of contaminated water into the Floridan aquifer over three weeks. Mosaic workers became aware of the leak on Aug. 27 and notified the department on Aug. 28. State inspectors arrived within 24 hours. Their initial report didn’t use the word ""sinkhole,"" but ""water loss incident."" Environmentalists and the media called for more transparency by the state government. But state law at the time did not require the department to inform the public about a spill into the aquifer if it had not spread off-site. DEP officials described their response to the spill as going ""above and beyond the requirements of Florida law by working with Mosaic to notify the nearest adjacent home­owners who may want their drinking water wells tested."" Jon Steverson, DEP secretary at the time, said he didn't know it was a sinkhole, which was why he didn't tell Gov. Rick Scott about it until Sept. 16, 2016, the day after it hit the news. (Scott’s office confirmed to PolitiFact that he learned about it on that day.) ""I knew at the time in late August that there was a water loss incident,"" Steverson told reporters weeks later. ""I was not aware of the sinkhole until a much later point in time."" Not announcing the incident, which was allowed under the law at the time, is not the same as a ""cover up,"" which could imply that state officials and Scott schemed to hide the information. Mosaic apologized for not notifying the public sooner. Once Scott was notified, he took action during the next couple of weeks. Responding to criticism from Graham at the time, Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz told the Tampa Bay Times that Scott had directed the DEP to expedite its investigation and asked the Florida Department of Health to work with DEP to ensure drinking water was safe. Scott initially defended his agency by saying state law didn’t require DEP to notify anyone unless the pollution left Mosaic’s property. ""Within 24 hours after they (the DEP) were notified, they started the investigation,'' Scott said Sept. 22. ""If somebody's done anything wrong, we're going to hold them accountable.'' But days later, Scott declared the law ""outdated"" and announced a temporary emergency rule that included 24-hour public notification requirements. He also vowed to propose legislation for the upcoming session that would make such a policy permanent. ""I am demanding any business, county or city government responsible for a pollution incident to immediately tell the public,"" Scott said. ""That is common sense and our residents deserve that."" A judge later said that the Legislature would have to set such a rule change, and it did just that in 2017 when it unanimously passed a bill signed into law by Scott. Steverson, who was Scott’s pick to lead the department, quit a few months after news about the sinkhole broke.  Scott’s spokesman said Scott didn’t ask Steverson to step down. Mosaic said repairs were completed in June 2018. The state is reviewing the company’s report to ensure all repairs were effectively completed. After the story came out, Graham spread the word about it through statements to the media. Graham criticized the state’s response, called for an investigation and filed public records requests to Scott’s office and the environment protection department seeking electronic communications about the sinkhole. She received hundreds of pages of materials, but the communication between state officials was largely after the news broke. Graham raised questions about why the emails between state officials didn’t begin earlier. ""If this is the sum total of the communication that went on between DEP and the governor’s office over this massive potential contamination,"" Graham said, ""Florida families have a lot to be concerned about."" In her tweet’s accompanying Politico story, she was more nuanced about Scott’s role. ""I don’t know which is worse,"" Graham said in 2016. ""Either Gov. Rick Scott knew about the sinkhole and didn’t inform the public, or leadership at the Department of Environmental Protection is so irresponsible they didn’t alert the governor to a potential public health disaster."" Graham spokesman Matt Harringer didn’t point to any evidence that Scott himself had covered up the sinkhole, as her tweet indicates, but said his administration did and that the buck stops with the governor. ""It is completely fair to use ‘Rick Scott’ and ‘his administration’ synonymously,"" Harringer said. ""The governor is the ultimate head of the Department of Environmental Protection — and often takes credit for their actions."" Our review of her comments found that she more often pointed the finger more broadly at Scott’s administration or the Department of Environmental Protection. On Facebook in September 2016 she wrote: ""Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants — but the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has tried to keep a toxic sinkhole secret from the public. That's just wrong."" On an April 2018 press release on her campaign website she wrote, ""Graham has a record of holding Scott accountable for polluting Florida’s waters. In 2016, she launched a public records investigation to expose his administration’s role in covering up a toxic sinkhole."" But the July 18 tweet was not the only time that she blamed Scott for a cover up. The environment page on her campaign website states, ""When a massive toxic sinkhole opened up in Central Florida and state regulators tried to cover it up, Gwen fought for the public to know by exposing Governor Scott’s secrecy."" Graham said, ""When a sinkhole began dumping toxic water in Florida's aquifer, Rick Scott tried to cover it up."" She exaggerates by stating that Scott tried to cover up the sinkhole. News reports show that the head of the environmental protection department didn’t inform Scott until the media reported about it, which happened about three weeks after the sinkhole started. The department does not earn good marks for transparency: It initially labeled the sinkhole as a ""water loss incident"" and did not inform the public right away. But Graham goes too far in calling it an attempted cover up. Not announcing the incident was allowed under the law at the time. Graham’s tweet went further than past statements about the issue by squarely blaming Scott. The quick jab does not account for actions he took after he learned about the sinkhole, including an emergency order to change the notification rule and calling for a permanent law change about public notification (which he signed). Graham’s campaign now says that blaming Scott himself for the cover up is the same as blaming the administration. But the tweet should have been more precise. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096870200>],/factchecks/2018/aug/01/gwen-graham/gwen-graham-lacks-proof-florida-gov-rick-scott-tri/

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez overplays defense budget increase
","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist who beat incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in a New York primary race, has some ideas on how to finance programs that she supports, such as Medicare for All. In a recent interview with the Daily Show’s Trevor Noah, she said Congress should cut frivolous defense spending to pay for a wider social safety net. ""Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for,"" Ocasio-Cortez said July 26. ""They were like, we don’t want another fighter jet! Don’t give us another nuclear bomb. They didn’t even ask for it. And we gave it to them."" Did the military get a $700 billion dollar raise — that they didn’t even ask for? First off, Ocasio-Cortez fudged the figures, which her campaign acknowledged in an email. Congress gave the military a $61 billion increase from fiscal year 2017 to 2018. The total military budget for 2018 was $700 billion. That includes the Department of Defense and elements of other agencies, chiefly Energy Department programs pertaining to nuclear weapons. For 2018, that’s more money than President Donald Trump’s budget requested (roughly $668 billion). The 2019 spending level, $716 billion, is exactly what Trump requested. Through its Office of Management and Budget, the White House negotiates with the Defense Department to determine a budget. But settling at a lower number doesn’t mean military leaders don’t want more money, said Susanna Blume, senior fellow of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. In addition to the budget, each military branch (Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force) submits an annual list to Congress of items they want but were not able to include in the annual budget request for perceived lack of budgetary wiggle room. That wish list would have pushed the budget request to $700 billion in 2018. When Defense Secretary James Mattis testified before the House Armed Services Committee on Feb. 6, 2018, he echoed that request. (The fiscal year 2018 budget became law March 23.) ""Failure to modernize our military risks leaving us with a force that could dominate the last war but be irrelevant to tomorrow's security,"" Mattis said. ""We need Congress to lift the defense spending caps and support the budget for our military of $700 billion for this fiscal year and $716 billion for next fiscal year."" Obama usually requested more money than Congress granted (unlike Trump, whose proposed 2018 budget was upped by Congress). But Blume said it’s not unusual for things to shake out in this way, either. Ocasio-Cortez said, ""Just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn’t even ask for."" That’s the total defense budget for 2018, which marks an increase in $61 billion from 2017. (Her campaign acknowledged this point.) It is more than the Defense Department settled in negotiations for Trump’s budget request ($668 billion), but exactly what they requested in their annual wishlist to Congress.

This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The UN report said the organization’s population division monitors fertility, mortality and migration trends for all countries of the world, as a basis for its official population estimates and projections. Due to two prominent trends — population decline and population aging — it conducted a study to address whether replacement migration is a solution to those issues. Replacement migration is defined as ""the international migration that would be needed to offset declines in the size of population and declines in the population of working age, as well as to offset the overall ageing of a population."" It analyzed six replacement migration scenarios for eight low-fertility countries, including the United States, and for two regions, Europe and the European Union.

Press releases in six different languages accompanied the UN report, countering Infowars’ headline claiming that a ""plan"" had been ""revealed"" just recently. Infowars did not respond to requests for comment.

Did wages fall by 1.8 percent after Donald Trump's tax cut?
","Democrats have countered President Donald Trump’s message of positive economic growth by trying to highlight parts of the economy that haven’t been so strong on his watch. Recently, Democrats found a potent example: wage stagnation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was among a number of Democrats and liberal groups that shared this assertion about wages following the passage of Trump’s tax cut. On July 26, she tweeted a link to a Vox.com article, adding: Paul Ryan on June 24th: ""Wages are rising.""

Reality: ""Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent."" Paul Ryan on June 24th: ""Wages are rising.""Reality: ""Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent."" 👇https://t.co/ltygIwhFGv Others who tweeted the same talking point included the Democratic Governors Association and the Fight for 15 coalition, which pushes for a higher minimum wage. The talking point about plummeting wages is at best outdated, given the release of new information. In addition, the data cited is not one of several official measurements, and it appears to be a statistical outlier. The statistic reached its widest audience after Vox published an article citing it July 23. The finding was previously noted in a Bloomberg column July 18 and, even earlier, in a CBS News article July 11. The first thing to know is that the wage data in question did not come from longstanding government statistical series. Rather, it came from the PayScale Index, a calculation made by a private group. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a problematic source, but it does mean that it needs to be weighed against the wage statistics compiled by the federal government, which are considered the gold standard. When the 1.8 percent decline first hit the media, official statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were not available for that same quarter — the second quarter of 2018. However, by the time Democrats and their allies began tweeting about the PayScale data, the second-quarter BLS data had become publicly available. When we looked at a standard BLS measurement for wages — median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers — we found that this measurement actually rose slightly between the first and second quarter of 2018, from $350 a week to $351 a week. That's an increase of less than three tenths of 1 percent, rather than down by 1.8 percent. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, suggested three additional BLS statistics to consult: average hourly earnings for all private employees; hourly earnings for manufacturing; and the employment cost index for private industry workers. Burtless adjusted each of these statistics for inflation and created an index showing how much each of the four wage measures had increased since the end of 2007. (In his system, the final data point of 2007 is pegged at 100, with any subsequent number above 100 showing how much it rose compared to the 2007 reference point.) Here’s his final graph. Key: Blue = average real hourly earnings of all private employers; red = hourly earnings for manufacturing; green = median usual weekly real earnings for full-time wage and salary workers; purple = employment cost index: wages and salaries for private industry. Generally speaking, the four BLS statistics have moved in tandem, showing wage increases above inflation since 2014, with a bit of a slowdown since 2016. At worst, wages are going sideways or moving slightly higher in the most recent quarter — not suddenly crashing, as the PayScale data indicated. ""I don’t think there’s any evidence I would trust that inflation-adjusted wages have declined noticeably, either over the entire Trump administration or in the period since Congress passed the new tax law,"" Burtless said. Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, concurred. ""It’s certainly fair to say real wages are not rising rapidly, and depending on the index chosen and the exact time period, they could even be falling slightly, but there is no plausible story where they fell 1.8 percent between the first and second quarter,"" Baker said. A spokesman for Pelosi said the tweet -- which was written by staff, not Pelosi -- ""quotes word for word"" from the Vox article and attached the link ""for full context and openness."" PayScale, for its part, acknowledges that comparing the PayScale Index to other BLS statistics ""is comparing apples to pears."" In a blog post, the company’s chief economist and vice president of data analytics, Katie Bardaro, wrote that the PayScale Index is designed to capture how workers’ wages change as they switch companies, while a BLS measure like the Employment Cost Index does not. She concluded, ""Be careful of spurious comparisons of distinct measures and be sure to understand the underlying methodology of any metric you bring into your data arsenal."" Pelosi tweeted, ""Between the first and second quarters of 2018 — after the tax cuts were enacted — real wages fell by 1.8 percent."" There's a grain of truth, in that one unofficial measurement did produce that finding. But it is an outlier. Official statistics contradicted that, showing stable or modestly rising wages. Those were available before the recent social media traffic.

Defending hog farms, Steve Troxler says North Carolina river among cleanest in the state
","If hog farms were wrecking the environment in eastern North Carolina, a local river would be more polluted. That was the logic behind a recent statement by Steve Troxler, the state’s agriculture commissioner since 2005. Troxler was among several Republicans to speak at a rally on July 10 in Duplin County, in rural Eastern North Carolina. They attended the event to denounce a court ruling against Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer and a partner of many N.C. hog farmers. A jury recently awarded $25 million to an Eastern North Carolina couple after they complained that a Smithfield farm caused swarms of flies, bad smells and other nuisances on their property. Troxler called the ruling ""un-American"" and ""a travesty of justice."" And he expressed doubt about the extent of damage that hog farms cause. ""The Black River starts in Sampson County, runs through Duplin County right through hog country. And the water quality in that river is rated at the very top in North Carolina,"" Troxler said. ""Now, how can that be with all of the stories you’ve heard about environmental disasters associated with the hog industry in North Carolina? It’s just not true,"" he continued. ""But I think it goes back to the old adage that if you say it enough times, it must be true. So we have got to disprove that. We’ve got to educate, and we’ve got to talk about it."" During hurricanes and other big storms, hog waste sometimes runs into rivers in Eastern North Carolina. Farmers keep the waste in lagoons, or ponds, often to use for fertilizer. The lagoons can overflow during floods. The Black River is a 50-mile-long tributary of the Cape Fear River, which last year was ranked as one of America’s ""most endangered"" by the American Rivers environmental advocacy group. The group listed the threat of pollution from hog farms as their reason for concern. So PolitiFact wondered about the accuracy of Troxler’s claim about the Black River. Is its water quality ""rated at the very top"" in North Carolina? A state classification In an email, a spokeswoman for the state Agriculture Department cited Black River’s classification with the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality. The river is classified as a swamp that has ""outstanding resource water,"" meaning it has ""excellent water quality"" while ""being of exceptional state or national ecological or recreational significance."" It’s the highest classification the state offers. And only 900 of the 13,000 water bodies that DEQ examines — about 7 percent — have that label, according to Christy Simmons, a spokeswoman for DEQ. The department measures dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductivity, water temperature, total suspended solids, turbidity and fecal coliform, among other things. Fecal coliform bacteria come from warm-blooded animals. While coliform bacteria won’t necessarily make you sick, their presence can be a sign the water is home to harmful pathogens. At two stations in the Black River, fecal coliform is elevated about 10 percent of the time, according to DEQ. The Black River doesn’t violate any of the department’s quality standards. However, DEQ doesn’t collect fecal coliform data frequently enough to assess the extent that fecal coliform growth exists and fluctuates in the river, DEQ spokeswoman Bridget Munger said. The ""true standard"" for measuring fecal coliform levels is to take five samples in a 30-day period, she said, but DEQ collects data only once a month. The lower part of the Black River ""is listed as data inconclusive due to low dissolved oxygen levels in this part of the river system,"" Munger said in an email. PolitiFact asked DEQ whether the Black River is, indeed, ranked as one of the state’s cleanest rivers. ""I don’t think we have the data to make this specific claim,"" Munger said. ""It doesn’t violate the water quality standards set for this stream. There are elevated nutrients and fecal coliform bacteria concentrations at times,"" Munger said. ""There is only a single major (wastewater treatment plant) upstream of the Black River but there are many animal feeding operations in the Black River watershed."" Lack of testing Thus, environmental advocates say the Black River’s ""outstanding resource water"" classification isn’t a true reflection of the river’s water quality. Part of the reason DEQ hasn’t found more pollution in the Black River is because it’s not properly looking for it and reporting it, said Grady McCallie, policy director at North Carolina Conservation Network. North Carolina doesn’t have standards for nitrogen and phosphorus in the water — which can cause illness. ""If we did, I suspect a lot of the rivers in hog country would show significant burdens of these pollutants. Because we don’t, we rely on chlorophyll-a, a pigment associated with algae, as a marker for too much nutrient pollution,"" McCallie said in an email. The problem with testing for that kind of algae is that it blooms only when the water slows down, he continued. ""That’s why you see significant impairment behind (a dam) on the Cape Fear, because the water slows down and the algae blooms. But as long as the Black River keeps flowing, the pollution is just carried down the river to cause problems downstream,"" McCallie said. Compounding issues, the state isn’t testing for a wide enough range of nutrients. ""Lots of nutrient pollution in the river could be messing up the ecology, but we also don’t have a ‘periphyton’ standard, which would measure whether we have the right kinds or too much algae on the bank and bottom of the river,"" McCallie said. ""EPA had previously recommended that North Carolina develop one, but we haven’t."" ‘Hogwash’ Michael Mallin, a research professor at UNC-Wilmington, has conducted research on eastern NC rivers and co-authored the 2016 report ""Environmental Assessment of the Lower Cape Fear River System."" At the time, Mallin noted high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus at three sites in the Black River. Mallin checks the nutrients monthly and ""often"" finds nitrogen and phosphorus levels to be higher than the level that scientists would consider healthy, he said in a phone interview. He called the Black River’s ORW classification ""outdated."" Ryke Longest, director of the Duke Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, went a step further. ""But the claim that this proves there are no water quality problems caused by hog farms is pure hogwash,"" Longest said in an email. ""The truth is the Black River may be much more polluted than we know because it lacks sufficient monitoring stations to check its status."" Longest, McCallie and Will Hendrick, staff attorney for the N.C. Waterkeeper Alliance, scoffed at Troxler’s suggestion that hog waste isn’t affecting the Black River and that the river’s water quality is among the state’s best. ""What Troxler is saying is that because it’s classified at the top, its quality is at the top. But just because you say the quality should be good at this place doesn’t mean it is,"" Hendrick said. ""It has the ORW classification. But that says nothing at all about the current water quality. Period."" Our rating Troxler cast doubt on the effect of hog farms, saying the Black River’s water ""is rated at the very top in North Carolina."" While the Black River has an ""outstanding"" designation with the state, its environmental regulatory agency says the label doesn’t mean the river is one of the cleanest in the state. And experts say the state probably would find other harmful nutrients — if only it tested for them. We rate Troxler’s claim Half True.

Misleading headline suggests McCaskill personally routed tax dollars to husband's businesses
","A recent clickbait headline claimed Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was ""busted"" for routing millions of tax dollars into the pocket of her husband, business investor Joseph Shepard. Affordable housing projects in which Shepard has invested have received millions in federal subsidies during McCaskill’s two terms in office. But this headline spins the narrative in a way that could mislead readers — by making Shepard’s business success appear more nefarious than what has been reported. ""Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby,"" said a July 25 headline from Patriot Beat, a conservative website. The story quoted directly from a Breitbart News article, which in turn cited original reporting from the Kansas City Star. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) ""Well, well, well, with a tight election coming up, Senator Claire McCaskill does not need a ‘scandal’ to crop up,"" the Patriot Beat story said above its repost of the Breitbart News story. ""However, that’s precisely what’s happened — and it’s a doozy … According to a new report, McCaskill has funneled her husband $131 million in federal subsidies."" While the Breitbart story relies on the Kansas City Star report, the Kansas City Star’s research does not support the implications embedded in the inflammatory Patriot Beat headline. Its loaded words, such as ""busted"" and ""funneling,"" paint what could very well be a total coincidence as a deliberate attempt by McCaskill to profit off of taxpayer money. Other headlines — such as the Kansas City Star’s ""Businesses linked to McCaskill’s husband get $131 million in federal dollars"" — were more precise. Here’s what actually happened. A July 24 analysis from the Kansas City Star revealed that businesses linked to Shepard have received approximately $131 million in federal subsidies since McCaskill took office in 2007. Specifically, government-subsidized housing projects in which Shepard has invested were awarded $62 million and $69 million during McCaskill’s first and second terms, respectively. The businesses Shepard has invested in participate in affordable housing programs through both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The USDA program subsidizes low-cost rental housing in rural areas for domestic farm laborers and low-income, disabled or elderly people. The federal subsidies compensate property owners on behalf of tenants who otherwise would not be capable of affording their full rent. Meanwhile, the HUD program contractually obligates private landlords and developers to reserve some housing units for cheap rental, and the subsidies again help to pay off part of the rent. Although Shepard gets only a fraction of each federal award as income — most of each subsidy contributes to covering operating costs for the projects — the Kansas City Star report noted that his personal income grew during McCaskill’s two terms in the Senate, from between $1,608 and $16,731 in 2006 to between $365,374 and $1,118,158 in 2017. According to the Kansas City Star’s analysis, ""a growing percentage of Shepard’s personal earnings come from new businesses he has invested in that are receiving federal awards, primarily rural rental assistance through the USDA."" The Kansas City Star also made clear, however, that there is ""no evidence that McCaskill played any part in directing federal funds to businesses affiliated with her husband."" McCaskill has voted for some omnibus spending bills that would have benefited affordable housing programs, but she has voted against others. She also does not sit on the Senate committees with jurisdiction over HUD and USDA, where she could have had more influence. Additionally, the Kansas City Star report noted that Shepard is now just a limited partner with most of the federally subsidized housing projects in which he invests. This means that he does not control day-to-day operations or the distribution of profits. The report also specified that Shepard’s investments in affordable housing predated his 2002 marriage with McCaskill. A spokesman for Shepard’s company, Sugar Creek, told the Kansas City Star that the company is involved with fewer government housing projects now than before Shepard married. Similar articles detailing subsidies provided to Shepard’s businesses also surfaced in 2012. ""Claire's work in the Senate has absolutely nothing to do with her husband's business investments,"" said Meira Bernstein, McCaskill campaign spokeswoman. Patriot Beat did not respond to a request for comment. A misleading headline said, ""Shock report: Senator McCaskill busted funneling millions of tax dollars to her hubby."" The article cited research from a credible newspaper — the Kansas City Star — showing that since McCaskill took office, her husband has seen his income increase at least in part because of federal subsidies awarded to housing projects that he has invested in.

Facebook graphic misrepresents Trump's $12 billion aid package to farmers after China tariffs
","President Donald Trump has recently faced criticism for his decision to authorize $12 billion in programs to assist farmers hurt by tariffs. One critic of that decision was The Other 98% in a Facebook post. The graphic in the post reads: ""Trump just gave a $12 billion bailout to farmers hurt by his failed tariffs. This will cost every household in the U.S. $95. And by the way, Trump is borrowing the money from China since his tax cuts blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit. Does this feel like winning yet?""     The post has generated a lot of discussion on Facebook — more than 43,000 reactions and 126,000 shares — so we decided to fact-check it. It turns out that the post distorts information about how the aid package is being funded. Let’s break down each claim in the graphic, one by one.   ""$12 billion bailout""  It’s true that U.S. Department of Agriculture did recently ""authorize up to $12 billion in programs,"" according to a recent press release. That money is meant to help farmers who were hurt as a result of China increasing its tariffs in retaliation to Trump’s increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. However, one expert we reached out to took issue with the emergency aid package being dubbed a ""bailout."" ""I would not use the term ‘bailout’ … since the term connotes the recipients will be compensated for actions they took,"" said Steve Suppan, a senior policy analyst at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. In the past, we’ve referred to monetary aid packages to Wall Street entities and the auto industry as ""bailouts."" That’s because those companies were being compensated for risky mistakes they made.   But unlike those Wall Street workers and automobile companies, ""farmers did not initiate the U.S. tariffs that triggered the Chinese and other tariffs,"" Suppan said. ""This will cost every household in the U.S. $95""  In tackling this claim, we began with a bit of math. Trump’s relief package authorizes up to $12 billion of aid. Divided by the 126 million U.S. households (as reported by the market and consumer data website Statista.com), that works out to roughly $95 per household. So from a very simple standpoint, the math checks out. But the experts we talked to agreed that the $95-per-household figure has its limits, and won’t affect every taxpayer the same.  ""The $12 billion must either come from reduced government spending, higher taxes or increased debt,"" said Aaron Smith, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. ""Increased debt suggests that future households will pay for it in the form of higher taxes, reduced spending or higher inflation. Households pay tax at different rates and they would be affected differently by … what, if any, reductions in spending occurred."" Brian Wright, a professor of agricultural economics at University of California, Berkeley, agreed that the monetary burden is likely to be distributed unevenly. He told us it will probably ""fall more on the younger part of the population (since they) will have to deal with the deficit for some time."" ""Trump is borrowing the money from China""  From there, the post gets more interesting. Would the package spurred by Chinese retaliatory tariffs be financed by money borrowed from China? The USDA press release specified that the authority required to administer and fund the aid package comes from a piece of legislation known as the Community Credit Corporation Charter Act. The Community Credit Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury for this purpose, an amount that more than covers the $12 billion aid package. The Facebook group may have been referring to the fact that China holds the most Treasury securities of any foreign country. Treasury securities can be purchased by both individuals and other entities, like foreign governments. When someone purchases a Treasury bond or a note, they’re agreeing to hand over their money to the federal government in return for being handed back that same amount at a later date. In between their initial purchase of the bond or note, the purchaser is paid interest at a predetermined rate.    Because these debt obligations are backed by the U.S. government, many foreign countries purchase a large amount of Treasury securities, since they’re relatively safe investments. China, in particular, buys them in order to depreciate its own currency and make its exports cheaper. But it’s inaccurate to suggest the aid package is financed specifically by Chinese purchases of Treasury securities. That’s because the revenues generated from bond sales ""go into the general fund that finances all U.S. government activity,"" said Suppan, the trade policy analyst. Meanwhile, there’s another logical flaw to consider.   ""It can't be that current households will pay for this bailout and the money will come from increased borrowing from China,"" Smith of UC-Davis said. ""It must be one or the other.""   Trump’s ""tax cuts blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit""  After looking at the Congressional Budget Office’s records of the federal deficit by year, we found this claim to be inaccurate.  The last time the federal deficit exceeded one trillion was in 2012, when it was $1.087 trillion. The CBO projects that the 2018 deficit will be $804 billion. That’s a step up from 2017’s deficit, which was $665.4 billion.   In saying that Trump’s tax cut legislation ""blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit,"" it’s likely that The Other 98% was referring to a report released by the CBO after the legislation was passed that projected the deficit would rise to over $1 trillion by 2020.  But that hasn’t happened yet, so the post is imprecise in using the past tense when saying that the tax cuts ""blew"" a ""hole in the deficit."" The Other 98% did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A recent Facebook post calls Trump’s recent announcement of an emergency aid package to farmers a ""bailout."" It also claims that the package will cost each household $95, and Trump borrowed money to finance it from China because his tax cuts left a trillion dollar hole in the deficit. The USDA did recently announce a $12 billion aid package for farmers, but some would consider the labeling of it as a ""bailout"" to be misleading since farmers were not responsible for the tariffs and other factors that led to the aid package being necessary. It’s also not fair to declare that the package would cost each household $95, since different households pay taxes at different rates. In addition, the government isn’t directly borrowing the money to finance the aid package from China. They’re borrowing the money from the U.S. Treasury. China buys and owns Treasury securities, but those securities have a very remote connection to the aid package. Lastly, the federal deficit hasn’t been over $1 trillion since 2012. The CBO doesn’t project it to be over $1 trillion until 2020. We rate the claims in the post Mostly False.

Jim Sensenbrenner says Scott Walker opposed the massive 1998 transportation bill
","
If a Mark Neumann TV ad in response to a Scott Walker TV ad is the political equivalent of tit-for-tat, what do you call a response to the response?

In this case, more confusion for voters.

The ad in question is a radio spot by Walker that features U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, talking about a 1998 transportation spending bill that has become a central issue in the GOP gubernatorial primary.

Neumann, in Congress at the time, voted for it. Sensenbrenner opposed it -- and says Walker, then a state lawmaker, opposed it, too.

""Let me set the record straight,"" Sensenbrenner says in the 60-second spot.""I served with Mark Neumann. Mark Neumann voted for $9 billion in pork projects when he was in Congress. He voted yes for wasteful transportation spending. I voted against that bill because it was full of waste and payoffs to special interests. Like me, Scott Walker opposed the bill and the $9 billion of wasteful spending.""

So does the blunt-talking Sensenbrenner set the record straight? Hardly.

Neumann did vote for the bill but argues Walker was way off base to link him to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi based on that vote. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the connection False.  In his counter-ad, Neumann says Walker supported the bill at the time. We rated that Barely True -- Walker publicly supported a provision of the measure relating to how some $241 million in federal money for the area could be spent, not the whole bill.

We turned to the Sensenbrenner to ask for support for his statement. His longtime chief of staff, Tom Schreibel, referred us to Walker, saying they got the information from him. Jill Bader, Walker’s campaign spokeswoman, said the basis was Walker’s own recollection this week.

""We had a conversation with Scott in which Scott recalled opposing the bill,"" Bader said.

Neither Bader nor Schreibel could identify any public statements from the time indicating Walker’s opposition to the bill.

In fact, the only public statements that have surfaced are the ones related to a provision in the bill authored by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Fond du Lac. That change allowed money set aside mainly for a proposed light rail system to go to freeway reconstruction projects. Walker joined five other state lawmakers representing Milwaukee County in applauding that piece of it.

Any other evidence?

Schreibel said it’s common in Washington for lawmakers to support an amendment to a bill, but vote against the final product: ""The pig's ears might be cute, but do you want to buy the whole pig?""

And Bader suggested that because Sensenbrenner was Walker’s congressman, he would have supported Sensenbrenner’s position.

That’s all as much of a reach as the original move by Walker to tie Neumann to Pelosi.

So far the only information on the record from the time shows Walker supported at least a portion the bill. It’s possible that more evidence will surface to back up Sensenbrenner’s claim that Walker joined him in opposing the bill. But for now we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978C57C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/11/jim-sensenbrenner/jim-sensenbrenner-says-scott-walker-opposed-massiv/
"['Iraq', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Rep. Ron Paul says that 4,400 Americans were killed in Iraq, 30,000 wounded and more than 100,000 suffering from PTSD due to the Iraq War
","
From the Oval Office where President George W. Bush announced the United States would invade Iraq, Barack Obama said Aug. 31 that ""the American combat mission in Iraq has ended. Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country."" 
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside, who opposed the Iraq war from the start, was unimpressed, saying in a Sept. 1 statement that the war cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars and many casualties. 
""Forty-four hundred Americans are dead, 30,000 severely wounded, and more than 100,000 are suffering from serious health problems related to post traumatic stress syndrome,"" Paul said. ""This alone should tell us that it was not worth the investment and the needless sacrifice of our young people and the taxpayers."" 
We're not weighing the worthiness of the investment. But we wondered whether Paul correctly recapped the conflict's toll of U.S. dead and wounded. 
Rachel Mills, Paul's press secretary, first pointed us to data on U.S. casualties in Iraq kept by GlobalSecurity.org, a nonpartisan company that specializes in information about defense, the military, weapons of mass destruction and homeland security. 
As of December 2009, 4,287 American troops were killed in Iraq, according to GlobalSecurity, which relies on the U.S. Department of Defense for such data. ""There are at least several hundred contractor deaths,"" Mills said, citing a Wikipedia web page. ""So, the 4,400 American dead is spot on."" 
We checked with the Defense Department, which updates daily the number of U.S. casualties and wounded military personnel as a result of the Iraq war. As of Sept. 3, 4,408 American troops had died as a part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, including casualties that occurred in the Arabian Sea and Saudi Arabia, among related locations. Include civilian casualties and the department's death toll totals 4,421. Of them, 3,492 were killed in action. 
About 31,930 troops had been wounded in action by the same date, according to the Defense Department. But were those troops ""severely wounded,"" as Paul says? More than half — 17,953 — were returned to duty within 72 hours, according to department. 
John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity, told us: ""I don't know if you can gauge the meaning of severe,"" but agreed that if a combatant returns to duty within 72 hours, their injuries probably aren't. 
Next, we turned to Paul's reference to post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Mills of Paul's office first cited a June 7 post on CNN.com per a study by Army researchers finding that up to 31 percent of soldiers returning from combat in Iraq experience PTSD or depression. The researchers analyzed mental health surveys taken from more than 13,000 Army and National Guard service members between 2004 and 2007, both three and 12 months after they returned to the United States. 
Mills also referred to a April 2005 Salon.com story — posted on GlobalSecurity.org — about how many U.S. soldiers have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11. ""Well over 1 million U.S. troops have fought in the wars since Sept. 11, 2001, according to Pentagon data released to Salon,"" according to the story. 
""So if 31 percent came back with PTSD, than that would be over 300,000,"" Mills said. But that calculation includes U.S. troops who were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, while Paul's statement is limited to returnees from Iraq. 
Elaine Lainez, a spokeswoman at the Defense Department, told us there have been 65,784 cases of PTSD among troops who served in both wars, far less than the total cited by Paul for Iraq alone. Lainez said that service members are diagnosed with PTSD after having ""at least two outpatient visits or one or more hospitalizations."" 
However, the Department of Veteran Affairs, which has a looser criteria for assessing PTSD cases, pegs the toll much higher. Jessica Jacobsen, a spokeswoman at the Dallas division of the department, told us that as of March 31, a total 162,050 veterans were seen at a VA clinic for potential PTSD following their return from Iraq or Afghanistan. Jacobsen said she couldn't tell how many are suffering from serious health problems, as Paul says, because the severity of each veteran's condition is a ""case-by-case account."" 
Evan Kanter, a psychiatrist at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System who specializes in the health effects of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the Defense Department's records are ""a very limited source."" He also called the VA's estimate — more than 100,000 — a ""very conservative number."" 
Pike agreed, because the VA doesn't count those who never report symptoms that could be related to PTSD. 
Kanter pointed us to a 2008 study by the RAND Corp., which estimates that approximately 300,000 of 1.64 million troops who deployed for the Afghanistan or Iraq wars suffer from PTSD. RAND based its conclusion on a telephone study of 1,965 previously deployed troops, finding that 14 percent screened positive for PTSD. 
The definitive number on how many troops have suffered from the disorder? 
""Who knows?"" Pike said. ""If you think you've got yourself a hard and fast number, you haven't studied it long enough."" Pike said Paul is ""definitely in the ballpark."" 
Where does that leave us? 
True, more than 4,400 Americans are dead as a result of the Iraq War. Also true: about 30,000 military personnel had been wounded as of September — though Paul's statement that all of them were ""severely"" injured isn't supported by Department of Defense data indicating more than half returned to active duty within 72 hours. Paul's office had no immediate comment when we followed up on this point. 
Quantifying how many people are suffering from PTSD is trickier, and none of the numbers we saw — including the figure Mills pointed us to — separated the Iraq PTSD cases from those resulting from duty in Afghanistan. But given the wide range of the government's own measures, Paul's 100,000 figure shakes out as reasonable. 
We rate his statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A453500>],/factchecks/2010/sep/11/ron-paul/rep-ron-paul-says-4400-americans-were-killed-iraq-/
"['Rhode Island', 'Candidate Biography', 'State Budget', 'Steven Costantino']","
Costantino says he's the only mayoral candidate who's balanced budgets, created jobs
","In the four-way Democratic primary for Providence mayor, state Rep. Steven Costantino has portrayed what some consider a liability -- his years in the General Assembly -- as a strength that separates him from the rest of the pack.

His latest TV commercials cite his experience, saying ""he’s the only candidate who’s balanced budgets and brought jobs to Providence.""
 
We’ll take the claims one at a time, starting with the budget balancing.

As chairman of the House Finance Committee, a position he’s held for seven years, Costantino is considered the legislature’s chief budget writer.

The Rhode Island Constitution requires state budgets to be balanced. And on paper, when the governor presents his budget to the General Assembly and when the Assembly gives final approval to its revised version, they are.

But critics have long complained that Rhode Island's budgets are never really balanced. Too often, they're predicated on spending plans that aren't followed, or on overly optimistic assumptions that federal funding will increase or gambling revenues will grow. Almost every year, the Assembly must pass mid-year ""supplemental"" budgets to plug the holes. Then the debate continues as to whether they were ever balanced in the first place.

Costantino defends the budgets he’s crafted as House Finance chairman, saying they are accurate at the time they are written.

 ""Every budget in the world is an assumption,"" he said. ""At the time we pass them, they are balanced."" Yet the finance chairman is also realistic that tax-and-spend plans don’t tend to stay that way for long. They are moving targets.
 
Technically, he’s right about all of that. But is Costantino the only candidate who has experience balancing budgets?

Three of his opponents-- Democrats Angel Taveras and Christopher Young and independent Jonathan Scott -- have never held elected office, so none of them has been in a position to balance a budget.
 
Democrat John Lombardi is another story. For 26 years, Lombardi has served on the City Council, including seven years as president. He also filled in briefly as mayor after Vincent A ""Buddy"" Cianci resigned in 2002.

We asked Lombardi about his experience with the city’s budget, which, like the state’s plan, must be balanced each year. As council president, Lombardi said  he oversaw the council’s roughly $1-million budget. Each year, he also voted on the $600-million plus  tax-and-spend plan (sometimes in favor, sometimes against). In addition, he sent us several examples of letters he wrote to the Council Finance chairmen recommending ways to trim city expenses.

The Costantino campaign dismisses Lombardi’s budget experience: ""There’s a very clear difference between the person who sits at the table, rolls up his sleeves and manages a budget than the person on the City Council who simply has to take a vote,"" a spokeswoman said.
 
Yet the fact remains that, with 26 years experience, Lombardi played at least some role, however small, in assembling spending plans.

It’s fair for Costantino to say he balanced budgets. But his claim that he’s the only candidate who has done so is not entirely accurate.

Now on to the second claim, that he’s the only candidate who brought jobs to Providence.

Costantino sponsored and pushed for passage of legislation this year that allowed the Industrial Recreational Building Authority, an arm of the state's Economic Development Corporation, to guarantee up to $60 million in bank loans to help free up credit that small businesses need to hire new employees. The first $6.7-million guarantee went to Providence’s CAPCO Steel, which is currently using the money to hire 100 workers, his campaign said.

The Costantino camp provided other examples --  his roles in the Assembly’s decision to purchase and renovate the Dunkin’ Donuts Center -- and in legislation that helped rehabilitate the derelict Masonic Temple into a luxury hotel, to name a few.

Therefore, it’s accurate to say Costantino has helped bring jobs to the city.

Is he the only candidate who did that? Again, Taveras, Young and Scott were not in a position to do so. But Lombardi cited several examples of how he helped bring jobs to Providence. He said he voted in favor of the tax benefits that lured the GTECH headquarters to the capital city. He also supported a variety of ordinances needed for development of the Rhode Island Convention Center. Finally, he told us he added a handful of jobs to the Providence City Council office.

Costantino is correct about his own record in crafting budgets and bringing jobs to Providence, but he gets it slightly wrong when he says he’s the only candidate who did so. We’re calling his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967A0980>],/factchecks/2010/sep/11/steven-costantino/costantino-says-hes-the-only-mayoral-candidate/

Ann Coulter says there have been more terrorist attacks in U.S. under Obama
","Just days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Ann Coulter, the often provocative conservative pundit, wrote a column in which she compared the number of terrorist attacks in the United States under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama.

Coulter was challenging the argument by Gen. David Petraeus -- the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan -- warning against a proposed Koran burning in Gainesville, Fla., on the grounds that, in Coulter's words, ""it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans.""

Coulter wrote that ""this is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting?"" She went on to knock Andrew Sullivan, an iconoclastic conservative pundit, for suggesting that if Obama was elected, his racial background and life story could help counter jihadist recruiting efforts.

""It didn't work out that way,"" Coulter wrote. ""There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin (sic) had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the 'it will help them recruit' argument yet?"" (For the record, she said she opposes [Koran]-burning, saying, ""The reason not to burn [Korans] is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm."")

Coulter raises a pertinent question about what the U.S. can actually do to curb recruiting by jihadists. But the only part of her comment that's checkable is her claim that ""there have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq."" So we looked into it.

We'll start by noting that Coulter's terminology is quite specific, leaving out a lot of terrorist activity that occurred under both presidents.

She appears to be counting terrorist attacks (not foiled attacks or arrests before attacks were carried out or plots undertaken), and she is limiting her count to attacks on U.S. soil (leaving out attacks against U.S. interests in other countries). She also starts the clock after the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which means excluding the July 4, 2002, incident in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian immigrant, fired on an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two.

Among the other incidents excluded by Coulter's parameters are the December 2001 ""shoe-bombing"" incident, in which Richard Reid was foiled trying to detonate plastic explosives packed in his shoes and the March 2006 case of Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate, driving an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians. Both cases were reportedly motivated to one degree or another by radical Islam.

After looking through several sources, including reports by the FBI and independent commissions, we conclude that there were no Islamist-inspired terrorist attacks fitting Coulter's strict definition under Bush.

As for the record under Obama, we found two that fit Coulter's categories. One was the attack at Ft. Hood in Texas on Nov. 5, 2009, which left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded. Maj. Nidal Hasan, a military doctor and suspected Islamic extremist, has been charged in the shooting. The other attack at a military recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark., June 1, 2009, left one soldier dead and one wounded. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad has been charged with being the gunman in that incident.

Using Coulter's criteria means excluding at least two well-publicized incidents that took place during Obama's tenure -- the foiled Dec. 25, 2009, attempt to bomb a plane landing in Detroit by alleged ""underwear"" bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and the failed Times Square attack of May 1, 2010, by alleged car-bomber Faisal Shahzad.

So, Coulter's numbers may be meticulously circumscribed, but they're right: There were zero attacks during the six years cited under Bush, and two attacks in the first 16 months under Obama.

But terrorism experts told us that the more important question is what those statistics signify. The answer may be: not much.

In large part, that's because terrorist attacks often take years to plan. Bruce Hoffman, director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, noted that Najibullah Zazi -- who plotted simultaneous suicide attacks on the NYC subway a year ago -- made contact with and was trained by al-Qaida in 2008. So he began his planning under Bush but was arrested under Obama, Hoffman said. The same goes for many of the Somali-Americans who went to Somalia for terrorist training as far back as 2006 and 2007 but only got onto the authorities' radar screen in 2009.

In fact, experts we spoke to agreed that it's unlikely that the terrorists and alleged terrorists in question even gave any thought to who was serving as president when planning their attacks. Someone who takes the fateful step of starting to plan a deadly attack against U.S. citizens isn't likely to be swayed in their views by mere changes in partisan control; they have become fundamentally opposed to the underlying foundation of American society.

""Islamist terrorism exists not because of what we do but because of what its practitioners believe and because of the policies of the states that support it,"" said Ted Bromund, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Bromund called it ""solipsism"" -- that is, extreme self-centeredness -- for any American to assume that our own short- to medium-term actions will have much of an impact on jihadist recruiting. ""Islamists have their own ideology, and states like Iran have their own interests, which are not simply a mirror reflection of us and our actions,"" Bromund said. ""Therefore, we should carry out policies that are in accord with our interests and values and not fall into the habit of believing that the problems of the world are really all about us.""

This view actually fits pretty well with the broader point Coulter was trying to make, which is that individual incidents and events aren't likely to have much of an impact on terrorist recruiting.

Reviewing the evidence, Coulter's numbers are correct -- there have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil under Obama than under Bush. But this statistic is of questionable value. It's based on carefully constructed parameters that could have produced a different comparison if those parameters had been tweaked. It suggests that terrorist plots can be blamed on a specific presidency, even though plots can take years to come together. And it suggests that the only way to measure success in combating terrorism is by comparing deadly attacks on U.S. soil, even though ""it's immensely relevant whether someone has become motivated to attack U.S. persons or interests anywhere in the world, including Afghanistan and Iraq,"" said Robert Chesney, a law professor and terrorism specialist at the University of Texas. Ultimately, we think the statement is accurate but doesn't provide needed context. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809706D100>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-there-have-been-more-terrorist-at/

Adam Putnam sounds alarm on looming water crisis
","
Republican Agriculture Commissioner candidate Adam Putnam is sounding the alarm about a critical water shortage he says Florida will soon be facing.

""The most important issue facing Florida long term is water -- whether you want to plant an orange grove, build a subdivision, save the Everglades ... it all boils down to water,"" Putnam, a congressman from Bartow in Polk County, said on Sept. 9, 2010, during an editorial board interview with the St. Petersburg Times.

""We've got to find 2 billion -- find, create, make, obtain through conservation -- 2 billion gallons (of water) between now and 2025. Per day."" 
Putnam told the editorial board members assembled that the state needs to invest in alternative water supplies like reclaimed water, and create incentives for developers to invest in alternative supplies as well. The state must also advocate for more conservation and efficiency measures, Putnam said, and continue to invest in desalination facilities -- which turn salt water into drinking water.

He wrote a policy position paper on the state's water supply issues, which you can read here.

In this fact check we're drilling down on Putnam's basic assumption, that Florida needs to somehow develop an additional 2 billion gallons of water per day in the next 15 years. 
We turned to the state Department of Environmental Protection, the agency tasked to increase the state's available water supplies, for an answer.

Florida used an estimated 6.9 billion gallons of fresh water per day in 2005, the DEP said, citing the most recent U.S. Geological Survey report. By 2025, it is projected that the state will use 8.7 billion gallons a day. That's an increase of 1.8 billion gallon per day, or 27 percent. Close to what Putnam said. 
We should note that the projected is based on the assumption that the state's population will grow to almost 25 million by 2025. Currently, the state's population is estimated to be around 18.77 million. The projection also assumes that the government will be responsible for providing water for everyone in the state. Both those assumptions could, of course, change between now and 2025. 
""As Florida continues to grow, pressure is put on the water resources of the state and the need to ensure these resources are available for future generations becomes increasingly important,"" the state wrote in its 2010 Annual Report on Regional Water Supply Planning. ""Floridians have always enjoyed a quality of life that is inextricably linked to the health of our water resources. Tourists come here to enjoy pristine beaches, swim in our freshwater springs, and experience unique fishing opportunities. Florida's water resources also support large agricultural industries. If Florida did not maintain its high quality natural systems, the effects would be felt throughout the entire economy."" 
To be sure, the DEP and the state's five water management districts have been preparing for the uptick. The water management districts are required by law to develop and update regional water supply plans every five years.

And they have already identified, developed or are developing projects to help close the gap.

In 2005, the Legislature created the Water Protection and Sustainability Trust Fund and designated $100 million to be used to promote the development of alternative water supplies. The state set aside another $117 million over three years in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Legislature stopped funding the program in 2009, the DEP said.

The investment, however, helped water management districts provide funding assistance for 327 water saving projects, which will help create approximately 761 million gallons a day of ""new water"" available for consumptive use. That's close to 40 percent of the water expected to be needed by 2025.

Most of the projects focus on adding reclaimed water capacity or demineralizing brackish groundwater.

The work already being done by the state and water management districts is an important caveat when considering Putnam's comments because he makes it sound like the state has to find 2 billion gallons of water a day by 2025. In reality, the state already has projects on the book that get the state a portion of the way there.

Yet, Florida has a ways to go. 
Putnam is right, based on the latest estimates Florida will use about 2 billion more gallons of water a day in 2025 than the state did in 2005. But the state and the five state water management districts have started planning for it, and already have identified water construction projects that will help meet some of the increasing demand.

Kendrick Meek not the lone defender of the Everglades
","
In his first television ad of the general election, released on Sept. 7, 2010, U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek tries to distinguish himself from his fellow Senate hopefuls, Republican Marco Rubio and the independent candidate, Gov. Charlie Crist.

The clip opens with Meek stepping into an airboat and zipping around the Everglades – an image that screams Florida. In his first claim on the 33-second video ""Only One,"" Meek boasts of being ""the only one who's fought against developers draining the Everglades!"" The ad goes on through a litany of claims: ""The only one against drilling before and after the BP spill. The only one against privatizing Social Security. The only one who's pro-choice, who took on George Bush, who's fought for middle-class tax cuts, against high credit card fees, and to raise the minimum wage.""

Such a wealth of fact-checking opportunities! We decided to start at the top, saving the Everglades. It seemed like such a bold claim that it warranted a closer look. 
We asked the Meek campaign to show us the proof that its candidate could lay claim to such bragging rights. Meek spokesman Adam Sharon noted that the Democratic contender had voted in favor of a 2007 bill that set aside funding for water resource construction and improvement projects, including $687.07 million for Everglades restoration. The Meek campaign also cited $135 million that Meek helped secure for Everglades Restoration in fiscal years 2009. These measures are clearly pro-Everglades but do they do much to keep developers out of the Everglades? We didn't see anything in the bills, and neither do others. 
""It has nothing to do with any restrictions on development in Florida,"" said Kirk Fordham, chief executive officer of the Everglades Foundation in Washington, D.C. 
Clearly, Meek is referring to his actions on federal legislation, and it isn't exactly a fair comparison. Former House Speaker Rubio and Gov. Crist aren't in the same position to vote; after all, they aren't federal lawmakers. ""They didn't vote in the same body so you can't compare their voting records,"" said Fordham.

Just as we had asked the Meek campaign to show us how he single-handedly stopped developers from draining the Everglades, we asked Crist and Rubio whether they've done anything to help the Everglades.

Crist spokesman Danny Kanner quickly pointed to the governor's 2009 bid to buy out U.S. Sugar Corp. and convert its 180,000-plus acres to reservoirs and pollution-treatment marshes. The original plan with its $1.75 billion price tag has since been scaled back to $197 million and 26,800 acres, but a new deal gives the South Florida Water Management District options to buy all or part of the land for up to 10 years.

Everglades advocates such as Fordham and Thom Rumberger, chairman of the Everglades Trust in Tallahassee, also point out that Crist has made key appointments favorable to the environment. Fordham noted how Crist -- compared to his developer-friendly predecessor, Jeb Bush -- appointed pro-environment types to the governing board of the South Florida Water Management District including Shannon Estenoz, Sandy Batchelor and Kevin Powers. Crist has also received some green recognition, including a ""Champion of the Everglades"" award in 2008 from Audubon of Florida.

As the Meek campaign was quick to point out, Crist signed Senate Bill 2080 in 2009, which stripped the water board's authority over issuing consumptive use permits and gave it to the board’s directors, a move that prevented the public from making decisions on who gets water, how much and from where. ""Everglades restoration depends on reducing the quantity of water taken from the environment,"" Audubon of Florida said in a statement May 21, 2009, that urged Crist to veto the bill.

Still, ""It would be hard to argue that Meek has a superior record to the governor,"" said Fordham, a major backer of the U.S. Sugar deal. ""I know Crist has a pretty solid record on protecting and restoring the Everglades.""

For his part, Rubio voted when he was in the House in favor of a 2008 bill that authorized issuing bonds for Everglades restoration. It also doubled the maximum annual issuance amount from $100 million to $200 million.

""The real work on the Everglades was being done at that time on the Senate side,"" said Eric Draper, executive director of the Audubon of Florida. ""The House was more in a position of going along. I would characterize (Rubio) as going along, not as providing leadership.""

For Meek to claim he is the only one among the three to stop developers from draining the Everglades is decidedly not true. The Meek campaign cited bills he backed as evidence that he was pro-Everglades, but neither of the two bills stopped developers from draining the Everglades. Similarly, Crist and Rubio have also taken steps to back measures that support Everglades restoration. So we rate Meek's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DF7D00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-not-lone-defender-everglades/

National Taxpayers Union ad blasts tax proposal as ""handout"" for BP
","On Sept. 2, 2010, the National Taxpayers Union -- a conservative advocacy group -- announced that it would be spending $4 million on an advertising campaign that targets higher energy taxes. Here's the narration of the TV ad: ""Our economy's hurting, but some senators want to weaken an industry creating jobs. America's energy industry supports 9 million jobs, but Congress may double-tax U.S. energy companies, helping foreign companies owned by China and Venezuela, even BP. New taxes will raise your gas prices, make us more dependent on foreign oil, and cost 600,000 American jobs. Tell Congress BP doesn't deserve a handout. No new American energy taxes."" At first, we thought this was an ad decrying the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal, a legislative effort to cap greenhouse gases that Republicans have consistently criticized as a tax on ordinary energy consumers. But that's not what the ad is about. Instead, NTU says the ad is about two changes under consideration by the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress -- rules for ""dual capacity"" taxpayers, and the Section 199 deduction. The ad is correct that the modifications being considered would primarily affect oil and gas companies. Even by the byzantine standards of tax law, these rules are highly arcane. So bear with us as we try to explain how they work and investigate whether the ad portrays them fairly. Our aim is to gauge whether the ad is accurate when it says that making these changes would amount to a ""handout"" to companies like BP. Let's start with the ""dual capacity"" rule. This rule stems from a tax code provision that lets U.S. taxpayers receive credit for taxes paid on income derived overseas, so income is not taxed twice. Say you're a U.S. oil company. You go to a foreign country to extract oil. You pay a 20 percent tax to that country on what you extract. When your U.S. taxes are calculated, you'll get a dollar-for-dollar credit for the taxes paid overseas. Where it starts getting complicated is that some foreign countries charge oil extractors a single payment that includes both the tax and a payment for the right to drill in the first place. So, rather than paying 20 percent tax on what's extracted, the company will have to pay more, because the rights to drill are included in the same levy. (The dual nature of these payments is the origin of the term ""dual capacity."") Whether the company considers this a tax or a royalty payment matters quite a bit for the U.S. company's tax bill because amounts considered to be foreign taxes provide dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability, whereas a royalty only permits a deduction, which is a significantly smaller tax benefit than dollar-for-dollar. So, the greater the amount that's considered a foreign tax, the larger the sum that can be deducted from U.S. taxes. Current U.S. tax law deals with this by trying to determine what part is the true tax (and thus eligible for a dollar-for-dollar tax credit) and what is being paid by the company for a specific economic benefit, such as the right to drill (which is only deductible as a business expense). This is a fairly easy process if the foreign country has a straightforward corporate tax structure. But it gets complicated if the country either taxes ""dual capacity"" taxpayers at a different rate than other corporate taxpayers or if it has no basic corporate tax rate at all. In such cases, U.S. companies have more flexibility to call the payments they've made ""taxes"" -- too much flexibility for some critics, who argue that it's an unnecessary loophole that drains the U.S. Treasury of taxes. That's why President Barack Obama, in his fiscal year 2011 budget, and some senators have proposed tightening the rules. We won't get into the guts of the proposed changes here, but the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' official, non-partisan arbiter of tax policy changes, found that Obama's proposal would collect an additional $8.2 billion between 2010 and 2020. Oil and gas companies aren't the only sector that would be affected, but they are the main companies that will. Now for the second proposal -- eliminating oil and gas companies as beneficiaries of Section 199 of the tax code.  Section 199 is a deduction for companies that produce goods or software or undertake construction projects in the U.S. Passed in 2004, it replaced a previous tax benefit extended specifically to U.S. exporters, struck down as an illegal trade subsidy by the World Trade Organization. Under section 199, U.S. oil and gas companies can take advantage of a lower tax rate. According to Treasury Department testimony in 2009, making oil and gas ineligible is projected to increase federal revenues by $13.2 billion from 2010 to 2019. We won't address the ad's claim that these proposals could result in the elimination of 600,000 jobs, higher gasoline prices or greater dependence on foreign oil, since such estimates are speculative and ultimately not provable. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad is justified in calling such changes a ""handout"" to BP or other foreign companies.

In the ad's defense, the changes would only affect U.S.-based companies, and by taking away a benefit from a U.S. firm, the government could, in a sense, be advantaging foreign-based firms.

Pete Sepp, NTU's executive vice president, said that the two tax provisions were created to take the sting off the U.S. corporate tax code. Because many of the United States' competitors do not tax the foreign earnings of domestic firms -- but we do -- deductions and exemptions like the two in question here help U.S. competitiveness. ""Taking away one or both these provisions for oil companies -- provisions that exist for a wide variety of firms -- will, in our opinion, necessarily increase the overhead of oil and gas firms (based) here. That means higher costs for those firms -- costs which foreign-based competitors like BP don't have to shoulder.""

Still, ""handout"" is a pretty strong word to describe what's being proposed. In Webster's New World Dictionary, the relevant definition of ""handout"" is ""a gift of food, clothing, etc., as to a beggar."" Allowing for some artistic license to exchange ""BP"" for ""beggar,"" we think the accuracy of ""handout"" depends on whether the government is affirmatively providing a direct benefit to BP. And it's not clear that the government would be doing this if it made these changes.

If the government were to pass these two policy proposals, it would certainly be taking away a benefit granted to U.S.-based oil and gas companies. But would taking away the two benefits from U.S. companies be equivalent to giving a handout to BP? We're not so sure.

Mitchell Kane, a professor at New York University Law School who specializes in international corporate taxation, said the use of the term ""handout"" in this context is ""highly misleading,"" noting that there would be no change at all to BP's tax liability. ""There could be competitive effects, but this is a highly speculative claim, and in any event is not what most people think of as a handout,"" Kane said. ""If your co-worker loses her job, and there is therefore less competition in the company for promotions and future raises, does this mean you have received a 'handout?'""

There's another reason to question whether BP's British owners are the only ones who would benefit if these provisions were to pass. In a globalized economy, some Americans would actually benefit, since foreign companies employ, do business with and pay quarterly dividends to lots of U.S. taxpayers. According to BP's website, it is the largest oil and gas producer and one of the largest gasoline retailers in the United States, as well as the largest non-U.S. company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. And U.S.-based subsidiaries of foreign companies, including BP's U.S. subsidiaries, qualify for Section 199 credits, which weakens the argument that BP would be a clear winner if these changes were made.

It's certainly understandable that U.S. oil companies doing business overseas would be opposed to these proposals -- and perhaps feel picked on, since both changes specifically target their industry. Still, we think the term ""handout"" in this context is questionable -- even hypocritical, since the tax policy the oil companies want to keep in place could easily be described as involving longstanding ""handouts"" for them. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DDB800>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/national-taxpayers-union/national-taxpayers-union-ad-blasts-tax-proposal-ha/

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says Sean Duffy wants to privatize Social Security
","
Using Social Security as a focus of a political attack -- especially labeling an opponent as out to gut the popular program -- is a tactic almost as old as the program itself.

In the race to succeed retiring U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau) in Wisconsin’s 7th District, the attack came early. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the group in charge of retaining control of the House for Democrats, launched an ad against Republican Sean Duffy claiming Duffy supports privatizing Social Security.

The issue could be a potent one in the northwest Wisconsin district, open for the first time since 1969. Indeed, 15.7 percent of the district residents are 65 years or older -- the highest rate of the state’s eight congressional districts and above the 13.2 percent figure statewide.

With its ad, the DCCC  piggybacks on an earlier web ad from the state Democratic Party and on claims being made by state Sen. Julie Lassa (D-Stevens Point), who is running unopposed for her party’s nomination. They all make essentially the same claim against Duffy -- and even cite each other when providing support for their statements.

We’ll focus on the DCCC ad, which includes the requisite ominous tone and imagery.

""When we should be fighting to protect Social Security, Sean Duffy backed a plan to privatize it,"" the ad states, later referring to the stock market and adding: ""Remember the crash? Families could have lost 40% of their retirement benefits.""  

Scary stuff.

So, does Duffy really want to play the stock market with Social Security funds?

In supporting its claim, the DCCC points to Duffy’s support of the fiscal plan crafted by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville) called ""A Roadmap for America’s Future.""

Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, introduced the wide-ranging plan in 2008 and in January 2010 began shopping around an updated version for sponsors. The proposal has attracted considerable attention nationally, though not everyone who supports its concept has signed on to each individual piece. And it has not been identified by House leaders as a priority.

When it comes to Duffy, the DCCC refers to the state Democratic Party’s web ad, which includes a video snippet dated March 11, 2010, in which Duffy tells an unidentified questioner he supports the Ryan Roadmap.

Question: ""Do you support it?""

Duffy: ""I do.""

The first question is whether the Ryan plan would privatize Social Security.

The plan calls for the creation of optional ""personal"" accounts that would be owned by the individual and ""managed and overseen by Social Security -- not a stockbroker or private investment firm."" The accounts have a guarantee that they would never lose money. They would be voluntary -- not mandatory -- and available to those now under age 55.

Ryan says his plan ""provides future retirees with the option to either stay in the traditional government-run system or to enter a system of guaranteed personal accounts. Neither option is privatized."" The money would be invested mutual funds or bonds. Yes, they’re tied to Wall Street, but are overseen by the government. Ryan said the same system is used for state and federal employees, including members of Congress.

The claims regarding whether the Ryan plan privatizes Social Security have been looked at repeatedly and debunked. The national PolitiFact site even turned to a linguist who noted that an earlier Republican plan calling for ""private"" accounts was tweaked after pollsters found the public was more comfortable with the term ""personal"" accounts.

""Privatization is usually taking government programs and handing them over to industry to run,"" Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California at Berkeley, told PolitiFact National. "" ‘Privatize Social Security' makes it sound like they want to hand it over to Visa to run.""

Nevertheless, the semantics of the matter are central to the debate.

For some, personal investment accounts -- even if they are overseen and managed by the government -- are private, especially when compared with the current system. For others, the accounts are ""privatized"" when they are managed by a Wall Street firm. That sounds like the definition Democrats are using. After all, the ad and related statements refer to the plunges in the stock market, and greedy Wall Street bankers.

The ad against Duffy follows a similar pattern being used nationally, in which Democrats are attempting to tie general statements of support for Ryan’s plan to specific pieces that may be unpalatable to voters. It’s sort of how a vote for a massive spending bill is picked apart and used to hang individual items on those who supported the overall measure.

As Duffy’s two-word answer cited in the web ad indicates, he has voiced some support for Ryan’s Roadmap. But what has he said about privatizing Social Security?

In a Wausau Daily Herald item about an Aug. 23 editorial board meeting, Duffy is quoted as saying: ""Privatizing is not an option.""

On his campaign website, Duffy states: ""I have not and will not endorse privatizing Social Security because I don’t believe it is the solution to making Social Security solvent.""

And this is what Duffy told the Journal Sentinel about his views:

""Do I want to see people take their Social Security payments and put them into private accounts, open up an eTrade account and go into the stock market? Absolutely not.""

Duffy said he is willing to ""look at all kinds of different systems"" but says he has not come out with his own proposal or endorsed Ryan’s plan.

""I’ve said it’s a good starting point,"" Duffy said.

So, the DCCC ad uses a Duffy statement -- cut and spliced by the state Democrats for maximum effect -- to brand Duffy as an advocate for privatizing Social Security. But Duffy is on the record repeatedly as opposing privatizing Social Security and says he is not supportive of Ryan’s entire ""roadmap"" plan. What’s more, Democrats say Duffy would leave recipients at the mercy of Wall Street, when the plan would restrict investments to government managed accounts and guarantee them against long-term losses. 
The Democrats’ claim is not just false, it’s ridiculously so. Where’s a match? We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F7240>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-says-s/

Larry Gonzales says state Rep. Diana Maldonado uses Craigslist to hire block walkers
","
Republican Larry Gonzales of Round Rock, challenging first-term Democratic state Rep. Diana Maldonado, says his ""roadmap to victory"" includes plans for volunteers to visit voters house by house. 
Tweaking Maldonado, Gonzales says in an Aug. 31 e-mail to supporters: ""We are not soliciting paid walkers on Craig's List like my opponent is, who is offering to pay complete strangers by the hour to carry her message."" 
We wondered whether Maldonado was in fact hiring campaign workers to walk blocks and ring doorbells through Craigslist, a website that enables people to post ads under categories such as jobs, housing, events and personals. 
Gonzales told us that he found out about the Craigslist entry from a supporter who had responded to it. Gonzales said he had not seen the ad but that the supporter, whom Gonzales would not identify, had forwarded him an e-mail conversation proving that the Maldonado campaign had placed it. 
Many Craigslist postings are free, according to its website, although there is a charge for posts including ""brokered apartment rental listings in New York,"" ads for therapeutic services in the United States, and job openings in certain cities including Austin. The fee for posting a job in the Austin area: $25. Searching the ads, which include an e-mail address for responses, is free. 
Gonzales forwarded us a copy of the e-mail exchange between the Maldonado campaign and the supporter, whose name and address had been redacted. (According to Gonzales, the day before our inquiry, he sent a copy to a conservative blogger; we saw that version posted online.) 
The subject line of the e-mail response from [email protected] was ""Paid Canvassers Needed for Highly Competitive State House Race (Round Rock)."" Her e-mail said, ""Thanks for responding to the ad, we are working really hard to win this race. If you are interested in a position send me your resume and 2-3 references and we will go from there."" 
We searched Craigslist for the job posting, but it was no longer available. 
Mitra Salasel, communications director for Maldonado's campaign, confirmed that the campaign had posted a jobs ad on Craiglist. She e-mailed us a copy, which states: ""Competitive Texas State House campaign seeks highly motivated door-to-door canvassers for part-time and full-time paid positions. The ideal candidate has experience volunteering and/or organizing for democratic or nonprofit campaigns."" 
The ad says applicants ""must be willing to work outdoors during irregular hours, including evenings and weekends."" The location is listed as Round Rock, and the hourly pay is listed as $10.11. Neither Maldanado nor Gonzales is mentioned by name. 
Salasel told us that Maldonado's campaign field director, Kristin Fine, has the e-mail address [email protected] and that the ad was posted July 24 and expired after 30 days. 
Salasel said: ""As I'm sure you're aware, our district is a commuter district where most people have family obligations. So we supplement our volunteer program — over 100 strong — with five paid canvassers that can work a regular schedule."" 
Three of the five were hired through Craigslist, she said. 
Gonzales told us that he has not paid people to walk blocks or call voters on his behalf. A review of his campaign finance reports found no expenditures that suggested otherwise. 
Two Democratic political professionals told us that it's not uncommon to pay canvassers. Peck Young, who is director of Austin Community College's Center for Public Policy and Political Studies and who has worked as a Democratic campaign consultant, said many people can't afford to volunteer if they have to pay for child care while doing political work. ""It's to compensate them so they can afford to be part of your campaign,"" he said. 
However, GOP consultant Chad Wilbanks, who said he has no connection to the Gonzales campaign, said that it happens more often in legislative races than statewide contests and that such hiring usually starts later in the game. 
""If you look at state legislative campaigns, there may be an effort to recruit people and pay them in the last 72 hours of a race, but it is rare,"" Wilbanks said. ""When it is even more rare is 60 days out."" 
Using Craigslist to recruit campaign workers is ""unconventional,"" said Wilbanks, but Young had a different take. ""In these big cities, with all the high-tech stuff, people are using all kinds of high-tech techniques,"" Young said. 
Maldonado's campaign confirmed using Craigslist to hire block walkers. We rate Gonzales' statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971ACC00>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/larry-gonzales/larry-gonzales-says-state-rep-diana-maldonado-uses/
"['Georgia', 'Energy', 'Roy Barnes']","
Barnes ad claims he can put 10,000 people to work through energy program
","
It is one of the most striking claims of this campaign season.

Roy Barnes, former Georgia governor who is hoping to return to the Governor's Mansion in January, said in a televised campaign ad he can put 10,000 people to work.

How?

""By retrofitting each state building to make them more energy-efficient,"" he said in the ad, which premiered June 23.

""The best part is,"" Barnes added, ""the energy savings will pay for the improvements.""

Ten thousand jobs is a pretty hefty claim in this sluggish economy, particularly when the state's unemployment rate is 9.9 percent, slightly above the national average of 9.5 percent.

So how did Barnes come up with this estimate? Is it accurate? And how soon could it be accomplished?

The Barnes campaign said it based its estimate of how many jobs can be created on two findings in two separate reports.

One, by the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, suggests the state can create up to 5,000 new jobs. About 6,000 people already employed would also see the benefits by working on retrofitting state buildings. The other is a 2008 study by the Political Economy Research Institute, which describes itself as an independent unit of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The report estimates about 20 jobs can be generated for each $1 million spent on energy-efficiency efforts.

Dennis Creech, executive director of Southface, an Atlanta-based company that works with government agencies and others to promote sustainable workplaces, has seen similar estimates of how many jobs can be generated by retrofitting a building.

By the PERI calculation, Barnes must spend about $500 million to achieve his goal of putting 10,000 people to work. The GEFA estimate would require a $528 million investment. But is that doable? 

Georgia government has suffered financially in recent years. State leaders passed a $17.8 billion budget in April that took effect July 1. The budget was about $3 billion less than the 12-month spending plan adopted three years ago. State agencies saw across-the-board cuts.

GEFA based its $528 million estimate on financing projects over the span of 15 years.

Apparently, Barnes has joined the parade of people supporting the latest hot idea in government: performance contracting. It's the practice of hiring companies to retrofit a building to make it more energy-efficient, saving money on energy bill and water costs. The company typically gets a cut of the money from the energy savings. Many states and cities have entered into performance contracting with companies to produce energy savings. Georgians will vote on Nov. 2 whether to amend the state constitution to allow state agencies to enter into multiyear contracts with companies to improve energy efficiency in state buildings.

The state of Georgia has 15,757 buildings, ranging from storage buildings to park cabins to state office buildings to the Capitol, according to Katy Pando, spokeswoman for the Georgia Building Authority.

""I think it's the right number,"" said Jason Rooks, an Avondale Estates resident who recently formed a group, Taxpayers for Energy Efficiency, to support a referendum later this year to fund retrofitting projects.

Each state agency is responsible for conducting building assessments and potential cost savings opportunities for any renovation projects, Pando said.

Many of Georgia's buildings are old and not energy-efficient, said state Sen. Steve Henson, a DeKalb County Democrat. Gov. Sonny Perdue committed all state agencies to reduce energy consumption per square foot by 15 percent below 2007 levels by 2020. State officials estimate they can save as much as 30 percent on energy and water costs by retrofitting a building.

Henson, one of the co-sponsors of legislation to propose a referendum, said the companies would be paid for the retrofitting through a portion of energy cost savings. If there are no cost savings, Henson said, the company would not get paid. Barnes campaign spokesman Emil Runge said the candidate would fund the work through the cost savings.

Henson said 10,000 jobs could be created or retained through the plan, but ""not in one year."" Henson said the number of workers necessary to do the work depends on how much time it takes for the companies to perform the retrofitting and the willingness of state government to fund the program.

GEFA estimates the state spends about $225 million annually in energy and water costs in state facilities. A 30 percent cost savings would be about $67.5 million. Perdue's 15 percent energy reduction consumption mandate would be about $34 million a year.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency hailed performance contracting in a 2008 report but warned of some potential pitfalls, such as the complexities of the process to hire contractors. The EPA also noted some early contracts did not deliver the expected results, which created some skepticism. The EPA added that some of the skepticism has declined with familiarity of state needs and procedures.

Robert Pollin, who helped write the PERI report, said he and the other researchers used federal government data that outline how businesses operate. From that data, Pollin determined how many jobs can be created, retained or supported through the retrofitting of state buildings.

Some who have analyzed the PERI report contend there is at least one flaw in the research. The Institute for Energy Research noted the unemployment rate for workers with the skills needed to do retrofitting is one-half of the national average. The institute, which has offices in Washington, D.C., and Houston, concluded there will be fewer unemployed workers hired.

No one we spoke with disputed whether 10,000 people could be put to work by retrofitting state buildings. The research by agencies on this topic shows these positions would be new hires and people who would directly benefit from the work. By Barnes saying he could put ""10,000 people to work,"" we believe he gave the impression that all of these workers would be new hires. Some of those 10,000 would already be employed. The positions could be filled, but as Henson noted, the work will require some political will that will be necessary after the end of a potential Barnes administration.

Barnes' statement is accurate, but it leaves out important details that might lead to a different impression. We rate his claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF4680>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/roy-barnes/barnes-ad-claims-he-can-put-10000-people-work-thro/

Maryellen O’Shaughnessy overstates number of lawsuits inherited from Ken Blackwell over 2004 presidential election
","
Maryellen O’Shaughnessy was spot on when she said recently Ohio Secretaries of State are judged on their handling of presidential elections.

O’Shaughnessy, a Democrat running for Secretary of State this November, then slammed Republican Ken Blackwell for mishandling the 2004 presidential election when he held the office. Republican state Sen. Jon Husted, of the Dayton area, is O’Shaughnessy’s opponent.

""It's factually correct to say that Ken Blackwell had at least 18 lawsuits that were even carried over that Jennifer Brunner inherited when she came into the office as a result of his mismanagement of the 2004 election,"" O’Shaughnessy said in an Aug. 16 interview with WPKO/WBLL in Bellefontaine, a city in west-central Ohio, after a speech to local Democrats.

Brunner, a Democrat, was elected in November 2006 to succeed Blackwell after he lost a gubernatorial bid that year. O’Shaughnessy told the radio station that, if elected, she would maintain the stability Brunner brought to the office.

O’Shaughnessy’s comments put her on a long list of Democrats to criticize Blackwell. We wanted to check out her claim and asked her campaign for information about the lawsuits. A spokeswoman pointed to a letter Brunner wrote The Columbus Dispatch and a separate news story that appeared in The Daily Record, of Wooster.

In a letter to the Dispatch published Feb. 18, 2007, Brunner said 21 lawsuits were pending when she took office. She did not say how many were related to the 2004 presidential election. The Daily Record story, published April 5, 2007, also said 21 lawsuits were pending when Brunner took office. The story made no mention of the 2004 presidential election.

The portion of O’Shaughnessy’s statement that said Brunner inherited ""at least 18 lawsuits"" seemed solid. But there was no proof, within the evidence O’Shaughnessy’s office provided -- that those lawsuits were related to the 2004 presidential election.

We checked with Brunner’s office, which provided a comprehensive list of all cases that Brunner inherited from Blackwell. It is not specific to the 2004 presidential election, Brunner spokesman Patrick Gallaway said. The list, last updated in January, shows Brunner inherited 18 cases when she took office, including one settled during Blackwell’s term with unpaid fees.

Court documents showed 10 of the 18 cases are related to Blackwell’s administration of the 2004 presidential election. The others dealt with a myriad of issues, including campaign finance law and the use of electronic voting machines.

To their credit, the O’Shaughnessy campaign acknowledged she was incorrect after we shared the records from Brunner’s office with them.

""She misspoke about the ones that relate to 2004,"" spokeswoman Heidi Hubmann said.

O’Shaughnessy clearly jumped to an inaccurate conclusion about Blackwell’s job performance in the radio interview. Her sources of information, two newspaper articles from 2007, do not support the meat of her claim – that Blackwell’s mismanagement of the 2004 election led to at least 18 lawsuits that landed in Brunner’s lap. Brunner’s records show that’s not true.

We rate the statement False.

Kilmartin says Fernandez didn't prosecute mayor's brother for writing bad checks to Providence
","Democratic Attorney General candidate Peter Kilmartin came out swinging against primary opponent Joseph Fernandez last week, accusing the former Providence city solicitor of not having the courage to prosecute John Cicilline, Mayor David Cicilline's brother, after John wrote two bad checks to the city.

""When the mayor of Providence's brother wrote over 100 grand in bad checks to the city, Joe Fernandez didn't have the guts to prosecute him. He let him off the hook,"" the Kilmartin campaign ad says.

The facts of this case have been widely reported but the story broke two years ago. So let's review.

In the spring of 2006, Providence was trying to collect back taxes from Felix Nelson Garcia for his storefront property on Cranston Street. John Cicilline, Garcia's lawyer, wrote a $75,000 check on his law office account to the city tax collector's office, to be used as collateral. Garcia was to pay the tax bill once he refinanced the property. To allow the refinancing to happen, the city lifted a lien on the property.

When that check expired, Cicilline wrote a replacement check on the same account, which apparently never had sufficient funds to cash it. Cicilline maintained that the city knew that the money wasn't there. City officials said they agreed to the deal because Cicilline was a well-regarded criminal lawyer who was unlikely to jeopardize that distinction or do anything to embarrass his brother.

(Cicilline was subsequently sentenced to 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty in June 2008 to shaking down drug-dealer clients. He is now disbarred.)

The check was never cashed and the property changed hands without the city getting its money. The incident led to the firing of Tax Collector Robert P. Ceprano.

ProJo.com reported the news of the bad check on Sept. 18, 2008. By then, Garcia's bill, with interest, had grown to $132,000.

Five days later, Providence Police Chief Dean M. Esserman asked the state police to investigate. They spent nearly nine months on the probe, before sending the case to Attorney General Patrick Lynch. Two months later, Lynch's office decided against criminal prosecution.

Now back to the campaign ad.

During all of this, Fernandez, as city solicitor, was Providence's top lawyer. Neither Fernandez nor his office prosecuted the case. Kilmartin says Fernandez should have done that, implying that he didn't because John Cicilline is the mayor's brother.

The Kilmartin ad leaves out a lot of important information.

It is true that Cicilline wrote two bad checks totaling ""over"" $100,000. The actual total was $150,000.

But the second $75,000 check was a replacement for the first check, which had  expired. Cicilline never owed the city ""over $100,000,"" as the ad implies. As a result, the phrasing of the Kilmartin ad is technically true but grossly misleading.

Second, and perhaps more important, state law prohibits any city or town solicitor from prosecuting a felony. That authority rests with the attorney general, who declined to take action after an independent investigation by state police.

Robert Craven, a lawyer for the Kilmartin campaign and former state prosecutor, argued that Fernandez should have repackaged the case as a misdemeanor charge or filed a civil suit against Cicilline to get the money. (That wouldn't actually be a prosecution. Only crimes are prosecuted; civil cases are litigated.)

The Fernandez campaign said that, by that time, the city solicitor's office had a conflict of interest because Ceprano (the fired tax collector who had been represented by Fernandez's office) had sued the city for wrongful discharge. To avoid the conflict, Fernandez hired Deming E. Sherman, of Edwards Angell Palmer & Dodge, to pursue a civil lawsuit to recover the unpaid taxes.

David M. Zlotnick, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law, said Fernandez's sending the case to a private lawyer seems more than reasonable. ""If you refer the case to outside counsel, then the suit is going to get pursued."" In a later e-mail he said, ""There seems to be no effort to sweep this under the rug or avoid tackling a serious matter.""

Sherman says Fernandez instructed him about a year ago to explore potential civil action against Scott L. Hammer, the private attorney who dealt with the Garcia account on the city's behalf.

The campaign provided us with an April 21, 2009 letter from Sherman acknowledging that he would represent the city ""in connection with potential litigation against Scott L. Hammer and John M. Cicilline...""

Sherman said he has been actively pursuing a case against Hammer and depositions are still being taken. He would not say whether any action was planned against Cicilline, who has since been released from prison.

And, for the record, the Kilmartin ad says, in big letters, ""Joe Fernandez failed to prosecute corruption - Providence Journal 4/1/09."" The Journal's story that day, headlined ""Deadline near for suit in Providence tax case,"" says no such thing.

To sum it up:
* Kilmartin's ad cites a dollar amount that is misleading.
* He attacks Fernandez for not bringing criminal charges, when Fernandez, by law, had no authority to do so.
* He faults him for not bringing a civil case, when Fernandez, for ethics reasons, turned the case over to a private lawyer to pursue potential civil action.

His allegations against Fernandez fall into the realm of ridiculous, and we give him a Pants On Fire!",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E8500>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-says-fernandez-didnt-prosecute-mayors-br/

Fernandez says he stripped crooked cops and government workers of their Providence pensions
","
Former Providence City Solicitor Joseph Fernandez, one of three Democrats running for attorney general, has painted himself as a crime- and corruption-busting prosecutor during his nearly-eight years in Mayor David N. Cicilline's administration.

In a mailing to Rhode Islanders citing ""the facts, plain and simple,"" Fernandez says that ""during his term, crime dropped 30 percent over previous years"" and he ""protected tax dollars"" because he ""kicked crooked cops and government officials off the public pension rolls.""

We discussed the crime rate drop, which Cicilline also claims credit for, in an earlier PolitiFact item, in which we questioned whether Cicilline was directly responsible. The same question applies to Fernandez.

So we focused on the pension question, and whether he actually kicked crooked officials off the rolls.

Our first stop was the Fernandez campaign. We wanted to know whom they were talking about. Campaign manager Dan Herkert said the mailing referred to four people implicated in corruption probes -- former administration director Frank Corrente, former tax collector Anthony Annarino, former Police Chief Urbano Prignano and Kathleen Parsons, a former parks department employee.

Herkert said that in February 2003, when Fernandez was in his second month on the job, he issued a key ruling that a criminal conviction was not required to revoke the pension of an employee who had acted dishonorably while on the job.

""Based on that ruling, the Retirement Board moved forward and voted to either reduce or strip the pensions,"" said Herkert. ""He developed the legal strategy that led to either the reduction or revocation of the pensions.""

But it's a lot more complicated than that.

The city's Retirement Board voted to revoke Annarino's pension in February 2002 -- almost a year before Fernandez became solicitor --  after Annarino pleaded gulty to conspiracy, attempted extortion and mail fraud as part of Operation Plunder Dome, which focused on corruption in the administration of Mayor Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci, now a talk-show host on WPRO (630-AM).

Then in October 2002 -- two months before Fernandez took office -- the board voted to strip the pension from Corrente, Cianci's former director of administration, after Corrente was convicted of racketeering, conspiracy and attempted extortion in conjunction with the Plunder Dome probe.

The Fernandez ruling first became relevant in the case of Prignano, who retired after being implicated in a police promotions cheating scandal. His case was different because it was the city's first attempt to strip the pension of an employee for violating the ""Honorable Service Ordinance,"" even though he had never been convicted of a crime. It took until June 2008 for the board to actually vote to remove him from the pension rolls.

Finally, there is Parsons, a former office manager in the parks department. She was originally granted a $1,895-a-month pension in June 2005, even though she had confessed on Nov. 24, 2004, to embezzling nearly $27,000 from an off-the-books account in the department. It took the board until April 2007, another 21 months, to vote to slash her pension by 99 percent. The Journal reported at the time that some Retirement Board members said they were not informed of her plea by Fernandez's office. He blamed it on miscommunication.

Fernandez didn't prosecute any of these four cases directly. Instead, the city sometimes hires outside lawyers to act on behalf of the Retirement Board, said Vincent A. Ragosta Jr., who handled the Prignano case and independently recommended that it go forward. Ragosta issued the report that the board used to make its decision.

Ragosta said Fernandez ""has been at the forefront"" of all the cases, hiring outside lawyers with expertise in labor and employment law, supervising those lawyers, and following the proceedings at the Retirement Board and in Superior Court, where the board's decisions needed to be ratified before they can actually be implemented.

He said taking credit for the actions against the four employees is akin to the attorney general taking credit for putting a murderer behind bars even if an assistant attorney general actually tried the case. ""In a broad sense, that's an accurate and truthful statement.""

All four cases have been long, involved and subject to appeals in Superior Court -- and in at least one instance -- to the state Supreme Court. Fernandez's office was responsible for pursuing them. He was also city solicitor when the board decided to reinstate part of Corrente's pension in August 2008, on the grounds that he had served honorably during his first stint in City Hall.

There are two problems with Fernandez's claim.

First, he says he ""kicked crooked cops"" off the public pension rolls. But the only police officer on the list the campaign supplied is Prignano. Last time we checked our dictionary, the word ""cops"" meant more than one.

When we asked Herkert about this, he said, ""the statement stands as it is. The statement is accurate.""

Not that part of it.

Second, two of the four ex-employees are still receiving their pensions while their cases are under review in Superior Court. Prignano is getting $5,884.50 per month and Parsons is receiving $1,895.04 a month. They have not been kicked off the pension rolls at all.

Herkert's response: ""We're basing our statement on the actions of the Retirement Board.""

So the tally of those who have actually lost their pensions so far: two government officials -- Corrente and Annarino. And their pensions were acted on by the Retirement Board before Fernandez began working for the city. 

We think the average person reading the Fernandez campaign material would be led to believe that, thanks to the work of the former city solicitor, the city is no longer paying pension money to at least two crooked police officers and two crooked government officials.

That wouldn't be accurate.

Fernandez and the city get credit for trying to hold public officials accountable by pursuing the pension cases. But the statement in his mailing greatly exaggerates the facts.

We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C125780>],/factchecks/2010/sep/10/joseph-fernandez/fernandez-says-he-stripped-crooked-cops-and-govern/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama says Republican Congresses used lots of earmarks
","
President Barack Obama has been making a case against Republicans in Congress, hoping to help Democrats in the midterm elections.

One of his points is that the Democrats' policies on the economy are better than the Republicans.

""Along with tax cuts for the wealthy, the other party's main economic proposal is that they'll stop government spending,"" Obama said. ""Of course, they are right to be concerned about the long-term deficit -– if we don't get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of Americans feel it's time for government to show some discipline too.

""But let's look at the facts. When these same Republicans –- including Mr. Boehner –- were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down.""

""Mr. Boehner"" is Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. Obama mentioned him by name about half a dozen times in his speech on Sept. 8, 2010.

We knew earmarks had gone up during the Bush administration, but we weren't sure how they tracked Republican majorities in Congress. Republicans held control of Congress for most of the period from 1995 to 2006. (In 2001, Democrats briefly re-took control of the Senate but lost it again in 2003.) So we decided to check it out.

Generally speaking, earmarks are spending that individual members of Congress request for particular programs or projects. Earmarks usually don't go through the normal vetting processes to make sure the projects are worthy. They're often considered a perk for members of Congress to fund their favorite projects.

We turned to Taxpayers for Common Sense, an nonpartisan advocacy group that fights wasteful spending in Congress. The group opposes earmarks because they circumvent normal budget processes, crowd out funding for merit-based projects and invite corruption. We asked vice president Steve Ellis whether earmarks went up, not down, under the Republican-controlled Congresses.

""Totally true,"" Ellis said. ""Certainly under the Republicans there was a big rise in earmarks."" The high mark was  fiscal 2005, the last fiscal year before Democrats won control, when Congress passed bills with approximately 16,000 earmarks, Ellis said.

We were able to find other sources that agreed with Ellis. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service documented increasing earmarks in different parts of appropriations bills in its report Earmarks in Appropriation Acts: FY1994, FY1996, FY1998, FY2000, FY2002, FY2004, FY2005.

The conservative Heritage Foundation included a striking chart on earmarks in its Federal Spending by the Numbers 2010 report. It reported a slightly different number of earmarks, at approximately 14,000 earmarks in 2005. But that was the largest number of earmarks between 1991 and 2010, and a significant increase from 1994, when there were fewer than 2,000.

We asked Ellis why earmarks increased so steadily during the years Republicans controlled Congress, and he said there were several factors at work. Prior to Republican control, Ellis said, Democrats reserved earmarks for committee chairman and other powerful leaders. Under Republicans, more rank-and-file members of Congress were allowed to insert earmarks into bills. The Republicans allowed Democrats to insert earmarks as well, so Democrats were not so quick to criticize what the Republicans were doing, he said. Finally, special interests got better at lobbying members of Congress, using new technology like cell phones and Blackberrys to communicate with members as legislation was being put together.

That new technology, though, also allowed citizens to document and share information about earmarks, which led to widespread outrage that resulted in earmark reforms when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006, bringing more transparency to the process.

""The more people could look at earmarks and analyze them, the more they could see what Congress was doing and criticize it,"" Ellis said.

But transparency on earmarks doesn't mean earmarks have gone away. During the campaign, Obama promised to reduce earmarks to $7.8 billion a year, what they were at in 1994. Here at PolitiFact, we rated that Promise Broken. The last budget for fiscal year 2010 included 9,499  earmarks worth $15.9 billion, according to an analysis from Taxpayers for Common Sense.

We should note that earlier this year, House Republicans voluntarily agreed to a one-year moratorium on earmarks. House Democrats agreed to a ban on earmarks that benefit for-profit companies but not on earmarks for local government projects or nonprofit projects. Senators of both parties continue to earmark.

And finally, it's important to note that other Republicans may like earmarking, but Boehner is not among them. In 2009, we fact-checked his statement, ""I don't do earmarks. I've never done one,"" and rated it True. He hasn't taken an earmark since he was elected to Congress in 1990.

Boehner's staff also pointed out that Boehner was not in leadership for all of the years Republicans controlled Congress; he did not have a leadership position between 1998 and 2006. And in 2006, the year Boehner was majority leader, earmarks declined from the 2005 high, they said.

Getting back to our rating, Obama said that ""When these same Republicans – including Mr. Boehner – were in charge, the number of earmarks and pet projects went up, not down."" Earmarks increased dramatically between 1995 and 2006, so we find Obama's statement that earmarks went up, not down, to be correct. But he also singles out Boehner by name, when Boehner didn't take any earmarks and wasn't in leadership for most of those years. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972ED6C0>],/factchecks/2010/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-says-republican-congresses-used-lots-earmark/

Development doesn't pay for itself, pro-Amendment 4 group claims
","
The group pushing a constitutional amendment that would give voters more direct control over development projects is trying to debunk what is says is a well-told myth about development -- that it pays for itself.

Florida Hometown Democracy, the organized group supporting the passage of Amendment 4, says in a new web ad that development ends up costing taxpayers, not benefiting them.

""Politicians keep telling us that new development brings tax money to our community,"" the group says in a web ad available on the group's website. ""What they don't tell is that for every dollar a county gets in taxes from new development, it costs us 40 to 50 percent more to provide services.""

Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes. The measure, which needs 60 percent of the vote to pass, is being opposed by most local governments and the development industry. A group of mainly grass-roots activists -- led by environmental attorney Leslie Blackner of Palm Beach -- is supporting the proposed amendment.

We've rated three statements about Amendment 4 previously, which you can read here. In this item, we're going to examine Hometown Democracy's claim that for every $1 in new tax revenue coming in from development, $1.40 to $1.50 is spent servicing that new development.

Hometown Democracy spokesman Wayne Garcia pointed PolitiFact Florida to four studies to support the group's claim.

A 2006 study by Jeffrey H. Dorfman at the University of Georgia found that in Leon County in Florida, for instance, for every $1 generated by new residential development, the government would spend $1.39. The study focuses on replacing farmland with development, and concludes that commercial, industrial and farm uses will save taxpayers money in the long run.

The Dorfman study also measured the cost in 14 Georgia counties and found that for $1 of tax revenue, governments would spend anywhere from $1.13 to $2.27.

An earlier study from 2002 and 2003, commissioned by the 1000 Friends of Florida, The Conservation Fund, The Georgia Conservancy and Tall Timbers Research Stations, focused on Leon County in Florida and two Georgia counties. It found that for every $1 in revenue generated by the residential development of farm and forest land, taxpayers pay $1.38.

A third study, commissioned for a specific development in Jacksonville in 2000, found that developing the undeveloped land would create $157 million in property taxes over 15 years but cost Duval County taxpayers $250 million.

The fourth study was commissioned for Sarasota County in 2002. It found that the typical Sarasota subdivision costs the county $1.53 for every $1 of revenue it generates.

After seeing the findings referenced in the four studies, we noticed a trend. Each seemed to be focusing on the development of residential subdivisions, or taking undeveloped farm or forest land and turning it into single family homes.

That's certainly a prominent form of development in Florida. Probably the one most people think of when they think about development.

But it's not the only kind.

Some development does more than pay for itself

All the studies Garcia provided found that commercial and industrial development did more than pay for itself. The Dorfman study found that in Leon County, for every tax dollar generated by commercial and industrial development, taxpayers would have to pay $0.46 for services.

The Sarasota study found that expensive 5-acre ranches cost $0.57 for every $1 generated.

The ad makes no claim about one specific type of development or another. It just says development.

And still, those studies don't account for the disproportionate share of taxes the people in new homes are paying, said David Denslow, research economist for the Bureau of Economic and Business Research and Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Florida.

""New houses are on average more expensive than existing ones, and therefore pay more than their average share of residential property taxes,"" Denslow said. ""In addition, except for Florida residents with portability, the new houses don't get an initial break from Save Our Homes.""

The studies, Denslow said, also ignore the fact that Floridians create property tax revenue where they live, where they shop, and where they work. The development creates spin-off tax benefits. (For the record, Denslow opposes Amendment 4, saying he doesn't believe it will result in good land planning).

Other experts we talked to said that the cost of a development to taxpayers very much depends on the specifics of the development.

Take a 3,000-acre farm in eastern Hillsborough County. In order to add 1,000 homes there, the county government would need to upgrade county roads and extend utility lines. Then, once the homes are built, the government would have to provide fire and police service, and the school district would have to provide school options.

Through impact fees, developers would pay some of those costs. Through property taxes, homeowners would foot another part of the bill. But very likely, not all of it.

Now take an empty square block in downtown St. Petersburg. And say someone wants to build a 10-story hotel. Roads are in place. So are the utilities. No new residents means no real impact to the school district.

In that scenario, property and sales taxes generated by the property very likely would more than cover the cost to the city.

Now say you're a beach community tearing down an old hotel and replacing it with condominiums. In that scenario, you're potentially increasing the cost on the school system, but you're also increasing the tax dollars generated by the property. How does that all shake out?

Maybe a net positive.

Or say you're building low-value residential developments in a bedroom community Polk or St. Lucie County. That's going to most likely cost taxpayers.

The bottom line is ""it very much depends on the type of development what kind of ratio you get between the tax revenues received and the cost of public services,"" said Lance deHaven-Smith, a professor in the Reubin O'D. Askew School of Public Administration and Policy at Florida State University. ""For a long time, we just wanted growth in Florida ... the thinking being we were going to bring in this growth and make a bountiful Florida.

""But now we know that not just any growth will do it,"" deHaven-Smith said. ""It requires a mix that includes commercial and industrial and unless you actively plan for that, you don't get it.""

And as we searched, we even found at least one study that contradicts the studies provided by Hometown Democracy. The study isn't from Florida, but found a net positive impact for taxpayers by the development of five St. Louis area residential subdivisions. The study, which was paid for by a St. Louis business group, said that ""annual revenues from the five subdivisions for local taxing districts exceeded the costs of providing services to the subdivisions by $13.9 million.""

Our ruling

What's the net effect of all the development happening in Florida? No one was able to direct us to an authoritative study to provide a clear answer.

There is evidence, however, that growth isn't completely paying for itself. Back in Hillsborough, the county Metropolitan Planning Organization has identified more than $3.2 billion worth of unfunded, but needed road projects. Here's a list of the top 20 unfunded projects from 2008. Pinellas County in 2009 had at least $1.1 billion in unfunded road projects.

But when Hometown Democracy says in an ad that taxpayers are paying a 40 to 50 percent premium for development, they're failing to tell the entire story. The group is able to find specific examples of developments that cost taxpayers 40 to 50 percent more than what they're generating in new tax income, but the math doesn't work as a generalization. The cost, or benefit, of a development to taxpayers matters very much on the specific details about the development.

Generally, studies suggest that new large single family developments do not pay for themselves. But infill development (taking an empty lot in an urban area) or redevelopment is much more likely to pay for itself. So are commercial and industrial development projects. As such, we rate Hometown Democracy's claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F9A880>],/factchecks/2010/sep/09/florida-hometown-democracy/development-doesnt-pay-itself-pro-amendment-4-grou/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Message Machine 2010', 'Susana Martinez']","
Republican candidate says opponent Denish put 50,000 illegal immigrants behind wheels
","
Perhaps it was only a matter of time before New Mexico joined the list of states embroiled in heated debates over immigration policy. In her latest ad, Republican gubernatorial candidate Susana Martinez says that while she gave illegal criminals prison time, the Richardson-Denish administration gave out 50,000 licenses to illegal immigrants.

New Mexico is one of only three states in which illegal immigrants may apply for and receive drivers licenses --Utah and Washington are the other two. But we wanted to see whether Martinez's ad tells the full story.

First, some background. On March 14, 2003, Gov. Bill Richardson signed a bill that allows individuals without a Social Security number to apply for a New Mexico driver's license. During the registration process, the applicant is asked to provide an alternative means of identification, such as a personal taxpayer identification number, a valid passport issued by the country of citizenship, a Matricula Consular card issued after 2005 by the Mexican consulate or a foreign birth certificate with a notarized English translation. If all checks out, the Motor Vehicles Department will issue a driver's license, regardless of the applicant's immigration status.

In 2003, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish was Richardson's lieutenant governor, so it is fair to say that she carries at least some responsibility for the policy, which in effect allowed illegal immigrants to apply for and receive a New Mexico driver's license. Proponents of the law said that it was a question of public safety. With a driver's license comes a driving record, which means that the police can keep track of dangerous drivers. It also meant that all drivers could buy insurance.

Still, we find that the ad is misleading on major points.

First, the number 50,000. According to Martinez's ad, that's how many illegal immigrants received a driver's license since the policy took effect. But S.U. Mahesh, a spokesman for the New Mexico's MVD, wrote us in an e-mail that the state does not track how many licenses it issues to those who are in the country illegally. Since 2003, it has issued around 80,000 licenses to foreign nationals, but there are no official statistics on how many of those were illegal immigrants. When we asked Martinez's campaign staff where the number came from, we were referred to two articles. In June 2010, The Albuquerque Journal reported that ""more than 50,000 immigrants have obtained driver's licenses since 2003."" Since the actual number is around 80,000, the newspaper's statement is technically accurate. But unlike Martinez, the article says ""immigrants,"" not ""illegal immigrants."" The other account used the 80,000 figure.

Second, Martinez claims that Denish ""gave"" driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, but that is an over-simplification. Before Gov. Richardson signed the legislation, it had to receive stamp of approval from the New Mexico legislature. Moreover, the MVD does not automatically hand out drivers licenses. While it does not check the individual's immigration status, the MVD works with the Mexican and other governments to verify an applicant's identity. And as of July 2010, individuals without a Social Security number must schedule an appointment at the MVD in advance. The measure is aimed at making it easier for MVD clerks to review application documents in more detail, said MVD Director Michael Sandoval.

The ad also fails to point out that Denish has publicly said that she no longer supports the law because it has not worked as intended. ""Diane Denish does not support giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants and would seek to change that law,"" Chris Cervini, Denish's deputy campaign director, wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact. The New Mexico Independent reported in July, 2010 that ""Denish has said she’d consider stopping the issuance of licenses going forward."" Her opponent, Martinez, has said she would go even further, revoking licenses already issued. Neither candidate has directly answered how she would deal with the consequences of ending the policy, including an uptick in the state's uninsured rate, according to the Independent.

So let's go back over what we've found. Martinez says that Diane Denish ""gave"" 50,000 licenses to illegal immigrants. First, the MVD doesn't just hand out drivers licenses:  It takes steps to verify an individual's identity, and the rules are getting tougher. Second, while it's reasonable to believe that some of the immigrants who received licenses under the policy are in the country illegally, the numbers don't support the claim. The state doesn't keep track of how many licenses are issued to illegal immigrants, so all we can be sure of is that since 2003, 80,000 foreign nationals have received drivers licenses. Third, while Denish supported the measure when it was enacted, the ad conveniently ignores Denish's public statements that she no longer supports the policy.

Lee Fisher hammers Rob Portman on record in Bush administration
","
As a Democrat trying to win a Republican-held Senate seat in economically distressed Ohio, it's not surprising that Lee Fisher would focus his campaign ads on the economy. In a recent ad, he attacked opponent Rob Portman's service under President George W. Bush as U.S trade representative and then as director of the Office of Management and Budget.

""Congressman Rob Portman knows how to grow the economy -- in China,"" the ad says. ""He voted for billions in tax breaks for companies that export jobs. On his watch as Bush's trade czar, our deficit with China exploded, sending 100,000 Ohio jobs overseas. As Bush's budget chief, Portman oversaw a spending spree that doubled the deficit. Outsourcing, bad trade deals, soaring deficicts. Congressman Portman -- a real economic plan, but not for Ohio.""

Let's get something out of the way first: The honorific in the ad aside, Portman last served in Congress in 2005. (Perhaps the Fisher camp thinks anyone associated with Congress will attract extra ire from voters.) We also won't check the jobs figure, which is an estimate over which reasonable people can disagree.

Instead, we'll focus on two other claims about Portman -- that ""on his watch as Bush's trade czar, our deficit with China exploded,"" and that ""as Bush's budget chief, Portman oversaw a spending spree that doubled the deficit.""

To analyze the claim about the trade deficit, we turned to the Census Bureau, which tracks foreign trade statistics on a month-by-month and year-by-year basis. We looked at the time that Portman served as U.S. trade representative, which was from April 29, 2005, to May 26, 2006.

We found that the trade deficit went up by almost $228 billion over that 13-month period. For comparison's sake, we looked at the 13 months prior to Portman taking the job. We found that the trade deficit with China rose by about $189 million during that period.

Comparing those two numbers, the cumulative trade deficit under Portman was about 21 percent higher than it was for the equivalent time period just before he took office.

We didn't see any direct disagreement on this point in the Portman camp's news release attacking the ad or in their e-mail interview with us. The release tries to deflect that ad by offering several examples of how Portman went after the Chinese on trade enforcement. But it doesn't offer an alternate way of looking at trade deficit numbers.

So while the term ""exploded"" is a bit of an exaggeration, a 21 percent increase is nothing to sneeze at.

As for the deficit, we turned to OMB historical tables. As OMB director from May 26, 2006, to August 3, 2007, Portman was deeply involved in the fiscal year 2008 budget process. (The fiscal 2007 budget would have been handled by his predecessor.)

The fiscal 2008 deficit of nearly $459 billion was more than twice the fiscal 2007 deficit, which approached $161 billion.

Portman's camp counters that Bush's 2008 budget mapped out a plan for a fiscal 2008 budget deficit that was actually smaller than the fiscal 2007 budget deficit, with surpluses returning by fiscal 2012. The Portman campaign blames changes made by the Democratic-controlled Congress for busting the budget.

Since the president's budget is essentially a wish list that is always subject to negotiation before implementation, we don't buy the argument that Portman should simply be judged on the initial proposal in the budget process.

Gene Steuerle, an economist at the liberal-leaning Urban Institute, says that the final deficit numbers owed at least as much, if not more, to decisions and events after Portman had left OMB, including Bush's economic stimulus package -- the financial bailout and the decline in tax revenues that followed the official start of the recession in December 2007.

Indeed, in OMB's Mid-Session Review -- a budget document produced on July 11, 2007, shortly before Portman left OMB -- the agency projected the deficit for fiscal 2008 to be $258 billion. If we take this projection and compare it to the 2007 deficit, it's about 60 percent higher. That's less than double.

This brings up the broader question of how much of the burden for these economic numbers should fall on anyone who holds Portman's former positions. The president, Congress and other cabinet officials have a say in both areas, and broader economic trends shape the patterns as well. ""There's nothing a USTR can do about it when the primary cause is U.S. demand and a mercantilist Chinese exchange rate policy,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

On the other hand, the ad is careful to say that the economic developments occurred ""on (Portman's) watch,"" rather than that he was solely responsible for them. (That makes it safer than a prior Fisher claim that PolitiFact Ohio ruled False -- that Portman was ""the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the (Mahoning) Valley and sent them to China."")

So let's review what we found. The ad overstated how big the jump in both statistics was, but in both cases, the numbers did increase significantly on Portman's watch. And while we acknowledge that Portman isn't the only factor -- nor, perhaps, even the primary factor -- in the course of both economic trends, we do think that in the middle of a campaign, challenging an opponent on his record in office is fair game. On balance, we rate the item Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DEE880>],/factchecks/2010/sep/09/lee-fisher/lee-fisher-hammers-rob-portman-record-bush-adminis/
