He didn't say that, but he did shift to the left
","
While Romney never said he was ""to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights,"" Romney did reach out to gay and lesbian voters during his failed 1994 bid for Kennedy's Senate seat. More to the point, Romney said he could outperform Kennedy on gay and lesbian issues.
 
In an October 1994 letter to the Massachusetts chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights group, Romney wrote, ""For some voters it might be enough for me to simply match my opponent's record in this area. But I believe we can and must do better.""
 
And during an August 1994 question and answer session with the Boston gay and lesbian newspaper

Bay Windows,

Romney said he could be a more effective advocate for gay rights than Kennedy because he is a Republican. ""When Ted Kennedy speaks on gay rights, he's seen as an extremist. When Mitt Romney speaks on gay rights he's seen as a centrist and a moderate,"" he said.
 
By 2002, when Romney defeated Democrat Shannon O'Brien to become Massachusetts' governor, he had backed off his support of gay rights. O'Brien said she would support legislation to legalize gay marriage, while Romney said he would not. After Romney won the election, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2004 that gays and lesbians must be allowed to marry in Massachusetts, making it the first state to confer that right. Romney fought it every step of the way.
 
While he didn't say that he would ""be to the left of Teddy Kennedy on gay rights,"" he did say he would be a more effective gay rights advocate than Kennedy because of his centrist/moderate stance. So apart from the license he takes with Romney's wording, Giuliani's attack is Mostly True and demonstrates just how far Romney has shifted to the right since his first foray into politics in 1994.

Huckabee wanted scholarship open to all
","With Mike Huckabee surging in the polls in Iowa, Mitt Romney recently released an attack ad that turned on the issue of immigration. Among other things, the ad says that Mike Huckabee ""even supported taxpayer-funded scholarships for illegal aliens.""
 
There's some truth here, but it's not as dramatic as the 30-second ad portrays.
 
Rather than supporting a scholarship fund aimed at illegal aliens, Huckabee supported a measure that would have allowed the children of illegal aliens who graduated from Arkansas high schools to receive in-state tuition and apply for a state-funded scholarship program, the Academic Challenge Scholarship. Arkansas students can qualify for the scholarship if they achieve a specific grade-point average (3.0 out of 4.0 for a four-year college) and meet a few other basic criteria.
 
At a November 2007 debate in St. Petersburg, Huckabee said he supported the measure so that the children of illegal immigrants could have ""the same scholarship that their peers had, who had also gone to high school with them and sat in the same classrooms.""
 
(Huckabee also claimed the rules regarding this proposal were stricter than they actually were; we checked that claim

here

. We also checked previous claims from Romney on similar issues

here

and

here

.)
 
 Even though Huckabee supported the measure in 2005, it never made it out of the Arkansas legislature, so it never became a law in Arkansas.
 
Romney is right in his assertion, but he glosses over a few important caveats to get there. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.

Hitting him where it hurts
","Among GOP primary voters, the name Ronald Reagan is sacred. So, it's not surprising that each Republican candidate for president has done his best to claim Reagan's mantle and position himself as heir to his legacy.
 
Rudy Giuliani, the only GOP candidate who says he supports abortion rights, might have the hardest time making that sale, since Reagan's legacy is so wrapped up in his socially conservative views. Even so, Giuliani has made much of the past statements of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has admitted he did not always support the Gipper.
 
The Romney admission in question, like much else Romney has tried to bury in his past, came in a 1994 Senate debate when Romney faced Edward Kennedy. The topic was economics. Kennedy said: ""And under your economic program, under the program of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, we saw the growth in terms of the unemployment, the growth in the number of children living in poverty, the growth in terms of those children out of wedlock.""
 
Romney responded: ""I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to return to Reagan-Bush.""
 
Romney has since gone out of his way to distance himself from such remarks, repeatedly referencing Reagan in glowing terms on the campaign trail this year and acknowledging his own conversion to social conservatism on hot-button issues like abortion and gay rights.
 
""Now, I wasn't always a Ronald Reagan conservative,"" Romney told a meeting of conservative activists in January. ""Neither was Ronald Reagan, by the way.""
 
We find Giuliani correctly characterizes his rival's past statements and find the claim to be True.

A legitimate beef with ham sandwich regulations
","
In a speech in Shenandoah, Iowa, Clinton made a campaign issue out of a ham and cheese sandwich.
 
She said the federal government ""is not taking the steps necessary to protect us"" because of inadequate inspections of toys and food. She cited this example:
 
""A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects manufacturers daily. But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects manufacturers about once every five years.""
 
To find out if her sandwich example was correct, we turned to government reports on food safety, interviewed the head of the USDA's food inspection service and studied the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, a fascinating manual that provides rules for Wiener schnitzel (""a veal cutlet prepared by dipping in egg, flour and bread crumbs, and frying to a golden brown"") and vinegar pickle (""sausage in vinegar pickle is approved with the understanding that sausage is completely covered with pickle and that the pickle has a pH level not higher than 4.5""). The manual also spells out which foods are under USDA jurisdiction.
 
We found that Clinton is correct about the regulation of sandwiches and the big disparity in inspections by the two agencies.
 
In an interview with PolitiFact last week, Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged that the sandwich rule is silly. ""There is no rationale or logic that I can explain to anybody,"" he said. ""It defies logic.""
 
He said the rules don't affect the safety of the nation's food supply, but said, ""it's an issue that makes it look like we don't know what we're doing.""
 
Raymond didn't know the origin of the sandwich rule, but others suggested that the volume of meat might have been the key factor in whether it was FDA or USDA jurisdiction. (The rule only applies to plants that assemble sandwiches for retail stores like 7-Elevens. Sandwiches made-to-order at a deli or a Subway store are not subject to the inspections, Raymond said.)
 
To understand the strange bureaucratic turf of food inspections, you have to go back to the 1906 publication of Upton Sinclair's novel

The Jungle

, which described horrific conditions at meat plants. That book, still required reading in many high school English classes, had such impact that it persuaded Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt to enact a law requiring meat inspections. Roosevelt had called for a law that would require oversight ""from the hoof to the can.""
 
Since then, the government has put considerable emphasis on meat and poultry, which fall under the USDA. The agency's 7,500 inspectors and veterinarians conduct continuous daily inspections of the nation's meat and poultry plants. The law requires USDA inspections before the products can be sold.
 
But other foods have not gotten the same scrutiny. Most are regulated by the FDA, but the law does not mandate inspection frequencies, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. The report confirms that Clinton is correct that, on average, the FDA inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years. ""There is no rhyme or reason to how we regulate food today in the U.S.,"" said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""It's based on antiquated laws and bifurcated agencies. The current food safety system doesn't protect the public.""
 
Without a mandate for regular inspections, the FDA hasn't gotten enough money to do them more frequently. Smith Dewaal said the agency is ""really starving for resources.""
 
Her complaints are echoed in a new report from an FDA advisory panel. The November 2007 report for the agency's Science Board said the FDA is so overburdened and underfunded that it can't effectively conduct routine surveillance.
 
""The nation's food supply is at risk,"" the report said.
 
And so we find that Sen. Clinton has a legitimate beef on ham and cheese. We find her claim to be True.

Romney wants a different prescription for the nation
","There are several pieces to this, so we'll take them one at a time.
 
First, Massachusetts: As governor, Mitt Romney oversaw a major rewrite of the state's health care program in 2006 that featured a mandate on individuals. Everyone in the state must enroll in a plan or face tax penalties. It's true that Romney vetoed the teeth behind part of the mandate â a charge to companies that didn't offer coverage to employees â which was later overridden by the state Legislature.
 
So, Giuliani is correct that Romney enacted a ""mandate"" plan, though Romney has sought to avoid that term. Giuliani also is correct that the program in Massachusetts shares some things with the health care proposal put forward by Sen. Hillary Clinton.
 
Both expand upon the current private-public system. Neither forces changes for those who like their current employer-provided insurance. Both aim to provide coverage for all, with subsidized private plans. And both mandate coverage by penalizing those who can afford to buy a plan but don't.
 
Now, does that mean the Massachusetts program is ""HillaryCare""? We'll take a pass on judging that one.
 
Giuliani's other point is that Romney isn't proposing a national plan similar to what he did in Massachusetts. That's true, too. Romney has argued that population demographics vary so much by state that a universal plan can't be applied across the country.
 
Instead, he has proposed changing the way federal dollars are made available to states â which is what Massachusetts was able to do â so states are free to draw up plans that suit themselves.
 
Add it all up and Giuliani's got it right.

Ridiculous evidence -- but true
","
The campaign of Sen. Hillary Clinton recently trotted out quotes from Sen. Barack Obama's kindergarten teacher to prove that he's been aiming for the White House longer than he admits. Seriously.
 
The conflict between the top Democrats running for president began when Obama said this: ""I have not been planning to run for president for however number of years some of the other candidates have been planning for.""
 
The Clinton campaign responded with a thoroughly researched news release that culled details from Obama's life that had been reported in feature articles about him.
 
""Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years,"" the Clinton news release said. ""So who's not telling the truth, them or him?""
 
The evidence:
 
â¢ Former classmates who said that when he was at Harvard Law School, Obama was ""thinking about politics.""
 
â¢ A brother-in-law saying Obama told him in the early 1990s that he was interested in a run for president.
 
â¢ An essay Obama wrote in third grade called, ""I want to be a president.""
 
â¢ An essay he wrote in kindergarten called, ""I Want To Become President.""
 
PolitiFact set out to confirm those sources.
 
Brad Berenson, a classmate and friend of Obama's at Harvard Law School in the early 1990s, said: ""I certainly never heard him say directly or indirectly that he wanted to be president of the United States. That kind of sentiment would have been absurdly presumptuous at that point.""
 
Now, Obama spent some of his early years in Indonesia, including kindergarten and third grade. We started to track down those teachers living on the other side of the world, but then we realized this goose chase wasn't worth the effort. The Obama campaign is not denying the accuracy of the Clinton reports.
 
Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist, says there's no doubt the Clinton campaign has some facts on its side.
 
""The overall thematic attack that he is out there saying that he is somehow different from someone else in the field, that he is somehow propelled into this race â¦ I think that's absolutely fair game for the Clinton camp to go after,"" said Dunn, a Democratic strategist not aligned with a candidate, but who worked as a consultant to Obama's Hopefund PAC for six months in 2006. ""On the other hand, were they wise in the example they used?""
 
It does appear that Obama expressed ambition for the office of president many years ago. We wish we had a ruling category called ""True, but ridiculous."" We don't, so we're left with True.

Yes, Romney said no.
","On several occasions, Mitt Romney has criticized former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for supporting a bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Arkansas high schools to be eligible for in-state tuition rates at state schools.
 
Romney, on the other hand, has said repeatedly that he opposed a similar measure when he was governor of Massachusetts. He does so in a television ad. That claim is accurate.
 
Romney vetoed a bill in 2004 that would have allowed illegal immigrants who graduated from Massachusetts high schools to pay in-state tuition at state-run colleges and universities.
 
""I hate the idea of in any way making it more difficult for kids, even those who are illegal aliens, to afford college in our state,"" Romney said at the time. ""But equally, perhaps a little more than equally, I do not want to create an incentive to do something which is illegal.""

Romney glosses over in-state tuition details
","
Mitt Romney said a proposed law that Mike Huckabee supported when he was governor of Arkansas would have given ""a tuition break to the children of illegals that are here illegally when citizens are having to pay a higher rate."" There's no disputing Huckabee's position on the measure, but is that an accurate way to characterize it? 
Because they aren't citizens, the children of illegal immigrants are not eligible for in-state tuition rates for state schools, which tend to be significantly lower than the rates charged to out-of-state students. The proposed Arkansas law, similar to laws on the books in other states, would have allowed some illegal immigrants who came to this country as children to receive the same tuition as their classmates. Ten states have passed similar laws, which typically include having students sign statements saying they want to resolve their immigration status. 
At the Republican debate in St. Petersburg, Huckabee articulated a defense to Romney's attacks, saying the bill was intended to give resident students who were not citizens the same chances that their classmates had to attend college. 
""They didn't get something better; they had to earn it,"" Huckabee said. 
(Huckabee also exaggerated some of the regulations for the proposed law in Arkansas; we checked those claims previously  here  .) 
Romney is right that Huckabee supported the measure. But Huckabee is right when he said the illegal immigrants in his state wouldn't have gotten a better deal than legal residents. 
Romney's description of the measure as ""a tuition break"" would have been true only in comparison to citizens who lived outside the state of Arkansas. For Arkansas students who graduate from Arkansas high schools, the law would have given in-state students, illegal or not, the same tuition rate. 
Romney may even realize this point but chose to ignore it. When he vetoed the legislation in Massachusetts in 2004, he said, ""I hate the idea of in any way making it more difficult for kids, even those who are illegal aliens, to afford college in our state. But equally, perhaps a little more than equally, I do not want to create an incentive to do something which is illegal."" That's some distance from his recent comments that the proposal ""makes no sense to me at all."" 
We find his shorthand of a ""tuition break"" for illegal immigrants glosses over a complicated issue to the point where it's somewhat inaccurate. We find that part of his argument Half True.",/factchecks/2007/dec/05/mitt-romney/romney-glosses-over-in-state-tuition-details/
"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
This attack is spot-on
","Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was indeed an original member of the Iraq Study Group, formed at the request of Congress to conduct a bipartisan assessment of the situation in Iraq.
 
And he was either fired or quit from that panel after missing two official meetings.
 
Here's what we know.
 
Giuliani was appointed to the panel in March 2006, then missed two two-day meetings. On the dates of those meetings, he was paid for lucrative speaking appearances elsewhere.
 
On April 11-12, 2006, the first official meeting of the Iraq Study Group was held in Washington, D.C. Where was Giuliani? On April 12, he was a keynote speaker at the FT Asian Financial Centers Summit in South Korea. His net fee: $160,000.
 
The second official meeting of the group was May 18-19, 2006. Where was Giuliani? On May 18, he spoke at the Georgia 100 annual awards breakfast in Atlanta. His net fee: $80,000. Later that day, he attended a $100-a-plate fundraiser for former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed, then a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia.
 
James Baker, secretary of state under the first President Bush, was co-chair of the Iraq Study Group, along with former U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. Baker declined to comment for this story.
 
But his co-chair explains how Giuliani left the group.
 
Hamilton says that after Giuliani told Baker he couldn't attend the second meeting in a row, ""(Baker) said, 'I'm going to have to go to another person.' ""
 
On May 31, 2006, the group announced former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III would replace Giuliani.
 
At the time, Giuliani said: ""My previous time commitments do not permit me the full and active participation that the Iraq Study Group deserves.""
 
It's unclear whether he was fired or forced to quit, but consider this: During his two-month tenure on the panel, between March 15, 2006, and May 24, 2006, Giuliani made 30 paid appearances for a net revenue of $2.25-million, according to his financial disclosure forms.

He says universal, but it's no guarantee
","
Under attack at a recent debate from rival Hillary Clinton on health care, Barack Obama shot back:
 
""Well, let's talk about health care right now because the fact of the matter is that I do provide universal health care. The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated â forced â them to get health care.""
 
Before jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common.
 
One of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like.
 
Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University.
 
Obama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't. Obama's argument is that if you then fine them, you're essentially punishing the poor â and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later.
 
So is it fair for Obama to call his plan ""universal""? Well, not really. Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available, nothing in his plan guarantees it. We rate his claim Barely True.

MikeHuckabee.com features an online store, where supporters can buy T-shirts and baby bibs that read ""I Like Mike."" There's also a Webisode where actor Chuck Norris discusses why he endorsed Huckabee.

Huckabee's success on the Web could also be attributed to voter curiosity.

Hillary Clinton said during a debate in November 2007, ""but when it came time to step up and decide whether or not he would support universal health care coverage, he chose not to do that. His plan would leave 15-million Americans out.""
 
Clinton is accurately quoting studies that estimate how many will be uninsured under Obama's plan. But some experts think the plans don't offer enough detail to create a reliable estimate for such a complex issue, casting doubt on the validity of a hard number.
 
Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as Clinton's plan does. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University.
 
Clinton believes 15-million people would be left uncovered because of that lack of mandate. She based her analysis on an article written by Jonathan Cohn of the

New Republic

who quoted RAND, the Urban Institute and MIT economist Jonathan Gruber.
 
Realistically, though, the claim is an educated guess. Given that 47-million people are uninsured now, 15-million uninsured after Obama's plan doesn't seem unreasonable, according to several experts â it would mean that Obama succeeded in covering almost 70 percent of those currently uninsured. But neither Clinton nor Obama offer hard numbers on what income levels would qualify for what programs. Given the limited data, other experts question the hard number.
 
It's a tough call, but because of the disagreements here, we find her claim to be based on too many hypotheticals to rate more than a Half True.

Study now says Wis. coronavirus cases will peak April 26. But thatâs not the date that went viral.
","Specifics have been hard to come by in this pandemic. We donât know how many people are infected, how fast the coronavirus is spreading or how long we may need to quarantine. So the first study to project a date when each stateâs cases would peak drew a lot of interest -- especially since Wisconsin jumped off the virtual page. The study, released March 26, 2020, said cases wouldnât peak in Wisconsin until May 22, 2020 â a month later than most states, and nearly two weeks later than any other state in the nation. The date went viral. News outlets across the state picked it up, and one writeup of the story from Madison365.com received nearly 40,000 comments, reactions and shares on Facebook in a day. And then the study changed. An updated analysis posted four days after the original study moved Wisconsinâs projected peak by almost a month to April 26, 2020. So whatâs up with the shift? Which date is right? This post, when the study offered a May peak, was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)Â  Hereâs what we found. The analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation â an independent research center based at the University of Washington â developed a model projecting coronavirus growth across the United States for the next four months. It projects deaths as well as a variety of measures of hospital utilization â beds used, intensive care unit days and ventilators days used. That estimate was based on COVID-19 deaths so far, data on hospital capacity and use and more detailed coronavirus hospitalization data available in some localities. The institute estimates the pandemic would peak nationally around mid-April and result in more than 80,000 deaths, a summary of the study said. The state-by-state projections were based on a statistical model â essentially a detailed formula that projects the future virus spread based on death rates and other data available to this point. And those projections moved a lot after the initial release. Four days after the original publication, on March 30, 2020, researchers added 1,730 nationwide deaths to the model and tweaked the methodology. They said the updates created more precise estimates The updated projections changed the estimated peak for all but four states. Wisconsin moved the most, to 26 days earlier, but several others saw dramatic shifts as well. Marylandâs estimated peak moved to 25 days later, Missouri to 21 days later and Idaho to 13 days sooner. Ali Mokdad, a senior faculty member at the institute, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the original model â started around the beginning of March â assumed Wisconsin would have a Safer at Home-style order in place about two weeks sooner than it did. Gov. Tony Evers issued the order banning all but essential services and travel on March 24, 2020. The update factors in that actual date along with additional death data, which dramatically changed the modelâs analysis of the state. The new projected peak for Wisconsin, April 26, 2020, is still later than what state health officials are saying. Wisconsin Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm said March 30, 2020, the state expected the curve to begin flattening (i.e. peaking) in about 10 days.

Trump blames past administrations for a flawed COVID-19 test. The test couldnât have existed earlier
","President Donald Trump deflected blame for the slow start of testing for the new coronavirus in the United States. ""We inherited a broken test,"" he said on Fox Newsâ ""Fox and Friends"" March 30.Â  Trump said much the same the day before during a Rose Garden press conference. ""We took over a dead, barren system,"" Trump said. ""That didnât work, because when CDC first looked at their test, the biggest problem they had is, the test didnât work. That wasnât from us. Thatâs been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world."" Trumpâs assertion that the test ""wasnât from us,"" gets things backwards. There could be no test for the virus that causes COVID-19 until the virus emerged.Â  Trumpâs claim that his administration inherited a broken test ""doesnât make sense,"" said infectious disease researcher Christopher Mores at George Washington Universityâs School of Public Health. ""The (Centers for Disease Control) designed it and validated it and deployed it,"" Mores said. ""It has since been found to have multiple problems and has been changed to address some of these."" China officially reported the new disease Dec. 31, 2019. It sent a genetic map of the viral DNA to the world community Jan. 7, 2020.Â  Within 10 days, a German lab had published a recipe for a test to detect the virus. The World Health Organization adopted that test and began helping low- and middle-income countries roll it out. RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic The first case of COVID-19 appeared in the United States on Jan. 21, and by Feb. 5, the CDC was sending test kits to state health agencies. But there was a hitch. The tests needed clean reagents, chemicals essential to providing reliable results. Some of the reagents were tainted and states had to send their samples to be tested back to the CDC. All of this cost public health officials precious time learning how far the coronavirus had spread. By mid February, CDC and state labs had tested just under 2,200 samples. This was at a time when South Korea had performed over 7,900 tests.Â  According to the COVID Tracking Project, by March 29, the country had conducted more than 831,000 tests. Trump has incorrectly blamed the Obama administration for creating a policy that hamstrung the development of a testing regime. It is true that Food and Drug Administration rules slowed the process for private labs, but that practice dated back to the days of the President George W. Bush administration. Trump also falsely said the WHO had a bad test. Three independent labs validated that test. We asked the White House how a previous administration could be responsible for a test created three years into the Trump presidency. We did not hear back. Trump said that his administration inherited a broken test. That flies in the face of logic. There could be no test until the virus emerged.

Congress did not give itself a raise in the coronavirus stimulus package
","The $2 trillion economic relief package that President Donald Trump signed March 27 is aimed at giving aid to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. But some widely shared posts on Facebook claim the legislation helps Congress more than workers. While the stimulus, officially known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, will dole out $1,200 checks to every adult making less than $75,000 per year, a March 26 post says the cash is pennies compared to the pay raise that legislators are giving themselves. ""Congress wants $25 million for raises. Thatâs $46,700 each,"" the text post reads. ""Now whoâs thinking of you."" Another post, published March 20, asserts that the House of Representatives voted to award its members an extra $8,000 per month instead of giving aid to senior citizens. A March 25 post is even more specific, claiming the congressional pay raise is on page 134 of the stimulus. The posts were flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Collectively, theyâve been shared more than 140,000 times. (Screenshot from Facebook) The CARES Act is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. The legislation offers economic support in the form of small business loans, tax cuts, and health-related spending. In addition to sending cash to everyday Americans, the law will give aid to the airline industry, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Weâve seen a lot of misinformation about the stimulus, so we wanted to look into these Facebook posts to see if thereâs any truth to them.Â  While the CARES Act does allocate money to some Capitol employees, there is nothing in the legislation that gives a pay raise to members of Congress. Several fact-checkers have debunked the claim. ""The CARES Act does not provide either a pay raise or any funding for Member salaries,"" said Evan Hollander, communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, in an email. ""Likewise, no version of the legislation â House or Senate â ever included provisions for a Member pay raise or funding for salaries."" We checked page 134 of the stimulus package as it appeared on March 25, when one of the Facebook posts was published. It contains information about grants given to states that have ""short-time compensation programs,"" which are alternatives to layoffs for employers that experience a reduction in available work. Under the programs, employees who have their hours cut are permitted to collect a percentage of unemployment benefits to make up for lost wages. RELATED: The Senate stimulus bill: Whatâs in it for you The March 25 version of the CARES Act said nothing about pay increases for Congress. Neither does the final version of the stimulus. Hollander said there is $25 million in the stimulus to ""support the Houseâs capability to telework,"" including equipment purchases and improvements to the network. There is also money for reimbursing the staff of the House Child Care Center, covering the costs of food service contracts and paying the House sergeant-at-arms. Meanwhile, the Senate is slated to get $10 million from the stimulus. $1 million will go to the sergeant-at-arms to remain available for coronavirus response while $9 million will be reserved for ""miscellaneous items,"" including reimbursement for workers at the Senate Employee Child Care Center.

Reporter was right: Trump did question governorsâ ventilator requests
","President Donald Trump argued with ""PBS NewsHour"" reporter Yamiche Alcindor over what the president had said, or hadnât said, about New Yorkâs need for ventilators. Ventilators are a type of medical equipment considered vital for saving the lives of patients hit hardest by the virus. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made urgent calls for more ventilators to cope with a rising number of hospitalizations in his state due to coronavirus. ""All the predictions say you could have an apex needing 140,000 beds and about 40,000 ventilators,"" Cuomo told reporters March 27, citing estimates by Weill Cornell Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and McKinsey & Co. Anthony Fauci, a leading infectious-disease specialist who is on the White Houseâs coronavirus task force, told CNN, ""There are a lot of different calculations. My experience, I tend to believe Gov. Cuomo.""Â  The exchange between Trump and Alcindor came during a March 29 Rose Garden press conference. It unfolded this way: Alcindor: ""You've said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need. You said New York might need â"" Trump: ""I didnât say that."" Alcindor: ""â might not need 30,000."" Trump: ""I didnât say that."" Alcindor: ""You said it on Sean Hannityâs, Fox News."" Trump: ""I didnât say â come on. Come on."" The exchange continued, with Trump at one point telling Alcindor, ""Be nice. Donât be threatening."" He later cut her off before she was able to ask her second question, although another reporter subsequently handed her the microphone so that she could ask it. Here, weâll look at the substance of the dispute between Trump and Alcindor. Which of them was right about what he said during a March 26 phone interview on Hannityâs show on Fox News?Â  Alcindor was. When we looked at Trumpâs interview with Hannity, we found two portions in which Trump addressed this question. Hereâs the first: ""Gov. Cuomo and others that say we want, you know, 30,000 of them (ventilators). 30,000! All right. Think of this. You know, you go to hospitals, they'll have one in a hospital. And now, all of a sudden everybody's asking for these vast numbers."" Later, Hannity picked up on this theme. Hannity said he was ""kind of angry at Andrew Cuomo. I had a great â I had him on radio for 40 minutes, great conversation. I grew up in â I was born and raised in New York. And then it's, âI need 30,000 ventilators.â And I'm like OK, it really â it was annoying me."" Trump subsequently echoed this sentiment. ""New York is a bigger deal. But it's going to go also. But I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you're going to major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now, all of a sudden, they're saying, can we order 30,000 ventilators?"" So, contrary to Trumpâs repeated denials during the press conference, this passage clearly shows that the president told Hannity that he feels the numbers of ventilators being requested by governors, including Cuomo, are higher than whatâs needed. Trump told Alcindor that ""I didnât say that"" some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don't actually need. Thatâs directly refuted by Trumpâs comments during Hannityâs show, in which he said, ""I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to be. I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators."" We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2020/mar/30/donald-trump/reporter-was-right-trump-did-question/

Ads attack Jill Karofsky over sexual assault sentence, but she wasnât even involved
","With the April 7, 2020 election bearing down, a national Republican group has jumped in the race for Wisconsin Supreme Court, attacking challenger Jill Karofsky. Liberal groups have lined up behind Karofsky in her battle against incumbent Daniel Kelly and his conservative backers. At stake is a 10-year seat on the stateâs highest court, where conservatives currently hold a 5-2 majority. The Republican State Leadership Committee released multiple ads March 26, 2020, addressing Karofskyâs time as a Dane County prosecutor 20 years ago. Backed by the requisite ominous music, one ad says this: ""Liberal Jill Karofsky â dangerously soft on crime. As prosecutor, Karofsky even went easy on criminal predators, like no jail time for a monster who sexually assaulted a 5-year-old girl."" A second ad uses almost identical wording, saying ""as a prosecutor, she went easy on criminal predators."" In both ads, on-screen text notes the case in question is that of Donald A. Worley. But a closer look at the case file reveals a major oversight in the ad. Hereâs what we found. The Republican State Leadership Committee â which seeks to elect down-ballot state officials â is no stranger to Wisconsin politics. It made late forays into a number of previous races, including ads in support of conservative Brian Hagedorn in his successful 2019 Supreme Court bid and in support of Republicans when they took over control of the state Legislature in 2010. This time around it's spending itsÂ money attacking Karofsky by highlighting the Worley case. Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is also funding airtime for the ad. The Madison man, then 26, was charged in February 1999 with child enticement and first-degree sexual assault of a child â serious felonies that carried decades of potential prison time. A plea agreement reached in March 2000 reduced both offenses to misdemeanors, and Worley was sentenced to three years probation with no jail time, online court records show. Those online records list Karofsky as the prosecutor, which is what both groups pointed to when asked for evidence backing the ad. But they missed a critical detail: online court records list only the most recent prosecutor. Many district attorneys' offices have different prosecutors handle hearings over the course of a given case, and thatâs what happened here. The prosecutionâs file from Worleyâs case, provided by Karofskyâs team, details which prosecutor handled different elements of the case. The prosecuting attorney for each appearance initials the file, and Dan Martinâs initials are listed alongside appearances from the preliminary hearing in February 1999 to the request to close the case in March 2000 following the sentencing hearing. So Martin âÂ not Karofsky âÂ was at the controls when the plea deal was made. The file shows Karofsky didnât touch the case until more than a year after the plea agreement and sentencing. She represented the office for a motion hearing in July 2001, where the state requested that Worley not be allowed to remain in his family residence. Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne confirmed the accuracy of the case file record in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Karofksyâs campaign issued a news release March 27, 2020, demanding the ads be taken down, and noting a cease-and-desist letter would be issued. A pair of attack adsÂ say Karofsky was ""soft"" as a prosecutor because she allowed Worley to get away with no jail time. But Karofsky didnât touch the case until more than a year after the plea agreement reducing the charges and the sentencing imposing no jail time. The ad is based on sloppy research that misunderstood the meaning of the online case records.

Conservative group's meme distorts Nevadaâs chloroquine restrictions
","A malaria drug that could potentially be used to treat COVID-19 has become the latest political touchpoint of the coronavirus pandemic. A meme published on Facebook by Turning Point USA, a conservative group that targets high school and college students, claims Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak bucked doctorsâ recommendations and outlawed the use of chloroquine to treat the coronavirus. ""WHAT?! Nevadaâs Leftist Governor Has Banned The Use Of An Anti-Malaria Drug That Might Help Cure Coronavirus!"" reads the caption on the meme, which was posted March 25, 2020. ""Big Government Is Deadly!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 10,000 times. (Screenshot from Facebook) Weâve seen a lot of confusion about chloroquine, which is also prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, and its application to COVID-19. So we wanted to check out Turning Point USAâs post. While Sisolak has limited the prescription of chloroquine for coronavirus patients, the move isnât a ban âÂ and his order didnât contradict doctorsâ advice about the drug, as this post suggests. Health officials and federal regulators have urged caution when using the drug to treat COVID-19 until more research is done. The order is also intended to prevent hoarding, so patients who need the drug still have access to it.Â  Sisolak has restricted prescribing chloroquine for COVID-19. But the order has an exemption for doctors issuing the drug to patients in hospitals and emergency rooms. On March 24, Sisolak, a Democrat, signed an emergency regulation that safeguards the supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which is sold under the brand name Plaquenil and as a generic. The order prohibits doctors in outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing the drugs for COVID-19 treatment. It also limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies. ""While the two drugs serve necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevadaâs own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,"" Sisolak said during a press conference. ""The emergency regulation is aimed at preventing the hoarding of the drugs so those that actually need them can have access to them."" Sisolakâs order came after President Donald Trump touted the potential of chloroquine in treating COVID-19 patients during a March 19 press conference, saying it could be a ""game changer"" and a ""tremendous breakthrough."" RELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic News outlets first reported that Sisolakâs action was a ban on using chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. But that coverage missed a key fact: there is an exemption. A spokesman for Sisolak told KSNV-TV in Las Vegas that the regulation allows for a ""chart order for an inpatient in an institutional setting,"" meaning that doctors in hospitals and emergency rooms can still prescribe chloroquine to treat patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The Associated Press, for one, corrected its initial story on the order to reflect that exemption. So while Sisolakâs order does restrict the prescription of chloroquine in Nevada, it does not constitute an outright ban, as Turning Point USAâs meme claims. Nevada health officials advocated for restricting chloroquine prescriptions given the potential for hoarding. Thatâs different from Turning Point USAâs post, which makes it look like Sisolak disregarded physiciansâ recommendations by issuing the emergency regulation. In a March 20 letter, the stateâs Board of Pharmacy noted that ""safety and efficacy have not been established"" for the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19. Its guidance allowed for the use of chloroquine to treat coronavirus patients, but only as treatment âÂ not prevention. ""In the effort to prevent the stockpiling of these medications, the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy is restricting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine,"" wrote J. David Wuest, executive secretary of the board. RELATED: Fact-checking COVID-19 prevention, treatment myths As several news outlets have reported, physicians around the country have started to fraudulently prescribe themselves chloroquine in order to hoard it for their families. That hoarding has led to drug shortages in some parts of the country, affecting patients who take chloroquine regularly to treat conditions like lupus and arthritis. Still, Sisolakâs order was quickly criticized by organizations like Turning Point USA and politicians like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who tweeted March 25 that the governor was ""trying to score political points against Trump."" Turning Point USAâs meme makes it seem like chloroquine is a potential cure for the coronavirus. But the science is not settled. Trumpâs March 19 remarks on chloroquine were based on a recent French study that found the malaria drug could be effective in treating patients with COVID-19. The authors, which include researchers from universities in France and Vietnam, concluded that the use of chloroquine sped up healing, and the effect was reinforced by adding azithromycin, an antibiotic.Â  But the study was based on only 20 people in France with COVID-19, and public health experts quickly put the findings into perspective. On March 19, the Food and Drug Administration published a statement in which it said that while ""there are no FDA-approved therapeutics or drugs to treat, cure or prevent COVID-19,"" the agency is investigating whether chloroquine ""can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms."" During a press conference on March 20, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also tempered expectations for the malaria drug, saying the French study was based on anecdotal evidence. RELATED: A 100% COVID-19 cure? No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal ""The information that you're referring to specifically is anecdotal; it was not done in a controlled clinical trial,"" Fauci told a reporter. ""So you really can't make any definitive statement about it."" Based on that limited data, chloroquine is recommended for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug is ""currently under investigation in clinical trials."" We reached out to Turning Point USA for a comment, but we havenât heard back. Turning Point USA said in a Facebook post that Sisolak banned the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 against doctorsâ recommendations. Nevadaâs emergency regulation restricts the prescription of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients in outpatient settings, but not in hospitals and emergency rooms. Sisolak signed the order on the recommendation of state health officials, who said the safety and efficacy of chloroquine in treating the coronavirus is unproven, and there is a potential for stockpiling the drug. While the Facebook post touts the potential of chloroquine in curing COVID-19, federal health officials and regulators have said that, as of now, the effectiveness of the drug is anecdotal. More research and clinical trials are needed before drawing a conclusion. Turning Point USAâs post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Fact-checking whether Biden called Trump âxenophobicâ for restrictions on travel from China
","Amid criticism of his administrationâs response to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump routinely flags one action as efficient and bold: restricting travel from China into the United States. Trump has said he instituted a travel ban against everyoneâs wishes and that ""nobody,"" not even doctors, wanted him to restrict travel. But ""probably tens of thousands"" of people would be dead now if he hadnât done so, he claimed on Fox News March 24. At the same time, heâs claimed that former Vice President Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic nomination for president, called him racist and xenophobic for restricting entry from China. ""I had Biden calling me xenophobic,"" Trump said on Sean Hannityâs Fox News prime-time show March 26. ""He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in."" Trump has said that about Biden at least three other times â on Twitter, at a White House briefing, and during the Fox News town hall. But Biden has not directly said that the travel restriction was xenophobic. He has used that phrase in reference to Trump and his handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Bidenâs campaign told PolitiFact that Bidenâs tweets were not specific to the restrictions on people coming from China. The White House press office said Trumpâs claim is supported by a tweet Biden posted Feb. 1, the day after the Trump administration announced travel restrictions on people who were in China 14 days prior to their attempted entry into the United States. Biden tweeted: ""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science â not Donald Trumpâs record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."" But Biden did not explicitly tie xenophobia to the travel restriction. His tweet reflects coronavirus remarks he made during a campaign stop in Iowa Jan. 31, the day the travel restrictions were announced. Biden said: ""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science."" Biden again used the word ""xenophobic"" in March â once at a press conference and once in response to a Trump tweet. In the first, Biden was criticizing Trump for labeling coronavirus a ""foreign"" virus. In the second, itâs not clear whether Bidenâs use of the word was in direct reference to the travel restriction. During a March 12 press conference Biden said, the United States should not be overly dismissive of the outbreak, ""but neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia, labeling COVID-19 a foreign virus does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration."" Earlier that day, the Trump campaign tweeted that Democrats and news outlets were ""accusing President Trump of racism and xenophobia"" for his use of the phrase ""Chinese virus."" On March 18, Trump tweeted: ""I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the âbordersâ from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!"" Biden replied the same day: ""Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job."" Stop the xenophobic fear-mongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job. https://t.co/nQ5aLVrpyb The tweet that Biden responded to included the phrase ""Chinese virus,"" which experts say could foster discrimination toward people of Chinese or Asian origin. Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said Biden ""has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak. This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions."" Travel restrictions that are supported by science, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy can be warranted, Bates said. Speaking of his restriction on travel from China, Trump said, ""I had Biden calling me xenophobic. â¦ . He called me a racist, because of the fact that he felt it was a racist thing to stop people from China coming in."" Biden has not directly said that the restrictions were xenophobic. Around the time the Trump administration announced the travel restriction, Biden said that Trump had a ""record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering."" Biden used the phrase ""xenophobic"" in reply to a Trump tweet about limiting entry to travelers from China and in which he described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus."" Biden did not spell out which part of Trumpâs tweet was xenophobic. Trumpâs statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Has Gov. Tony Evers banned family dinners amid Wisconsinâs coronavirus pandemic? Yes and no
","Itâs hard to find something that hasnât changed in Wisconsin amid the coronavirus pandemic â work, school, church, home. On the eve of Gov. Tony Eversâ ""Safer at Home"" order limiting all non-essential movement, a Republican lawmaker lamented the last item on that list. ""Laura, my eight children and I are enjoying our last legal dinner together this evening from our spring break staycation,"" state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, said in a March 24, 2020, tweet. Eversâ 16-page order â which took effect March 25, 2020 â has sweeping consequences throughout the state, but does it really ban family dinners? Letâs take a closer look. At first glance, Stroebelâs claim to legal limitations within his home might sound off base. The order explicitly makes an allowance for family units. It says Wisconsinites ""do not need to maintain social distancing between family members in a single living unit or household members."" A later section adds, ""Nothing in this Order prohibits the gathering of members of a single household or living unit."" Laura, my eight children and I are enjoying our last legal dinner together this evening from our spring break staycation. https://t.co/Cllv1Gbgho But it turns out Stroebel wasnât referencing a single household. John Soper, Stroebelâs chief of staff, said in an email the senatorâs eight children range in age from 14 to 29. Only three of those children live at home, while five have their own residences. ""Governor Evers mentioned specifically âdinner partiesâ as an activity that must stop under the new Order,"" Soper said. ""Senator Stroebel put out this tweet to highlight that there is no exemption for meeting immediate family (adult children, grandparents etc.), but there is for places like liquor stores and dry cleaners."" That changes the analysis dramatically. Indeed, there is no blanket exception to social distancing requirements for extended or even immediate family members if they live separately. Hereâs the key line from Eversâ order: ""All public and private gatherings of any number of people that are not part of a single household or living unit are prohibited, except for the limited purposes expressly permitted in this Order."" Those ""limited purposes"" include things like providing care or transport for the health and safety of someone in another household. ""Large family dinners that include people who do not live together are prohibited,"" said Melissa Baldauff, Eversâ spokeswoman. She said itâs a requirement that affects everyone, including Evers. ""Thatâs really hard on extended families, we get it,"" she said in an email. ""The governorâs grown kids and their families arenât coming to visit him and the first lady at the executive residence right now. ""But thatâs the sacrifice we are asking of everyone in this state. Stay home and limit the number of people you have contact with. This kind of distancing is one of the most effective ways of stopping the spread of the disease."" Stroebel said in a tweet before the stay-at-home order that he was having his ""last legal dinner"" with his wife and eight children. Though this is technically true for Stroebelâs family, people reading this tweet could well take away that their own one-household family canât get together to eat. To that extent, the tweet is misleading.Â  Thereâs a key difference between families that still live together under the same roof and those like Stroebelâs with adult children â to the point that Eversâ order allows one and bans the other. So Stroebel is accurate, but only if you take into account key details that werenât included in his tweet. Thatâs our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2020/mar/27/duey-stroebel/has-gov-tony-evers-banned-family-dinners-amid-wisc/

No, a new lawsuit doesn't say Pennsylvania registered the dead to vote
","Two months before Pennsylvania voters cast their presidential primary ballots, one of the stateâs most populous counties is facing a federal lawsuit over maintenance of its voter rolls. Conservative website The Patriot Journal published a story about the lawsuit with the headline: ""Swing State Hit With 2020 Voting Lawsuit - Accused Of Registering Over 1,500 Deceased People In Pennsylvania."" We wondered whether the lawsuit really alleged registration of the dearly departed â one of the oldest dirty tricks in politics. There is a lawsuit, but it wasnât filed against Pennsylvania, a pivotal swing state. The Public Interest Legal Foundation, an Indiana-based nonprofit led by a former member of President Donald Trumpâs defunct voter fraud commission, filed suit against Allegheny County elections officials last month. The complaint alleges that the county violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 by not making a ""reasonable effort"" to remove ineligible votersâ names from its registration lists. Similar lawsuits have been filed against dozens of other counties across the country by a man committed to preventing non-citizens from casting ballots in U.S. elections. J. Christian Adams, the Trump appointee who leads the nonprofit, for years has warned about states improperly pushing noncitizens onto their voter rolls. In 2016, the group published a report titled ""Alien Invasion in Virginia"" about its research into the problem in that state. Critics accuse Adams of peddling baseless claims about voter fraud and putting unsuspecting voters at risk of disenfranchisement. Does this latest lawsuit filed by the activist nonprofit allege that Allegheny County elections officials registered the dead to vote or that a deceased person has actually cast a ballot? No.Â  The complaint states that when the group obtained and reviewed the countyâs voter list last fall, it found 1,500 deceased voters whose registrations should have been canceled but remain active. The group also found more than 3,700 sets of duplicate, triplicate and quadruplicate voter registration records and more than 7,400 instances of failure to correctly process votersâ name changes. The lawsuit doesnât allege that the county improperly registered anyone to vote, rather that the county hasnât done enough to keep its list of active voters up to date. State and federal law require counties to purge their rolls anytime a voter moves out of state, dies or requests removal in writing. We called Allegheny County Manager of Elections David Voye to find out how often he does list maintenance and to ask whether the county had discovered any suspicious instances of dead voters rising to cast ballots. But we havenât heard back. When asked about the lawsuit by a reporter for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, he said each citizen registered to vote gets one vote, and ""there are no allegations (in the lawsuit) that anything to the contrary has occurred."" Â ""As is always the case with voter registration list maintenance, the utmost care will be taken to ensure that no one is disenfranchised,"" Voye said. The Patriot Journal headline stated that a swing state had been accused of registering hundreds of dead Pennsylvanians to vote.Â  The claim gets some critical facts false. The lawsuit was filed against county elections officials, not the state. And the complaint doesnât allege registration of the dead. It alleges that the county officials havenât done enough to remove deceased voters from the rolls. We rate this statement Mostly False.Â  This story has been updated to reflect that while the nonprofit behind the lawsuitÂ has warned aboutÂ states pushing noncitizens onto their voter rolls, the lawsuits the group files are not explicitly designed to stop an alien invasion at the ballot box.Â ",/factchecks/2020/mar/27/blog-posting/no-new-lawsuit-doesnt-say-pennsylvania-registered-/

Justice Kelly's claim to 'maverick' title relies on old analysis
","State Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly likes to paint himself as a ""constitutional textualist."" Kellyâs bid to hold onto his seat against Dane County Circuit Judge Jill Karofsky in the April 7, 2020 election has pitted conservatives and liberals against each other, with the state GOP and President Donald Trump backing Kelly, while Karofsky has the support of Democrats.Â  But Kelly claims that on the bench he sets aside his conservative views and focuses only on the letter of the law.Â  He made that argument again during a March 8, 2020 interview on WISN TVâs UpFront, and used a blog run by a Marquette law professor to bolster his claim. That professor, Kelly said, found no correlation between his opinions and conservative background and even called him a maverick. ""He starts out with what he believes he knows about my politics, and then he compares the opinions that I write and join,"" Kelly said. ""Heâs looking to see if thereâs any necessary correlation between the two. And his conclusion was that thereâs not a necessary correlation there, and in fact, he called me a maverick."" A professor who analyzes state Supreme Court justices did suggest Kelly could be a maverick among conservatives â in 2017, and in one type of case. But a more recent review of opinions indicates that title may belong to another justice. So how does Kellyâs claim stack up? The blog Kelly referenced, SCOWstats, is run by Marquette University history professor Alan Ball.Â  When asked for evidence to back Kellyâs claim, his campaign referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to an Oct. 16, 2017 post by Ball titled ""Justice Kelly a Maverick? An Update on Fourth Amendment Cases."" In that piece, Ball found that Kelly and Justice Rebecca Bradley were more receptive to Fourth Amendment arguments than their predecessors.Â  Reminder: The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects people against ""unreasonable searches and seizures.""Â  Most Fourth Amendment cases that come before the state Supreme Court are criminal ones, Ball told PolitiFact Wisconsin. That could mean the search of a vehicle in a drug case, as one example. Liberal justices tend to be more sympathetic to defendants, Ball said, while conservatives often support the state and agree the evidence was admissible. Ball noted that Kelly had only cast a small number of votes at the time of writing and said ""this early impression will need to be checked against the results from subsequent terms.""Â  But Ball was struck by an opinion written by Kelly that cautioned against giving the state Legislature the power to erode peopleâs constitutional rights, using arguments that could have come from a more liberal justice. ""There are certain parts of the State that experience a disproportionate amount of crime,"" Kelly wrote in his opinion for State of Wisconsin v. Navdeep S. Brar. ""Perhaps the legislature might decide police need greater access to homes and other buildings in such areas."" To Ball, that opinion and Kellyâs receptiveness to Fourth Amendment arguments distinguished him from other conservatives. ""Thus, if one were asked to predict who might emerge, if only occasionally, as a maverick among the courtâs five âconservativesâ in the upcoming term, the most conceivable candidate could well be Justice Kelly, and a promising place to look for evidence of this would be his separate opinions in Fourth Amendment criminal cases,"" Ball wrote. While Kelly cited the post as evidence that heâs an independent thinker, itâs not quite that straightforward.Â  Pay attention to Ballâs phrasing. He didnât outright call Kelly a maverick â he instead speculated that the justice could emerge as a possible, but only occasional maverick. Plus, Ball wrote that post after Kellyâs first term and focused only on Fourth Amendment cases. Thatâs certainly not enough for Kelly to hinge his identity on.Â  Kellyâs claim also omits some key information: Ball wrote another, more recent, blog post assigning the title of maverick to someone else. On Jan. 30, 2020, Ball argued in a post that Justice Rebecca Bradley is proving to be more independent than Kelly. The two were in lockstep during the 2016-17 term, Ballâs data show, but Bradley has increasingly deviated from her fellow conservatives. In 2018-19, for example, Kelly voted with conservative Chief Justice Patience Roggensack on two more cases than Bradley, according to Ball. Kelly voted with Justice Annette Ziegler 74% of the time that term, compared to 63% for Bradley. So far this term, Kelly has voted with Roggensack and Ziegler on every case, while Bradley has only voted with them 43% of the time. Ball expects that gap to close as the term progresses, but said Bradley â as it stands now â is still twice as likely to disagree with other conservatives than Kelly. ""If you wanted to call any of them a maverick, she would be a better candidate this year than Kelly,"" he said.Â  Translation: Kelly is relying on an outdated analysis as evidence of his independence. In a TV interview, Kelly claimed that a Marquette law professor called him a ""maverick"" and found no correlation between Kelly's opinions and conservative background. The professor analyzed Kellyâs rulings on Fourth Amendment cases in 2017 and determined that Kelly ""might"" emerge as a maverick after standing out among his fellow conservatives. But thatâs hardly enough to stake an identity on. And earlier this year, Ball awarded the label to a new justice: Rebecca Bradley. Kellyâs claim completely disregards the most up-to-date analysis of his opinions.Â  A statement is Mostly False when it contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/mar/27/daniel-kelly/justice-kellys-claim-maverick-title-relies-old-ana/

Thereâs no evidence COVID-19 can survive on surfaces up to 17 days
","A CNBC story circulating on Facebook displayed a misleading headline that claimed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the coronavirus ""survived"" in cruise ship cabins for up to 17 days.Â  The headline, which has since been changed, led some Facebook users who shared the story to believe that the CDC now says the virus can survive on surfaces that long.Â  The organization has made no such statement. The story was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Knowing the facts has never been more important. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.  The World Health Organization says itâs not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses: ""Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)."" New CDC research conducted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship found traces of the coronavirus on some of the shipâs surfaces up to 17 days after passengers disembarked. But traces are not the same thing as live viruses.Â  The report doesnât conclude that the virus ""survived"" on any of the surfaces that long and the CDC hasnât issued an official statement that gives that assessment, either. Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at Yale University, also told us it was the presence of the virus that was found, not a live sample. ""The CDC report examined the presence of viral RNA on various surfaces of the cruise ship. They found viral RNA up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the Diamond Princess,"" Iwasaki wrote in an email. ""A piece of viral RNA is not the same thing as a live infectious virus. In order for a virus to be infectious, it has to have intact membrane, spike protein and the whole intact genome (there are close to 30,000 bases of genetic code in the viral genome)."" We previously looked at how long the virus can survive on certain surfaces in a recent fact-check and found research suggesting it can live for up to three hours in the air, four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and three days on plastic and stainless steel. Itâs important to note that the study hasnât been peer-reviewed and more research is needed. The WHO and other health experts recommend that people disinfect surfaces often and wash their hands to avoid contracting or spreading the virus. More research needs to be done, but there is no evidence that the coronavirus can surive for up to 17 days on various surfaces.

Trucking news website Transportation Nation reported that one trucking group reached out to McDonaldâs on March 18 asking for changes to be made to allow truckers easier access to food. ""Truckers are having a difficult time finding food on the road due to various closures because of the national emergency,"" wrote James Lamb, president of the 15,000-member Small Business in Transportation Coalition. ""We are told they are being refused service when they walk up to your drive thru windows because they are not in sedans and their 80,000 lb. big rig trucks do not fit through your drive thru driveways."" Lamb asked the company to make temporary accommodations for trucker customers. McDonaldâs responded by creating a curbside ordering system. The fast-food chain pointed PolitiFact to a March 23 statement that addresses the issue: ""As the world continues to address the quickly changing landscape, we are in this together with you, our valued friends in the trucking and transportation industry.

Checking Cornyn on Chinese culture and coronavirus
","In separate interviews with reporters on March 18, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said China has been the source of multiple recent contagions breaking out because of what he called a culture of eating some animals such as bats, snakes and dogs. In remarks captured by The Hill, Cornyn said this applies to the new coronavirus. ""China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the swine flu and now the coronavirus,"" he said. ""I think they have a fundamental problem and I don't object to geographically identifying where it is coming from."" He made a similar comment on a weekly conference call with reporters in Texas, stating that the ""open meat markets that serve everything from bats to tapirs to snake to dog meat"" allow viruses to jump from animals to humans. The Hillâs video clip of Cornynâs remark was shared thousands of times on social media, so weâll focus on fact-checking that statement, keeping the context of his second claim in mind. Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie said Cornynâs statement is referring to the culture behind so-called wet markets in China. ""If people didnât eat that type of meat, wet markets would not exist,"" he said in an interview, referencing the animals Cornyn identified in his remarks. Letâs dive in. SARS, MERS and Swine Flu Before we address the parts of Cornynâs claim related to the coronavirus, letâs take a look at his assertion that the viruses SARS, MERS and swine flu originated in China. Cornyn is right about SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which was first reported in 2003 in the Guangdong province of southern China, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. SARS is thought to be an animal virus, but its source remains uncertain. It is believed to have spread from the source animal to other animals and infected humans, according to the World Health Organization. But Cornyn is wrong about where the first MERS and swine flu cases were reported. Brandewie said Cornyn misspoke when included them in his list. MERS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, according to theÂ CDC. Swine flu, or the H1N1 flu, was first identified in humans in the United States in 2009, according to the CDC. Transmission of the virus The first part of Cornynâs claim states that people in China ""eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that."" But Peter Li, associate professor of East Asian Politics at the University of Houston, said this type of cuisine is not representative of Chinese culture. ""Chinese as a whole do not have wildlife eating habit,"" Li said in an email. ""It is the eating habit of a small number of people, just like a small number of people in the U.S. dare to eat rattlesnakes or the like. â¦ The eating habit is not Chinese and not traditional."" Even considering the small population that may consume these animals, Adam Kamradt-Scott, an associate professor of global health security at the University of Sydney in Australia, said ""The consumption of exotic meats is not, in itself, the problem."" ""The issue is instead the level and extent of the human-animal interface that wet markets permit,"" he said in an email. ""Having said this, we have yet to identify the host animal for the COVID-19 virus. â¦ It has also not been verified whether the COVID-19 virus infected humans at the wet market in Wuhan, only that some of the first cases to be identified had a history of having visited the wet market."" The CDCâs situation page for the new virus states that early cases in China ""had some link"" to the market, as did numerous news articles highlighted by Brandewie in response to PolitiFactâs inquiry. But researchers have yet to pinpoint when, where or how the virus was transmitted from animals to humans. ""It was originally suggested that it began at the Wuhan fish market, but there is no longer good evidence to support that,"" said Vincent Racaniello, a virology professor in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at Columbia University who is researching the virus. ""The first case was not associated with that market and now we think there were earlier clusters in November not associated with the market."" Racaniello pointed to a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of January by researchers in China looking at the first 425 confirmed cases of the virus. The data shows that while the first reported cases of the new virus were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, the first identified case of the virus predated the publicly reported cases and was found in a person with no connection to the market. Other researchers also identified early cases unrelated to the market. In the March 15 episode of his virology podcast, This Week in Virology, Racaniello interviewed coronavirus researcher Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill about the origins of the current pandemic. Baric said researchers have identified numerous SARS-like strains in bats and said it is ""just a question of time for when a human comes in contact with a bat"" carrying these viruses and that sparks a new pandemic. He added that it is entirely possible that the current outbreak was caused by a person in rural China who came into contact with a bat or bat guano and then traveled to Wuhan and started the outbreak.Â  Baric said the initial contact could have occurred in a farmer harvesting bat guano to use as fertilizer or ""just by random chance"" in a person who came into contact with bat guano when a bat flew overhead and its droppings fell. Not strictly cultural Itâs true that markets that sell live animals that are slaughtered on the premises pose a risk or viruses to be transmitted from animals to humans, but experts said this risk exists across the globe and is not unique to China. ""His claim, if it were true, is ridiculous,"" said Li, the University of Houston professor. ""No country in the world monopolizes the outbreaks of epidemics."" Racaniello said that suggesting the new coronavirus is ""spread simply by eating a bat is too simplistic,"" as is pointing only to China as the source of new viruses. ""If you eliminated all eating of bats, you would still have these spillovers,"" he said. ""The four mild coronaviruses we have probably crossed from bats into humans hundreds of years ago â that could have happened anywhere. This is much broader than eating a bat in a meat market. I think thatâs the important key here, that there are a lot of ways for viruses to get from various animals into humans."" Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist and president of the research organization EcoHealth Alliance, said global health experts discussed the potential of a new pandemic in 2018 (labeling it ""Disease X""), as pandemics are on the rise and the worldâs strategy for dealing with these illnesses is ""woefully inadequate,"" in Â op-ed for the New York Times. Daszak wrote: ""These spillovers are increasing exponentially as our ecological footprint brings us closer to wildlife in remote areas and the wildlife trade brings these animals into urban centers. Unprecedented road-building, deforestation, land clearing and agricultural development, as well as globalized travel and trade, make us supremely susceptible to pathogens like coronaviruses."" Science writer David Quammen discussed future risk during an interview on NPRâs Fresh Air in February, and said the reason the globe is seeing more viruses in humans is because we ""are so abundant and so disruptive on this planet that we come in contact with these things."" He continued: ""There's 7.7 billion of us. We're cutting the tropical forests. We're building work camps in those forests and villages. We're eating the wildlife. We're transporting wildlife around the world. We're raising a lot of domestic livestock that become exposed to viruses through wildlife. ""We're doing all these forms of disruption that I say sometimes that you go into a forest and you shake the trees, literally and figuratively, and viruses fall out. And if they fall out of their hosts, they need a new host. And we're there. We're available. We're their opportunity. And then we fly around the world and carry it every which way."" Our Ruling Cornyn said: ""China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine Flu and now the coronavirus."" First of all, Cornyn is wrong that MERS and the Swine Flu were first identified in humans in China. He is right that SARS and the new coronavirus were first identified in humans there.Â  The problem with Cornynâs claim is his assertion that Chinese culture is at fault. Experts said the threat of viral transmission from animal to human is not unique to China, and the risk of this kind of spillover is growing globally as humans come into closer contact with animals. Plus, experts noted that any consumption of the animals Cornyn mentioned is not, in itself, the problem. It is also worth noting that researchers have not pinpointed exactly when, where or how the coronavirus hopped from animals to humans. While early reports indicated that the virus jumped from animals to humans at a seafood market in Wuhan, further study has identified cases predating those in people with no connection to the market. Taken as a whole, Cornynâs statement is not accurate. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/26/john-cornyn/checking-cornyn-chinese-culture-and-coronavirus/
