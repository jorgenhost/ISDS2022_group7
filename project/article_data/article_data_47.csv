Chase half flips on pledge not to launch independent bid for governor
","Del. Amanda Chase threatened to bolt the Republican party and run for governor as an independent last December when the state GOP decided to nominate its 2021 candidate at a convention instead of holding a primary election. She rescinded her threat six days later, after many Republican loyalists accused her of being disloyal to the party. Then, in late March, Chase added a condition to her pledge not to run as an independent, sparking charges from some Republicans that she had gone back on her word.  Let’s examine whether Chase has changed her position.  Chase in December To the chagrin of Chase, the state GOP’s governing board narrowly voted on Dec. 5, 2020 to hold a 2021 nominating convention instead of a primary. Chase withdrew her threat to run as an independent in a Dec. 11 Facebook video. ""I am still advocating for a primary, but I am not going to run as an independent, because if I run as an independent, that would ensure that a D would win, and that, as a true conservative R is not something that I'm willing to do so,"" Chase said. This was a big deal for Republican activists. Chase, who bills herself as ""Trump in heels,"" has significant support from rural voters attracted to her pro-gun, pro-Southern heritage stands, and her promotion of debunked claims that the 2020 presidential election was fixed. With seven candidates seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, Chase stood a decent chance of winning a primary with a plurality vote. But the party made victory harder for her holding a convention, which must be won by a majority vote of delegates - many of them party insiders who dislike her populist style. Still, Republicans have wanted to keep Chase in their tent. The concern is that if she ran as an independent this fall, she would split the conservative vote and ensure the election of a Democrat. Chase in March On March 31, Chase put a caveat on her pledge to support the winner of the GOP convention. ""If Pete Snyder wins the nomination, ""I’ll run as an independent,"" she told WRVA radio in Richmond. ""You know, (if) any other candidate wins, I’ll support them wholeheartedly, just like I have any other Republican for the past ten years."" Snyder, a wealthy, well-connected Charlottesville entrepreneur, appears to have a decent shot at the nomination but  - given the complexities of the convention process - it’s difficult to identify a frontrunner. There are other well-known candidates also seeking the GOP nod: Former House Speaker Kirk Cox; Glenn Youngkin, a wealthy, former business executive; and Chase. Snyder urged party leaders to go the convention route, a path that has been riddled with potholes. Republicans originally eyed an indoor convention in May attended by thousands of delegates, only to learn such an event would violate state COVID laws limiting the size of public gatherings. In February, party leaders voted to hold a drive-in convention in parking lots at Liberty University in Lynchburg - much to the surprise of Liberty officials who said they had not been consulted. Party leaders dropped the idea after finding the university didn’t have enough parking lot space to accommodate the event. The GOP ultimately agreed to make the nomination on May 8 from 37 remote convention sites across the state. Chase accuses Snyder of using undue influence with the party’s governing board to rig the nomination process in his favor. She points out that Chris Marston, the state party’s lawyer, is treasurer of Snyder’s campaign. Rich Anderson, chairman of the state GOP, says he’s put a ""firewall"" between Marston and convention planning. Marston did, however, offer the party legal advice in February on holding a convention. The Washington Post, in an April 4 article, laid out other instances where Snyder’s campaign offered jobs to party officials who had a vote in the nominating process. Anderson said it’s common for party officials to back candidates in nomination fights and those who have been hired this year have not been allowed to participate in convention decisions. He defended Snyder’s actions. ""A lot of this is maneuver on the political battlefield,"" he told WRVA. ""It’s kind of like practicing politics with a license."" Our ruling Chase, in December, promised she would support the Republican nominee for governor this year and would not launch an independent run for the office. In March, she added a condition: She’ll back any nominee except Pete Snyder. If he wins the GOP nomination on May 8, Chase said she will run as an independent. We can’t say Chase has u-turned because there are seven Republicans running for governor and Snyder may not win the nomination. As of now, Chase is still a Republican candidate. But there has been a partial change in her position, and we rate it a Half-Flip.  ",/factchecks/2021/apr/12/amanda-chase/chase-half-flips-pledge-not-launch-independent-bid/

Krueger overstates findings on marijuana legalization and youth usage
","New York state legislators and Gov. Andrew Cuomo have approved a law allowing recreational use, production and sale of marijuana for people over age 21. State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan, has long sponsored legislation to legalize marijuana. During the Senate debate, she said: ""In fact, the data coming in from some states that have legalized marijuana is that they actually see a decrease in use over time, particularly among young people."" Given concerns about whether young people will be more inclined to use marijuana, even if it is legal only for people age 21 and older, we wondered if reliable data supported Krueger’s point.  We reached out to Krueger’s office, and a spokesman, Justin Flagg, sent us several studies.  In Colorado, the legal sale of recreational marijuana began in 2014. Four years later, Colorado’s Division of Criminal Justice published a study about the effects of legalization, and found that between 2005 and 2017 the proportion of Colorado high school students reporting using marijuana ever in their lifetime had modest fluctuations but remained statistically unchanged. Also, the study found no statistically significant difference between Colorado student responses compared to national data. The proportion of students reporting they had used marijuana in the last 30 days was also stable, with no significant changes, from 2005 to 2017.  A year after that report, the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey found that youth marijuana use had ticked up slightly from the previous survey, and was up less than 1 percentage point from just before legal sales began. Survey authors reported there had been no significant change since 2005.  Other studies also suggested no change in youth use in Colorado. In 2018, a study in Prevention Science showed that for high school students there were no significant changes in marijuana use when they were asked if they had used it ever, or in the last 30 days.   In Washington state, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, a study from the Rand Corp. and others published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2018 found a small decrease in youth use, but warned that more data is needed to identify long-term trends. Marijuana use dropped a small, but statistically significant amount among eighth graders and 10th graders in Washington state following legalization, in 2014 and 2016, compared with 2010 and 2012, researchers wrote. Among eighth graders, prevalence of marijuana use fell from 9.8 percent to 7.3 percent. Among 10th graders, use fell from 19.8 percent to 17.8 percent. No changes were reported among 12th graders. A 2019 study in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse found that there were not significant shifts in use among youth overall in places that had decriminalized marijuana, ""but predicted significant declines in marijuana use among 14-year olds and those of Hispanic and other ancestry (1.7-4.4 percentage points), and significant increases among white adolescents (1.6 percentage points)."" In a research letter published in JAMA Pediatrics in 2019, researchers wrote that based on their analysis of surveys in states that had legalized recreational adult-use marijuana, youth use ""may actually"" decline. Recreational marijuana laws were associated with an 8 percent decrease in the likelihood of marijuana use and a 9 percent decrease in the likelihood of frequent marijuana use.    Study author D. Mark Anderson, an associate professor of economics at Montana State University, told PolitiFact earlier this year that researchers interpreted their results as consistent with the argument that as licensed dispensaries that require proof of age replace drug dealers, marijuana becomes more difficult for teens to obtain.     We talked to three academic researchers who study marijuana legalization, and they all said that there is not a definitive link between legalization and lower use by minors.  Magdalena Cerda, an associate professor at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, was a co-author of the Rand study. That study found a decrease in adolescent marijuana use after legalization, but it didn’t have a comparison group, therefore it’s unclear whether the decrease was due to legalization, or whether, in the absence of legalization, the decrease would have been larger, Cerda said. Another of Cerda’s studies, published in 2019 in JAMA Psychiatry, found no change in use among adolescents, but a potential small increase in cannabis use disorder, particularly among adolescents who had previously used marijuana. Based on the JAMA Psychiatry study and the JAMA Pediatrics study, Cerda said, ""I think this suggests that we don’t see an increase in use among the general population of adolescents in the short-term aftermath following legalization."" As for problematic use among existing users, the finding is very preliminary and requires further study, she said.      Katharine Neill Harris, a fellow in drug policy at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, said that youth use has been on a decline since the early 2000s, before any state legalized recreational marijuana. In looking at youth use since legalization, Colorado’s data is best, and that it shows that marijuana use by high school students has been stable, she said.  In states that have legalized, increases or decreases have been very small, Harris said. Meanwhile, among adults, marijuana use is increasing nationwide, including in states that have legalized, she said. She pointed us to a study published in July 2020 from the University of Washington, which showed that reductions in teen use could be slowed by legalization, meaning that teen use could have decreased more without legalization. The Washington study followed a smaller group of young people over time, which offers a different analysis than point-in-time survey data from a larger group.  It’s still too early to make any definitive conclusions about whether legalization impacts youth use, she said.   Jonathan P. Caulkins, a past co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center and a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said there are 15 states and multiple indicators from which advocates can pick statistics. The overall finding, Caulkins said, is that legalization for adults was accompanied by stable rates for youth overall, but youth rates of risky behaviors such as smoking, drinking, getting drunk, and other indicators are all down. ""Some of us guess that legalization has offset or erased what otherwise would have been progress,"" he said.  Still, the effect of legalization is small, if any, he said. The reasons for this are that legalization was only for adults, not kids, and that marijuana was already widely available even where it was prohibited and that in many states, legalization came after medical marijuana was permitted in brick and mortar stores, broadening legal access.  ""It has been less bad for kids than we feared it might be, and it is definitely not bad and might even be level, but it is just not right to say that a fair and comprehensive look at the data concludes that kids have been helped by legalization in that way,"" Caulkins said.   PolitiFact has fact-checked similar claims.  In 2019, PolitiFact found that adult use in Colorado through 2017 rose, as it had been trending before legalization, while youth use remained the same or decreased a little.   Also in 2019, PolitiFact Illinois rated a claim that ""steady decreases in youth use"" in states that have legalized Mostly False, based on a lack of evidence from states that have legalized.  In March, PolitiFact Wisconsin issued a Half True ruling to a claim that youth usage has gone down in states that have legalized, citing the JAMA Pediatrics study and other sources.  Krueger said data from ""some states"" that have legalized shows a decrease in use over time, particularly among young people.  The data shows youth usage has been stable, or with a decrease according to some research. Other research has shown, meanwhile, that legalization could actually thwart a downward trend in youth usage, and that problematic use among teens could increase after legalization.  Krueger’s statement could leave the listener with the impression that there is a relationship between legalization and lower rates of youth marijuana usage. Some research might support this, but certainly not all of it, and researchers warn that more study is necessary.   We rate this Half True.    ",/factchecks/2021/apr/09/liz-krueger/krueger-overstates-findings-marijuana-legalization/

No direct link between ‘gun control’ and killings by authoritarian regimes
","A previously debunked post that attempts to link gun control policies to genocide and extermination campaigns carried out by authoritarian governments has reemerged on social media, this time in the form of a widely shared Instagram post. ""This is why you never, ever let the government take away your guns,"" a preface on the post says, alongside an image of a steamroller driving over a sea of firearms. ""Read up, educate yourself. Here's a LITTLE GUN HISTORY."" The post lists select examples of extermination campaigns carried out by authoritarian regimes at various points in the 20th century, including the Soviet Union, Cambodia and Nazi Germany, that it says occurred after they ""established gun control."" It adds: ""56 million defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control."" The March 30th post was flagged as part of efforts by Facebook, which owns Instagram, to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Iterations of the Instagram post in question have resurfaced through the years and caught the attention of fact-checkers. Snopes published a Nov. 11, 2017, fact-check based on a similar post and called it mostly false.  We found that while the governments cited in these societies did confiscate guns from certain people, there’s no evidence to conclude that those confiscations were directly responsible for the millions of deaths that happened afterward, as the post claims. The central claim driving this post — that gun control enabled genocide — is a popular talking point for the National Rifle Association and other opponents of gun control. But the theory has been disputed by historians and researchers as hypothetical, and as exaggerating the role personal gun ownership by civilians could have played in counteracting the power of authoritarian governments and their militaries. The concept ""suggests, for example, that the Holocaust could have been avoided if Germany's minuscule Jewish population had been better armed. It also argues that Ukrainian peasants could have defeated the Stalinist regime, backed by the NKVD and the Red Army, if they had possessed individual firearms,"" Mark Nuckols, an instructor with Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, wrote in The Atlantic magazine. Under Nazi Germany’s 1938 regulations, Jews living under the Third Reich were forbidden to own or possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. But the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes by then, and ""the small number of personal firearms in the hands of the small number of Germany’s Jews (about 214,000) remaining in Germany in 1938 could in no way have stopped the totalitarian power of the Nazi German state,"" the Anti-Defamation League explained in 2013. In the Soviet Union, ""tens of thousands of people were shot by Soviet state police and hundreds of thousands deported,"" Yale University history professor wrote a March 2011 New York Review article. ""Those who remained lost their land and often went hungry as the state requisitioned food for export."" However, the greatest casualty figure of the Soviet era had nothing to do with access to firearms. Instead, it stemmed from a government-imposed famine which killed at least 5 million people, Snyder wrote. In Turkey’s 1915 offensive against ethnic Armenians, also cited in the post, the Armenians ""were ordered to turn in any weapons that they owned to the authorities,"" according to a New York Times article, citing David Fromkin’s book ""A Peace to End All Peace,"" about World War I, though it was mostly military members, not civilians, who were allowed to own firearms to begin with.  ""I don’t know of any evidence which shows causality"" between gun confiscation and genocide, Philip Alpers, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Sydney who studies gun laws and regulations, told PolitiFact in an email. A post on Instagram claims that ""56 million defenseless people"" were ""rounded up and exterminated"" in the 20th century because of gun control. The claim conflates gun control with confiscation. And it rests on the theory that gun confiscation policies by authoritarian governments left citizens defenseless and enabled genocide.  Researchers and historians say there’s no evidence to support the theory, and that it exaggerates the role armed civilians could have played in counteracting the power of authoritarian governments and their militaries.  We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/09/instagram-posts/no-direct-link-between-gun-control-and-killings-au/

Instagram post ignores full Floyd video to falsely claim officer’s knee was not on Floyd’s neck
","Supporters of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin have rallied around the claim that he did not have his knee on George Floyd’s neck. A post on Instagram showed footage from Chauvin’s trial and declared, ""Lying media exposed."" ""Knee not on neck of George Floyd,"" the April 8 post said. The video clip was built around new footage from Police Officer Alex Keung’s body camera. Eric Nelson, Chauvin’s attorney, asked Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo about the new footage. ""Would you say that from the perspective Mr. Kueng’s body camera, Officer Chauvin’s knee was more on Mr. Floyd’s shoulder blade?"" Nelson asked April 5. ""Yes,"" Arrandondo said. But the post ignores when the events in the footage took place. They occurred as the medics arrived and rolled Floyd’s limp body onto a stretcher — in other words, only in the last seconds of the approximately eight minutes that Chauvin had restrained Floyd. In the rest of the police chief’s testimony, prosecutor Steve Schleicher drilled down on that point. Schleicher: ""You testified that the particular moment in time that you were viewing officer Keung's body worn camera it appeared, at that moment in time, that the knee of the defendant was more towards the shoulder blade. Is that right?"" Arrandondo: ""That is correct."" Schleicher: ""That is at a time where the ambulance had already arrived?"" Arrandondo: ""Yes."" Schleicher: ""Very shortly before they loaded Mr. Floyd onto the gurney?"" Arrandondo: ""Yes. That is correct."" Schleicher: ""And in your view of the body-worn camera footage, everything you reviewed prior to testifying today, did you see the defendant's knee anywhere but the neck of Mr. Floyd up until that time?"" Arrandondo: ""That is correct."" Schleicher: ""And so, the knee of the defendant was on Mr. Floyd's neck up until the time you just pointed out?"" Arrandondo: ""Yes. When I viewed that video portion, that is the first time that I had seen the knee of the defendant on the shoulder blade area."" Another prosecution witness, Jody Stiger, a Los Angeles Police Department sergeant, who viewed the footage, testified that Chauvin applied pressure continuously to Floyd’s neck or neck area.  Several prosecution witnesses testified that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen, not drugs, as the defense has argued. An Instagram post said video proved that Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s shoulder, not his neck. The video was taken only in the last seconds of Chauvin restraining Floyd, and does not show what occurred before. All testimony based on the full video showed that pressure was applied continuously on or near Floyd’s neck. Medical experts say that pressure in that area blocks the flow of oxygen and blood.

More children held at the border under Biden than Trump, but not 4 times as many
","Is the number of children crossing the Mexico border more than four times higher under President Joe Biden than it was at its peak under President Donald Trump? ""Funny how all of a sudden there's no more photo ops, no more nonstop media coverage, and no more crisis at the border now that the numbers are at all time highs and a DEMOCRAT administration is in control,"" said a post widely shared on Facebook. ""Oh, and you're a racist if you point that out. See how it works?"" The claim is made in an image shared with the post. The image, which includes a bar graph with red for Trump and blue for Biden, said: ""Kids at the border: 2,600 highest number Trump, 12,000 currently under Biden."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The corresponding number is higher under Biden, but nowhere near 12,000. The post was by Brandon Tatum, a conservative commentator and former police officer in Tucson, Ariz. who has 315,000 followers on Facebook and 1.49 million subscribers on YouTube. He made national news in 2016, the year before he left policing, after attending a Trump rally in Tucson as a civilian and then posting a video in which he said he feared there was going to be a riot at the event because of the behavior of anti-Trump protesters. Tatum did not reply to our requests for information to back up his statement.  When Texas Gov. Greg Abott claimed on March 30 that ""twice as many children are in Border Patrol custody under Biden than"" the peak number under Trump in 2019, our rating was True. We found that 2019 was the last year border authorities recorded a surge in migrant children and family crossings. In 2020, the Trump administration stopped taking minors into custody after it implemented a policy that immediately expelled all people crossing the border, including children, citing COVID-19 precautions. The Biden administration suspended that policy for children in January, and now allows children who cross the border alone to remain in the U.S. while they await immigration court proceedings.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed to us that the 2,600 unaccompanied minors in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody in June 2019 was the highest such figure under Trump.  The number was 5,160, essentially twice as many as at the peak under Trump, when Abbott made his claim. So, as of April 5, the date of Tatum’s Facebook post, had that figure more than doubled to 12,000?  No. According to the latest unaccompanied children daily reports provided to us by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the figure dropped. It was 4,231 on April 5 and 4,228 on April 6.  Those figures count children housed temporarily by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Federal policy is to move those children into more permanent facilities run by Department of Health and Human Services facilities within 72 hours. As of April 6, there were 16,045 children in HHS facilities. According to HHS, its more than 100 shelters in 17 states, run by state-certified nonprofit agencies, provide services on ""par with facilities in the child welfare system that house American children."" Besides getting the numbers on the border wrong, T the framing of the post comparing Trump and Biden is missing context.  Much of the uproar over Trump’s confinement of migrant children was because his policy was to separate families after they crossed the border — adults went to one place to await criminal charges, while their children were sent to another facility. That zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings was in place from April to June of 2018; it is not in place now.  Tatum claimed: ""Kids at the border: 2,600 highest number Trump, 12,000 currently under Biden."" Under Trump, the number of migrant children temporarily housed near the Mexico border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection peaked at 2,600, in June 2019. Under Biden, the figure as of April 5, the date of Tatum’s post, was 4,231. We rate the post Half True.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus and autopsies do not violate WHO policies, as posts claim
","More than a year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, posts circulating on social media continue to purport that the public’s understanding of the illness — and of the virus that causes it — is deeply flawed. One Instagram post shares a headline that says COVID-19 is not actually caused by a virus at all.  ""Russia is the first country in the world to dissect Covid-19 corpses, and after a thorough investigation, it was determined that Covid does NOT exist AS A VIRUS,"" reads the screenshot of a story headline.  The photo caption goes on to say that the Russian doctors the article refers to are ""violating"" a World Health Organization ""law that does not allow autopsies of people"" who have died of COVID-19.  The post also claims a bacteria, rather than a virus, causes the disease. ""After a period of scientific discovery, it cannot be assumed that it is a virus, but rather bacteria that cause death,"" the post says, before reiterating, ""the patient dies because of these bacteria."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This post is wrong in a number of ways.  First, the claim that COVID-19 is caused by bacteria is false. It is caused by a virus.  COVID-19 is the World Health Organization’s official name for the disease caused by the virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (or SARS-CoV-2).  False claims about COVID-19 being caused by bacteria have been circulating for months. PolitiFact, other fact-checking organizations, and even the WHO have repeatedly debunked those claims. Although bacteria and viruses can cause people to experience similar symptoms, the two are different biologically. The post is also inaccurate in its claims that there is a WHO ""law"" that prohibits doctors from conducting autopsies on people who have died of COVID-19. The WHO does not prohibit autopsies on COVID-19 patients.  In September 2020, the organization released guidelines for how medical professionals can safely perform autopsies on those who died because of COVID-19. The guidelines include recommendations regarding personal protective equipment and performing autopsies in rooms with adequate ventilation. The first full autopsy of a COVID-19 patient was published in a Chinese medical journal in February 2020, according to a study of COVID-19 autopsies.  Doctors and researchers in the U.S. have been conducting autopsies on people who have died of COVID-19 for months. The Washington Post reported that ""the first large batch"" of autopsy reports were published in May and June 2020. Autopsy findings have ""shaped our understanding of what COVID-19 does to the body and how we might combat it,"" ABC News reported, noting that different treatments have been considered based on autopsy results. A post claims that bacteria causes COVID-19 and that ""Covid-does NOT exist AS A VIRUS."" It also says that Russian doctors who performed autopsies on deceased COVID-19 patients violated a World Health Organization law. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not by bacteria. The WHO does not prohibit autopsies on people who have died of COVID-19. The organization actually provided guidelines for how to safely perform autopsies on COVID-19 patients.

Yes, the Texas Senate's election bill SB7 changes early voting rules
","Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stood before reporters during a Tuesday morning news conference in which he excoriated Democrats and many in the media for spreading ""lies"" about Senate Bill 7, a measure that would restrict voting access in the state. ""The left, the Democrats, many in the media, some in this room, across the state, across the country, have changed the word sadly from ‘voter security’ to ‘voter suppression' or ‘voter restriction,’"" Patrick, a Republican, said angrily. ""Senate Bill 7 is about voter security not about voter suppression, and I’m tired of lies and the nest of liars who continue to repeat them."" Before explaining how the bill would amend the state election code, Patrick said something that he would repeat during the 35-minute press conference. ""Nothing has changed in the election code (under SB7) regarding early voting. Nothing has changed,"" he said. SB 7 was passed along party lines by the Texas Senate last week and is one of two voting bills being considered by the Legislature. Similar to voting bills in Georgia and other states, SB 7 is designed to diminish local control over elections.  The bill would prohibit local election administrators from extending early voting hours and operating drive-thru voting centers. It also would bar election officials from sending out mail-in ballot applications without a voter’s request and, among other things, gives partisan poll watchers more access to polling locations during voting hours. Patrick said the measures are intended to restore people’s trust in American democracy following the 2020 presidential election. Patrick has perpetuated former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was plagued by voter fraud. In November, the lieutenant governor offered $1 million in rewards to anyone who provided information leading to an arrest and conviction for voter fraud. (When asked by a reporter Tuesday if he would be rewarding Pennsylvania Lt. Governor John Fetterman, who says he provided Patrick with two cases of Trump voters casting ballots in the name of their deceased mothers, Patrick said, ""I didn’t come here to take stupid questions from the media."") ""People in America have lost faith in their elections,"" he said. ""We have to resolve that issue in this country and in this state. That’s why SB 7 is needed."" For this fact-check we focus on Patrick’s first claim — that SB 7 wouldn't change anything in the election code regarding early voting. Let’s look at how the bill would affect early voting. Patrick said during the news conference that many elements of the bill are targeted toward Harris County. Election officials in the state’s largest county opened eight 24-hour polling centers during a portion of the early voting period in areas with high numbers of overnight workers, near medical centers and the ship channel. The county also opened drive-thru voting locations during early voting to ease coronavirus concerns. Nearly 145,000 Texans availed themselves of these new voting options during the general election, which helped the county surpass its all-time record for number of votes cast before the early voting period was over. Patrick said that county officials had come up with these methods ""out of thin air"" and that they weren't explicitly allowed by state law. County officials counter that nothing in the law precluded 24-hour voting or drive-thru locations, and several GOP challenges last year to the expanded voting methods were unsuccessful. ""24-hour early voting and drive-thru early voting were not included in the Election Code before Harris County decided to use them anyway. ... So, nothing has changed,"" said Patrick's spokesperson Steven Aranyi. If passed, SB 7 would codify Republicans' objections to drive-thru voting and 24-hour voting into the state election code. To Roxanne Werner, deputy director of communications for Harris County Elections, that's an appreciable change.  ""There are definitely a number of things that would change under SB7, particularly with early voting. Some of the more obvious things are the drive-thru locations and the lack of extended early voting hours,"" Werner said. ""There are several things in SB 7 that relate to early voting, so I'm surprised to hear (Patrick’s) particular statement."" For instance, the bill’s text would eliminate 24-hour voting by adding language to the election code that requires early voting to be conducted ""for a period of at least nine hours, except that voting may not be conducted earlier than 6 a.m. or later than 9 p.m."" And it would prohibit drive-thru voting — during the early voting period or on election day — by adding language that says ""no voter may cast a vote from inside a motor vehicle."" Robert Stein, a Rice University political scientist who has worked with and studied Harris County’s election system, said the changes proposed in SB 7 are obvious. ""What do you mean nothing changed?"" Stein said, responding to Patrick’s claim. ""Then why are you writing SB 7? You're changing the law so as to prevent someone from doing something they have been doing in the past."" David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, agrees and notes that SB 7 would make Texas one of the most restrictive voting states in the nation. Becker said that SB 7 would ""concentrate more voting to a single day"" by disincentivizing early voting and mail-in voting.

In gun policy address, Joe Biden exaggerates about background checks at gun shows
","In a Rose Garden event, President Joe Biden announced several actions his administration will take to address what he called an ""epidemic"" of gun violence. Biden repeated his call for Congress to pass legislation to expand background checks. The House voted largely along party lines to pass a pair of background check bills this year, but they haven’t moved forward in the Senate. ""These bills, one, require background checks for anyone purchasing a gun at a gun show or an online sale,"" Biden said at the April 8 event. ""Most people don't know it, you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check. But you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check."" When it comes to background checks for gun purchases, what matters is who sells the guns, not where the guns are sold — and when a federally licensed seller is a vendor at a gun show, they have to run a background check just as they would if they were back at a bricks-and-mortar gun store. The White House told PolitiFact that Biden wasn’t suggesting that every gun transaction at a gun show would take place without a background check. Instead, he meant that sales without background checks could occur in some cases.  However, that's not what he said. Advocates for stricter gun control measures often talk about the ""gun show loophole,"" though some observers say the term is a misnomer. The phrase itself doesn’t explain who is and isn’t required to run background checks at gun shows.  Federal law requires that people in the business of dealing in firearms be licensed by the federal government. Specifically, the law says that a license is required if ""a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms."" The law specifically rules out a required license if a person ""makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms."" This can sometimes be a fuzzy distinction, but it means many sellers of guns do need to have a license. ""Every federally licensed retailer, whether they are selling a gun at a brick and mortar store, a  gun show or the sale starts online,"" must complete a signed background check form from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and get approval from the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check system, said Mark Oliva, a spokesperson for the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Gun shows can include either licensed dealers or private sellers. So at a gun show, the licensed sellers need to run a background check on buyers, and the non-licensed sellers don’t. So Biden’s blanket statement that if you go to a gun show, you can avoid a background check, is wrong. It depends on who you buy from. It’s also worth noting something that Biden’s statement ignores: A number of states have implemented additional background check requirements that cover at least some private sales. The states include some of the nation’s most populous, including California, New York and Illinois.  These states’ specific laws vary, but at least in the states with the strictest additional requirements, you will have to pass a background check for any gun you buy at a gun show, contrary to what Biden said. How common is it for licensed sellers to set up shop at gun shows? The available data is old and of uncertain accuracy, but what data we have shows that gun show vendors are often licensed sellers. Professors at Northeastern and Harvard universities conducted a gun survey in 2015 and found that 22% of gun owners who reported obtaining their most recent firearm within the previous two years reported doing so without a background check. For firearms purchased privately, including sales between individuals in person, online or at gun shows, 50% were obtained without a background check. Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida who specializes in gun research, said that observations that he and his wife, fellow University of Central Florida sociologist Lin Huff-Corzine, have made in Florida in recent years suggest that licensed dealers have a ""disproportionate amount of the stock"" for sale at shows, accounting for roughly three-fourths of sales. Biden said, ""You go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want, and no background check.""  This is overstated. If you go to a gun show and buy a firearm from a federally licensed seller, you will have to pass a background check, just as if you went to a bricks-and-mortar gun store. You would only escape a background check at a gun show if you bought from a seller who isn’t federally licensed. While the data is incomplete, federally licensed sellers have been found to make up a substantial share, and perhaps a majority, of gun show vendors. We rate Biden’s statement Mostly False.

No, Gallup poll does not show Biden approval rating at 11%, that’s Pants on Fire

The tweet did not include a link and it’s not clear what report from the Daily Caller, an online publication with a conservative lean, it might be referring to. In January, the Daily Caller reported that a Gallup poll found that only 11% Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country.  But that poll question did not ask about Biden, and the poll was taken Jan. 4 to 15, before his inauguration on Jan. 20. The question was: ""In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States at this time?"" In the latest Gallup poll asking about Biden’s approval rating, taken March 1 to 15, his approval rating was 54%. Gallup asked: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling his job as president?""  That was the third time Gallup asked the question during Biden’s presidency. The first time, in a poll taken Jan. 21 to Feb. 2, Biden’s approval rating was 57% overall and 11% among Republicans. Gallup provides a comparison of polling for other presidents, dating back to Dwight Eisenhower in 1953, during March of their first year in office. The lowest rating was Donald Trump, at 40%, in March 2017. FiveThirtyEight.com tracks approval rating polls, saying it takes into account each poll's quality, recency, sample size and partisan lean. As of April 8, Biden’s approval rating, as calculated by FiveThirtyEight, was 53.2%.  That includes polls taken since March 29, the date of the tweet, by Global Strategy Group, Morning Consult, AP-NORC, YouGov, Rasmussen, Ipsos and IBD-TIPP. Among that batch of polls, according to FiveThirtyEight, Biden’s lowest approval rating was 47% in a Rasmussen poll taken March 31 to April 4.

Tiffany misses mark with claim that young adults are not susceptible to coronavirus
","More than 15% of the U.S. population is now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and as the pace of inoculation picks up and summer nears, it’s clear there are brighter days ahead.  Wisconsin is among the leaders in the nationwide race to immunize against the virus, with more than 20% of residents having completed the vaccine series.  Though we don’t yet know exactly how many Americans will have to be vaccinated to achieve ""herd immunity"" (the point at which outbreaks cease because the virus has so few new hosts to infect), scientists estimate that it’s at least 70% of the population and could be as high as 90%.  But U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, undercut that notion at a town hall meeting in Hudson on March 29, 2021. He told attendees he advised his adult daughters against getting vaccinated because they are ""largely not susceptible to coronavirus,"" Wisconsin Public Radio reported.  ""Think about this practically,"" Tiffany said he told his daughters. ""You really are not under that much of a threat as a result of this virus, and I’m not sure why you would go and take a vaccine as a result of that.""  So Tiffany is claiming it doesn't make sense for young adults to get the vaccine since they ""really are not under that much of a threat as a result of this virus."" Implicit in that statement is the idea that getting vaccinated only benefits the individual. That ignores one of the fundamental purposes of immunization: protecting the community at large.  Let’s break it down.  Are younger people ""not under that much of a threat"" from COVID-19?  When asked for evidence to back up his claim, a Tiffany spokesperson pointed to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which shows fewer cases of the virus have been reported in children under age 17 when compared with adults, as well as a statement from former CDC director Robert Redfield that children are at more risk from influenza than from COVID-19.  He’s correct that children have fared better against the virus over the past year. In Wisconsin, residents ages 0-19 have made up about 16% of cases. Only 2% of those cases resulted in hospitalization, and there have only been three deaths in those between 10 and 19, according to data from the state Department of Health Services.  We’ve seen examples in recent weeks: A 14-year-old Milwaukee boy died of COVID-19 April 1, the first pediatric death the city has recorded from the virus, and 35 people (including 16 children) tested positive for a contagious COVID-19 variant at a Dane County child care center. Cases and deaths among people ages 20-29, though — an age range that would include Tiffany’s two older daughters, according to WPR — are more common. Nearly 20% of the state’s cases were among people ages 20-29, though just 1% required hospitalization and 22 died.  Bottom line: Younger Wisconsinites aren’t under as much of a threat as those who are older, but serious cases have happened in the population — and they also risk spreading it to someone who is more susceptible to severe consequences from the virus. Should young people skip the vaccine because the threat is lower?  Getting any vaccine helps people both protect themselves and their community from disease.  Each COVID-19 shot currently authorized in the U.S. was proven in clinical trials to significantly reduce a recipient’s chances of illness and death from the virus, which is how it protects the individual.  But once enough people are vaccinated against any virus, that virus won’t be able to travel as easily from person to person, and the entire community is less likely to get the disease, according to a vaccine fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Once that happens, the disease becomes rare.  For example, prior to the development of the measles vaccine in 1968, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15. After the vaccine was developed and used widely, disease rates were reduced drastically — by 1981, there were 80% fewer reported measles cases compared to the previous year, according to the CDC.  Herd immunity also protects the small number of people who can’t get a vaccine for medical or personal reasons, according to the National Institutes of Health.  Tiffany said it doesn't make sense for young adults to get the vaccine since they ""really are not under that much of a threat as a result of this virus.""  He’s correct that younger people generally are less likely than their older counterparts to become severely ill or die from the virus, but still, it has happened, meaning the vaccine would personally protect even young people from severe disease or death, even if the risk is small.  Getting enough people vaccinated is also crucial to reach herd immunity, which will protect the entire community.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""  That fits here.   ",/factchecks/2021/apr/08/tom-tiffany/tiffany-misses-mark-claim-young-adults-are-not-sus/

Is Joe Biden’s infrastructure proposal fully paid for?
","After signing a coronavirus and economic relief plan into law, President Joe Biden turned to an infrastructure proposal as his next legislative priority. Cabinet members, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have fanned out to promote the president’s $2 trillion-plus package, while critics of the plan are complaining about the cost.  In an interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" April 4, Buttigieg emphasized that the expenditures would be covered by revenue increases. ""The vision the president has put forward (in the infrastructure bill) is fully paid for,"" he said. ""Across 15 years, it would raise all of the revenue needed for these once-in-a-lifetime investments."" The president himself re-emphasized the importance of this point in a speech touting the plan on April 7. ""We’ve got to pay for this,"" he said. Buttigieg is largely correct, though there are some important caveats to note. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" on April 4, 2021. (Screenshot) Biden’s proposal, called the American Jobs Plan, would provide funding for highways, bridges, ports, airports and transit systems, as well as infrastructure for water, the electric grid, and expanded high-speed Internet access. It would also support retrofitting and upgrading homes, commercial and federal buildings, schools, child care facilities and veterans’ hospitals, and it would invest in research and development. The proposal also includes items not traditionally considered infrastructure, such as funding to support home health care workers and job training, and pro-union provisions. In all, the proposal comes with a price tag of more than $2 trillion over a decade. To pay for it, Biden would lean heavily on new or higher taxes on corporations, including raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, preventing U.S. corporations from claiming an offshore tax haven as their place of business, eliminating tax preferences for fossil fuels, tightening tax enforcement by adding employees to the Internal Revenue Service, and changing other taxes that hit corporations. Republicans have attacked both the spending and revenue sides of Biden’s proposal, arguing that some of the items in it are not really ""infrastructure,"" and that raising corporate tax rates could lead businesses to leave the United States.  Biden said in his April 7 remarks that he’s open to compromise on what a bill ultimately includes.   For this article, we’ll focus on whether the spending portions of the plan are equaled by the revenue-raising portions, as Buttigieg said. The White House pointed us to the fact sheet it has released on the plan, which makes that claim, but doesn’t get into details. However, at least two independent groups have analyzed the plan and found that Buttigieg’s formulation checks out. One was published by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. It found that the plan has approximately $2.65 trillion in new costs over eight years. Over the first 10 years, the group found, the plan would increase the deficit by about $900 billion. However, over a longer, 15-year period —the one Buttigieg cited — the plan’s revenues would match its expenses and would actually reduce deficits beyond that. The other analysis, published by the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model, came to a similar conclusion. The Penn group said the Biden plan would spend $2.7 trillion over 10 years and raise $2.1 trillion in that period, expanding the deficit by about $600 billion. However, the group found that over 15 years, it would generate more than $3.6 billion, which would be more than enough to cover its costs. Projections are always just that — projections.  Rght now, there is not even a formal bill, so the spending and revenue provisions could shift in either direction before they’re signed into law.  For instance, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. — whose support would be required for any Democratic bill — has already said he won’t support a corporate tax hike to anything higher than 25%. And under a 25% corporate tax, a lot of revenue would disappear. Similarly, some of the bill’s spending items could also disappear during lawmaker negotiations. Another asterisk is that these analyses are based on eight years’ worth of spending and 15 years of revenue increases, which is an unusual method.  Typically, congressional legislation is judged based on what happens during a 10-year window. Buttigieg wouldn’t have been able to say the plan paid for itself over the standard, 10-year budget window, so his focus on the 15-year time frame is a bit of cherry-picking. And the revenue impacts 15 years down the road are going to be harder to predict than the impacts in 10 years. That said, ""there’s nothing economically significant about the 10-year window,"" said Marcos Dinerstein, an economist with the Penn Wharton Budget Model. ""It’s just a convention. Just looking at a 10-year window can miss the benefits of policies like infrastructure and research and development that often take a while to start generating returns."" Buttigieg said Biden’s infrastructure proposal ""is fully paid for. Across 15 years, it would raise all of the revenue needed for these once-in-a-lifetime investments."" Two independent analyses back up the notion that the new spending will be evened out by the new revenue raised in the plan after 15 years. But long-term projections like this are always tricky, and a 15-year time frame is unusual for evaluating the budget impact of legislation; under the typical 10-year time frame, the plan would not be fully paid for.

Donald Trump repeats Pants on Fire claim about '30 million' illegal immigrants
","In a major policy speech on immigration, Donald Trump criticized the government’s approach to the undocumented population, sayings the feds don’t even know the scope of the problem. ""Honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million,"" Trump said. ""They have no idea what the number is. Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks."" Trump questioned the 11 million figure early in his presidential bid last year, and floated 30 million and 34 million as alternative estimates. That claim rates Pants on Fire. Is it possible that, a year later, Trump’s claim of 3 million or 30 million is more accurate? The answer is still no. Estimating the undocumented The U.S. Homeland Security Department last estimated the size of the undocumented immigrant population at 11.4 million in January 2012, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. This count includes people who entered the United States illegally and people who overstayed their visas. Figures from independent organizations that study immigration are all in the same ballpark. Here’s a rundown: Unauthorized population size (2012) Unauthorized population size (latest year) Dept. of Homeland Security 11.4 million Pew Research Center 11.2 million 11.3 million (2014) Center for Migration Studies 11.1 million 10.9 million (2014) Center for Immigration Studies  11 to 12 million 11.7 million (2016)* *This is a preliminary estimate. All of these figures come from subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census. Researchers at all of the organizations told us Trump’s statement is wildly inaccurate. There is ""absolutely zero possibility"" for the number to be just 3 million or as many as 30 million,"" according to Robert Warren of the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan immigration policy think tank. ""There is strong evidence that the number is 11 million, with a plausible margin of error of plus or minus 1 million,"" he said. Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Research Center, called both of Trump’s numbers ""virtually impossible"" and explained why. On the low end, survey data shows large enough foreign-born populations and legal admissions that there could not be as few as 3 million people. The high-end of Trump’s offered estimate is contradicted by the limited number of housing units in the United States, Mexico and Central America’s census data and surveys’ size, and U.S. data on admissions and departures. ""There’s simply no way for an additional 20 million people to be in the country and have escaped detection,"" Passel said. If the figure really is as high as 30 million, school enrollment and birth registration would reflect that, as both public schooling and birthright citizenship are incentives for undocumented immigrants, pointed out Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of legal immigrants. ""But the numbers are not out of whack,"" Camarota said. ""Bottom line is we don’t know what the number is for sure. But based on the available evidence, it seems very unlikely that it’s 20 million (more)."" Why it’s ‘always’ 11 million Trump suggested he was skeptical of the 11 million figure because it’s ""always"" been the estimate. Experts told us there’s a good explanation for that: a steady flow of people coming in and leaving. ""The reason that he has heard the same number for years is that the population has not been growing,"" said Warren. ""There’s enormous churn in the illegal immigration population. Hundreds of thousands come in at 11 million and then hundreds of thousands leave,"" Camarota said, adding that the undocumented population is a demographically unusual group as it can’t grow by births (as all children born in the United States are citizens). But even if you folded in these citizen children, the number would be 17 million at most, he said. While the federal estimate hasn’t been updated in a few years, experts agreed that the outside groups’ calculations are sound. Still, Camarota criticized the government for not providing a more recent figure. ""This creates enormous uncertainty in a debate about an important policy issue. It’s like saying, ‘We should do something about the deficit, but we don’t know how big it is,’ "" he said. ""We talk about something that everyone perceives is a problem without any data."" Our ruling Trump said the number of illegal immigrants ""could be 3 million. It could be 30 million."" Both figures are not within the range of possibility. Every credible estimate we found was in the 11 million range, with a margin of error of around 1 million. The figure has ""always"" been 11 million, in recent years, because of the flow of undocumented immigrants in and out of the United States.

Donald Trump says illegal immigration costs $113 billion a year
","In his speech in Arizona, Donald Trump outlined all the ways he plans to address illegal immigration if elected to the White House. The United States has to act, he said Aug. 31, because illegal immigration comes at a steep cost. ""Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get,"" Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said. ""For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting."" We wondered if illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion a year. We asked Trump’s campaign for the source of his data but did not hear back. Fox News’ Sean Hannity presented the $113 billion figure a few days earlier in a town hall interview with Trump, citing a 2013 report from Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group seeking reduced immigration. FAIR’s report says $113 billion represents the total cost at the federal, state and local levels for undocumented immigrants. The vast majority -- $84 billion -- is paid by state and local governments. The $113 billion is not a net cost. Taking into consideration federal, state and local tax payments made by the undocumented population, the net cost would be about $99 billion, according to the FAIR report. The report details federal expenses for education, medical treatment, law enforcement, public assistance and general expenditures covering people here illegally. General expenses include ""non-enumerated functions of government,"" such as the cost of fire departments or of the legislature, the report said. FAIR based its estimates on a pool of 13 million people in the country illegally. It includes at least 3.4 million children who are U.S. citizens born to undocumented parents. That total estimate is higher than figures estimated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, about 11.4 million by January 2012. Pew Research Center estimated there were 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in 2014. Before Trump, other Republican officials have used FAIR reports to bolster arguments about the fiscal costs of undocumented immigrants on their state. (PolitiFact has rated similar but state-centric claims in Florida and New Jersey as False, another claim Mostly False in Oregon, and one Half True in Georgia.) One thing we’ve been told over the years: FAIR’s conclusions stem from inexact estimates and assumptions. American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant think tank, said a previous FAIR report about this topic in 2010 relied ""upon flawed and empirically baseless assumptions to inflate its estimate of the costs."" In its estimated health care costs, we’ve found FAIR used a survey of hospitals that includes private hospitals, which are not funded by the state government. And its reports have assumed that most students enrolled in English learning classes are children of undocumented immigrants. That’s because ""legal immigrants have often studied in the United States or otherwise learned English before immigrating and raise their children to speak English,"" the 2013 report says. Regarding the inclusion of education expenses for U.S. born children, ""Without regard to whether this estimate is accurate, the concept of this being a ‘cost’ attributable to the unauthorized immigrants is subject to debate,"" said Jeff Passel, a senior demographer at Pew Research Center. The 2013 FAIR study also includes about $2.47 billion in fraudulent use of Medicaid, though it said only anecdotal information is available. FAIR also includes incarceration costs for undocumented immigrants. But federal agencies and immigration experts have told us there’s no definitive source for the total number of inmates in the country illegally. FAIR says it bases its incarceration costs on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. The program reimburses states and localities for costs related to incarceration of undocumented criminal immigrants ""with at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions for violations of state or local law, and incarcerated for at least 4 consecutive days during the reporting period,"" according to the U.S. Department of Justice. ""The quibbling about our use of estimates is ludicrous,"" said Jack Martin, FAIR spokesperson. ""All analysis of the impact of illegal aliens is based on estimates. The closest to survey data is the SCAAP data filed by state and local governments. We responsibly noted where we used estimates and why we thought they were reasonable estimates."" It’s difficult to determine exact costs of a population for which only estimates are available. Other, lower estimates Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies, said the cost of illegal immigration is not known for sure but could be under $113 billion. He pointed us to another report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Households led by undocumented immigrants received about $85 billion a year in benefits in 2010, according to the report. The Heritage Foundation report found that in 2010, there were about 3.44 million households headed by undocumented immigrants and on average, each household received about $24,721 in government benefits and services, such as public education, police and fire protection. That report also takes into account expenses tied to some U.S. citizens -- about 4 million children born in the United States to parents living in the country illegally. ""These children would not reside in the U.S. if their parents had not chosen to enter and remain in the nation unlawfully,"" the report said. ""Obviously, any analysis of the fiscal cost of unlawful immigration must therefore include the costs associated with these children, because those costs are a direct and inevitable result of the unlawful immigration of the parents."" Fiscal concerns related to undocumented immigrants are driven by a disparity in services they use and taxes they pay, Camarota said. ""Most immigrants come to work, including illegal immigrants,"" Camarota said. ""Illegal immigrants are a fiscal drain not because they are illegal or immigrants, or lazy and don’t work, but because people at that level of education use a lot in social services and pay little in taxes."" About 50 percent of adult undocumented immigrants have less than a high school education, in comparison to about 8 percent of the U.S. born-adult population who have not graduated from high school, Pew Research Center has found. According to the Heritage report, the average household led by an undocumented immigrant without a high school degree in 2010 paid around $8,860 in taxes, compared to about $10,900 in taxes paid by a household led by a non-immigrant without a high school degree. Overall, households of all educational levels led by undocumented immigrants paid about $10,300 in 2010, according to Heritage. Costs of the unauthorized population have been debated before, though recent, nonpartisan estimates are scarce. In 1995, the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that a professor emeritus of economics had pegged the net cost of undocumented immigrants to federal, state and local governments at $11.9 billion in 1992. A review of the professor’s work published in 1994 by the Urban Institute, a policy research organization, rebutted that amount, adjusting it to $1.9 billion. The professor, Donald Huddle, in a separate exercise estimated net costs between $16 billion and $21.6 billion for 1994, the GAO report noted. The 1994 range of estimates assumed an undocumented population between 4 million and 5.4 million. (Huddle also rebutted the Urban Institute’s rebuttal.) ""Because little data are available on illegal aliens’ use of public services and tax payments, the various indirect approaches used to estimate costs and revenues were often based on assumptions whose reasonableness is unknown,"" the report said. ""A great deal of uncertainty remains about the actual national fiscal impact of illegal aliens."" A 2007 report from the Congressional Budget Office examined the impact of unauthorized immigrants on state and local governments and found that they pay less in taxes than what they receive through state and local public services. It also noted they are prohibited from many federal benefits. The Congressional Budget Office report analyzed 29 reports and said none attempted to look at total costs and revenues. Estimates that don’t factor in positive economic impacts by unauthorized immigrants don’t tell the whole story, said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies immigration trends. She noted that the Social Security Administration reported that in 2010 unauthorized immigrants paid a net $12 billion into the trust funds. Our ruling Trump said, ""Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year."" Trump presented this figure as a hard fact to make his case, and not as the rough, high-end estimate that it is. The figure matches a 2013 study by a group that wants to reduce immigration, FAIR. It’s uncertain how much immigrants in the United States illegally cost taxpayers, but FAIR’s data is largely based on broad estimates and assumptions. Another report by a conservative think tank pegged the amount at about $85 billion a year. Reports by pro-immigration or neutral groups have come in significantly lower, and other reports have been inconclusive. Estimating the costs of illegal immigration is extremely difficult and produces dramatically different figures, depending on the source. Yes, there are costs. But Trump is selecting the highest of all possible estimates from a range that varies widely.

"['National', 'Ethics', 'Transparency', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Did the Clinton Foundation go 'above and beyond' in transparency?
","Hillary Clinton dismissed criticism of the Clinton Foundation for creating the appearance of conflicts of interest for the State Department she led, arguing that the nonprofit has actually been more transparent and ethical than was required. CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Clinton Aug. 24 about Donald Trump’s charge that she ""sold favors and access"" in exchange for donations to the foundation and why Bill Clinton would leave the foundation only if Hillary Clinton became president. Clinton responded that Trump is ""ridiculous."" ""In 2009, (the foundation) took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization, voluntarily disclosing donors, significantly reducing sources of funding, even to the point of, you know, of those funding being involved in providing medication to treat HIV/AIDS,"" Clinton said. Clinton’s family, campaign and supporters have used similar defenses lately, often calling the Clinton Foundation’s disclosure agreements ""unprecedented"" and pointing out that charities associated with the Bush presidents didn’t have to abide by the same standards. Just how accurate is this talking point? Clinton is right that the foundation bearing her family name has done more than what is required of charities by law. But the requirements are rather basic to begin with, and other nonprofits, including those tied to presidential candidates and presidents, have been similarly forthcoming. Clearing a low bar The Clinton Foundation, as part of an ethics agreement with the Obama administration, promised to publish the names of all of its donors, roll back Bill Clinton’s involvement in fundraising, and stop accepting donations to the Clinton Global Initiative from foreign governments, among other pledges. The foundation only began to do that in 2008, as a condition of Clinton’s confirmation as secretary of state in order to preempt conflicts of interest (and it hasn’t always lived up to that ethics agreement). Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, pointed out that the Clinton Foundation continued disclosing donors after Clinton left office even though it was ""under no obligation to do so.""  None of what the foundation agreed to do — disclosing donor identities, limiting an official’s role, or not taking foreign donations — is required by tax law. The law doesn’t actually require much from nonprofits like the foundation. ""The legal requirements are so absolutely minimal that it’s like saying, ‘No, I haven’t shot anyone today, so you should be grateful,’ "" said Daniel Schuman, policy director for Demand Progress, a progressive advocacy group focused on civil liberties and government transparency. Suzanne Friday, legal counsel to the nonpartisan Council on Foundations, agreed that the laws are ""basic."" Many nonprofits are volunteering a lot more information than what’s required, she said. ""Anyone who is more putting more information on their website or wherever goes above and beyond the law,"" Friday said. Tax-exempt organizations or 501(c)(3) groups only have to reveal a few bits of information to the public when requested. The requestable tax documents can include the last three years of a group’s Form 990, which gives an overview of the organization’s activities, leadership and finances. More specific requirements vary by state and also depend on whether an organization is a private foundation or public charity. Confusingly, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity, not a private foundation, even though it has the word ""foundation"" in its name. Private foundations (for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) are typically controlled by one person, one family or one corporation and have just a few funding sources. In addition to Form 990, they have to disclose their donors upon request of the public. (This is how we know, for example, that World Wrestling Entertainment gave $1 million to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 2009.) The requirements are less stringent for public charities, which includes schools and churches but also organizations with many funding sources — like the Clinton Foundation. They don’t have to disclose their donors, even if requested, but they do have to prove to the IRS that a third of their revenue comes from fundraising. So the Clinton Foundation is not required by law to disclose its donors, as it does on its contributors page, and most other nonprofits don’t give this information, said David Callahan, editor-in-chief of Inside Philanthropy. (Friday of the Council on Foundations said this is to protect donor privacy.) Minassian referred us to the Clinton Foundation's Charity Navigator rating of four stars out of four stars and a 93 out of 100 in accountability and transparency.  The Clinton Foundation, however, is not the only charity disclosing its donors on a website. The Wikimedia Foundation, the Sunlight Foundation, the Center for Global Development and the Center for Strategic and International Studies are are all examples of public nonprofits that voluntarily disclose donors. Many nonprofits like Oxfam and the World Resources Institute publish annual reports that include more comprehensive donor rolls on their websites, said Friday. The Clinton Foundation does not do this. ‘The wild west’ of presidential foundations There are about 1.1 million public charities like the Clinton Foundation, but only a handful are linked to presidents and presidential candidates. Experts told us the Clinton Foundation is among the most transparent in this group of charities, which, for the most part, are foundations associated with presidential libraries. (The Clinton Foundation was initially focused on Bill Clinton’s library and evolved into the organization it is today.) Anthony Clark, author of a book on presidential libraries called The Last Campaign, told us the presidential library foundations follow basic disclosure laws and therefore are notoriously opaque. He agreed with that the Clinton Foundation’s transparency was ""unprecedented."" ""It’s the wild west,"" he said. ""Before 2008, the closest we came to learning the donors was a donor wall with major donors engraved in granite or a bronze plaque."" Here are two charts detailing the disclosure and finances of charities related to presidential candidates and presidents:      As the chart shows, the Clinton Foundation discloses more information than the other presidential foundations. It also fundraises significantly more. For that and a few more reasons — such as the fact that Clinton has served as secretary of state and is running for president — experts told us, it belongs in a category of its own. ""The sheer scope and size of the Clinton Foundation is also unprecedented and warrants extra measures to guard against conflicts of interest,"" said Craig Holman of the government accountability group Public Citizen. Schuman of Demand Progress also brought up Marc Rich, a former fugitive and Clinton Foundation donor pardoned by Bill Clinton on his last day in office, as a conflict of interest issue that preceded the ""above and beyond"" disclosure steps. Hillary Clinton ""doesn’t seem to be meeting her own standards either,"" said Schuman, referring to unsuccessful legislation she cosponsored in the Senate on disclosing gifts to presidential foundations in 2001. The Clinton campaign specifically forwarded us reports about George W. Bush's continued involvement in his father’s foundation while he was president. We also found reports of Bush foundations taking foreign donations during that time. Experts agreed that more scrutiny should have been placed on the Bush family, but the situations are somewhat different. ""Adult children aren’t tied financially and otherwise to their parents the way one’s spouse is tied to another spouse, ""said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor who specializes in government ethics. "" ‘Hey, they did it too’ — it’s not quite as juvenile as that, but it’s not a particularly persuasive argument."" ""The Bush foundations did not raise comparable amounts of money and from as many foreign sources as the Clinton Foundation,"" said Holman of Public Citizen. In contrast to the Bush organizations, three other public nonprofits tied to presidents and presidential hopefuls have been rather forthcoming, though they don't disclose all their donors as the Clinton Foundation does.  This election cycle, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush disclosed the vast majority of donors to his Foundation for Excellence in Education early in his campaign, and the foundation subsequently published their names on its website. Bush, who started the think tank in 2008 after his tenure as Florida governor, also stepped down as its chairman when he began to seriously consider running for president in early 2015. Jimmy Carter’s nonprofit is perhaps the most similar to the Clinton Foundation with its focus on international work in human rights, poverty and disease. (Most other presidential foundations function as political think tanks advancing the ideology of its president or as education shops promoting and preserving his legacy, Clark said.) The Carter Center has been disclosing its donors every year in annual reports since 1982, when it was founded. It does, however, take anonymous donations. And then there’s Barack Obama, whose presidential library foundation also lists its contributors who've donated more than $200 and publishes its financial documents. Plus, Schuman added, ""He did it without being under duress."" Our ruling Clinton said the Clinton Foundation ""took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization."" The law does not require the Clinton Foundation to disclose donors or roll back foreign donations, but the disclosure requirements are rather minimal to begin with. It’s important to note that the Clinton Foundation, already unique in its size, function and relationship to two presidential figures, agreed to take these steps only when Clinton was nominated as secretary of state. Among presidents and presidential candidates, foundations affiliated with Jeb Bush, Obama and Carter have all been forthcoming about their donations and finances.

Dems: Glenn wants to kill Education Department, jeopardizing college funding for 320,000 Coloradans
","The Colorado Democratic Party says Republican U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn wants to eliminate the Education Department and ""jeopardize"" federal student funding for more than 300,000 Coloradans. ""Darryl Glenn as a United States senator would be no friend to students,"" Chris Meagher, spokesman for the Colorado Democratic Party, said in a news release. ""Glenn wants to eliminate the Department of Education and jeopardize Pell Grants and federal student loans for 320,000 Coloradans. He opposes student loan forgiveness programs and even believes the government has no responsibility to help curb the rising costs of a college education."" The state Democratic Party took its message to events at Colorado State University and the University of Colorado in Boulder. Republicans have called for abolishing the federal Education Department since President Ronald Reagan vowed to do so in his 1980 presidential campaign. The department was created in 1867 but did not become a Cabinet-level agency until 1980. It ""establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education,"" according to the department website. President Barack Obama has requested a $69.4 billion department budget for fiscal year 2017. The agency's kindergarten-through-12th grade programs annually serve about 50 million students attending more than 98,000 public schools and 28,000 private schools. Department programs also provide grant, loan, and work-study assistance to more than 13 million students attending college and other postsecondary programs. We wanted to fact-check this statement by the state Democratic Party: ""(Darryl) Glenn wants to eliminate the Education Department and jeopardize Pell Grants and federal student loans for 320,000 Coloradans."" The Colorado Department of Higher Education, the agency that oversees the state’s public university and college system, confirms that nearly 324,000 people in the state received federal student aid in fiscal year 2015. State students received a total of $1.4 billion in federal student aid. We asked the Democratic Party for information supporting the claim about Glenn’s intentions for the Education Department and federal grants and loans. Meagher pointed to responses Glenn made to a candidate survey for the Denver Post’s June Voter Guide. Asked what significant spending cuts he would support to balance the budget and reduce the annual deficit, Glenn replied in part: ""I support the elimination and defunding of all agencies like the Education and Energy Departments because they fall outside of the framework of the Constitution."" ""Does the federal government have a responsibility to help with student debt, and what ideas do you think would make a difference?"" the Post asked. ""No,"" Glenn said. ""There is no constitutional basis for the federal government to be mandated to assist with student debt. Better educating our college students on the risks of high student debt and helping them to find alternatives to taking out student loans would help make the difference to their financial future."" Glenn put his position a little differently on his campaign website, saying he puts more stock in parents managing students’ financial burdens than the federal government. ""I'm not talking about cutting one dime out of education. I’m talking about who is in charge,"" Glenn wrote. ""I trust Colorado families and teachers way more than I trust D.C. central planners who think they know better than parents do."" Glenn says instead of sending millions of dollars to the Education Department, ""I believe those dollars should be returned to Colorado so parents, teachers and superintendents have the freedom to make choices and direct the education of their kids."" Glenn campaign spokeswoman Katey Price told PolitiFact, ""Eliminating the Department of Education doesn't mean cutting education; it means returning all those dollars back to the states. These things aren’t in conflict."" How would it work? Glenn has not said how the federal funding should be ""returned"" to Colorado parents and local school districts. For example, would state government administer the funding? Price also did not elaborate. An expert on student financial aid systems said state-run programs lack the federal government’s ability to leverage better interest rates for students. ""What the federal government does when it makes student loans is to use its size to get lower rates than states and MUCH lower than students are able to get on unsecured loans,"" Robert Shireman, a former deputy undersecretary in the Department of Education for the Obama administration, said in an email to PolitiFact. Shireman was the architect of a 2010 financial aid overhaul by the Obama administration and Congress, which had the federal government lend directly to students -- eliminating the government-subsidized private sector loan program. ""While there have been state loan programs, they tend to be small and usually lack helpful protections like income-based repayment (which is possible because the federal government has income information through the IRS),"" added Shireman, who is now a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank. The New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, the largest state-based program in the nation, has become a symbol of the pitfalls of state loan programs. A ProPublica and New York Times investigation found the New Jersey program charged higher interest rates than similar federal programs and, in disputes, the state aggressively uses lawsuits against borrowers along with its power to garnish wages, seize state income tax refunds, revoke professional licenses and even take away lottery winnings. A 2015 story titled, ""What Happens If We Abolish the Department of Education?"" by the New America think tank, said eliminating the department and its student aid funding would likely lead to the closure of some private schools and community colleges and a decrease in the number of people going to college. The story said it would also increase the number of people seeking to attend state schools, and likely require a jump in state taxes to support public colleges and universities. Our Ruling The Colorado Democratic Party said Darryl Glenn ""wants to eliminate the Department of Education and jeopardize Pell Grants and federal student loans for 320,000 Coloradans."" Glenn has acknowledged he wants to abolish and defund the department, adding ""there is no constitutional basis for the federal government to be mandated to assist with student debt.""   He said he wants the federal education department’s funding to be ""returned to Colorado so parents, teachers and superintendents have the freedom to make choices and direct the education of their kids."" But he doesn’t propose an alternative, such as an organization to administer a state loan program.

Donald Trump explains why Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms
","Inch by inch, row by row, time to see if Donald Trump's claims will grow. At a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump proclaimed that he was ""going to end this war on the American farmer"" and accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to shut down family farms. ""Almost 97 percent of farms in this country are family owned and family managed. It’s not only a great American tradition, but a vital component of America’s economic and national security,"" Trump said. ""Yet, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms just like she wants to shut down the mines and the steelworkers,"" he continued. ""She will do this not only through radical regulation, but also by raising taxes on family farms — and all businesses — to rates as high as nearly 50 percent. Adding to the pain, she will tax family farms again at death by as much as 45 percent."" There are four elements here. We'll take them in order. Clinton wants to shut down family farms? There is no evidence this is true. Clinton, in fact, talks about a strong agricultural economy on her website. ""A strong agricultural economy remains a critical cornerstone of a vibrant rural economy,"" Clinton’s website says. ""Farmers and ranchers supply food for America's dinner tables, invest in farm machinery and supplies, and provide domestic energy resources that fuel small businesses. The agriculture economy also drives America's larger economic success."" Her site talks about ""raising agricultural production and profitability for family farms,"" offering ""support (for) the next generation of farmers,"" and providing ""a focused safety net for farmers and ranchers."" So what's Trump talking about? His campaign declined to offer details, but based on his speech, that's where regulations, the business tax and the death tax come in. 'Radical regulation' We asked the Trump campaign for specifics about what Trump meant by ""radical regulations."" They declined to cite specifics, saying it's been outlined in his speeches. We searched the Congressional Quarterly database of Trump speeches since January. We found two other instances where the candidate talked about ""radical regulations."" Like his speech in Iowa, neither said what they were. Raising taxes as high as nearly 50 percent Trump is plowing familiar ground here claiming that Clinton would raise taxes on family farms — and all businesses — to rates as high as nearly 50 percent We rated a different version of this statement Mostly False. The Trump campaign is talking about Clinton's proposal to raise the tax rate for taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of more than $5 million. Currently, taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $5 million have a tax rate of about 43.4 percent. Clinton wants to raise the rate by 4 percentage points, to 47.4 percent. Income above $5 million would potentially be subject to the additional 4 percent tax. And to be sure, that would not affect the vast majority of people who own small businesses or family farms. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, of the 2.1 million farms in the country in 2012, only 0.3 percent of family farms were large enough to have gross cash income of $5 million or more. The vast majority -- 88 percent -- reported less than $350,000 in income. Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said, ""Very few people make enough to be affected by the surtax and only a tiny fraction, if any, are traditional family farmers."" 'Death' tax This is another cornfield we've visited before. The ""death tax"" is formally known as the estate tax, which applies to inherited assets such as cash, stock and real estate. The problem with Trump's assertion is that only the wealthiest Americans are subject to the tax and only a tiny fraction of those are farmers. The tax doesn't kick in until an individual's estate is worth $5.45 million and the 40 percent tax only applies to amounts over that limit, which is indexed for inflation. At first blush, this would seem like an area where family farms might be hit particularly hard. Given the price of land and the expensive machinery used to farm it, it would seem that even the value of a small farm would likely exceed the $5.45 exemption. But in reality, in 2013 only 16 to 24 small businesses and farm estates owed any estate taxes, and the actual tax amounted to just 4.9 percent of the estate's total value, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Many of those may actually have been businesses, not farms. Not only that, the exemption doubles for a farm owned by a couple, there is an additional $1.5 million exception for closely held family farms, and the tax code allows farms to spread their payments over 15 years at a low interest rate. That number prompted comedian Bill Maher to joke that, ""More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013,"" a statement we rated as Mostly True. But, as we reported in 2014, there are countervailing forces at work here. For example, if you want to take advantage of the tax breaks, the property has to be held and used for farming for 10 years, and using it as collateral for a loan becomes more difficult because the IRS places a lien on the property to make sure it's used for crops or livestock. The estate tax was more of an issue for family farms years ago when the exemption was much lower. In 2001, during the Bush administration, for example, only the first $1.5 million was exempt from the tax. Now it’s $5.45 million. President Barack Obama has tried to get the exemption brought down to $3.5 million. Trump, like most Republicans, wants to eliminate the estate tax entirely. That would leave the treasury short by about $19 billion. ""Note that years ago, opponents of the estate tax who asserted that families had to sell their farms to pay the estate tax were unable to find a single case where that happened,"" said Williams, the Tax Policy Center expert. ""I expect that finding family farms that would be driven out of business by the surtax would be just as hard."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms"" using ""radical regulation,"" by raising tax ""rates as high as nearly 50 percent"" and through a death tax as high as 45 percent. So let's harvest the arguments. Clinton wants to shut down family farms? We've seen no evidence she's ever said that. Radical regulation? Trump's not providing any evidence to evaluate. Raising taxes to nearly 50 percent? Clinton's proposing an extra 4 percent increase, but that's on the wealthiest Americans, and very few family farms will face it. Death tax? Family farms have been surviving with the death tax for years, and the best data suggest that it affects no more than about 20 estates nationwide per year, if that. We rate this combination of claims as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/114a083e-bf90-4b4b-90b8-cd9819ef30b9",/factchecks/2016/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-explains-why-hillary-clinton-wants-sh/

Has Hillary Clinton not had a press conference in 269 days?
","Donald Trump and his allies have seized upon a statistic that they believe reflects poorly on Hillary Clinton -- and they’re hammering it home on a daily basis. On Aug. 30, 2016, the Trump campaign blasted out an email titled, ""HIDING HILLARY: DAY 269,"" going on to explain that ""it has been 269 days since (Hillary) Clinton has held a press conference."" Among other things, the email pressed Clinton to take reporters’ questions on aspects of her relationship to the Clinton Foundation. The Trump campaign was joined in this call by the Republican National Committee, which sent its own email headlined, ""269 days since Hillary Clinton held a press conference."" ""Today and every day until Hillary Clinton holds a formal press conference, the Republican National Committee (RNC) will issue a reminder of the number of days since Hillary Clinton has faced members of the media in an environment not carefully controlled by her campaign."" Is the Trump campaign correct that, as of Aug. 30, ""it has been 269 days since Clinton has held a press conference""? (On our publication day, the number would have risen to 270 — an email from Trump's campaign on publication day declared ""HIDING HILLARY: DAY 270."") Much depends on the definition of ""press conference,"" which is to some extent in the eye of the beholder. Many independent media outlets have supported Trump’s point. The Washington Post even created a real-time widget showing how long it has been since Clinton last held a press conference:  For context, Post political writer Chris Cillizza has written, ""The last time Clinton held a press conference was Dec. 5, 2015. That was before: 1. A single state had cast a vote in either a presidential primary or caucus. 2. Major terrorist attacks in Nice, Brussels and Orlando. 3. FBI Director James Comey issued his scathing report on Clinton's email practices while at the State Department. 4. The Bernie Sanders phenomenon. 5. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was run out of the Democratic National Committee in the wake of a massive email hack/leak. 6. This whole Ryan Lochte international gas station incident."" And we should note that the Trump campaign has some bona fides for calling Clinton out in this regard: A tally by NBC News counted 17 Trump press conferences in 2016. The Clinton campaign has argued that Clinton has regularly made herself available to the press in ways that are equivalent to press conferences. But with one debatable exception, Trump can make a strong case that Clinton hasn’t given a press conference. The Fort Dodge press conference Clinton’s Dec. 5, 2015 event -- which is the consensus date of her last press conference among reporters and media outlets covering the Clinton campaign -- was held in Fort Dodge, Iowa. (And yes, we counted to make sure Trump's email blast came 269 days later.) The Clinton campaign provided us with a transcript of the exchange, which we’ve posted in full here. Clinton answered eight questions. They were heavily focused on substantive topics, including gun control, terrorism, mental health policy, visa waiver rules, and civil liberties. Given the serious tone of the exchanges and the mix of unfiltered questions by members of the traveling press corps, we think the Fort Dodge event qualifies as a genuine press conference, albeit a fairly brief one by standards of a sitting president. And at least one reporter, CNN’s Dan Merica, referred to the exchange as a ""press conference."" While stopping short of labeling them press conferences, the Clinton campaign did offer PolitiFact transcripts of four subsequent events for possible comparison to the Fort Dodge exchange. The Queens press availability On April 4, Clinton visited the Jackson Diner, an Indian buffet in the immigrant-heavy Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, N.Y. The transcript provided by the Clinton campaign is here. This time, the number of questions Clinton took was slightly smaller -- six -- and several were about substantive topics of local interest, including immigration reform and policy toward Wall Street. Other questions, however, were more about campaign tactics and the horse race between Clinton and Sanders. One was on debate preparations, another on incivility among Sanders supporters, and a third was about whether she thought she and her supporters could eventually unify with Sanders and his backers. Notably, none of the articles about the event that we found referred to this as a ""press conference."" One dispatch, in amNewYork, wrote that Clinton ""stopped to take questions from reporters before heading out"" from the restaurant. And the Guardian blogged that Clinton ""has just taken questions from reporters."" The Compton press availability The next event highlighted by the Clinton campaign took place on June 6 in Compton, Calif., a predominantly African-American jurisdiction near Los Angeles. It came one day before the California presidential primary, the last major contest of the Democratic nominating season. Clinton took eight questions, with very little about policy matters. Rather, the questions revolved around her electoral prospects in the primary, her battle with Sanders and when President Barack Obama would begin campaigning for her. Many dispatches cited a more formal news conference by Sanders on the same day, but most didn’t use the term ""press conference"" for the media’s exchange with Clinton. The Associated Press and the Orlando Sentinel used the phrase ""speaking to reporters,"" while the Guardian used ""told reporters."" CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin and Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin referred to it as a ""gaggle,"" a term for an impromptu -- and typically brief -- question-and-answer opportunity, often with the politician finishing one event and moving on to another. Griffin referred to it as taking ""a few last-minute questions"" in Compton. Indeed, by the time of Clinton’s Compton visit, some journalists had begun to specifically question the campaign why she hadn’t taken questions for so long. As Fox News reported, reporters covering the campaign rejected Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon’s assertion on CNN that she often ""comes out after an event has concluded"" and ""she'll literally stand there for 15, 20 minutes and answer questions from her traveling press corps."" Washington Post media reporter Callum Borchers called Fallon’s comments ""not true."" ""Talking to reporters in a scrum isn't particularly conducive to live television -- and the comparison here is to Trump's regularly scheduled news conferences, which cable channels often air live -- but at least Clinton would be submitting herself to a similar level of questioning,"" Borchers wrote. (A ""scrum"" is essentially the same thing as a ""gaggle."") Borchers cited calculations by Liz Kreutz of ABC News, who counted ""only nine"" such availabilities, ""none lasting as long as Fallon claimed. In fact, the total duration of all nine was less than 50 minutes, a length that Trump has eclipsed at one single news conference."" For the Compton event, Kreutz reported that it lasted ""about eight minutes -- still well shy of the 15-20 that Fallon said was customary,"" Borchers reported. The Ashland press availability The Clinton campaign also pointed to a joint exchange between Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, and the media on July 31 in Ashland, Ohio. Here’s the transcript. Reporters got to ask a small number of questions of the running mates, mainly focusing on Trump’s controversial comments about the parents of a fallen soldier, Capt. Humayun Khan, and whether the four fall debates would go off as planned. The opening segment of the exchange is dominated by discussion of the milkshakes they were ordering. We didn’t find any examples of journalists at the time calling this a ""press conference."" The NABJ-NAHJ conference Finally, on Aug. 5, Clinton gave a speech to a joint convention of African-American and Hispanic journalists and followed up with a question-and-answer session. Here is the full transcript. The Clinton campaign pointed to a remark by the NABJ's president, Sarah Glover, who called the event the ""largest press conference with any presidential candidate before a room filled with journalists of color"" when introducing Clinton. NAHJ president Mekahlo Medina also called it a ""press event"" to the Huffington Post. In addition, this was the longest of these events, at roughly 30 minutes. Kristen Welker of NBC and and Lori Montenegro of Telemundo, the moderators, represented the two journalism organizations; they asked multi-part questions. Three other reporters -- Yamiche Alcindor of the New York Times, Ed O’Keefe of the Washington Post and Kevin Merida of ESPN -- asked a question each. They had been pre-selected by the moderators because they had participated in a preliminary panel. However, the fact that the moderators chose the questioners from a limited pool of convention participants (and were convention participants themselves) cast doubt for many in the press corps on whether this fit the full definition of a press conference. Politico’s Jennifer Epstein, the Associated Press’ Lisa Lerer, CNN’s Merica, and the Post’s Chris Cillizza and Abby Phillip were among those making that argument on Twitter. After months of complaints from the traveling press corps that they were not getting a press conference in which they would all have an equal opportunity to ask a question, many were not satisfied that this setup met their demands. Other arguments from the Clinton camp Beyond pointing to these four examples, Clinton campaign officials have noted that Clinton has made herself available for many interviews. For instance, on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, campaign manager Robby Mook said, ""She's done over 300 interviews this year, and she takes questions in a variety of formats."" When NPR looked at the campaign’s documentation on Aug. 25, they confirmed that Clinton had indeed done 350 interviews this year. The analysis also counted nine town-hall sessions from Jan. 1 to July 31, though these question-and-answer sessions were geared more towards members of the public than the media. However, the analysis noted that about one-fifth of the ""interviews"" were conducted by supporters, rather than journalists, or were done in settings not typically considered journalistic. In addition, NPR reported, ""a spot-check of interviews found most hovered between about three and eight minutes in duration, enough time to be seen on television screens and heard on the air, but short enough time to limit how deeply an interviewer could drill down."" ""Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill, who provided the database to NPR, did not take issue with the network's conclusions when they were shared with him,"" NPR reported. Cillizza, writing in the Post, found even a large number of interviews insufficient. ""Sitdown, one-on-one interviews aren't the same thing as a free-wheeling press conference,"" he wrote. ""There are lots and lots of ground rules that govern sit-downs — most notably a typically strict time limit that makes pursuing any particular line of questioning in any real depth almost impossible. And then there is the fact that an interview with, say, Jimmy Kimmel, isn't the same thing as a press conference with reporters from the Washington Post, New York Times and the TV networks. Kimmel is a comedian, not a reporter."" Our ruling Trump’s email said, ""It has been 269 days since Clinton has held a press conference."" Only one event in the past 269 days -- Clinton’s appearance before the minority journalists’ convention -- could reasonably be considered a press conference, and there are good arguments for why it isn’t. The questioners were limited to a small pool of convention participants, leaving most of the Clinton campaign press corps  -- the dozens of journalists who know the campaign the best and who had complained the most about lack of access -- without an equal shot at asking a question. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b54d70d-9710-4f3e-9eff-02268f8a0dc3",/factchecks/2016/aug/31/donald-trump/has-hillary-clinton-not-had-press-conference-269-d/

Jimmy Carter correct on popularity of Clinton and Trump
","Presidential elections are a sophisticated and very expensive form of the old popularity contest. And in the 2016 contest the two main candidates are not all that popular. That according to former Democratic President Jimmy Carter. The 91-year-old Carter told an Associated Press reporter in Memphis, where the Nobel Peace Prize winner was helping build a Habitat for Humanity house, that he will be voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton. ""Everybody knows that I’m a Democrat and I’ll be voting Democratic,""  Carter said. But then he took a bit of a political shot. ""It’s been an exciting and unprecedented kind of campaign this year, and unfortunately, the way it’s turned out, both choices in the major parties are quite unpopular,"" Carter said. ""But I don’t have any doubt that one of the candidates is better qualified than the other."" PolitiFact decided to take a deeper look at Carter’s ""quite unpopular"" comment with two months to go until the Nov. 8 election. As it turns out, there’s plenty of numbers out there on the subject. And most of them back up Carter. In political parlance, a candidate’s popularity is measured in what are known as ""favorables"" and ""unfavorables.""  Negative ratings are know as unfavorables while their positive ratings are labeled favorables. Real Clear Politics, a nonpartisan online site that compiles and averages polls and surveys about the major candidates and major races, keeps tabs on Clinton’s and Trump’s favorable-unfavorable rating. The RCP’s most recent average of seven polls has Hillary Clinton at 53 percent unfavorable to 41 percent favorable and Trump at 62 percent unfavorable to 34 percent favorable. Those are striking numbers, say some political experts. ""Since the advent of modern polling I don't think we've encountered a situation where both major party candidates had an unfavorable rating that exceeded 50 to 60 percent,"" said Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta. 
An August poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Clinton’s and Trump’s unfavorable ratings tied at 58 percent in the Peach State. Clinton’s favorables in Georgia were a bit higher than Trump’s: 40 percent to 36 percent. Some of the polls drill down into what’s behind the low favorable ratings. An Aug. 8 poll by Bloomberg found that only 41 percent of respondents found Clinton trustworthy while 39 percent found Trump to be so. An Aug. 4 ABC/Washington Post poll put those numbers at 49 percent for Clinton and 40 percent for Trump When asked in the ABC poll: Do you think Hillary Clinton is honest and trustworthy?, 59 percent said ""no"" and 38 percent said ""yes."" When the same question was asked about Trump, 62 percent said ""no"" and 34 percent said ""yes.""   University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said Carter’s comments are on target. ""Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have low favorability ratings, and they are viewed by large majorities as being dishonest and untrustworthy,"" Sabato said. ""It is notable that, just as many Republicans are declaring backing for ‘the nominee’ without mentioning Trump’s name, Carter is doing essentially the same thing for his party’s standard-bearer."" Carter’s tepid endorsement of Clinton during his Memphis visit was followed up this week with a warmer embrace of his fellow Democrat. Clinton supporters across the country Tuesday were greeted by an email from the former Georgia governor asking them to pitch in to help elect Clinton in November. 
Our ruling Former President Jimmy Carter said both major candidates for president in 2016 are ""quite unpopular."" Carter’s view is backed up by poll after poll, including one in Georgia that reflected much the same disatisfaction as the national polls.

Does Milwaukee, scene of unrest after fatal police shooting, have top black male incarceration rate?
","After a weekend of arsons and attacks on police in the Sherman Park neighborhood of her home city, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was interviewed Aug. 15, 2016 on MSNBC. There was this exchange between talk show host Lawrence O’Donnell and the Milwaukee Democrat: O’Donnell: One of the things that the history of this subject shows everywhere in the United States, is that when you get a violent community reaction like this, it is never for that one individual incident, it's always an accumulation of past grievances that have not been satisfactorily addressed in terms of the community's understanding of them, at least. Is that the case in Milwaukee? Moore: Oh, absolutely, Lawrence. You know, we have one of the youngest African-American populations in the country. And the dearth of resources for summer jobs, for economic well being, for basic things like the ability to pay rent for women and the high incarceration rate for black males. We have the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country. And it creates a powder keg. Similar claims were made by other Milwaukee Democrats, including state Sen. Lena Taylor on CNN, and have been reported by national media. So, does Milwaukee have the nation’s highest incarceration rate for black males? There is data to indicate that Milwaukee ranks very high. But there isn’t city-level data on a national level to know whether it ranks highest. Moore’s evidence To back Moore’s claim, her office cited a study from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee entitled ""Wisconsin’s Mass Incarceration of African American Males: Workforce Challenges for 2013."" It has been widely cited, but its major finding is about Wisconsin, not Milwaukee, and it is dated. The study said that as of 2010, 12.8 percent of working-age African-American men were in state prisons or local jails -- the highest such rate in the country, with Oklahoma ranking second. The study also said that in Milwaukee County, over half of African-American men in their 30s and half in their early 40s had been incarcerated in state correctional facilities at some point in the past. Other experts Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry professor who has written on the black incarceration rate, and Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, said the UWM study appears to be solid research. They also said both Milwaukee and Wisconsin have high rates of black male incarceration. But they and University of Wisconsin-Madison sociology professor Pamela Oliver,  whose research work includes the Wisconsin Racial Disparities Project, told us there simply isn’t city-level data nationally in order to rank Milwaukee. Oliver said it’s likely Milwaukee would rank high among larger U.S. cities with large black populations, but that ""many members of the general public incorrectly assume that because 70 percent of Wisconsin’s black people live in Milwaukee County that anything that is true about Wisconsin really refers to Milwaukee. It is more complicated than that."" Mauer noted that his organization, which works to address racial disparities, reported in June 2016 that -- among black males and females -- Wisconsin has the second-highest rate of black incarceration in the nation, behind Oklahoma. (Unlike the UWM study, the Sentencing Project study didn’t include local jails. And no local-level data was reported.) Our rating Moore said: Milwaukee has ""the highest incarceration rate among African-American men in the country."" There are indications that Milwaukee has a very high black male incarceration rate, including a 2016 study that ranks Wisconsin ranks second in the incarceration of black males and females in state prisons. But there are no local-level data on a national basis to determine exactly where Milwaukee ranks.

Zeldin attended some hearings his rival says he missed
","U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a freshman Republican from Long Island, sits on the Veterans Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives. But he’s barely seen, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In an article from Newsday, a DCCC spokesman accused Zeldin of missing two-thirds of the Veterans Affairs Committee's hearings. His Democratic opponent for the 1st Congressional District seat, Anna Throne-Holst, tweeted a jab at Zeldin based on the DCCC charge. ""No Show Zeldin continues to miss work, missed 2/3rds of Veterans Affairs Hearings,"" her tweet read. She linked to the article in the tweet. Zeldin’s office says he attended nearly three-quarters of the meetings held by the committee and subcommittees to which he belongs. So, who’s right: Zeldin or Throne-Holst and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee? We checked transcripts and webcasts to find out. Checking attendance The initial reply from Zeldin’s office cited his attendance at both hearings and markup sessions. During hearings, lawmakers listen to witnesses testify. In markup sessions, lawmakers meet to amend a bill. So the back and forth between Throne-Holst and Zeldin when the story first broke refferred to two different sets of numbers. We based our analysis on Zeldin’s attendance at Veterans Affairs hearings, since that’s the charge that Throne-Holst and the DCCC made. The committee has held 56 hearings since Zeldin took office and joined the committee in 2015. Zeldin’s office said he attended 36 of the 56 hearings. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said he attended 20. To verify attendance at hearings, you can check the official transcript or watch the webcast of the hearing. A hearing’s transcript includes an attendance record. But it takes time for transcripts to be available. When the DCCC made its claim in early August, the most recent official transcript was from a hearing on June 10, 2015. So only four of the 16 disputed hearings have transcripts available. Zeldin is marked as present in two of the official transcripts for meetings that the DCCC charged him with missing. In another transcript, Zeldin was not listed as present when his office said he was there. How many hearings did Zeldin attend? Verifying Zeldin’s attendance at the other hearings meant watching the webcasts. So that’s what we did. In the webcasts for 13 of the hearings. Zeldin is either heard voting or seen in plain view in five of the hearings the DCCC charged him with missing. We did not find Zeldin in eight of the hearings his office said he attended. That does not mean he wasn’t there. Zeldin’s seat is on the outside of the dais, which is sometimes cut off from the camera’s view. We found proof from transcripts and webcasts that Zeldin attended at least 28 of the 56 hearings. Our ruling The DCCC and Throne-Holst claim Zeldin missed two-thirds of the Veterans Affairs hearings.   We found through webcasts and transcripts that their claim doesn’t add up. Zeldin attended at least seven hearings the DCCC claimed he missed. Zeldin attended at least half of the hearings. He did not miss two-thirds of the hearings.

PAC ad say Bruce Poliquin voted to force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs
","The political action committee End Citizens United has launched a multi-pronged attack ad against Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, accusing the businessman of making health care more costly for older Americans. In a 30-second television commercial, the PAC says Poliquin voted for a Medicare proposal that would ""force seniors to pay thousands more."" ""He’d even force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs,"" the ad says. Poliquin's office objected to the ad, saying in a news release, ""Congressman Poliquin has been working to get prescription drug prices down, not up. That’s why he strongly supported Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for our seniors."" Who's right here? Both sides are spinning the truth. End Citizens United spokesman Adam Bozzi says the claim is a reference to Poliquin's March 25, 2015, vote for a Republican budget that called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure passed the House, but it had no shot of passing the Senate and surviving the veto of President Barack Obama Obama. The language of the ad itself if difficult to understand. We watched the ad several times and weren’t entirely sure if the ad said, ""He’d even force seniors to pay …"" or ""He even forced seniors to pay …""  The wording difference might mislead voters as to what Poliquin did or hoped to do. Either way, End Citizens United says a vote to repeal Obamacare is a vote to force seniors to pay more for drugs because repealing Obamacare would eliminate a fix to Medicare Part D known as the prescription drug doughnut hole. Here's what they’re talking about. In 2010, seniors had to pay full price for the first $310 worth of prescription drugs purchased. Between $310 and $2,830, insurance kicked in and Medicare paid 75 percent of the cost. But once the bill exceeded $2,830, seniors had to pay the full price of their drugs until the annual bill reached $4,550 (the doughnut hole). Then catastrophic insurance kicked in and insurance covered 95 percent of the cost. So the ""hole"" was the $1,720 gap between $2,830 and $4,550. In 2006, 4 million seniors ended up paying full price for some of their prescriptions because of the gap. The health care law, passed in 2010, sought to shrink and eliminate that gap in coverage. The gap is in the process of being phased out and will close completely in 2020. But even closing it gradually, combined with other features of Obamacare saved nearly 10.7 million seniors more than $20 billion on drug costs, according to a February 2016 estimate by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That's nearly $2,000 per senior since the law was enacted. Repealing Obamacare would cost seniors in other ways, as we outlined two years ago. Poliquin’s campaign argued that Poliquin actually voted against an attempt to repeal Obamacare in February 2015, because there was no plan to replace it. He voted for repeal the following month because the Republican budget had a better plan that would have kept traditional Medicare ""as a plan option"" for people in or near retirement but privatized part of the program. There was another vote on repealing Obamacare on Jan. 6, 2016. Poliquin voted in favor of it. His spokesman, Michael Byerly, said that wasn't really a vote to repeal ""as it technically only repealed the harmful taxes and provisions that have caused prices to go up."" But sponsor Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, opened debate on the measure by saying, ""For the first time since the law was enacted, Congress is one vote away from sending a broad repeal of Obamacare to the president’s desk."" Byerly, Poliquin's spokesman, also argued that prescription drug prices have gone up because of Obamacare itself, referring us to a 2010 letter from the Congressional Budget Office predicting a 1 percent increase for established drugs. Democrats, in turn, have argued that Obamacare has kept health costs lower than they would have been without the legislation. As we've reported in the past, such arguments are debatable. To sum it up, Poliquin never voted to raise drug prices directly. He voted to repeal the health care law -- a show vote that could have resulted in drug prices going up for Medicare recipients. Our ruling End Citizens United's ad says Poliquin voted to ""force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs."" It gives the misleading impression that he voted on that specific issue when, in fact, he was voting to repeal the 2010 health care law. If the repeal bill had become law — it didn’t — it would have removed provisions phasing out a prescription drug doughnut hole for Medicare recipients.  End Citizens United’s claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6836d2fa-255e-4ec2-a0f7-06edd8243e2a",/factchecks/2016/aug/30/end-citizens-united/pac-ad-say-bruce-poliquin-voted-force-seniors-pay-/

Donald Trump is wrong that 'inner-city crime is reaching record levels'
","Aiming to blunt an overwhelming edge among African-American voters, Donald Trump has been decrying longstanding black support for Democratic politicians, who he blames for allowing economic inequality and crime to fester in African-American communities. In an Aug. 29, 2016, tweet, Trump wrote, ""Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!""  Is Trump correct that ""inner-city crime is reaching record levels""? No, not even close. Record levels? There is no official category -- or even a definition -- for ""inner-city"" crime. So the best we can do is look at crime in large cities. Among the crime data the FBI collects is for that committed in cities over 250,000 in population, so that’s what we used. The chart below shows the rate of all violent crimes -- including homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults -- committed per 100,000 people, which is a standard way of measuring the extent of crime. The top line shows the rate for cities over 250,000 in population, while the lower rate shows it for the country as a whole. The two lines track each other fairly well, but the trend is unmistakable: The frequency of violent crime has declined since the early-to-mid 1990s. We also looked at one subset of the violent crime rate -- the homicide rate -- for both the country as a whole and for cities over 250,000 in population. The patterns for homicide are the same as they are for violent crime generally -- they have been declining since the early-to-mid 1990s. The same pattern holds for the subset of the nation’s very largest cities -- those of 1 million or more residents. In 2014, the violent crime rate in these largest cities was 658.7 per 100,000 residents, a significant decline from 868.9 in 2006 (and even higher in earlier years). Over the same period, the murder rate in these cities fell from 12.3 per 100,000 residents to 7.4 per 100,000 residents. A cursory look at a few specific cities shows that the number of murders, even at their somewhat elevated rate today, are well below their peaks in the 1990s. The number of murders in New York City, for instance, fell from 2,262 in 1990 to 1,927 in 1993, 629 in 1998 and 352 in 2015. And in Chicago, there were 468 murders in 2015, well below the 925 recorded in 1991, according to the Wall Street Journal. The recent spike in crime We should note that even if crime isn’t hitting record levels, there is growing evidence that there has been a one-year uptick, at least in certain cities. Trump’s supporters have seized on this as evidence that Trump isn’t totally off base in claiming that crime is on the rise. Some background: In early June, we gave Trump a Pants on Fire for his statement that ""crime is rising,"" noting that he had made a sweeping statement while ignoring the consistent and long-term decline cited above. Critics took issue with our rating, citing preliminary figures for 2015 that showed crime rising. Scholarly research published since our original fact-check suggests that the uptick is indeed notable. Later in June, the National Institute of Justice -- an office within the U.S. Justice Department -- released a paper that analyzed the uptick. It was written by Richard Rosenfeld, who studies crime at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Rosenfeld found that the preliminary increase in homicides ""was real and nearly unprecedented."" But he also added that it was not universal in the nation’s big cities. Only certain cities seemed to see significant increases. Specifically, he found that 10 out of the 56 large cities he studied ""produced two-thirds of the big-city homicide increase in 2015."" Most cities either showed small increases or declines. Here is a chart he assembled showing how big or small a spike each of the cities experienced:  Rosenfeld found that the 10 cities with the biggest spikes tended to have higher poverty rates, higher African-American populations and smaller Hispanic populations. However, he wrote that beyond that, there is insufficient public data available at this time to determine the precise cause, or mix of causes, for the top 10 cities’ homicide spikes. In any case, none of this supports Trump’s more recent statement that crime is approaching ""record levels."" Even if the recent spike proves durable, the rates of homicides and violent crime in general have fallen so much in the past 25 years that the recent increases will not push them up to ""record"" levels at any time in the near future. ""The increase in crime in inner cities in 2015 was a large one-year increase, but you can see that the long-term trend is way down,"" said Alan Lizotte, a criminologist at the University at Albany. ""The recent spike would need to continue for a while to reach early 1990s levels."" ""Inner-city crime rates are not even close to record levels,"" agreed James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. ""And crime rates among African-Americans, especially youth, were much, much higher in the early 1990s."" Our ruling Trump said that ""inner-city crime is reaching record levels."" Criminologists say that it is worth watching the recent jump in homicides in certain big cities to see whether it represents a lasting trend or just a blip. However, the homicide rate and the violent crime rate has fallen to such an extent over the past quarter century -- both in big cities and in the country at large -- that it would take many years of significant increases to return to the ""record levels"" of the early 1990s. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47151ed3-abf3-4b0c-9021-db2c19f155e6",/factchecks/2016/aug/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-inner-city-crime-reaching-recor/

Viral image perpetuates misconception that vaccines cause autism
","A viral image from the website NaturalNews.com is bouncing along through the echo chamber of Facebook. It suggests a connection between the number of vaccines given to babies in the United States over time, and an increase in people diagnosed with autism. Health memes like this are common on social media, and this particular image’s source, NaturalNews.com, encourages its community to spread the message. The site brands itself as ""the world’s top news source on natural health."" Its founder, entrepreneur Mike Adams, calls himself the ""Health Ranger."" To vet this claim of causality between vaccines and autism, we consulted Dennis Cunningham, an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Ohio State University. He is on the physician team on infectious diseases at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. What we found is that the number of autism diagnoses has risen in the past decade, but scientists aren't sure if that represents a true increase in cases or a change in diagnosis. Scientists and experts say the rise in cases, however, is not related to the number of vaccines children are receiving. Small change in vaccines The meme says the number of vaccinations has grown from 10 in 1983 to 46 in 2013. Both numbers are vastly inflated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2013 immunization schedule only lists 10 vaccines recommended for babies up to 24 months of age. ""We’re not really up to 46 vaccines,"" Cunningham said. ""They may be including vaccines administered in multiple doses, like for measles, mumps and rubella. If they are counting every time a child gets a shot as a ‘vaccine,’ I’m not sure that’s an accurate way to count."" PolitiFact Ohio attempted to contact NaturalNews through a form on the website but received no response. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website defines a vaccine as ""a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease."" One vaccine can require more than one shot to achieve the best protection. The mumps, measles and rubella vaccine (MMR), for example, prevents all three diseases. It requires two shots, one at 12 to 15 months and one at four to six years of age. Though it is designed to protect against three diseases, and is administered in two shots, the MMR vaccine is treated as one vaccine. Ian Branam, a communications specialist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told PolitiFact Ohio that vaccines sometimes require more than one shot ""to build high enough immunity to prevent disease, boost immunity that fades over time, help to make sure people who did not get immunity from a first dose are protected, or protect against germs that change over time, such as flu."" For all years, the viral image overstates the number of vaccines recommended for children. The meme says that there were 10 vaccines administered to babies in 1983. Branam gave us the official count: only three vaccines were recommended for babies under two years of age that year. The meme says that the number of recommended vaccines for babies increased to 36 by 2008. Branam corrected that number to 10 -- the same number in 2013. Rise in autism According to NaturalNews’ viral image, the rate of autism has risen from 1 in 10,000 in 1983, to 1 in 150 in 2008, to 1 in 88 in 2013.  The viral image’s figures on the prevalence of autism over time are inconsistent with CDC research. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first report on autism in 2007, and quantified its prevalence as 1 in 150. The most recent report said autism affects 1 in 68 children in 2016. The rise in the rate of the disorder is proportional to the increase in scientific and medical attention it has received, according to epidemiologist Michael Rosanoff. Rosanoff is the director of Autism Speaks, the largest autism advocacy group in the country. The numbers ""suggest that we’ve gotten better at identifying autism in the United States,"" Rosanoff said. ""Ten years ago – when the CDC first started autism surveillance --  the reported prevalence was 1 in 150. We have reason to believe that much of the increase since then is due to improved detection."" Put another way, Rosanoff says it’s not necessarily that more children have autism today, it’s that we are better at identifying it. Breaking the link between vaccines and autism rates NaturalNews’ viral image illustrates two phenomenons -- vaccines given to children, and rates of autism -- stair-stepping upward together over time. But Cunningham, with the Nationwide Children’s Hospital, told PolitiFact Ohio that the relationship is spurious. Autism rates have been going up, said Cunningham. That's partly because the criteria for the diagnosis has widened, encompassing children that would not have been considered autistic when the disease was in earlier phases of detection, he said. Moreover, NaturalNews ""is ignoring the multiple articles in medical literature that show no association between autism and vaccinations,"" Cunningham said. (PolitiFact previously has addressed this question in regards to the Measles vaccine, with scientists saying there is no connection between the vaccine and autism.) Concerns over thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that was used in some vaccines, sparked the original vaccine scare. Cunningham said thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which is quickly broken down and eliminated by the body. Methylmercury, on the other hand, can build up in cells and tissues over time, to poisonous levels. Though the harm that some feared was based on confusion between the forms of mercury, Cunningham said, thimerosal was nonetheless removed from most vaccines in 2001. ""I was one of the doctors who did not agree with taking it out, because it was not done for a scientific reason,"" Cunningham said. ""Since then, there has been no impact on the rates of autism."" On its website, the Autism Science Foundation features a statement regarding autism and vaccines. ""We’ve asked the autism vaccine question over two dozen times and each time we get the same response: no relationship,"" it says. ""We need to move on. We need to invest in studying genetics, the brain structures of children with autism, and environmental factors that may be playing a role."" Cunningham added, ""Parents absolutely have the right to make decisions for their children, but I get concerned when they move away from science and evidence-based medicine to an emotion-based response. I have seen kids die in the hospital from vaccine-preventable diseases."" Our ruling A viral meme from NaturalNews.com uses dates, rising numbers in vaccines given to babies, and rising rates of autism to suggest a relationship between vaccines and autism. The meme is inflating the number of vaccines, which stood at 10 in 2008 and 2013, according to the CDC. Meanwhile, the rate of children diagnosed with autism is increasing, though the numbers NaturalNews.com offered are not entirely accurate. The problem with this claim, however, is putting the two numbers together to lead people to believe that vaccines are causing the increase in autism rates. A pediatrician and specialist in infectious diseases said that any connection between vaccines (with or without thimerosal) and autism has been thoroughly dismissed through more than two dozen peer-reviewed studies.

Reince Priebus says Clinton campaign and supporters started the birther movement
","People may have heard from Donald Trump about the long-running myth that President Barack Obama was born outside of the United States, but Republicans say the rumor actually started from those on the left. According to GOP chairman Reince Priebus, Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign and supporters were responsible for starting the myth. ""Her campaign and her supporters in her campaign were the ones that borne out the birther movement,"" Priebus told NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard a claim about the birther movement. In 2015, Donald Trump tweeted that Hillary Clinton started the movement in 2008, adding ""She was all in!"" We rated this statement False, because there was no link to the movement and Clinton. Priebus falls halfway into the same hole, but added that her supporters also started the myth. We wanted to revisit the claim in a broader context. It started with an email In a previous fact-check, we found no evidence that Clinton or her official campaign had any direct link to starting the birther movement. Factcheck.org confirmed this, too. They reported that no journalist who explored this theory found a connection to anyone in the Clinton camp. Clinton even denied the accusation when CNN’s Don Lemon asked if she started the rumor Obama was not born in America. ""That is – no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it’s totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that,"" Clinton said. So the first part of Priebus’ statement is inaccurate. However, Priebus has a point about Clinton supporters starting the movement. During a somewhat close primary race between Obama and Clinton, it was reported that Clinton supporters sent out anonymous emails questioning if Obama was actually born in Hawaii. This was originally reported by Politico and the Telegraph. In addition, John Avalon, editor-in-chief of the the Daily Beast, wrote in his book, Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America, that Clinton volunteer Linda Starr played a key role in spreading the tale. Starr, who served as a delegate in the Texas state convention, volunteered for the Clinton campaign during the Texas primary, according to Avalon. Starr teamed up with a Pennsylvania lawyer Philip Berg, and Berg went to federal court, suing to block Obama’s nomination. That suit was thrown out multiple times, according to our article from 2015. On June 7, 2008, Hillary Clinton suspended her campaign, and urged her supporters to rally behind Obama. Our ruling  Priebus said Clinton’s campaign and her supporters started the birther movement. Half of this claim is true. It has been reported by several news outlets that Clinton supporters sent emails accusing Obama of being born outside the United States. However, there is no evidence that Clinton or her official campaign had anything to do with it. On balance, we rate Priebus’ claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b1f7651-2206-4984-bf4f-534f5448ffd6",/factchecks/2016/aug/29/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-clinton-campaign-and-supporter/

Trump says they were going to build a wall in '06, but environmental rules got in the way
","Donald Trump may have confused people recently about whether he supports mass deportation. But there’s one thing he’s been consistent about: building a wall along the southern border. And having Mexico pay for it. In an interview aired Aug. 23, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked the Republican presidential nominee how long it would take to build the wall, from start to finish. ""Almost immediately,"" Trump answered. ""Now if you would believe it, you know, they were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements. Can you believe it? Okay. Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad or…"" We were curious about wall plans from a decade ago and whether environmental impact statements hindered its construction, as Trump’s statements suggest. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for more information. But immigration experts referred us to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush. Secure Fence Act The act called for the construction 700 miles of additional fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. It also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to deter illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Bush said the new law would make borders more secure and hailed it as ""an important step toward immigration reform."" The act also required the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Environmental impact statements So there was a 2006 law that sought to increase fencing around the border. But it didn’t face hurdles from environmental impact statements. That’s because the REAL ID Act of 2005, passed by Congress, gave the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to ""waive all legal requirements"" that may get in the way of construction of barriers and roads along the border. In 2008, then Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, used his authority to waive environmental reviews. ""Congress and the American public have been adamant that they want and expect border security,"" said Chertoff in an April 2008 New York Times report. ""We’re serious about delivering it, and these waivers will enable important security projects to keep moving forward."" The secretary also waived requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act, according to Melinda Taylor, who directs an energy and environmental law center at the University of Texas and who co-wrote a paper on the environmental impacts of the border wall between Texas and Mexico. The waivers were not without controversy. ""The environment was certainly a major issue that opponents of the wall brought up,"" said Cassie Williams, spokesperson for Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors reduced immigration. But DHS did not need an environmental impact statement because of the Congress-approved waiver, Williams said. In July 2008, DHS released an Environmental Stewardship Plan, analyzing potential environmental impacts of the fence and plans to mitigate them. While there were environmental concerns related to fence construction, ""it’s simply false that environmental requirements or issues impeded wall construction,"" said Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. Gilman believes it’s appropriate to call the fencing a wall because it’s clear that it was supposed to keep people out. Segments built are generally 18-feet high, she said. Rebecca Hamlin, assistant professor of legal studies at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said environmental concerns were raised at the border, but believes money is what has halted additional construction, not environmental impact statements. A 2009 U.S. Government Accountability Office report noted that for fiscal years 2006 through 2009, the Secure Border Initiative program -- designed to secure borders and curb illegal immigration -- received about $3.6 billion. About $2.4 billion of that amount was allocated to complete about 670 miles of vehicle and pedestrian fencing along the roughly 2,000-mile border. That same report found that pedestrian fencing accounted for 140 of the miles Customs and Border Protection had completed by Oct. 31, 2008, averaging $3.9 million a mile. Vehicle fencing costs averaged $1 million a mile. ""The per-mile costs to build the fencing varied considerably because of the type of fencing, topography, materials used, land acquisition costs, and labor costs, among other things,"" the 2009 report said.       Our ruling Trump said, ""They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements."" The Secure Fence Act of 2006 called for the construction of an additional 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. While there were environmental concerns related to the construction, the Secretary of Homeland Security waived required environmental reviews in order to proceed with construction. Trump’s statement suggests a wall or barrier was not built due to inability to get environmental impact statements. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Energy', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine reverses stance on offshore drilling
","Republicans say Tim Kaine is melding his views to match those of the Democratic presidential ticket he joined recently. In an Aug. 15 post, the Republican National Committee accused Kaine of flip-flopping on several issues. Tops on their list is Kaine’s position on offshore drilling. ""Kaine recently told activists he supports banning offshore drilling off the Atlantic Coast despite being a strong advocate for offshore drilling for years,"" the GOP says. We decided to pull out the Flip-O-Meter to see if Kaine’s position has shifted on that issue. The prospect of drilling for oil and natural gas off Virginia’s coast and other Atlantic states has been hotly debated for years. At the start of this decade, energy leases to explore off Virginia’s coast were scheduled to begin. But a moratorium on those activities has been in place since the 2010 explosion on BP’s Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2013, Kaine’s first year in the U.S. Senate, he co-sponsored a measure with fellow Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner that called for opening the waters off the coast of Virginia to oil and gas drilling. The legislation called for state coffers to get a 50 percent cut of the energy royalties from drilling off Virginia’s coast. It also said that drilling wouldn’t be done in any area where it would threaten military operations or national security. ""Virginia is well-positioned to be a national leader in offshore energy exploration. A comprehensive energy strategy – including oil, gas, wind, solar, tidal and other areas – can transition us to a clean energy future while bridging that transition with secure U.S. fuels we don’t have to import,"" Kaine said in a joint 2013 statement with Warner.    ""Virginia’s diverse energy portfolio is a model for the nation. This legislation will bolster our energy security, create jobs, and direct revenues to Virginia that will support important priorities across the state."" A couple months later, in June 2013, Kaine penned an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he said ""I support development of offshore energy (gas, oil, wind and tidal) in the Atlantic."" In April 2015, Kaine was among eight senators who signed a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee asking for legislation that would provide Atlantic Coast states a share of revenues from offshore oil and gas exploration if that area was opened to new energy leases. ""Bipartisan support for oil and gas development on the Atlantic OCS (Outer Continental Shelf) can be found at the federal, state and local levels,"" Kaine and the other senators from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia wrote. ""Our states want the opportunity to create new jobs, generate new revenue."" The Obama administration had been examining whether to allow oil and natural gas drilling off Virginia and those three other Atlantic Coast states, and it included them in initial plans to open areas off the coast for oil and gas leases from 2017 to 2022. But the U.S. Department of the Interior, on March 15, said it had decided not to open the waters off Virginia and the other Atlantic Coast states for oil and gas exploration. It released an updated five-year offshore energy plan that proposes leasing operations in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The Interior Department said it was particularly moved by opposition from coastal communities as well as objections from the Department of Defense that the drilling could affect military operations along the coast in places including Hampton Roads. The same day of the Interior Department’s announcement, Kaine said he long had called for the federal government to reconsider its moratorium on drilling off the Atlantic Coast. But in that prepared March 15 statement, Kaine signaled his position was softening: ""I am particularly struck by the material objections of the Department of Defense to the incompatibility of drilling with naval operations off Virginia’s coast, cited by the BOEM (Bureau of Oceanic Energy Management) as one of the three principal reasons for their decision. I have participated in this debate for over a decade as a governor and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before. I look forward to additional discussions with DOD to understand its position."" Fast forward to August 2016. Kaine was asked after an Aug. 13 rally in Manchester, N.H., if he supported a ban on offshore drilling. ""Well, I actually am now in that position, because the Obama administration has decided not to do offshore drilling because the Defense Department objects, and I share those objections,"" Kaine said in a video of his response that was tweeted out by 350 Action, an environmental advocacy group. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an Aug. 15 story that Kaine’s opposition put him in line with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who expressed support for the Department of the Interior’s position. We asked Amy Dudley, Kaine’s national spokeswoman, for elaboration for the reasons of Kaine’s shifting stance on offshore drilling. ""As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Kaine met with DoD (Department of Defense) officials to further discuss the impact that oil drilling would have on our military operations in Hampton Roads, and concluded we should not be undertaking speculative drilling activities that could potentially impact installations in the region,"" Dudley wrote in a prepared statement. ""Sen. Kaine recognizes the Navy is a key economic pillar of the Hampton Roads economy and must be protected."" With the Flip-O-Meter, we don’t take a stance on whether a policy shift is a good or bad thing. We’re examining whether a change of position has occurred. Here, there’s little doubt that Kaine, who pushed for opening waters off the Virginia coast to drilling in 2013, opposes it now. His spokeswoman says he has come to that conclusion on the basis of additional information from Pentagon officials. So we rate this a Full Flop.",/factchecks/2016/aug/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-reverses-stance-offshore-drilling/

Gary Johnson questions pollsters as he tries to join Clinton, Trump on debate stage
","The only poll that matters, dealers in political cliches tell us, is the one taken on Election Day. For third party candidates, the Committee on Presidential Debates has imposed another consequential metric: they must reach 15 percent in a select set of polls if they want access to the debates and the attention and credibility that are attached. Right now, it looks like Clinton and Trump will be alone on stage come debate season. But if the polls were just conducted differently, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has suggested he would easily meet that requirement. ""None of the polls being conducted right now have us on the top line. None of them. It's always Trump and Clinton and then second question, third question, ‘Well, what if you add Johnson-Weld?’,"" Johnson told CNBC on August 22. In a couple of other cases Johnson specified how well he thinks he’d be doing if he were listed as an option in pollsters’ first horse-race question: 20 percent, more than enough to qualify for the debates. ""I think if we were included in the top line, as Johnson/Trump/Clinton, we'd be at 20 percent. A lot of that has to do with how polarizing the two of them are. But that's the issue right now. We need to be top line on the polls,"" Johnson said in another CNBC interview on Aug. 11. This would be quite a swing. Theodore Roosevelt was the last third-party presidential candidate to register more than 20 percent of the vote on Election Day, running as a Bull Moose in 1912, and Ross Perot reached 18.9 percent in 1992. We decided to look at whether the polls are really being conducted the way Johnson says, and if it really has such a dramatic impact. We looked at 25 national polls conducted in July and August, chosen off of a list compiled by FiveThiryEight.com. Based on this list, we can say that Johnson is certainly wrong that every poll asks about Clinton and Trump before adding his name in a later question. Eleven of the polls we looked at -- close to half -- included Johnson in their first or only question about the presidential horse-race. None of these polls vaulted Gary Johnson to 20 percent. In fact, he did slightly worse, on average, when he was included in the first horse-race question. Johnson’s average in the 25 polls was 9 percent. When he was listed in a later horse-race question, his average performance was slightly higher than that average. In the polls where he was listed in the first or only horse-race question, Johnson did slightly worse on average. Some of his best performances -- 12 percent in polls conducted for Fox News and International Business Daily and 13 percent in a poll conducted for CNN -- were in polls that listed him in a later question. We ran Johnson’s theory by several academics who study polling. While research hasn’t been done on the specific question Johnson addresses, they told us that question order could have an effect on polling results. All of them were, however, skeptical that the effect could be as large as Johnson suggested. ""It's not a totally crazy notion to think that including him in the first round versus not might affect his support. As a researcher, I would ask how big an effect that would have to be to get the kind of outcome he said. … You would have to have an effect of about 12 percent shift, which to me is just implausible,"" Adam Berinsky, a professor of political science at MIT. Even if there was some sort of bias introduced by the question order, it wouldn’t necessarily be in his favor. ""(Trump and Clinton) have the lowest favorability ratings of presidential candidates in recent memory. So I could spin a story that would suggest if you first ask about Clinton or Trump without Johnson, you kind of prime people to think ‘I don’t really like either of these folks.’ And then you include the question with him in it, and they say, ‘Oh, there’s another option,"" Berinsky said. When reached for comment about this article, Johnson communications director Joe Hunter wrote in an email that, ""As far as the issue of whether a third candidate is included in the first ballot test question, or added to a subsequent question, we believe it does, indeed, make a difference, and pollsters with whom we work agree."" Since Johnson’s likely to appear on the ballot in all 50 states, it's worth considering why any pollster puts forward a horse-race question without including his name. Support for third party candidates tends to flag down the stretch, with many of their supporters leaving for one of the major party options. Questions that only offer those candidates allow pollsters to get a sense of how people currently registering support for third parties might break if that happens. It's worth noting that Johnson seems to be bucking this trend, according to a recent article by the polling analysts at 538. Based on current polling, 538’s polls-plus general election forecast, which adjusts for economic factors and historical trends, expects Johnson to earn a bigger percentage of the vote than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1992. Our ruling Johnson said that polls ask about a straight Clinton/Trump race first, cueing them to ignore his name when it appears later. He said that including his name in the first questions pollsters asked about the horse-race could increase his support to 20 percent. Many polls do include Johnson’s name in their first horse-race poll, and Johnson does not do better in these polls. Experts say the jump Johnson is talking about is implausible. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b71a65b-45a3-4b7b-bb80-9222bc73ff4e",/factchecks/2016/aug/29/gary-johnson/johnson-questions-pollsters-he-tries-join-clinton-/

Republican Party of Florida Facebook post misses the mark in Clinton attack
","Hillary Clinton has made it clear on multiple occasions she doesn’t want to raise taxes on the middle class, but the Republican Party of Florida said she once voted to do just that. The party posted an image on its Facebook page that says Clinton ""voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500.""    Is Clinton guilty of double speak? What we found is the truth was far more nuanced than the what the image claims. Clinton’s 2008 budget vote  We never heard back from the Republican Party of Florida for evidence of this claim, but we did find the likely explanation from the Republican National Committee, which made a similar claim  Aug. 17, 2016. The GOP cites a March 14, 2008, vote, when Clinton joined Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Olympia Snow of Maine, in voting for Senate Continuing Resolution 70. The measure passed 51-44. Continuing Resolution 70 set the framework for the 2008-09 federal budget. It crafted a $3 trillion roadmap for lawmakers to follow in building the next year’s federal budget. It also created revenue markers for future years, so lawmakers could begin to contemplate how the budget picture may look down the road. If this reads like a mushy description, it is. As the New York Times put it at the time, the resolution -- and the companion passed in the House ""are nonbinding and represent no formal action on either spending or taxes."" Literally speaking, Clinton’s vote did nothing. (""Congress engages in $3 trillion political act,"" read the headline in the International Herald Tribune.) So how do Republicans claim CR 70 is evidence she voted to raise taxes on the middle class? Among the measures contained in CR 70 were revenue projections that assumed a number of temporary tax cuts signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 would expire at the end of 2010. The resolution endorsed extending $340 billion worth of the tax cuts, the Associated Press reported at the time, but ""balked at continuing all of them."" Among the projected revenue changes that Clinton voted for, one would have raised the 25 percent tax bracket back to its pre-2001 level of 28 percent. At the time of the vote, that 25 percent tax bracket started at $32,551 for single filers and went up to $78,850. Because of deductions people are allowed to claim, someone would need to make $41,500 a year to fall into the 25 percent tax bracket. A misleading attack There are several problems with this claim, however. Clinton’s vote was nonbinding. As we already mentioned, the vote didn’t affect people’s pocketbooks. CR 70 had no binding impact on the tax policy in the United States in 2008, 2009 or any year after that. The Bush tax cuts weren’t set to expire until the end of 2010. Clinton and everyone else knew that the Bush-era tax cuts wouldn’t expire until the end of 2010, when a new Congress and president would be in office. That means a different set of lawmakers would ultimately decide the fate of the tax cuts. In fact, it was a key point during the 2008 presidential election. Clinton the candidate wanted to extend the Bush-era cuts for people making less than $250,000 a year. Clinton, who was still seeking the Democratic nomination at the time of the vote, had promised to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for most Americans. ""I am absolutely committed to not raising a single tax on middle- class Americans, people making less than $250,000 a year,"" Clinton said at an ABC News debate in April 2008, a month after her vote on CR 70. ""In fact, I have a very specific plan of $100 billion in tax cuts that would go to help people afford health care, security retirement plans, you know, make it possible for people to get long-term care insurance and care for their parents and grandparents who they are trying to support, making college affordable and so much else."" Many of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were always scheduled to expire. From their initial passage, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts had a sunset provision. Again, in a literal sense, no vote was necessary to roll back many of the tax-cutting provisions. The laws were crafted to do that without any vote. William Gale, an economist at the Tax Policy Center and Brookings Institution, said allowing a temporary tax provision to expire is different from voting for a tax increase. ""In both cases, taxes would go up, but if the claim is that she VOTED for it, that seems not right to me,"" Gale wrote in an email. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said on Facebook the Hillary Clinton ""voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500."" Clinton voted for a nonbinding Senate resolution in 2008 that envisioned a world where many of the Bush-era tax cuts would have been allowed to sunset, as intended, at the end of 2010. In that world, tax rates would have gone up for someone making about $41,500 a year. But Clinton also said that had she been elected president, she would not have supported such a change and promised not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year. Neither action ultimately mattered -- Clinton’s vote didn’t carry the force of law and she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.
