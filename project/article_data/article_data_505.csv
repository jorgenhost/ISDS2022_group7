Greg Abbott says no to universal pre-kindergarten absent steps to ensure quality
","Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy Davis cited a news story as showing that Greg Abbott, the Republican choice for governor, unequivocally opposes providing pre-kindergarten to all Texas youngsters. About three hours after the Austin American-Statesman posted its March 31, 2014, story outlining Abbott’s just-revealed position on how best to serve the state’s youngest pupils, Davis put a photo-quotation on Twitter stating: ""Expanding pre-k education to all Texas children is a ‘waste’ -- Greg Abbott."" The tweet came to our attention from Matt Hirsch, an Abbott campaign spokesman. Davis’ message, retweeted more than 100 times by the next afternoon, asked followers of @WendyDavisTexas to sign a petition telling Abbott that ""educating a child isn’t a waste."" Her petition was topped by this statement: ""As he rolled out his education plan today, Greg Abbott said it would be a ‘waste’ to expand pre-k to all Texas children."" Did she get that right? Texas school districts have been required to offer pre-k to certain students since 1985, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research. Factors affecting eligibility include qualifying for a free- or reduced-price lunch, homelessness or the inability to speak or comprehend English, the institute says. In 2011-12, about 225,000 3- and 4-year-old Texans were enrolled in a pre-k class, the institute says. Abbott’s proposal states that nearly all the state’s districts offer a state-supported pre-k program. Clashing visions, plans The candidates are offering clashing visions at a time that some communities, including San Antonio, have moved to expand pre-k. The Statesman news story noted that Davis supports a broad expansion of full-day pre-k to all youngsters, costing the state about $750 million a year, the story said. In contrast, the story said, Abbott proposes spending an additional $1,500 per student in districts that agree to implement a ""gold standard"" program consisting of a rigorous curriculum and staff requirements plus assessments to measure effectiveness. Senator's back-up By phone, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said a section of Abbott’s proposal, headlined ""Effective Pre-k Programs,"" was the basis of Davis’ tweet and petition statement. Abbott’s proposal states: ""Expanding the population of students served by existing state-funded programs without addressing the quality of existing prekindergarten instruction or how it is being delivered would be an act of negligence and waste."" The sentence was the second paragraph of the Statesman story. Petkanas said the part of Abbott's statement about the state needing to address quality issues--not mentioned in Davis' claim--didn't diminish the validity of her claim that Abbott said providing pre-k to more students would be a waste. Petkanas further suggested that nothing in Abbott’s plan envisions expanded pupil enrollments. Petkanas also pointed out a section of Abbott's proposal touching on the Head Start program. The ""best available evidence,"" the proposal says, ""raises serious doubts that a large public investment in the expansion of pre-k for four year-olds will have the long-term effects claimed by supporters. Lawmakers instead should improve Texas’ current framework to better serve the existing eligible students."" Next, we read Abbott's plan with an eye out for indications he opposes expanded pre-k participation. Abbott's proposal According to the proposal, Abbott would want districts to participate in his quality-assurance program, but doesn't propose cuts in state aid for the half-day classes currently mandated. ""This proposal would leave the existing pre-k rules untouched,"" Abbott’s proposal says, while creating the option for districts to seek more aid in return for gauging and ensuring results. The added state cost of Abbott's approach would initially be $118 million over two years, according to his plan. A footnote says that if every district with a program buys in, so to speak, ""allocating enhanced funding for all eligible four-year-olds will cost an additional $294,444,000 annually."" ""Any increased investment in state-funded pre-K must tie outcomes to funding, and must provide incentives for private providers to offer high-quality kindergarten programs that meet the educational goals established by the state,"" the proposal states. Abbott’s plan calls any ""across-the-board expansion"" of pre-k without addressing quality a ""disservice to Texas students,"" and it says he’d leave it up to individual districts to fund full-day pre-k from local funds. ""Until a very high-quality, statewide half-day prekindergarten is achieved,"" Abbott proposes, ""the Legislature should not mandate full-day, but rather lawmakers should allow schools to make that decision based on the needs of their community while still rewarding schools"" that ""manage a quality program."" Abbott spokesman Avdiel Huerta emailed us the text of Abbott’s March 31 speech unveiling his pre-k ideas. The remarks speak to Texas transforming pre-k by sending more aid to districts that embrace the ""gold standard"" program. Abbott said districts adopting his ""gold standard"" would have leeway to determine effective ways to use the additional funding to meet requirements. ""Some districts may choose to hire more teachers,"" his speech said. ""Others may expand to full day pre-k. Others may choose to expand their existing partnerships with private providers."" While critical of existing pre-k, Abbott's remarks don’t directly address the idea of expanding pre-k classes to full days. We asked Huerta how Abbott responded to reporter questions about full-day pre-k. By email, he presented a question and Abbott’s reply, which seems to indicate that ""gold standard"" participants could use the added state aid to offer full-day programs. In the exchange, Abbott also used the abbreviation for independent school districts: REPORTER: The Davis people are saying that what you proposed is not expanding pre-K. If so, why is that? ABBOTT: Well, if you go back and look at the plan, what our plan does is give flexibility to local ISDs [and] allow them to decide how they want to [approach] pre-K…Some can take that $1,500 and use it to expand to full-day. Others can [use] it to hire more teachers - you have an almost infinite number of ideas of ways they [can] use the money. They could, say, buy technology. Whatever it is they feel they need. They can use that to craft what they perceive as the best pathway to achieve the Gold Standard in pre-K 4. And so, full day is a possibility for local ISD pre-K 4 if they choose it to be the best pathway for them. Our ruling According to Davis, Abbott said expanding pre-k to all Texas children would be a waste. Abbott said nothing like that in his prepared remarks, while his plan unveiled the same day folds in a caveat that Davis disregarded. In the plan, Abbott says it would be a waste to offer pre-k to more students--without addressing quality. While the senator's statement leaves a misimpression, it also has an element of truth. Abbott wouldn't move now to fund all-day pre-k for all Texas toddlers. We grade the petition claim as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Obama says more than 3 million young adults got health coverage from parents' plans
","President Barack Obama touted the success of the Affordable Care Act after 7 million people enrolled in coverage on the marketplaces by the March 31 deadline. ""Despite several lost weeks out of the gate because of problems with the website, 7.1 million Americans have now signed up for private insurance plans through these marketplaces,"" he said in an April 1 address from the Rose Garden. ""7.1 million, that’s on top of the more than 3 million young adults who have gained insurance under this law by staying on their family’s plan."" Since Sept. 23, 2010, young adults have been able to stay on their families’ private insurance plans until they turn 26. PolitiFact wanted to see for ourselves if 3 million people, a number we’ve seen disputed, have really benefited from that change. The White House pointed us to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services June 2012 report for the source of Obama’s number. Between September 2010 and December 2011, the percentage of 19- to 25-year-olds on their families’ insurance increased from 64.4 percent to 74.8 percent, according to the National Health Interview Survey. HSS then took that increase of 10.4 percentage points and multiplied it by the number of people in that age group, which, according to Census data, was 29.7 million in 2010, to arrive at nearly 3.1 million newly insured people. Their estimate is two years old and hasn’t been updated, though they say they it will be going forward. The administration’s calculation isn’t the only method you could use to evaluate the impact of the law’s increased coverage for young adults. Forbes opinion editor Avik Roy, a former Mitt Romney adviser and Obamacare critic, took down the 3.1 million figure and estimated that the true number is more like 930,000.   Factors that affect the estimate include: The starting point for counting uninsured young adults, and whether that is pre-recession The data set used for counting uninsured young adults The year the estimate was last updated Others have questioned Obama’s estimate as well. Our fact-checking colleague Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post published his own estimate of 2.2 million people, after using updated National Health Interview Surveys and also averaging 2010 figures instead of cherrypicking the third quarter, the year’s low point for uninsured young adults. Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee health care law professor who supports the law, said more than 3 million might be a high estimate, but Roy’s is too low. Again, he acknowledged that there are a number of different ways to arrive at the estimate, but his best guess is 2.5 million. Everyone agreed that the number of young adults covered definitely increased as a result of the law. But there’s no telling by exactly how much. Our ruling Obama said more than 3 million adults aged 19 to 25 got health coverage as a result of an Affordable Care Act mandate that allows those individuals to remain on their families’ private plans. There’s no way to get an exact figure, and estimates range anywhere from less than 1 million to 3.1 million. Obama’s estimate may be quite high, but his point that the law’s mandate has increased coverage in that age range is spot on.

McCaul: 'When people enter the service, there’s not a mental health evaluation'
","The second shooting at the Texas military base Fort Hood in less than five years has reopened wounds -- and old debates. During the Sunday morning political shows on April 6, 2014, typical questions over base security and concealed carry rules on military installations emerged in the wake of the deadly shooting last week, with politicians and pundits mostly assuming their party-line positions. But there was some bipartisan consensus that the military should take a closer look at the mental health of enlisted service members. On Fox News Sunday, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said the effort should start at sign-up. ""When people enlist in the military, there is a physical check but there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service,"" McCaul. ""I think this will be a good idea to, No. 1, screen out individuals that may have mental illness problems. No. 2, have a baseline so that when they return home, we can compare that to where they are when they come back."" We were unfamiliar with the process men and women go through to enlist and imagine McCaul’s claim about mental health evaluations caught the attention of viewers as well. So we decided to check it out. No formal process Officials have not yet identified a motive that caused Army Spec. Ivan A. Lopez to open fire at the Fort Hood base, killing three and injuring more than a dozen. Lopez was being treated for depression and was screened for post traumatic stress disorder, though Army officials have said mental health was ""not the direct precipitating factor"" in the shooting. McCaul’s office pointed us to legislation introduced by Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Penn. on March 27, 2014 -- coincidentally, just days before the shooting -- called the ""Medical Evaluation Parity for Service Members Act."" The bill would require a medical evaluation before an individual enlists in the armed forces. According to the legislation, ""Although the military currently has a baseline measurement process for physical health, the military does not currently have similar standards for mental health."" Speaking in favor of the bill, retired Army colonel and director of legislation for the National Guard Association of the United States Peter Duff said, ""Not having a baseline is a neglectful disservice to our military members and veterans who risk their lives for our nation."" The bill has the support from various military and veteran organizations, including Veterans of Foreign Wars, National Guard Association of the United States, Reserve Officers Association, Reserve Enlisted Association, Association of the U.S. Navy, National Military Family Association and Military Officers Association of America, as well as the American Psychological Association. A mental health examination is not listed in a description of the application procedure on the United State Military Entrance Processing Command website or in the Military Entrance Processing Station regulations. That’s all pretty strong evidence that no separate examination for identifying mental health disorders in enlistees exists, at least not in a similar form as the physical new recruits must go through. What does exist? But is there any evaluation the armed services conduct upfront? In addition to an aptitude test, as part of the initial screening, military officials review the medical records of potential service members for their mental health history. Col. Rebecca I. Porter, chief of the behavioral health division of the Office of the Army’s Surgeon General, told the Washington Post that the application process ""includes a review of whatever medical records we have available, as well as asking potential soldiers to complete questionnaires where they might disclose information. We look for past diagnoses or past treatments, or other indicators of behavioral problems."" Porter said a past suicide attempt, mood disorders like depression or bipolar disorders or drug abuse could all preclude someone from gaining admittance to one of the service branches. But much of that review requires the individual to have a documented medical history or to offer information that they may have problems. Such an admission would likely mean they would not be accepted. ""People who want to come into the Army are no fools,"" Dr. Elspeth Ritchie, a former chief psychiatrist in the Army, told the Los Angeles Times. ""They know if you say you had a past suicide attempt, you're probably not going to get in."" A recent study from the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry conducted in consultation with the U.S. Army found 1 in 5 servicemembers had a mental health disorder before they even enlisted. Once enlisted, however, service members are prone to frequent mental health evaluations before and after deployment. ""We have a series of evaluation of any soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, Coast Guardsman who's deployed prior to their deployment,"" Retired Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker told NPR. ""They have access to mental health and physical health care providers, as well, while they're on deployment. And when they return from deployment, within 30 days of their being redeployed, they have another series of examinations with the help of their small unit leader down-range, which is then married up with further assessments that take place when they hit the ground back at home station."" Mental health evaluations can also be recommended by the overseeing officer. ""If the chain of command becomes aware of a change in the soldier’s behavior, he can ask the soldier to be seen at a behavioral health clinic,"" Porter said in her Post interview. ""Or if a commander had questions about a soldier’s fitness for duty, they could do a command-directed mental health evaluation, in which case a soldier is referred for evaluation with the understanding that the behavioral health provider will provide feedback to the commander."" Not everyone in the military community agrees that a mental health evaluation upfront would be helpful. Schoomaker, a surgeon in the Army until 2012, recently told the Los Angeles Times that such a process ""would just lead to driving the problems further underground."" Our ruling McCaul said ""there's not a mental health evaluation when people enter the service."" Compared to the physical medical examination potential enlistees go through, there is no separate, specific examination of a recruit’s mental health. While the armed services review past medical records for a history of mental health issues and allow for the applicant to offer any additional information, it has not prevented a sizable number of individuals with mental health problems from acceptance. Lawmakers and military officials can debate what steps should or should not be taken, but we can’t find any flaw in McCaul’s characterization of the current procedures.

Liz Cheney: 'People that support Obamacare ... have been steadily dropping'
","Conservative pundits often incorporate polling data into their arguments against the Affordable Care Act, and it’s no wonder: Polls usually reveal that a plurality find the law unpopular. But a claim by Liz Cheney, the former conservative Wyoming Senate candidate and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, shows how polling trends can be easily flubbed on TV. As part of a political roundtable on Fox News Sunday on April 6, Cheney tried knocking down Democratic cheering about news from the White House that 7 million people signed up for Obamacare. The real story? The law is losing support, she said. ""The numbers of people that support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping,"" she said. ""The latest Wall Street Journal polls show that."" PunditFact wanted to know if Cheney’s point is accurate. We didn’t hear back from her after reaching out on Twitter. Polls run aplenty, and the health care law is a frequently surveyed topic. We already know from PolitiFact that a sizable share of Americans want the health care law repealed, but they do not increasingly want it repealed. We wanted to look at the evolving support and opposition for the health care law, and not just from the Wall Street Journal. Sites like Huffington Post Pollster and Real Clear Politics offer averages of several polls to give readers an idea of the public’s changing views of the law since its infancy. It’s not a perfect way of looking at the data, as the survey questions are not identical and the polls vary in size. Still, the polling aggregators don’t show steadily falling approval ratings for the law. According to a Real Clear Politics average of nine major polls from March 16-31, 40.4 percent of Americans favor the law and 52 percent do not. This is less than 2 percentage points shy of the favorability mark for much of March a year ago, and down a bit from a recent high of 42.6 percent at the end of October (the highest average on Real Clear Politics was 43 percent in June 2010). As problems with the online insurance marketplaces mounted last fall, approval for the law fell, hitting 36.9 percent in December. Approval ratings since have spurted up and down to their most recent place. See the chart. HuffPost’s Pollster shows a similar trend in its aggregration. The most recent average for people who favor the health care law is 41.2 percent, down from 42.1 percent in October but up from 38.1 percent in December. After the health care law passed in March 2010, poll averages hovered between 40 and 43 percent for the rest of the year before falling off a bit. Obama’s re-election gave the favorability ratings another boost during the end of 2012, peaking at 43.4 percent.  Polls on the health care law have been pretty consistent, said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. She pointed to AEI’s March 2014 study of health care polling by nine major pollsters since 2009. Shifts in support for the law have not been one of the bigger storylines because it has not changed that dramatically, she said. People usually chew on President Barack Obama’s favorability ratings or how he is handling the law’s implementation. Not even the poll Cheney singled out provides persuasive evidence for her claim that supporters have been turning against the law. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was a March 5-9 survey of 1,000 adults with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. The poll asked, ""From what you have heard about the new health care law, do you think it is a good idea or a bad idea?"" and then ""do you feel that way strongly, or not so strongly?"" In March 2014, 35 percent said it was a good idea, and 49 percent said it was bad. Digging a little deeper, 26 percent of people said they strongly thought it was a good idea, trailing the 42 percent of respondents who felt strongly that it’s a bad idea. Previous NBC/WSJ surveys, of which there were eight since June 2013, don’t show a recent favorability freefall.  ""It is clearly more unpopular than popular, but negativity isn't growing in this poll,"" Bowman said. In fact, a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post has Democrats hoping they’re flipping the Obamacare narrative. For the first time in at least 20 ABC/Post polls since August 2009, more people said they supported the law than opposed it, with support hitting a high of 49 percent. The 49 percent-48 percent margin could mean divisions are closer to a dead heat in the months after botched healthcare.gov rollout. Support was 40 percent and opposition was 57 percent in a November 2013 ABC/Post poll. Whether it’s an outlier or a new direction remains to be seen. ""It could be that the tide is turning,"" Bowman said. ""We just don’t know."" Our ruling Cheney said, ""The numbers of people that support Obamacare and like it have been steadily dropping."" Americans remain divided on the health care law, and most polls show that more people oppose it than support it. But we found no evidence that people who once supported the law are ""steadily"" changing their minds -- not even in the poll Cheney specifically cited.

Scott Walker says recent Wisconsin poll shows 70% approval for collective bargaining law that led to massive protests, recall election
","During a radio interview on April 1, 2014, Gov. Scott Walker claimed that a poll taken ""a few months ago"" showed ""70 percent approval or higher"" for Act 10, the collective bargaining reform law that spurred massive protests in Madison and an attempt to remove him from office. Statewide polls typically get widespread news coverage. But we don’t recall any recent headlines about 70 percent support for Act 10, which sharply curbs collective bargaining for most public employees and makes the employees pay more for their pensions and health care. Walker's claim is important because he is counting on support for the law in his effort to win re-election in November 2014. So let's see what the governor is talking about. Act 10 Walker largely credits Act 10 for shoring up state and local government finances. The measure has been vilified for repealing most collective bargaining for public employee unions, both at the state and local government levels. But even Walker’s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, who thinks Act 10 went too far on that score, is among critics who say the law nevertheless took a necessary step in requiring most public employees to pay more for their benefits. Walker signed the bill two months after taking office, in March 2011. Because of reaction to it, he faced a recall election in June 2012. The timing is important in assessing Walker's claim. It has been more than three years since Act 10 became law and nearly two years since it was the focus of the recall. In other words, it hasn't been a hot topic for pollsters for some time. And public opinion can change. The claim Walker made his statement about support for Act 10 to Jay Weber, a conservative radio talk show host at WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee. Weber began the interview by praising a number of Walker’s tax cuts, including a trim to property taxes. Then he alluded to Walker’s race with Burke. Weber cited results from a statewide Marquette Law School poll released on March 26, 2014, six days before the interview, and asked Walker about his approval rating. The poll had shown 47 percent of registered Wisconsin voters approved of how Walker handled his job. That was down from 51 percent in the previous Marquette survey, done two months earlier. The new poll, Weber said, ""showed that there was strong approval for the tax cut -- who wouldn’t want their taxes cut? -- but it didn’t translate into a bump in your approval ratings. So, what does that tell you -- you need to sell this before fall?"" ""Yeah, I think so. I think a combination,"" Walker said before citing another poll result, albeit with a number of qualifiers. ""If you look at that, the previous poll that was taken a few months ago also showed, I think, there was something like -- if I remember right -- something like 70 percent approval or higher for our reforms, the reforms that are commonly called Act 10, the budgetary reforms which allowed not just the state but local governments to balance their budgets as well."" Cleaned up, here’s the claim we’re checking: A poll taken ""a few months ago"" -- so, roughly early 2014, or perhaps late 2013 -- found ""70 percent approval or higher"" for Act 10. The evidence Neither the March 2014 Marquette Law School poll cited by Weber, nor the January 2014 version Walker seemed to allude to, included any questions about Act 10. So we wondered which survey Walker was relying on to back his claim. Walker press secretary Laurel Patrick told us the governor was referring to a question in the Marquette poll from late May 2012. That's nearly two years ago. That question asked: ""As you know, last year a number of changes were made concerning state employees, state spending and policies. For each, please tell me if this is something you favor or oppose -- requiring public employees to contribute to their own pensions and pay more for health insurance?"" The results were: Favor – 75%; Oppose – 22%; Don't Know – 3%. On other questions, however, support was not that high: 55% said they favored limiting collective-bargaining for most public employees and 50% said they preferred the change to collective bargaining rather than going back to the old law. (Another school that does regular statewide polling in Wisconsin is St. Norbert College near Green Bay. Like Marquette, it has not polled on Act 10 since May 2012. The results at that time: 59 percent favored allowing public employees to collectively bargain for wages and 60 percent favored bargaining for health and retirement benefits.) In any case, the Marquette results Walker cites are from nearly two years ago, not a few months ago. And no publicly released poll has asked Wisconsinites about Act 10 since then, according to Marquette Law School poll director Charles Franklin and St. Norbert College political science professor Wendy Scattergood, an associate with the St. Norbert College Survey Center Wisconsin. As for what the level of support for Act 10 there may have been a few months ago, Franklin told us the results could be the same, but: ""We simply don't know."" Our rating Walker said a poll ""taken a few months ago"" found ""70 percent approval or higher"" for his Act 10 collective bargaining law. No known poll has asked Wisconsinites about Act 10 in the months leading up to Walker's statement on April 1, 2014, and his staff did not cite one. One poll question from May 2012 found 75 percent support for one part of the law, but what the level of support for Act 10’s various provisions might have been a few months ago is strictly speculation. We rate Walker's statement False. ",/factchecks/2014/apr/06/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-recent-wisconsin-poll-shows-70-a/

Rhode Island legislator Linda Finn says large majority of residents want to ban assault weapons
","During debate on any contentious issue, advocates will argue that the public is on their side. That was the case during a March 18, 2014, State House rally designed to encourage the Rhode Island General Assembly to adopt stronger gun-control laws. Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, used that strategy at the end of her speech. ""By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent,"" she said. We decided to see whether support for an assault weapons ban is really that high and the level of gun ownership in Rhode Island is really that low. PolitiFact has looked at the issue nationally, giving a Mostly True to Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 2013 comment that ""No poll done this year . . . shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."" But Finn is claiming a much larger margin of support. When we contacted Finn, she sent us the results of a poll released in February 2013 in which 64 percent of Rhode Islanders said they supported banning assault weapons, 27 percent were opposed and 9 percent were not sure. Even with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent, that's a 2-to-1 margin. The 24-question survey of 614 voters covered a wide range of issues and was done by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Unlike most other polling services, PPP collects its data through robocalls, in which people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people -- typically 9 out of 10 -- hang up without responding. After checking with area pollsters, we couldn't find a more traditional survey of Rhode Islanders on the assault weapons issue. Finn said she thought the PPP results were similar to the results of national polls. They're not. We found a compilation of assault weapons polls at PollingReport.com and discovered that the degree of support for a ban on assault-style weapons was much less pronounced. The split was 54-42 in a May 2013 Pew study, 56-42 in an April 2013 ABC News / Washington Post survey, 51-48 in an April 2013 CNN / ORC poll, and 59-36 in a March 2013 Quinnipiac University survey. Those national results don't come close to the 2-to-1 margin of support seen in the PPP Rhode Island poll, but that shouldn't be surprising when other parts of the United States have very different attitudes toward firearms. And what about Finn's statement about the rate of gun ownership in Rhode Island? A direct state-by-state tally of gun owners is not available. In fact, it is illegal in Rhode Island for the state to maintain a gun registry. We do know that in 2013, 3,280 active concealed carry permits were issued by the Rhode Island attorney general's office. But that's only a small fraction of owners. Also last year, Rhode Island gun dealers reported doing 21,793 BCI background checks for the purchase or transfer of at least one firearm. All but 145 were approved. But that number doesn't tell you how many gun owners there are in Rhode Island because that's only for one year, each purchase might involve more than one weapon, and the same owner might be counted multiple times if he or she makes more than one purchase throughout the year. So the best information comes from surveys. Finn sent us to a webpage at About.com which reports that 12.8 percent of Rhode Island's population owns guns, and the only states where gun ownership was lower were Massachusetts, New Jersey and Hawaii. About.com says the source is the website USACarry.com. But it’s actually from a from a survey done six years earlier -- in 2001 -- by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which tracks health risks in the United States and is billed as ""the world’s largest telephone survey."" In addition, that wasn't the percentage of the population owning guns. It was the percentage of adults who said there was at least one weapon in their household. We were unable to get more recent data from the BRFSS, which asked the question in 2002 and 2004. But we found it in two studies. A 2005 paper in the journal Pediatrics reported that the 2002 rate in Rhode Island was 13.3 percent, slightly higher than what Finn reported. A 2013 paper in the American Journal of Epidemiology looked at the data from 2004, reporting a rounded-off rate of 12 percent, which conforms with what Finn said. Our ruling Rep. Linda Finn said, ""By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent.""

Virginia GOP says McAuliffe budget would `raid' school funds to pay for Obamacare
","The Republican Party of Virginia says Gov. Terry McAuliffe is planning to help fund Medicaid expansion in Virginia by taking money from education and other state services. A March 26 tweet on the RPV website said, ""@TerryMcAuliffe Not only did the GOP read your budget, we found the part where you were going to raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA.,"" We wondered whether the governor’s Medicaid plan really calls for such a diversion of funds. McAuliffe, a Democrat, has been urging the General Assembly to expand eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program to an additional 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, the federal government would pay the entire expansion cost for the next three years and 90 percent of it down the road. The Republican-led House of Delegates has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget. We asked Garren Shipley, the state GOP’s communications director, for evidence that McAuliffe plans to ""raid"" education and other services to pay for Obamacare. Shipley referred us to a paragraph in the thick budget plan released by the governor last month. On Page 516, it says, ""The Director of the Department of Planning and Budget is hereby authorized to transfer appropriations among agencies and programs as needed so as to implement coverage for newly eligible individuals pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1396d(y)(1)[2010] of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."" That sequence of numbers, letters and parentheses in the paragraph refer to the section of U.S. law that spells out Uncle Sam’s obligations for paying most of long-term costs for Medicaid expansion. Shipley said the paragraph allows the administration to move money from any agency or department to fund Medicaid expansion. Shipley said if McAuliffe ""intended"" to do otherwise, the language would not be in his budget plan. But Brian Coy, a spokesman for McAuliffe, called the claim ""an absurd allegation on its face."" ""That language is there for a very discrete purpose,"" he said. ""It will allow the Department of Planning and Budget to distribute money that would come into the Commonwealth for closing the coverage gap for Medicaid expansion."" If Virginia broadens eligibility, the new federal funds would flow into the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs the state’s Medicaid program. But to fully benefit from the expansion, DMAS would need to transfer some of the money to other state departments -- something is not empowered to do. Under expansion, for example, Medicaid would cover the treatment of inmates that needed  to stay in non-prison hospitals for more than 24 hours. Funds would need to be shifted from DMAS to the Department of Correctional Services. The conduit for that transfer would be the Department of Planning and Budget. Expansion also would broaden Medicaid services for mental health and substance abuse. That would require money to be shifted from DMAS to the Department of Behavioral Health. Again, the Department of Planning and Budget would be the pipeline. Secretary of Finance Ric Brown said that because the transfer language sits in a section of the budget dealing with Medicaid expansion, the administration believes it applies only to those limited uses. But Brown added that wording of the provision could be improved. ""The language could be tightened down,"" he said. ""It could be tweaked to make sure it’s specific."" We sought an opinion on the provision from retired state Sen. John Chichester, a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Chichester, a Republican who crossed party lines last fall and endorsed McAuliffe for governor, said the amendment would give the administration power to take money from other areas of the budget for Medicaid. But he questioned whether such a policy would be wise. Coy said such an effort would be unwise. He noted that the governor’s budget uses $225 million in expected savings from Medicaid expansion to fund pay raises for state employees and teachers, boost the Virginia Retirement System and increase benefits to workers who face hazardous duty. ""The budget is taking the savings from Medicaid money and puts it into programs,"" Coy said. ""We’re not going to then pull money from those programs into Medicaid."" Our ruling The state Republican Party tweeted that within McAuliffe’s budget, ""we found the part where you were going to raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA."" McAuliffe invited some concern by submitting a budget amendment that can be interpreted as giving him authority to transfer money in and out of Medicaid from other state programs. The governor disputes that the provision gives him such power. In any case, ""can"" does not mean ""will."" The GOP goes overboard in saying McAuliffe is ""going to raid"" schools and other state programs to help pay for Medicaid expansion -- an endeavor that almost entirely would be supported by federal funds. The Republicans offer no proof that this is McAuliffe’s plan. In making the sensational claim, the GOP ignores that the governor has proposed using savings from Medicaid expansion to bolster other state programs, including education. So the GOP tweet has a grain of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give people a different impression.

"['Oregon', 'Transportation', 'Andy Duyck']","
Has Washington County spent more on bike/ped projects under Andy Duyck's watch than in county history?
","Washington County voters have historically supported road-funding measures, giving road planners a revenue stream that officials in Multnomah and Clackamas counties can only dream of. But in recent years, concerns have grown about how much money to spend on building and maintaining bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Claim Andy Duyck,  elected chairman of the Washington County Board of Commissioners in 2010 and now running for re-election, touted his alternative-transportation credentials at a recent Washington County Public Affairs Forum. ""We’ve dedicated more money from (the county’s) transportation budget to bike and ped projects under my watch than at any time in the history of Washington County,"" he said. Unlike Portland, which routinely is ranked among bike-friendly cities, Washington County isn’t known as a bastion for bikes. So PolitiFact Oregon hit the road to check Duyck’s claim. The Analysis We contacted county spokesman Stephen Roberts, who pointed us to documents that seem to support the assertion. The last budget adopted before Duyck became board chairman in 2011, for instance, contained $6 million less for bicycle and pedestrian improvements than is budgeted in the current fiscal-year cycle. Of that, $3 million comes from Gain Share, a state program that compensates local governments for providing tax breaks to qualifying companies. ""This represents new dedicated bike/ped funding that did not exist before,"" Roberts wrote in an email. An additional $2.7 million for bike/ped projects this year is coming from a special district formed years ago to resurface hundreds of miles of streets in the county’s urban, unincorporated area. If incorporated, it would would be one of the largest cities in the state. In September 2011, the Board of Commissioners approved Duyck’s suggestion to modify the program to allow funding of ""safety improvements,"" including sidewalks. Twelve of 13 projects funded this year have been pedestrian improvements, according to county budget documents. ""This also represents new funding available for bike/ped improvements,"" Roberts wrote. The final chunk of ""new"" money comes from the county’s Minor Betterments program, an allocation of the county’s road fund. The $500,000 available this year for bike/ped projects compares with $320,000 budgeted the year before Duyck became chairman, according to documents. Together, those numbers show significantly more money is spent now for bike/ped improvements than before Duyck became chairman. But can he fairly say that money is ""more than at any time in the history of Washington County""? It’s difficult to say that with authority, Roberts said, because a decade or more ago, total road project costs were the only figures recorded. Bike/ped work done as part of those projects was not broken out, he said. ""But the county has only gotten bigger,"" Roberts said. ""And in all typical projects we take on now, we estimate that 25 percent is bike/ped. Based on the numbers, it seems like an accurate statement."" For additional historical reference, we reviewed county spending on these projects going back to the boom years of 2004-05. That year’s combined total of the top two sources for bike/ped money was the second-highest ever. Even so, the total still fell about $5 million short of this year’s record-breaking amount. Finally, we called Commissioner Dick Schouten, an outspoken advocate of bike-friendly policies who shows up to most meetings on his bike. Of Duyck’s claim, he said, ""I guess that’s true in the sense we have some new programs and access to additional dollars we didn’t have before."" He quibbled only with Duyck’s use of the phrase ""under my watch."" ""I’m not sure what that means, ‘under my watch,’"" Schouten said. ""He’s one vote among five."" In addition, unlike in Multnomah County, the Washington County chair does not prepare the annual budget. The Ruling Washington County board Chairman Andy Duyck, now running for re-election, claims that more money has been spent for bicycle and pedestrian improvements during his first term as chairman than at any time in Washington County history. Budget documents show that spending for such projects is now more than $6 million more than it was before Duyck became chairman. Comparable figures from more than a decade ago aren’t available because statistics specific to bike/ped projects weren’t listed separately then. However, spending on bike/ped projects during the building-boom years of 2004-05 was $5 million less than current allotments. A fellow commissioner noted that Duyck didn’t approve the spending allocations alone since it takes at least three votes for a budget proposal to win. We also note that while Duyck voted for the increases, his ""watch"" doesn’t come with the power to write the proposals. We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/apr/04/andy-duyck/has-washington-county-spent-more-bikeped-projects-/

Chain email says Michelle Obama waved communist flags in China
","The activities of Barack and Michelle Obama provide endless fodder for chain emails critical of the first family. A reader recently sent us one based on an event that occurred on Michelle Obama’s March 2014 trip to China. The email features a meme that’s based on a photo of the first lady. It shows her energetically waving two red flags, one in each hand. A superimposed caption reads, ""Michelle Obama waves red communist flags on her taxpayer-funded visit to China. Anyone remember her ever waving an American flag?"" The meme includes a Web address for Tea Party Nation, a Facebook-style social media website for conservatives. The reader sent us the email wanting to know whether it is accurate, so we took a look. (Snopes.com beat us to the punch with a fact-check here.) Was Obama waving ""red communist flags""? No, it was simply a bit of audience participation during a folk dancing exhibition. It came as Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha were visiting an ancient wall in the former capital city of Xi’an. The exhibit ""began with a breathtaking display of drumming and music by performers dressed in colorful traditional costumes,"" Michelle Obama wrote in her trip diary, which was later posted on the White House website. Later that day, the family and its entourage watched a second group of drummers and folk dancers. ""They did a lovely dance number for us (and my daughters and I joined in for some dancing at the end),"" Obama wrote. A White House press pool report said Michelle Obama and Malia were ""swaying to the music, mostly drums."" Photographs -- posted at the White House website and also in various media outlets, such as the Guardian and NBC News -- confirm that the flags in question are not the Chinese flag. The national flag of China features five gold stars on a solid red field. Instead, Michelle Obama is clearly holding much longer banners that were used during one of the folk-dancing celebrations. The dancers are wearing and carrying a variety of colors other than red, including shades of purple, yellow and green. ""Anyone remember her ever waving an American flag?"" Our online photo search pulled up at least one image of Michelle Obama waving a flag, taken while she was cheering on United States swimmers at the 2012 London Olympics. We also found ample evidence that Obama appears to enjoy displays of red-white-and-blue patriotism. For instance, on the eve of the London Olympics, Obama attended a sendoff for Team USA by wearing ""a bright red peplum top and a white and red jacket that basically looked like a retro American flag,"" according to a Huffington Post account. ""Standing against a navy backdrop, Michelle Obama would have made Betsy Ross proud."" In addition, Mrs. O -- a now-defunct blog ""dedicated to chronicling the fashion and style of First Lady Michelle Obama"" -- noted that when the Obamas celebrated July 4, 2012, on the South Lawn of the White House, Michelle Obama wore ""a red and blue striped shell paired with a pleated, side button white skirt. The president did his part on the fashion front, sporting a patriotic red, white and blue cowboy hat."" And during a 2011 trip to Botswana, Obama was photographed looking thrilled when she was welcomed by 25 schoolchildren waving American flags. Our ruling The chain email said Michelle Obama waved ""red communist flags"" on her trip to China. In reality, she didn’t wave the national flag of China or any other ""communist"" flag -- she was simply waving long red banners during a folk-dancing exhibition.

Were five aircraft carriers docked in one place in 2014, and was that a risk prompted by Barack Obama?
","A chain email says that President Barack Obama was irresponsible to order five first-line aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together -- purportedly the first time this had been done since World War II. Readers asked us to look into the email, which raised the specter of Pearl Harbor and implied that there may have been an ulterior motive on Obama’s part. So we decided to check it. (A hat tip to Snopes.com, the urban-legend website, which has also rated this claim.) Accompanied by a photograph of five aircraft carriers docked together, the email begins, ""What’s wrong with this picture? The picture is of the five first line U.S. nuclear carriers docked together in one place. Just like Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941. This picture was taken February 2014 in Norfolk, Va. .  . Obama ordered five nuclear carriers into harbor for ‘routine’ (?) inspections. Heads of the Navy were flabbergasted by the directive but had to comply as it was a direct order from their commander-in-chief."" It continues, ""This is the first time since WWII that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together. USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS George H.W. Bush, USS Enterprise, USS Harry S. Truman and USS Abraham Lincoln are all in port at Naval Station in Norfolk, Va., the world’s largest naval station."" Let’s start with the picture. The photograph is genuine -- the five carriers were indeed docked at Norfolk Naval Base at the same time -- but the email gets much of the context wrong. The picture was taken in December 2012, not February 2014, as the email claims. The email is also wrong about why the carriers were there. They were not docked for ""routine inspections"" -- they were brought to shore so that crew members could spend Christmas with their families. Intercepts, a defense news blog, reported in a Dec. 20, 2012, post that the Navy ""makes a point"" of trying to give its crew a chance to spend Christmas with their families, ""and for a few days the percentage of ships underway drops to the lowest point it will be all year."" What about this being the first time since World War II that five nuclear carriers were docked together? The quick answer is that December 2012 was not the first time since the war that five nuclear powered aircraft carriers were docked at the same place at the same time. A similar unintentional gathering took place at Norfolk in July 1997. A July 2, 1997, Associated Press article published in the Daily Press of nearby Newport News, Va., reported that ""for the first time"" all five Norfolk-based nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be ""moored at their home port."" The Navy spokesman at the time, Mike Maus, addressed this rare grouping. ""It just worked out that way,"" Maus said. ""There was no plan to say, ‘Let’s bring all the carriers in for the Fourth of July.’ Between scheduling for normal routine operations and shipyard stuff, that’s how it happened to fall into place."" The AP reported in 1997 that the Navy doesn’t consider having all five carriers in port at the same time to be a security risk. ""At this particular time,"" Maus said, ""we don’t really have much of a threat from anybody.""   What about Obama’s role in the carriers’ placement? Dictating the day-to-day locations of aircraft carriers is ""not really something the commander-in-chief deals with,"" said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org. Our ruling A chain email says Obama ordered five aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together in 2014, supposedly the first time this had been done since World War II. But the rendezvous occurred in 2012, a similar grouping happened at the base in 1997, and it was done so that naval personnel could be with their families for the Christmas holiday -- not for nefarious reasons that posed a security risk.

Has the EPA called Koch brothers businesses a 'model' company for a clean environment?
","For several weeks now, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has taken to the chamber floor to malign David and Charles Koch, the billionaire brothers who contribute heavily to libertarian causes and bankroll ads critical of Democrats. On April 2, 2014, Charles Koch fired back in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, arguing that Reid’s comments were disrespectful and a bad sign for democracy. And he defended Koch Industries and their subsidiaries against attacks, including claims that they oppose environmental protections. ""Koch employees have earned well over 700 awards for environmental, health and safety excellence since 2009, many of them from the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health Administration,"" Koch wrote. ""EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ "" Subsidiaries of Koch Industries include manufacturers like paper maker Georgia Pacific and INVISTA, a textile fiber producer. It also owns companies that deal with excavation of natural resources like Flint Hills Resources and Koch Pipeline. As you can imagine, these are industries that are heavily regulated by federal agencies like the EPA. So does the EPA think Koch Industries is a model environmentalist? We decided to explore that claim. Tracking down the quotes Quotes can often be taken out of context, so we thought it would be useful to understand exactly what the EPA said about Koch Industries and their subsidiaries. A spokesman for Koch Industries was able to provide a pair of press releases with the full quotes. So did the EPA call Koch Industries a ""model for other companies""? Kinda, but not really. The EPA was complimentary of one specific agreement reached in 2010 with Koch subsidiary Flint Hills Resources after the agency raised concerns about permits for a refinery in Texas. ""The process we have agreed to with Flint Hills Resources is an excellent one, and we look forward to working with the company to complete the work to transition their permits,"" stated Al Armendariz, Regional Administrator for EPA Region 6. ""It is our hope that the FHR process will serve as a model for other companies seeking to transition to federally-approved permits."" As you can see, they were very complimentary of the process in this one instance for this refinery in Texas. But it wasn’t really a blanket statement of the company or Koch Industries. Let’s move on to whether the EPA has commended Koch Industries for their ""commitment to a cleaner environment."" This one has more truth to it, but again, in a limited context. In 2009, Georgia Pacific was named a SmartWay Excellence Award recipient by the EPA. SmartWay is a private-public program run by the EPA that links up manufacturers and retailers with transportation services to ""improve fuel efficiency and the environmental performance ... of the goods movement supply chains."" Georgia Pacific was given the award because the company increased its partnership with SmartWay-approved carriers and grew more efficient in their distribution models. According to a Georgia Pacific press release, here’s the full quote from the EPA official: ""I commend Georgia-Pacific for its leadership in promoting sustainable transportation practices through the SmartWay Transport Partnership,"" said Margo T. Oge, director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA. ""These actions demonstrate a commitment to a cleaner environment and more secure energy supply."" An EPA spokeswoman told PolitiFact that the statement was solely ""about GP’s transportation practices as a member of SmartWay,"" and not an assessment of the entire company. Interestingly, the EPA used identical language in 2000 after reaching a clean air agreement with Koch Petroleum Group and BP Amoco. But the accord was only finalized after Koch was forced to pay a $4.5 million penalty and spend $80 million to improve emissions in three refineries. ""BP Amoco and Koch took the initiative to begin talks with EPA earlier this spring rather than wait for possible EPA enforcement action,"" the EPA said in a press release. ""In return for the company’s cooperation and ambitious commitment to a cleaner environment, EPA has offered a ‘clean slate’ for certain past violations, and greater flexibility and incentives for new technology."" So in this case, ""commitment to a cleaner environment"" only came after the EPA threatened enforcement actions. What else has EPA said about Koch Industries? While those positive quotes about Koch Industries and their subsidies are at least partially accurate, it’s a lopsided picture of the EPA’s dealings with the company in the last two decades. Since the late 1990s, Koch companies have repeatedly found themselves in the crosshairs of the EPA for various environmental violations. On numerous occasions they were forced to pay hefty fines and settlements and change their practices as a result of EPA and Justice Department action. The bulk of the more serious violations occurred years ago, but there have been other actions taken recently as well. Here’s a sampling: In 1999, Koch Industries was found guilty of negligence and malice after two teens in Texas died as a result of an underground pipe leaking butane, according to reports. In January 2000, Koch Industries was forced to pay a $30 million civil penalty, ""the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law"" and $5 million in cleanup efforts to resolve claims of more than 300 spills from oil pipelines in six states.

""This record civil penalty sends a clear message to those who transport hazardous materials: You cannot endanger public health or the environment,"" said Attorney General Janet Reno. ""We will not let you foul our water and spoil our land by breaking the law."" In March 2000, the Koch Petroleum Group was sentenced to pay $6 million in criminal fines and $2 million in remediation costs — the largest federal fine ever paid in Minnesota at the time — after it was found that one of their refineries polluted waterways and wetlands in Minnesota before 1997. According to a press release, ""Koch admitted that it negligently discharged aviation fuel into a wetland and an adjoining waterway. Even though Koch was aware of the problem, it did not develop a comprehensive plan to recover between 200,000-600,000 gallons of released fuel until June 1997."" In September 2000, Koch Industries was indicted for environmental crimes at a refinery the company owned in Texas. They eventually paid a $25 million fine after pleading guilty to one criminal charge.

""Companies that produce dangerous pollutants simply cannot focus on profit and efficiency at the expense of a community's health,"" said Lois Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the environment at the Justice Department. ""We will continue to find and prosecute those who would flout our environmental laws."" In February 2013, Koch Nitrogen Company paid a $380,000 fine for failing to create a risk management program for facilities producing and storing ammonia products in Iowa and Kansas. In March 2014, Flint Hills Resources paid a $350,000 fine for leaky equipment at a Texas chemical plant that allowed hazardous air pollutants into the atmosphere. Though the EPA also credited the company for implementing what it described as ""innovative technologies"" in the plant to capture pollutants. Our ruling In his op-ed, Charles Koch wrote that ""EPA officials have commended us for our ‘commitment to a cleaner environment’ and called us ‘a model for other companies.’ "" Actually, the EPA was focusing on very limited aspects of Koch Industries and not the company as a whole. Further, Koch Industries has a history with the EPA that was completely glossed over, and it includes multiple violations of rules. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Charles Krauthammer: Anyone can get out of individual mandate by claiming hardship without explanation
","Individual mandate, schmindividual schmandate. There’s a quick, penalty-free fix for anyone who wants out of Obamacare’s health insurance requirement, says conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer. Just check a box. The one that says ""hardship."" That’s it, you’re done! There will be no questions, and no consequences. At least, that’s how easy Krauthammer made it sound during his April 1 appearance on The O’Reilly Factor. He and host Bill O’Reilly discussed the Democrats’ changes to the law since it passed in 2010. Krauthammer: ""They decide what the law is every Wednesday morning. They've changed it 38 times. The employer mandate is out. Remember the great debate in the country for two years over the individual mandate? ""The individual mandate no longer exists. They haven't said so officially, but if you want out of the individual mandate, do you know what you've got to do? ""You have to say that this is a hardship. There are hardship exceptions. It means, it was meant to mean, if there's a hurricane or a tornado and you're living out of the back of a pickup truck, you can opt out. All you have to do now is tick off the box that says 'hardship' and you're out."" O'Reilly: ""Yes, you don't even have to explain it."" Krauthammer: ""You don't have to explain --"" O'Reilly: ""And it can be as simple as 'I don't know how to work the computer, so I can't get it.' "" Krauthammer: ""Right. When you have an anonymous bureaucratic computerized system and then you use the word 'honor system' as the way of describing, you are deliberately misusing the language."" O’Reilly: ""I think the evidence is overwhelming that you are correct."" With an assurance like that from O’Reilly, we thought Krauthammer’s point merited a second look. Is it really so easy to get out of the insurance mandate by claiming a hardship? We know from a previous fact-check that the Internal Revenue Service cannot use the threat of jail time or property seizures to go after people who do not pony up the ""shared responsibility payment,"" or what’s sometimes referred to as the ""tax"" for not having health insurance even though you can afford it. That fee, which will be collected in 2015 for the filing of 2014 taxes, is 1 percent of annual income or $95 per person for the year, whichever is more expensive. The fee goes up every year. Already, some people are exempt for reasons including religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, income being below the federal filing level, and undocumented immigrants. The hardship exemption comes in when you don’t fall into those categories but have a reason for not having health insurance and paying the fine. In most cases, it’s because you can’t afford it. Getting one is not as easy as checking a box. Here’s the application from the Health Insurance Marketplace, which spells out 14 categories for the hardship exemption. It also says what form of documentation (hello, proof) you need to attach in order to qualify. Categories that require some form of documentation include being evicted or declaring bankruptcy in the last six months; receiving a shut-off notice from a utility; the death of a loved one; a human or natural disaster caused substantial property damage; racking up unexpected costs taking care of a family member; applying for but not receiving Medicaid because the state of residence did not expand Medicaid access envisioned in the law; and having medical expenses you couldn’t pay in the last two years. There’s also a hardship category for people whose health plans were canceled and they find other options unaffordable. Being homeless or suffering domestic abuse are the only categories that do not require some form of documentation. But then there’s the 14th category: ""You experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance."" Documentation should be submitted ""if possible."" Is that the magical ""other"" category promising safe haven for people who don’t want to pay the insurance penalty? ""Exemption 14 is broad, but not open ended,"" said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University professor who has studied the law. ""My understanding is that it is meant to give (Health and Human Services) the discretion to take into account hardships not specifically listed."" An unlisted hardship would have to be in the spirit of the other categories, he said, and it would not be permanent, if it’s granted at all. The Department of Health and Human Services will respond within one to two weeks to let someone know if more information is needed, the application says. If the exemption is okayed, the recipient gets a special number to include on his or her tax return. ""HHS could certainly deny a hardship exemption if there was insufficient documentation or explanation,"" Jost said. Gail Wilensky, an expert on the law who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said Krauthammer’s point isn’t that far from the mark, especially since ""the administration has shown itself to be extremely 'flexible' when it comes to any type of enforcement or timing thus far."" Still, there is some explaining required. There’s a box for applicants to describe how their hardship prevented them from getting health insurance, with exceptions for people turned down for Medicaid and health policy cancellations (which are proven by copies of a denial for Medicaid or notice of cancellation). People who submit hardship exemptions without really needing one should pay special attention to step three of the application. That’s the part where you sign, under penalty of perjury, that your exemption claim is honest. Lying is a crime. ""Only people who have a true, factual basis for their claims should be advised to file,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, George Washington University health and policy professor. Our ruling Krauthammer said people who don’t want to comply with the individual mandate should just ""tick off the box that says ‘hardship’ and you're out."" He is over-simplifying the process. Included in the hardship exemption application -- because there’s an application, you don’t just check a box on your tax form -- is a 14th category that reads kind of like ""other."" It’s meant to catch examples of hardship not delineated in the form. Documentation is requested if possible. Again, claiming it doesn’t mean you get it. You apply. And just because you ask does not mean you will receive. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/apr/04/charles-krauthammer/charles-krauthammer-anyone-can-get-out-individual-/

Rubio says health care law fell short of goal for 30 million signups
","The White House celebrated earlier this week when 7.1 million Americans signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act marketplaces since they opened in October 2013. Predictably, the law’s critics were not as thrilled. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke on Hannity Tuesday night about what he sees as the reform’s shortcomings. ""I mean, the purpose of Obamacare was not to get 7 million people or 6 million people, or whatever the number now is, to sign up on a website,"" Rubio said. ""The purpose of Obamacare, according to them, was to get more people insurance. And by all accounts, it's going to fall woefully short. You're still going to have 30-some-odd million people in this country uninsured."" We wanted to know if Rubio’s claim was correct that the health care law was falling short of its goals. Rubio’s office didn’t return our request for comment. One thing that struck us is that Rubio is mixing up numbers for the law’s first year and what policy makers hope the law achieves over the long run. No one expected to see the law’s full effects in the first year after the health care marketplaces opened. The best authority on health care numbers is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which regularly publishes independent estimates of the law’s effects. In February 2013, months before healthcare.gov launched, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 7 million people would sign up on the marketplaces by March 31, 2014, after the marketplace had been open for six months. The CBO estimated that by 2019, 27 million people will have signed up on the marketplaces. There will still be roughly 29 million people uninsured by that time, which is close to the number Rubio mentioned. But that’s down from 55 million uninsured in 2013. Not everyone will end up with health insurance for a variety of reasons. Undocumented workers aren’t eligible to shop on the marketplaces. People living in states that have decided not to expand Medicaid will also be among the uninsured. The law also has a hardship exemption. That means homeless people, domestic violence victims, people caring for disabled family members and others can apply to have the penalty fee waived for not purchasing insurance under the reform’s individual mandate. Our ruling Rubio claimed the Obama administration’s goal for the Affordable Care Act was to get 30 million Americans insured, not the 7 million who enrolled by the March 31 deadline. Down the road, there are targets to insure millions more via the online marketplaces. But the clearly stated goal for 2014, that the White House hit just in time, was 7 million signups. By 2019, that number is expected to jump to 27 million. Rubio does have a point that many Americans will remain uninsured under the reform, but his claim twists the administration’s timeline for enrolling uninsured Americans. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/apr/04/marco-rubio/rubio-says-health-care-law-fell-short-goal-30-mill/
"['Social Security', 'Texas', 'Michele Bachmann']","
Bachmann says Social Security is running a deficit and borrowing from the general treasury
","
While Republican delegates chowed down on beef brisket at the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota sounded a stomach-turning note. 
""Social Security, like I told you, is out of money,"" she said in her June 11 keynote address. ""This year it is borrowing from the general treasury."" 
Bachmann had hammered the point earlier in her speech: : ""The Social Security payroll taxes have been our cash cow. And the dirty little secret is Congress has spent every last dime of Social Security money. Did you know that? I hate to tell you bad news."" 
To back up the claim, Bachmann’s campaign sent us a March 24 news article in The New York Times, which said that this year, Social Security ""will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes, an important threshold it was not expected to cross until at least 2016."" 
That’s according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does number-crunching for Congress. On March 31, director Douglas Elmendorf wrote on the CBO blog that Social Security’s ""primary deficit,"" not including interest the program earns on securities issued by the general treasury, will be $29 billion this year. Elmendorf predicted finances will improve temporarily as the economy recovers, but said ""a longer-term decline in the trust funds’ financial condition is inevitable under current law, because the retirement of the baby-boom generation will cause benefit payments to increase more than revenues."" 
In assessing the financial health of Social Security, it’s important to realize the program not only receives income from workers paying Social Security taxes, it’s also built up a big trust fund that it can tap when necessary. So even if income from payroll taxes runs short, Social Security can make up the money from the trust fund. 
The ""trust fund"" is  more or less an accounting device — how the government keeps track of the money it’s authorized to spend on Social Security. 
In an interview with the New York Times, Stephen Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, outlined the immediate bind: The recession has put people out of jobs, some of them then applying for Social Security benefits sooner than expected. Fewer jobs also means reduced payrolls, meaning less in payroll taxes going to the government. 
Still, Goss pointed out, the trust fund has a $2.5 trillion balance, enough to cover benefits for about 25 years. 
Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that specializes in analyzing budget deficits, said that just because payroll taxes have fallen short of paying for benefits this year ""doesn’t mean Social Security is insolvent, or out of money."" 
And what of Bachmann’s second point, that Social Security’s borrowing money from the general treasury? 
At the Social Security Administration, spokesman Mark Hinkle said that even if benefit spending exceeds available revenue from payroll taxes, the program can draw on interest from money it’s invested in securities in the general treasury. 
Hinkle said: ""We have all our trust fund dollars in special-issue treasury bonds that earn interest. We’re not borrowing from the treasury."" 
John Rother, executive vice president of policy and strategy for AARP, a nonprofit advocacy group for senior citizens, said it’s actually the government that’s borrowing from Social Security because Social Security puts money into federal securities, enabling the government to spend the invested money. 
As the nation’s retiree population balloons, Social Security faces long-term financial challenges. 
In its latest annual report, issued in May 2009, the Trustees of Social Security and Medicare trust funds predicted that balancing Social Security’s finances over the next 75 years would require an immediate increase in the payroll tax by 16 percent, a cut in benefits by 13 percent, or some combo of the two. 
The trustees concluded that without reforms, benefit spending would exceed tax income starting in 2016, a deficit that could be made up by redeeming trust fund assets until the program’s funds are exhausted in 2037. 
That estimate is now outdated. Trustees, still reconciling how the recently passed health care law will affect projections, haven’t issued their 2010 report, which, judging by the CBO’s projections, could show significantly different numbers. 
Upshot: Bachmann may have a point in calling Social Security payroll taxes — a component of the program’s trust fund — ""our cash cow."" Yet when she claims in the same breath that Congress has spent ""every dime of Social Security money,"" she’s wrong. 
Social Security isn’t yet out of money, nor is it borrowing from the general treasury, as Bachmann says. According to the latest projections, the ""cow"" won’t run dry until 2037. 
We rate her statement as False. 
Update: We stepped on a live wire with this article and, based on reader reactions, realize we could have been blunt that the so-called Social Security Trust Fund isn't a pot of money like, say, someone's personal savings account. Also, we could have been clearer about decisions that lie ahead to shore up Social Security.

References to the trust fund are really references to an ongoing relationship between two parts of the U.S. government. Here's how reader Michael Brandl, a lecturer at the McCombs School of Business, summed it up in his note to us this morning: The Social Security system ""will be in a deficit this year — that is because of economic slowdown, as you correctly point out. However, the 'trust fund' is not really a 'savings account' as one might think. As you correctly point out, the trust fund is made up of Treasury securities, which are paid with future tax revenues. So, the Social Security trust fund is made up of promises to repay ourselves!""

There's an overarching concern here, past the statement we checked. Down the years, will the government make good on Social Security's investments in treasury securities? We're not wading into that — it also wasn't at issue in Bachmann's statement. Social Security is clearly a hot topic.",/factchecks/2010/jun/24/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-social-security-running-deficit-and-/

Oil imports, energy and enemies: part of it's right
","While much of Florida's attention has been focused on Republican Marco Rubio and former Republican Charlie Crist in the U.S. Senate race, there's also a vigorous contest on the Democratic side. Congressman Kendrick Meek of Miami has been challenged by Jeff Greene, a billionaire real estate investor from Palm Beach, and the two faced off in a debate in West Palm Beach on June 22, 2010. Being dutiful fact-checkers, we tuned in to see what was said.One of the topics was the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and what it means for national energy policy.""This situation never should have happened, it's a big failure of the career politicians like Kendrick Meek who have been sitting in Washington and not creating an energy policy,"" Greene said.""You know that we only spend $4 billion, this is what the Congress spends, on research and development for energy when we're sending $350 billion abroad to enemies, I mean, in some countries, so many of whom are enemies. We need to increase research and development.""Greene's a political newcomer, but he slung the facts like an experienced political player. We decided to check Greene's facts on energy R&D and oil imports. We'll take it step by step.First, Greene said that Congress spends $4 billion on research and development for energy. We checked the last budget for the U.S. Department of Energy, for fiscal year 2010, and found that Greene was relatively close. Congress appropriated $4.9 billion in 2010 for basic science through the Energy Department. The department asked for a little more for next year, at $5.1 billion. The economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, sent some money -- about $1.6 billion -- to basic research. But the bulk of the stimulus money went to applied energy projects like weatherizing buildings, cleaning up nuclear sites, and electrical grid improvement. Next, we wanted to check whether we're spending $350 billion on foreign oil. This was a little trickier. An independent government agency, the Energy Information Administration, publishes regular information on how much oil we import in barrels. The agency also publishes average prices of crude oil. It does not, however, publish a number on annual spending on foreign oil.T. Boone Pickens, however, takes those numbers and combines them to calculate how much the U.S. spends on foreign oil on a monthly and annual basis. Pickens is an oil tycoon who advocates for energy independence through his website, The Pickens Plan. Keep in mind these numbers are an approximation based on average price, not actual spending. For the last 12 months, from April 2009 to May 2010, the U.S. spent about $314 billion on foreign oil, according to the Pickens numbers. The cost of imported oil has been even more in the past, when the price and consumption were higher.We were more concerned with Greene's statement that we were sending money to countries that are our ""enemies."" The U.S. doesn't have an ""enemies"" list, but we have to note the U.S. does not buy imported oil from Iran or North Korea, two countries with whom we have chilly relations. (In fact, oil imports from Iran are banned by the U.S. government.) The country we imported the most oil from in 2009 was Canada, followed by Mexico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Russia, Algeria, Angola, Iraq, Brazil, Colombia, the Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Ecuador, the Netherlands, Norway, Equitorial Guinea, and others. (See the complete list.) Which of these countries are our ""enemies""?We asked the Greene campaign for a response. Paul Blank, an adviser to the Greene campaign, said that Greene was speaking of individual Islamic extremists in the Middle East, not governments. The money the U.S. sends to the Middle East to buy oil can make its way into the pockets of terrorists indirectly, Blank said.We understand the point, but we're not going to delve into terror financing here, because it's not what Greene said. In fact, he said twice during the debate that we're sending money to countries that are our enemies. He said at another point, ""We're sending $350 billion a year now to foreign countries to buy oil, many of whom are our enemies. And you know what, that shouldn't be happening.""We're ruling here on Greene's statement that we're spending $4 billion on research and development for energy while spending $350 billion on foreign oil, which goes to some countries that are ""our enemies."" His numbers are close on how much we spend, but he's off about the countries being enemies. Canada and Mexico are friendly with the U.S. We may not always have the best relations with a few of the other countries on the list -- Venezuela comes to mind -- but we have a hard time seeing how any of them rise to the level of ""enemy.""

"['Afghanistan', 'National', 'Military', 'Pundits', 'Ed Schultz']","
Ed Schultz says McChrystal was Obama ""problem"" inherited from Bush
","It's moot now that President Barack Obama has accepted the resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, but liberal TV host Ed Schultz delivered a stinging commentary in which the liberal TV host he told the president to ""fire this jackass.""

McChrystal -- who along with his senior staff was portrayed in a Rolling Stone profile making disparaging comments about numerous senior officials, including Vice President Joe Biden -- was relieved of his duty on June 23, 2010, one day after the article became public.

In the 24 hours between the time the article surfaced and McChrystal's departure, Schultz delivered a rant excoriating the general.

""Gen. McChrystal has put the president of the United States in an untenable position,"" Schultz told viewers of The Ed Show on MSNBC. ""The president either has to fire him or let this culture of insubordination permeate through the ranks of the men and women under his command. ... The man in charge of 90,000 American lives in a war zone shouldn‘t waste time running his mouth or cutting corners on the truth. His job demands the highest level of honor and loyalty. It's about loyalty. And this stupid interview proves that he doesn't live up to that code.""

Schultz continued, ""This was a stupid move by McChrystal. So, once again, here's President Obama. He has to fix yet another problem he inherited from the Bush administration. I want the president to step up, stand up, take charge, and fire this jackass, Gen. McChrystal. Our troops deserve more.""

Most of what Schultz said is opinion, which falls outside of our purview. But we zeroed in on one thing Schultz said: ""So, once again, here's President Obama. He has to fix yet another problem he inherited from the Bush administration.""

Is it appropriate for Schultz to blame President George W. Bush for the McChrystal ""problem""?

McChrystal is a career military officer who rose steadily through the ranks from his first day as a second lieutenant in 1976. It's true that McChrystal served in several senior Army positions during the years that Bush was president, including as commanding general of the Joint Special Operations Command from 2003 to 2006. In Afghanistan during 2001 and 2002, McChrystal was chief of staff of military operations. He also ran commando operations in Iraq, and he served in two positions with the joint staff in Washington.

But there's a much stronger argument for linking his career to Obama than to Bush.

On May 11, 2009 -- less than four months after being sworn in -- Obama ousted Gen. David D. McKiernan, the top American commander in Afghanistan, and installed McChrystal. It was widely seen as a deliberate shake-up designed to improve the execution of the long-running war. In announcing the move, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that ''fresh eyes were needed'' and that ''a new approach was probably in our best interest.''

So while McChrystal served in senior positions under Bush, he was specifically tapped by Obama to run the war in Afghanistan. To the extent he's a ""problem,"" it seems clear to us that he's Obama's problem, not Bush's.

We considered the possibility that Schultz was saying that the ""problem"" Obama inherited from Bush was the war on Afghanistan as a whole. But while there's a bit of vagueness in Schultz's wording, we decided that the most sensible interpretation is that he was referring to McChrystal specifically. The entire rant, from beginning to end, is about McChrystal and the awkward position he put Obama in, and the immediate sentence before the statement we're analyzing was, ""This was a stupid move by McChrystal."" (We contacted MSNBC's publicity department but received no clarification about what Schultz meant.)

So if Schultz believes that McChrystal is a problem inherited from Bush, he's wrong. Obama didn't just appoint McChrystal to fill a vacant spot; he effectively sacked the general in charge to create a vacancy that he then proceeded to fill with McChrystal as his fix-it man. The lesson for Democrats is that not everything can be blamed on President Bush.

Emanuel says BP apologist Rep. Barton would be chair of Energy and Commerce if GOP regains House
","With many Republican leaders distancing themselves from Rep. Joe Barton’s apology to BP (including Barton), Democrats have been quick to point out that Barton isn’t any old congressman. He’s the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee that oversees the oil industry. Imagine, some Democrats have warned, what would happen if Republicans won control of the House in midterm elections. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel alluded to that on ABC's This Week on June 20, 2010, when he warned ""the ranking Republican (Barton) would have oversight into the energy industry, and if the Republicans were the majority, would have actually the gavel and the chairmanship."" Three days earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs made a similar claim via Twitter: ""Who would the GOP put in charge of overseeing the energy industry & Big Oil if they won control of Congress? Yup, u guessed it - JOE BARTON."" Well, not so fast. While congressmen who are a minority party’s ranking member on a committee often rise to the chairmanship if their party regains majority control, that’s not always the truth. As Politico's Jonathan Allen pointed out, ""Barton has somewhere between zero and no chance of being the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman next year, according to Republican rules and sources."" Here’s why. Back in 1995, House Republicans under Speaker Newt Gingrich’s leadership  imposed term limits on their own committee and subcommittee chairmen. Under those rules, a chairman or ranking member must step down after three terms.  Rep. Barton’s third term heading the Republican contingent on the Energy and Commerce Committee will end at the conclusion of this Congress. Exceptions have been made over the years, and Barton could seek a waiver from the Steering Committee. But Michael Steel, spokesman for House Republican Leader John Boehner, told us such waivers will only be considered in ""extraordinary circumstances."" For the record, Boehner’s hard line on term limits for committee leadership predates the Barton apology controversy. Back on Feb. 3, 2010, Boehner announced that the Steering Committee decided it would adhere to the term limits policy, even if Republicans were to regain control of the House. That wasn’t a popular decision with the ranking members of some committees who lamented that their leadership window would be eaten up by years serving as a relatively powerless ranking member of the minority party. Barton, R-Texas, was among those who complained the loudest. ""Don’t ask me to do a good job in the minority and make a rule that says you can’t continue to do a good job as chairman,"" Barton told Politico back in February. Although some Republicans called for his ouster as the ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce panel, the Washington Post reported that Barton offered another apology to Republican colleagues on June 23, 2010, and that Republican leaders have decided to keep him in that seat through this Congress. Again, exceptions to the term limit rule can and have been made in the past. In practice, Republican leadership can make exceptions whenever it wants. Given the Republican leadership’s rebuke of Barton’s comment, and the fact that Democrats have clearly seized on it as a potential wedge issue in the upcoming mid-term elections (Emanuel called it a ""political gift"") it’s hard to imagine Barton would be likely to win such an exception. A literal reading of Emanuel's comments leaves ambiguous whether he is saying if the Republicans were the majority right now, then Barton would be chair, or if he's predicting what could happen if Republicans were to regain control of the House in the midterm elections. If Republicans were in the majority right now, then Barton would be chair. But they are not. We think in the context of talking about Barton's comment as a political gift, Emanuel is raising the specter of what would happen if the GOP wins a House majority in the midterm elections. The fact is, even if Republicans were to win a majority in the House, it appears unlikely Barton would have assumed chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee next year anyway. Possible? Yes. But at the very least, it was far from a given, as Emanuel and Gibbs suggested. And so we rate Emanuel’s comment Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/23/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-says-bp-apologist-rep-barton-would-be-chai/

Durbin misstates debt growth during Bush years
","In the latest example of congressional leaders sparring over the ballooning federal debt, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., took to the floor on June 22, 2010, to lay the biggest share of the blame on the administration of former President George W. Bush.During the floor speech, Durbin said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ""is right. Deficits are important. So are facts. Let's mention a few facts on the floor of the Senate."" He continnued, ""When President George W. Bush was elected, President Clinton said: Welcome to Washington. Here is a $230 billion surplus. ... But what happened in 8 years of Republican rule, fiscally conservative Republican rule? I will tell you what happened. The national debt went from $5 trillion to $12 trillion. ... ""The national debt from Bill Clinton, $5 trillion; to the end of President George W. Bush, $12 trillion, and a little gift that President George W. Bush left to President Barack Obama as he left office. No, he did not leave him the $230 billion that he was given as he came into the presidency. No, he handed off to President Obama a $1.3 trillion deficit. Welcome to Washington, President Obama."" So, ""in eight years of Republican rule,"" was it true that ""the national debt went from $5 trillion to $12 trillion?""No -- an important part of Durbin's ""fact"" is wrong.According to historical tables published by the Office of Management and Budget, Durbin was close, though slightly low, in characterizing the federal debt level at the beginning of Bush's presidency. At the end of calendar year 2000, just before Bush took office, the debt stood at $5.629 trillion.Fast-forward eight years -- that is, just before Bush handed the reins to Barack Obama -- and the federal debt stood at $9.986 trillion. That's close to double, but it's still about $2 trillion less than what Dubrin said it was. When we asked Durbin's office for comment, a spokesman acknowledged the error and said that the senator will be correcting the record. We considered the possibility that Durbin's office was ascribing the extra $2 trillion to policies begun under Bush that played out after Obama took office. But that didn't seem right to us. While it's true that the Congressional Budget Office did predict on Jan. 7, 2009 -- two weeks before Obama took office -- that the deficit for fiscal year 2009 would reach $1.2 trillion, that was a projection. The legislation that led to the actual deficits for 2009 was based on a blueprint inherited from Bush, but it was passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by Obama himself. In addition, Durbin's comment clearly talks about numbers at ""the end of"" Bush's administration, not at a point in Obama's first year. Finally, Durbin's staff did not seek to raise this argument with us. For those keeping track, the debt estimate for the end of 2010 -- two years into Obama's term -- is $13.787 trillion. That's a 38 percent increase over two years. Looked at another way, the debt under Bush went up $4.357 trillion over eight years, while it has gone up under Obama by $3.801 trillion in two years.Republicans and Democrats will continue to fight over whether spending, wars, entitlement expansions and tax cuts under Bush or spending, wars, entitlement expansions and tax cuts under Obama are a bigger reason for the growing debt.

Scott says McCollum lobbied for clients who paved the way to homeownership for illegal immigrants
","Republican rivals for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum and Rick Scott, have accused each other of being too helpful toward illegal immigrants -- a hot topic in the wake of the Arizona immigration law. Their campaigns sent dueling press releases June 15 and 16, 2010, trying to portray their opponent's business practices as being too friendly to illegal immigrants.The Republicans' positions on illegal immigration will be key for primary voters. If elected, Scott has promised to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida -- a law that requires police officers who have made lawful stops to check an individual's immigration status. PolitiFact gave McCollum a full-flop for sending mixed signals on the law -- first opposing the original version, then stating he supported it after Arizona amended it to prohibit racial profiling, but then stating Florida doesn't need such a law.They are now arguing about whose past business practices benefitted illegal immigrants.McCollum sent these fighting words in a press release June 15, 2010: “In just the latest case of hypocrisy, it was revealed today that Rick Scott has heavily invested in a company that is geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country. ... Rick Scott says he wants to crack down on illegal immigration, but now we find out he has been profiting from illegal immigrants."" We rated that statement True.The following day, June 16, 2010, Scott's campaign issued a press release about McCollum which stated: ""Bill McCollum jumped his sinking ship of a campaign today and fled to Washington, D.C., where he served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants.'' (""Fled to Washington, D.C."" refers to a day of meetings McCollum had June 16 with a tax reform group and national conservative leaders, said his spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.)In this Truth-O-Meter item, we explore whether McCollum ""served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants."" The Scott campaign's press release focuses on three groups that it says McCollum lobbied for: the financial company Citigroup, a non-profit called AmeriDream Charity, and the Mortgage Bankers Association, the organization that represents the industry. Scott's campaign sent us McCollum's lobbyist registrations showing he registered to lobby federal offices for AmeriDream in 2002 and 2003, CitiGroup in 2002 and Mortgage Bankers Association of America in 2001. McCollum lobbied after he left Congress in 2001.Even though no federal laws prohibit making mortgages to illegal immigrants, we doubt any financial firm or organization, in today’s political climate, will acknowledge they offer or have offered loans to illegal immigrants. But many newspaper reports across the country in the past decade have described illegal immigrants who hold home mortgages. Some likely obtained mortgages from institutions that didn’t ask about immigration status, or winked. And certainly, lenders are occasionally duped by mortgage fraud committed by U.S. citizens and immigrants alike.The question here, though, is whether McCollum’s clients enabled those loans while he lobbied for them? We took ""enable"" to mean that the companies allowed illegal immigrants to obtain mortgages.We started with the sources Scott's campaign cited in its press release but first did some background on Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, or ITINs, which have been used by legal and illegal immigrants as a form of ID.The IRS started issuing ITINs in 1996 to provide a method to process tax returns and payments for those not eligible for Social Security numbers, including non-resident aliens. The IRS says ITINs are not intended for other uses. But by 2002, several major banking chains in the U.S. -- including Citibank – were accepting ITINs to allow customers to open bank accounts because they wanted to tap into the growing Hispanic immigrant market. That paved the way for some banks to offer mortgages through ITINs. Mark Rodgers, a Citigroup vice president who wrote an article in the online newsletter of the Comptroller of the Currency in the fall of 2004, touted the firm’s efforts in 2003 to offer bank accounts and money transfers, or remittances to Hispanics. We asked him whether his company provided mortgages to illegal immigrants in 2002. He explained in an e-mail that Citigroup accepted ITINs from mortgage applicants, and approved loans for ""applicants with proper identification, who meet our loan requirements and who have filed appropriate tax documents with the U.S. tax authorities, which we have verified.” He emphasized every applicant had to meet the requirements, but did not respond to a follow-up question on when Citigroup began the ITIN program.However, newspaper articles in The Palm Beach Post and Houston Chronicle in 2005 showed illegal immigrants held Citibank mortgages at least by 2004. McCollum lobbied for Citigroup only in 2002.According to a March 18, 2002, article in Business Wire, Citibank also said it would begin accepting Mexican Consular IDs as identification for Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. to open bank accounts. The card, known as a Matricula Consular, identifies the holder as a Mexican national. But that article does not specifically mention mortgages.Next we looked at Scott's claim about AmeriDream. AmeriDream distributed a press release Feb. 7, 2005, announcing it would accept ITINs to help immigrants buy homes, citing “an increasing number of private lenders throughout the country that have begun ITIN loan and mortgage insurance programs.”But by 2005, McCollum was no longer lobbying for AmeriDream. Federal lobbyist registration records show he lobbied for the company in 2002 and 2003. The Scott campaign also cited a Sept. 18, 2007, Boston Globe article about illegal immigrants buying homes, which quoted a representative from the Mortgage Bankers Association. ""It's not our bank members' job to determine immigration policy,"" said Corey Carlisle, senior director of government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a national organization representing more than 3,000 companies. ""But ... they don't want to make a loan to somebody that's not going to be able to repay it."" McCollum was registered to lobby this organization in 2001. So we asked an association spokesman what its policy was in 2001 regarding illegal immigrants obtaining mortgages.John Mechem replied in an e-mail that MBA complies with all applicable state and federal laws. He added that McCollum lobbied on efforts related to the Federal Housing Administration’s multifamily (rental housing) programs, not on mortgages for immigrants. Scott spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, however, insists that since the MBA represents lenders who give mortgages to illegal aliens, McCollum in effect ""enabled"" the mortgages through his MBA lobbying. We asked the McCollum campaign for a response to Scott's claim.Campbell, McCollum’s spokeswoman, said in an e-mail ""Bill McCollum never advocated to give mortgages to illegal immigrants."" She said he lobbied on tax issues -- not housing issues -- for CitiGroup, and MBA told us that he lobbied on issues related to a rental housing program. But the Scott campaign didn't claim that McCollum lobbied to give mortgages to illegal immigrants -- only that his clients ""enabled"" those mortgages. So where does that leave us?To recap, McCollum lobbied for the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2001, but that is a trade association that represents lenders and doesn't issue mortgages directly. Representing bankers doesn't ""enable"" mortgages. McCollum lobbied for Citigroup in 2002. That company started accepting the Mexican consular ID in 2002, but news articles didn't start mentioning Citi providing mortgages to customers with the ITIN identification until 2004. He lobbied for AmeriDream in 2002 and 2003, and AmeriDream didn't announce it would start accepting ITINs until 2005. There are numerous reports in the past decade that illegal immigrants have been able to obtain mortgages through the consular cards or ITINs, but there are no specific examples we could find or Scott could provide that McCollum's three clients did so when he was their lobbyist.

She wrote: ""For example, while seniors today must pay for preventative care, health reform eliminates co-pays, deductibles, and other costs for preventative care and provides for free annual wellness checkups starting next year – ensuring that every Georgia senior has the care they need to better maintain their health.""Free? Is this too good to be true? To back up their claim, Georgia's Democrats referred us to an article in The Record newspaper of Troy, N.Y., that cited the AARP. It states that ""many preventative services . . . will now be free for Medicare beneficiaries, and they won’t have to shell out co-pays for those services."" They also sent an article from CNN.com that said, ""Medicare will provide free annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011,"" and a fact sheet from WhiteHouse.gov that said the same thing. We called the AARP, a group known for its extensive research on issues that affect seniors. They confirmed that seniors who have Medicare will receive annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011.These benefits were established by Title IV of the massive health care overhaul bill, dubbed ""Prevention of Chronic Disease and Improving Public Health."" By 2010, Medicare recipients will receive free ""annual wellness visits"" from their health care providers. The checkup will include the creation of a personal prevention plan and a schedule of recommended health screenings for the next five to 10 years, the bill states. Since the AARP took sides on the issue, we sought additional verification. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that administers these programs, confirmed the AARP account and gave some additional information. There is some question about whether members of Medicare Advantage plans -- the privately managed plans that operate under the Medicare umbrella -- will also receive these wellness visits for free. A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said federal law requires that Medicare Advantage plans provide, at a minimum, the services included in Medicare. So by 2011, these plans will also have to provide wellness visits without charge. Generally speaking, the health care law has several provisions that attempt to change Medicare so that it pays for good outcomes instead of paying per procedure, a system known as ""fee for service."" The free preventive care is part of that overall philosophy.Tests such as cancer screenings that are already free under Medicare will remain so, and additional tests may also be included, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. Still, we at PolitiFact Georgia remained dubious. Is there no provision that will make seniors pay for the ""free"" preventive services in an indirect way?   Well there's free. And then there's ""free."" It's free if you paid your Medicare taxes, and make below a certain income. Over time, higher-income seniors will find that their overall Medicare costs increase, according to tax expert Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, Joseph Antos, a health policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a nonpartisan think tank with conservative roots, and a PolitiFact Georgia review of the legislation.Under the current system, recipients with individual incomes of $85,000 or family incomes of $170,000 pay higher premiums to receive coverage. Under the new system, the pool of people who pay this bigger bill will gradually increase because the income thresholds will not be adjusted for inflation until 2019,according to Section 3402 of the legislation. For those who cross the threshold, this could mean an increase of roughly $50 a month, Antos said. All taxpayers, including seniors, who make more than $200,000 individually or $250,000 as a family will pay more in payroll taxes under Section 9015 of the bill. Also, seniors who like to work on their tans -- whoever you are -- should watch out. Indoor tanning salons will have to pay an excise tax under the new law. That cost will likely be passed on to customers, Gleckman said. But the overwhelming majority of retired seniors will find that free preventive services are just that. Free.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Financial Regulation', 'Housing', 'Florida', 'Kendrick Meek']","
Kendrick Meek calls Jeff Greene the 'king' of Credit Default Swaps
","Jeff Greene's personal fortune may be financing his campaign for the U.S. Senate, but it's also become the chief line of attack for his Democratic primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek.Greene -- who has three (yes, 3) personal jets and a 145-foot yacht -- manages a real estate portfolio that he says once totaled $1 billion. That's not the issue, however.What is, Meek says, is Greene's decision to hedge those real estate investments in 2006 and 2007 by investing in a complicated financial instrument called Credit Default Swaps. The investment essentially paid out when other people's mortgages went bust, or their properties fell into foreclosure. Sensing the housing collapse, Greene admits he made hundreds of millions of dollars betting that property owners wouldn't be able to make payments on bad or risky mortgages.The investments, while perhaps unseemly, are legal. But that hasn't stopped Meek from making an issue of them in a suddenly competitive primary. In their first debate in West Palm Beach on June 22, 2010, Meek accused Greene of hoping Floridians would lose their homes. He then charged those investments helped sink the U.S. economy.""He is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now,"" Meek said.That's a heavy charge -- that Greene pioneered the investment strategy that wrecked the U.S. economy. Is it right?First we need to explain just what a Credit Default Swap is. Then Greene's role. Then the role of the Credit Default Swap in ruining the economy.And we're going to try to do all of it without giving you a headache.Credit Default SwapsMaybe we're kind of dumbing this down too much, but Credit Default Swaps have a lot in common with a Las Vegas casino game. Investors are essentially betting on mortgages and specifically that property owners won't pay. The bettors, or investors, put up a fraction of the money they could possibly win should they be right.In theory, the house -- or the bank -- should win a lot more than it loses because the bets are cheaper when compared to the possible payouts. And in a normal market, banks likely would have won more than they lost. But the housing collapse changed the dynamics of the bet.Greene talks about it another way, describing it as a type of insurance. And that's not an altogether bad description in his case.In 2006, Greene's massive real estate portfolio stood to plummet in value if the housing market reversed. Credit Default Swaps, he said, were a way to hedge against those potential losses. If the value of his real estate portfolio declined, his swaps likely would pay off. And if the housing market continued to climb, he'd lose his bets but recoup that money in real estate gains.Of course, he couldn't get anyone to take bets on his own properties, because he could manipulate whether or not they defaulted. So, instead, he found other properties and mortgages that he thought would be at high risk for default.""I was buying insurance,"" Greene told the Palm Beach Post editorial board. ""I was at risk for hundreds of millions of dollars. I ended up making hundreds of milions of dollars.""He bet on between 18 and 20 mortgage pools (accounts we've seen vary). A mortgage pool is exactly what it sounds like -- a grouping of individual mortgages.Greene's roleGregory Zuckerman, a Wall Street Journal writer, detailed Greene's gamble in the book ""The Greatest Trade Ever."" Zuckerman interviewed Greene and about a dozen of his friends and colleagues for the book, which also features other investors' attempts to profit off Credit Default Swaps.Thanks to the housing collapse, Zuckerman said Greene netted about $500 million on his bets.The book is a fascinating look at an often poorly described and little understood part of Wall Street. It also does an excellent job of documenting Greene's mindset about the trades he was making. Zuckerman agreed to speak with PolitiFact Florida about his work.Specifically, we wanted to know if Greene's description -- that he invested in Credit Default Swaps as protection against his real estate investments -- was accurate.""It started out as a way to protect himself, but it evolved into the greatest trade he ever found,"" Zuckerman said. Greene was making millions of dollars a day on his trades, Zuckerman said, and he didn't want to give it up.Not that he had any real reason to. Greene understood that his success meant problems for a mortgage holder somewhere else -- often in California, Nevada or Florida where the housing collapse was especially accute -- and he had sympathy for the property owners, Zuckerman said.But he believed it was the banks who were the true culprits, since they were the institutions that convinced people they could afford homes they had no business purchasing.Greene's thinking is captured during an exchange with Boston real estate developer Jeffrey Libert that is retold in Zuckerman's book. ""Libert, why are you being so uptight about it?"" Greene asked.""It just gives me the heebie-jeebies.""""You didn't cause it!""""Yeah, I know. But we're cheering for it."" Later, talking to the author, Greene explained his thinking. ""I didn't even think about (the moral aspects of Credit Default Swaps). If more people had been (invested in Credit Default Swaps) early on, then the pricing of debt would have been higher and things wouldn't have become so crazy. The world would have been a better place had more people been shorting. We had nothing to do with what happened to homeowners.""Greene was not the first person to pursue Credit Default Swaps. In fact, he stole the idea from John Paulson, a New York hedge fund operator. And other hedge funds pursued Credit Default Swaps before Paulson.But Greene was among the first and most successful private investors to make the gamble. ""He convinced people like Merrill Lynch to do the trade when they wouldn't do it for other individuals,"" Zuckerman said. ""Greene potentially is one of the only individuals in the country to have pulled this trade off.""Credit Default Swaps and the economic collapseTo continue the casino analogy, the housing market collapse allowed Greene and others to pick the spin of the roulette wheel time after time after time.Zuckerman says some Credit Default Swaps paid off 40 to 1. That means, on one hand, banks were having to cut big checks to investors. It also meant money wasn't coming in from the mortgage holders.Banks, in turn, produced huge losses. The financial industry collapsed.Between 2000 and 2008, the market for swaps ballooned from $900 billion to more than $30 trillion, the New York Times reported.AIG, for instance, traded Credit Default Swaps -- though not necessarily to Greene. The federal government had to offer $182.3 billion to rescue AIG at the height of the financial crisis.But it wasn't the only problem. Critics have argued that banks were too easily making loans, and that the government lacked proper regulation.And when it comes to Credit Default Swaps, the real problem was that banks made the investments so cheap and the reward so great that it wasn't the idea of Credit Default Swaps that was the problem, but the terms of specific deals, Zuckerman said.""Credit Default Swaps are like fertilizer,"" Zuckerman said. ""They can be used for good or bad.""We liked another description, this one coming from a report from NPR: ""If bad mortgages got the financial system sick,"" they wrote, ""Credit Default Swaps helped spread the illness worldwide.""And then, to round out our casino analogy, here's what Fortune said: ""There is at least one key difference between casino gambling and Credit Default Swap trading: Gambling has strict government regulation.""Our RulingThis is a tricky one, in part because we know Credit Default Swaps are going to be talked about a lot more as this Senate primary plays out. In this case, we want to be clear that we're sticking specifically to fact checking the statement Meek made, that Greene is the ""king"" of the Credit Default Swap that ""brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now.""Greene wasn't king of the practice of Credit Default Swaps, but we think it's fair to say he was in the royal court. He actually stole the idea from a New York hedge fund manager, who himself wasn't the first to bet on mortgages going bad. Greene was, however, one of the more successful cases stories and made about $500 million.And saying Credit Default Swaps brought about the destruction of the U.S. economy glosses over the subprime mortgage crisis and concerns over lax regulation, for starters. Banks helped people get into homes they simply couldn't afford, and wrote risky mortgages that resulted in delinquent payments, defaults and eventually foreclosures.In our mind, Meek's statement is an attempt to boil a very complex issue into a made-for-TV sound byte. The statement may be sexy, but it's more hyperbole than anything. We rate it Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/22/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-jeff-greene-credit-default-swap/
"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Kendrick Meek']","
Meek's pro-choice stance stands out
","There was a time when Kendrick Meek didn't need to defend his Democratic credentials. The son of a popular Democratic congresswoman and a longtime party loyalist, Meek has run unopposed in every general election since his foray into national politics in 2002. When the Miami congressman aimed his ambition toward Florida's U.S. Senate seat, the forecast was an easy primary win. Then along came Jeff Greene, a real estate investor and Palm Beach billionaire whose TV ad blitz helped carry him into a two-way tie with Meek only weeks after he entered the race in April.Now Meek's hopes seem pinned to exposing Greene's former Republican flirtation while broadcasting his own Democratic lineage. In a June 22, 2010, Palm Beach Post debate, Meek painted himself as the principal defender of public education, the middle class and legal abortions.""When I become the nominee, the Democratic nominee, I will be the only pro-choice candidate on the ballot,"" he said.If Meek makes it to the general election, would he be the only Roe v. Wade defender in the race? We decided to check it out.Florida has 22 candidates for U.S. Senate. Of those, seven are write-in candidates who won't appear on the ballot.In the Democratic primary, the 4-person field is expected to come down to Meek and Greene, who also supports Roe v. Wade. ""I believe that abortion should be safe, legal and rare,"" reads his campaign website. But Meek's statement envisions a November scenario where he is the Democratic candidate. So, while Greene’s stance provides useful context, it isn’t relevant to our ruling.  Of the three Republican candidates, former House Speaker Marco Rubio is expected to secure his party’s nomination. Rubio is fiercely anti-abortion. He boasts on his campaign website: ""As a state legislator, I supported various pieces of pro-life legislation that, among other things, would require doctors to perform ultrasounds before performing abortions and another bill that would ban the use of taxpayer dollars to fund stem cell research."" There are also six candidates running as independents and two third-party candidates: Then there is Gov. Charlie Crist, easily the best known independent candidate. His abortion views are a tad complicated. Crist, who left the Republican party in April 2010 to secure his position on the general election ballot as an independent, has maintained a flexible abortion stance during his political career. He called himself ""pro-choice"" in 1998, then recast himself as an anti-abortion candidate in his gubernatorial bid. In his latest political rebirth, Crist insisted he was still personally pro-life, but would not legislate according to his views. In June 2010, he rejected a controversial abortion bill that would have required most women seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound and listen to a doctor describe the fetus unless they signed a form to opt out. The bill was described as the most significant anti-abortion measure in Florida history by proponents.Campaign spokesman Nick Autiello said Tuesday that Crist is personally pro-life, but accepts that abortion is legal. That's not a rousing pro-choice endorsement.Meek’s campaign insisted that Crist’s gelatin-like abortion record does not amount to a substantial pro-choice stance.""On Charlie Crist, it is almost impossible to PolitiFact him because he doesn’t hold a position,"" said Adam Sharon, Meek’s spokesman.To highlight Meek's credentials, his campaign pointed to an early endorsement from the NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League) Pro-Choice’s political action committee.""He brings a distinguished record of support for a woman's right to choose to this race. Without question, voters in Florida will have a clear choice, regardless of which anti-choice candidate Meek faces in the general election,"" said the organization's president, Nancy Keenan, in a press release. However, Keenan also sent out a press release praising Crist after he vetoed the abortion bill. The press release called the veto, ""a victory for Florida women,"" and gave credit to both Crist and Meek for triumphing over the Republican-led effort. Let’s review. If Meek were to trump Greene in the primary, he would undoubtedly be the most passionate pro-choice candidate on the general election ballot. That seems to be the point he wanted to make.But, that's not what he said. He said he would be the only pro-choice candidate, and that statement needs some clarification. While Crist may not harbor the sharpest pro-choice views, he still has taken a seat in that tent both in recent days and in the past. Given Meek's solid pro-abortion stance and Crist's rotating views, we rule Meek’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/22/kendrick-meek/meeks-pro-choice-stance-stands-out/

Markey says U.S. consumes 25 percent of world's oil despite having 2 percent of reserves
","The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on the nation's energy portfolio. In an appearance on the June 20, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said, ""We only have 2 percent of the oil reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent of the world's oil on a daily basis. That is nonsustainable.""We won't pass judgment on whether it's sustainable or not, since that's a matter of opinion. But we did think it would be worth checking Markey's facts, especially since this comparison has become something of a Democratic talking point. President Barack Obama said something similar in his Oval Office address to the nation on June 15, 2010. The president's phrasing differed slightly, saying that the United States consumes ""more than 20 percent"" of the world’s oil, rather than ""25 percent.""We looked to the Energy Information Administration -- the nonpartisan Energy Department office that publishes the most complete set of statistics on U.S. energy use -- to confirm these numbers.For U.S. oil reserves, we turned to EIA's ""World Liquid Fuels Analysis to 2030."" A table in this report showed that, as of Jan. 1, 2009, the U.S. has 21.3 billion barrels of oil reserves. That's about 1.6 percent of the world total which, rounded up, would be 2 percent, as Markey said. (For the curious, that ranks the U.S. 12th in the world in reserves, with the top five being, in order, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran, Iraq and Kuwait.)As for the second claim, about U.S. consumption, we turned to EIA's country-by-country summaries of petroleum consumption. The most recent figures, available for 2008, are preliminary. These show that the U.S. consumed 19,498,000 barrels per day, compared to 85,462,000 for the world as a whole -- or 22.8 percent. That's a bit lower than Markey's 25 percent. But we'll add that in 2006 and 2007, the U.S. share of world consumption was 24 percent, which is just a hair under the number Markey cited.All told, Markey would have been better off using Obama's formulation -- that the U.S. consumes ""more than 20 percent"" of the world's oil.

Congressional candidate Clay Cox says he helped balance Georgia's budget
","Patriots, take notice. Clay Cox wants to convince you that he's the man who can fight the move toward what he labels as ""socialism"" in the U.S. government. A rousing campaign mailer lists the 7th Congressional District candidate's credentials. It says Cox has ""real-world"" experience balancing budgets, both as a successful businessman and a state representative: ""For six years, I served our community as a conservative state legislator. In every one of those years, I helped balance the state's budget.""So Cox helped balance the state budget? Well, of course. So did the state's 235 other legislators.The state Constitution requires the Legislature to balance the budget. Consider Article III, Section IX, Paragraph IV: ""The General Assembly shall not appropriate funds for any given fiscal year which, in aggregate, exceed a sum equal to the amount of unappropriated surplus expected to have accrued in the state treasury at the beginning of the fiscal year together with an amount not greater than the total treasury receipts from existing revenue sources anticipated to be collected in the fiscal year, less refunds, as estimated in the budget report and amendments thereto.""Put more simply: ""Unlike the federal government, the state of Georgia has a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget,"" said Alan Essig, executive director of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute.If the budget isn't balanced, the spring legislative session doesn't end, said Katherine Willoughby, a professor of public management and policy at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. If the budget goes out of balance during the course of the fiscal year, the governor must call a special session. ""There's no way for them [legislators] to get around doing their job,"" Willoughby said. Any legislator who participated in the session helped balance the budget. And unlike elementary school, there's no award for attendance in Georgia politics. The Cox campaign counters that his participation in the state budget process shows that he has the toughness to avoid tax increases in the face of dwindling government revenues.Still, avoiding tax increases wasn't the accomplishment Cox makes it out to be. He and other legislators didn't cut enough spending for state government to pay for itself. Cox was among those who voted for a fiscal 2011 state budget with almost $13 billion in federal funding, according to a recent article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The budget was balanced, in part, by shifting the burden to the U.S. government. Cox's claim was misleading.

"['National', 'Corporations', 'Financial Regulation', 'Regulation', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Transportation', 'Rahm Emanuel']","
Bush asked for change at General Motors and gave Obama the ability to rescind loans
","A repeated criticism of President Barack Obama's administration is that it has interfered too much with American companies. That criticism came up again in connection with the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, after President Obama successfully got BP to set up a $20 billion fund to compensate people who have lost their livelihoods because of the spill.

Jake Tapper, host of ABC News' This Week, asked White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel about the charge when Emanuel appeared on the show on June 20, 2010.

""What do you say when you hear criticisms that this administration has used too many strong-arm tactics when it comes to dealing with big business, whether it's in health insurance companies or Wall Street firms or the U.S. auto industry?"" Tapper asked.

""Well, first of all, it has had a different approach based on the situation,"" Emanuel said. ""In the case of General Motors, the prior administration wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change. We said, without a check from the American people, get yourself right. You've got to make fundamental change. They've made changes and now, as you know, General Motors is going to have an IPO (initial public offering of stock). And most importantly, they're going to keep open factories that they were planning on closing. So we're righting an industry that was not doing itself, or the American people or its workers, the right thing. So it was a way of getting them to do the changes that they had postponed."" (Read Emanuel's complete response on the This Week website or watch it via video.)

Readers messaged us via Twitter that Emanuel was wrong about how the Bush administration handled the auto companies, pointing us to a blogger who'd already debunked the statement. So we decided to check it out for ourselves.

The blogger in this case is Keith Hennessey, a former senior economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Hennessey is also a member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, whose members were selected jointly by the House and Senate Majority and Minority leadership. Hennessey wrote that he started his blog as an experiment: ""During my time in the White House, I wrote and edited hundreds of memos and presentations for President Bush. I'd like to do the same now directly for the taxpayer who finances the U.S. government, as well as for students of American economic policy wherever they might be.""

Hennessey wrote that Emanuel was wrong that the Bush administration ""wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change,"" laying out a detailed case that the Bush administration did put conditions on loans to the auto industry that went down in 2008. Hennessey even contends that Bush officials tried to get the Obama team to agree to a joint plan -- he describes in detail a meeting between the two sides that happened on Nov. 30, 2008 -- to give the auto companies loans and prevent immediate bankruptcies. The teams never reached any public agreement.

A few weeks later, Bush's negotiations with Congress over the matter broke down, and the administration decided to go ahead, using money the Treasury Department already had authorization to use through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

Hennessey pointed his readers to Treasury Department documents released Dec. 19, 2008, that outlined conditions for the $13.4 billion in loans it was offering General Motors and Chrysler.

The documents show, and press reports from the time confirm, that the Bush administration did put specific requirements on the auto companies that included paying down debt, limits on executive compensation, and negotiated reductions in wages and benefits for autoworkers. It also required the companies to submit detailed restructuring plans by Feb. 17, 2009, that would show how the company planned to achieve and sustain ""long-term viability, international competitiveness and energy efficiency.""

The requirements did have one clause that some critics of the plan said meant the details were nonbinding. The agreement said that the companies had to file additional reports by March 31, 2009, identifying any deviations from the requirements and explaining ""why such deviations do not jeopardize the borrower's long-term viability."" If the president's designee didn't approve the explanations, the loan would be have to be paid back within 30 days.

Still, coverage from the time indicates the auto companies thought the Bush administration's demands were plenty tough. The Detroit Free Press wrote that the loan agreements ""not only call for deep concessions outlined in wide-ranging plans due by mid-February, but also start a ticking bomb that could explode in Detroit's face unless dramatic change is on the way."" The Wall Street Journal reported the loans were ""just the first step in what could be a long and painful revamping of the three Detroit companies during a recession.""

And in a 2009 eight-part series looking back at the auto industry's turmoil, the Free Press again described the requirements as rigorous: ""The deal set tough targets for the two companies -- a two-thirds cut in debt, a 50% reduction in payments to health care funds for UAW retirees and proof of net positive value by March 31. It also came with a threat: Should the automakers fall short, the loans would be called back immediately and bankruptcy would follow.""

We want to emphasize that the loan agreements happened after President Obama was elected, but before he took office. At the time, Obama called the loans ""necessary steps ... to help avoid a collapse of our auto industry."" The March 31 deadline for the auto companies gave Obama about two months in office in which to make his own decisions about the companies. Hennessey called the decision to give the auto companies loans ""the least worst of two bad options.""

""Based both on his public comments and what I saw privately, President Bush wanted to give the firms a limited amount of time and a hard back end to prepare for and, if necessary, to force an orderly Chapter 11 process,"" Hennessey wrote. ""He also knew that President-elect Obama would be facing tremendous challenges in his first days in office. Despite their different political parties and policy perspectives, President Bush stressed that we needed to provide his successor with the time and space he would need in the opening weeks of his Presidency.""

The Obama administration continued loaning GM money that wasn't repaid until April 2010, and the government still owns a majority of GM stock in connection with the company's June 2009 bankruptcy.

Emanuel's statement -- ""In the case of General Motors, the (Bush) administration wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change"" -- implies that the Obama administration was tough while the Bush administration just threw money at the problem. Actually, the Bush administration detailed a number of conditions for change at General Motors, and Obama's administration could have recalled the loans soon after taking office if officials felt the auto companies were not compliant. The Treasury Department documents and press reports contradict Emanuel's claim, so we rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/21/rahm-emanuel/bush-asked-change-general-motors-gave-obama/

McCollum accuses Scott of investing in company used by illegal immigrants

Their campaigns sent dueling press releases June 15 and 16, 2010, trying to portray their opponent's business practices as being too friendly to illegal immigrants.The Republicans' positions on illegal immigration will be key for primary voters. If elected, Scott has promised to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida -- a law that requires officers who have made lawful stops to check an individual's immigration status. PolitiFact gave McCollum a full-flop for sending mixed signals on the law.McCollum sent these fighting words in a press release June 15, 2010: ""In just the latest case of hypocrisy, it was revealed today that Rick Scott has heavily invested in a company that is geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country. ... Rick Scott says he wants to crack down on illegal immigration, but now we find out he has been profiting from illegal immigrants.""The following day, June 16, 2010, Scott's campaign issued a press release about McCollum which stated: ""Bill McCollum jumped his sinking ship of a campaign today and fled to Washington, D.C., where he served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants.''In this Truth-O-Meter item, we explore whether Scott invested in a company that is ""geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to friends and family out of the country.""What’s the McCollum campaign talking about? The campaign provided a copy of a June 15, 2010, article in the Orlando Sentinel that stated that opposition research shows ""Scott's investment company was one of a handful of equity investors that lent $12.5 million in 2004 and 2005 to Emida Technologies. Emida provides electronic pre-paid services ranging from phone cards to money transfers, and focuses on Central and South American markets. According to its Web site, the company also partnered with another called IPP, which primarily focused on helping Hispanic migrant workers in Arizona transfer money and pay bills back in Mexico. Press releases from the company list Richard L. Scott Investments, LLC, as an equity partner.""Rick Scott spokeswoman Mary Anne Carter said that Scott's company did invest in Emida Technologies, but she described it as a prepaid cell phone company. RLSI Emida Capital Partners, LLC was set up to invest in Emida, Carter wrote in an e-mail. That company invested about $2 million in 2004 and about $1 million in 2005. Scott's personal portion was $736,004, Carter wrote.Since Scott doesn't dispute that he invested in Emida, the only question is whether Emida allows illegal immigrants to send money to friends or family in other countries.But first, some background on Emida. The company, formerly located in Miami and now based in Foot Hills, Calif., and Bogata, Colombia, started in 2001, according to a March 14, 2006, article in Business Wire. An article in the Miami Herald Dec. 22, 2003, described Emida as ""a provider of transactional networks for electronic prepaid distribution, bill payment and money transfer services targeting the global Hispanic market."" In 2005, Emida merged with Debisys Inc. -- another electronic prepaid solution company.Information on the privately-held company's website states that it has technology that ""enables the domestic and international distribution and value transfer of many types of prepaid products and payment services. Our strategy is to build profitable, robust distribution networks for many prepaid products in targeted operating geographies, and to introduce unique cross border value products between regions."" To learn more about Emida, we spoke to Martyn Fricker, director of business development and marketing. We asked Fricker to describe what Emida does. He described a typical prepaid wireless phone plan, purchased by customers in the United States, allowing the recipient in Latin America to make calls but not get cash.Could illegal immigrants be customers? ""The merchants who offer this service I'm not sure they ask 'are you an illegal immigrant?'"" Fricker said.So where does the idea about ""money transfer"" come from? Fricker said Emida has wanted to expand into the money transfer business and has recently launched or is launching two other money-transfer or “virtual wallet” products. But he said neither one has had a single transaction as of June 16, 2010.If those products have only been recently launched, we asked why Emida was described as providing ""money transfer"" since at least 2004. ""Sometimes private companies tell people about capabilities,"" Fricker said, to draw their interest ""before they have the capability to deliver.""So where does that leave us?There is no dispute that Emida could allow illegal immigrants in the U.S. to put money on cell phones for friends and relatives in other countries. Is that the same as a money transfer? Technically, no, but helping a relative keep their cell phone service available is financial help. McCollum's claim was that Scott invested in a company that was ""geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country."" Emida’s spokesman and its press releases acknowledge that’s the business the company is pursuing. Even if some of Emida's products are just launching this year, news articles since at least 2003 have described the company as providing ""money transfer"" -- even a press release from the company used that phrase in 2004 -- so it is clearly ""geared to"" that business. We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/21/bill-mccollum/mccollum-accuses-scott-investing-company-used-ille/

Snooki says Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning
","In a video promo for the new season of MTV's Jersey Shore, Snooki gets all, like, political. ""I don't go tanning-tanning anymore because Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning,"" Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi says after her boyfriend is shown spray-tanning her face. ""And I feel like he did that intentionally for us."" ""McCain would have never put a 10 percent tax on tanning,"" she said, adding, ""because he's pale, so he'd probably want to be tan."" McCain entered the discourse via Twitter: ""Snooki, u r right, I would never tax your tanning bed! Pres Obama's tax/spend policy is quite The Situation. but I do rec wearing sunscreen!"" We should hope so. McCain has a history of battling skin cancer. But let's get to the facts. Did President Barack Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning? On March 23, 2010, Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka the health care bill) into law. And Chapter 49, SEC. 5000B makes this all very clear: ""There is hereby imposed on any indoor tanning service a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount paid for such service."" We were pretty sure Snooki was kidding about Obama passing that provision specifically to stymie the Jersey Shore crew. But it turns out that the president had mentioned her by name on May 2, 2010, and said she'd be exempt: ""This next provision is called the Jersey Shore-Up,"" Obama said. ""It reads: 'The following individuals shall be excluded from the indoor tanning tax within this bill: Snooki, J-WOWW, the Situation, and House Minority Leader John Boehner.'"" (""The Situation"" and ""JWOWW"" are other members of the Jersey Shore cast.) Alas, Obama's comment was made during the White House Correspondents Association Dinner. In other words, it was a joke. (Yes, it scares us too that Obama and McCain are so familiar with Jersey Shore.) If we really wanted to pick a fight with Snooki, we could take issue with her saying it was a tax on tanning. There's no fee on sunshine, just indoor tanning. Or that it's Obama's tax. There's no indication an indoor tanning tax was Obama's idea. It was proposed by Senate Democrats in December as an alternative to a proposed tax on cosmetic surgery. The cosmetic surgery lobby (funded by plastic surgeons) apparently held more sway than the indoor tanning lobby. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected the tax will raise $2.7 billion over 10 years to help offset the cost of expanding medical coverage. Legislators said they also hoped it might discourage teens from indoor tanning, as some studies suggest it is linked to higher risk of cancer. The bill was passed by Congress, but Obama signed it, so we think Snooki's assigning the tax to Obama is fair. One other small point. The indoor tanning tax goes into effect on July 1, 2010. So when Snooki made her comment, she still could've gotten her tan on sans Uncle Sam's extra reach. But we're assuming Snooki isn't so much worried about the money as the principle. We rate her comment friggin' True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/21/snooki/snooki-says-obama-put-10-percent-tax-tannning/

Hatch says '30 percent of our oil' comes from the Gulf
","As Americans continue to worry about environmental damage from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is raising another concern -- that the federal government might overreact by putting up excessive obstacles to drilling in the Gulf.""That would be the stupidest thing they can do,"" Hatch told interviewer Neil Cavuto in a June 16, 2010, appearance on the Fox Business Network. ""The best thing we can do is keep BP going so that they can make these payments (to compensate people hurt by the spill). And let me tell you something. To put a moratorium on all of the gulf and all of the drilling down there when we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf? Where are these rigs going to go? They are going to leave our area, where we won't be able to get them back except at exorbitant prices, and they're going to go elsewhere in the world, and at the same time that they are shutting down exploration in the gulf that has worked very, very well up until this incident.""What caught our eye was Hatch's comment that ""we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf."" It's becoming something of a talking point for Republicans who express concern that the Obama administration may curb offshore drilling. For instance, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, cited the same statistic in a June 20, 2010, appearance on NBC's Meet the Press.So we decided to check whether Hatch's statistic is accurate.First, some background. On May 27, 2010, a few weeks after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig caught fire and sank, President Barack Obama ordered a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling -- that is, a six-month halt to new drilling projects in water depths of 500 feet or greater. (Oil production currently under way that doesn't involve new drilling was exempt from the moratorium.) Those who see oil as an economic linchpin of the Gulf Coast region have warned that if the government heightens regulation too much, oil companies will simply relocate to other countries that have lower regulatory standards, leaving Gulf Coast workers and their families in the lurch.Under this logic, it would be a substantial economic wallop if the government were to place at risk an industry that provides 30 percent of the nation's oil needs. But the numbers don't necessarily back up what Hatch says.In the wake of the spill, the Energy Information Administration -- the nonpartisan Energy Department office that publishes the most complete set of statistics on U.S. energy use -- released a Gulf of Mexico fact sheet. Using the fact sheet, we were able to pinpoint what appears to be the source of Hatch's 30 percent figure. It refers to the Gulf of Mexico's ""offshore share of U.S. crude oil production."" In other words, 30 percent of the crude oil produced in the United States in 2009 came from the Gulf.Now, you could use that statistic to justify Hatch's statement that ""we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf."" But we don't think that interpretation of his statement is the only one -- or even the best one. If Hatch had wanted to communicate that, he could have said that ""30 percent of the oil we produce in the U.S. comes from the Gulf.""Instead, we think that an equally fair -- if not more fair -- reading of his statement is that 30 percent of the oil used in the United States comes from the Gulf. And statistically speaking, that leads to quite a different answer, thanks to the major role played -- for better or for worse -- by imported oil in the nation's petroleum supply.The same EIA fact sheet shows that offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico accounts for 8 percent of total U.S. liquid fuels consumed. (Slightly over half of the liquid fuels used in the U.S. are imported, and slightly under half are produced domestically.)We'll acknowledge that even at 8 percent, Gulf Coast offshore oil production accounts for a significant share of U.S. consumption. If that spigot were shut off entirely, the economy would surely suffer. But the current moratorium does not involve shutting off the spigot entirely, only delaying new drilling projects for six months to grapple with the consequences of a disaster of historic proportions. More directly relevant for judging Hatch's statement, we think a reasonable person would conclude that the senator was saying that 30 percent of the oil used in the United States comes from the Gulf -- a comment that overstates the actual share by nearly a factor of four. That's not a trivial difference when Hatch is using the statistic to back up his contention that Gulf oil is simply too vital to the economy to overregulate. So we rate Hatch's comment Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/21/orrin-hatch/hatch-says-30-percent-our-oil-comes-gulf/

Campaigns duel over ""career politician"" attack
","We know the public has never had much of a love affair with politicians. This year seems to be no exception, and the candidates running for office know it.One example was an ad shipped by mail from the campaign of Ken Hodges, a Democrat running for Georgia attorney general.""Rob Teilhet,"" the advertisement reads. ""Just another career politician.""The Hodges campaign says it can easily back up its claim. Teilhet, they say, first ran for political office two years after he graduated from law school. Teilhet, a Cobb County Democrat, has been a state representative for eight years and now wants to be attorney general.""We call Teilhet a politician because he is one,"" Hodges campaign manager Shannon Marietta wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Georgia.After reviewing a similar claim in a Republican Party campaign, PolitiFact Georgia was eager to dig into the merits of this Democrat-on-Democrat attack.The Hodges campaign has its facts right about Teilhet's background. In 2002, two years after Teilhet graduated from law school, he made his first bid for public office. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about Teilhet and a wave of other young faces  coming to the Georgia Capitol in 2003.""I assumed I would be the young gun in Cobb,"" he said. ""Seeing two other elected officials even younger, I feel like I'm just another old, white guy.""Teilhet was 28 at the time. He's now 36, with eight years in the Legislature.Teilhet is a workers' compensation attorney. His campaign manager Rebecca DeHart notes it's a full-time job, as opposed to Teilhet's time at the Legislature, which has 40 meeting days a year. The Hodges campaign suggests Teilhet isn't doing much work outside the Capitol. They could find only 19 cases he's been involved with in the past 10 years. The Teilhet campaign countered he works about 40 cases a year.Hodges, 44, has served as Dougherty County district attorney for the past 12 years. He's been re-elected twice. The Teilhet camp says it's hard to call someone a ""career politician"" when you've been in office longer than the other candidate.Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie agrees.""If you are going to throw a punch, it is going to come back at you in some shape or form,"" she said. ""It's the pot calling the kettle black.""Marietta contends that being a district attorney is less political than being a state lawmaker. Gillespie believes there's still politics involved with campaigning for and serving as district attorney.Teilhet has been involved in politics basically since he graduated law school. He is certainly a young man in a hurry, and one with major political ambitions.But some political experts believe his eight years in the Legislature does not qualify Teilhet for the title ""career politician."" Some, like Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint, say Hodges should not make such accusations, based on his 12 years in office.""They might not have thought this through,"" he said.We rate this attack as Barely True.",/factchecks/2010/jun/21/ken-hodges/campaigns-duel-over-career-politician-attack/

Patterson says Napolitano can't and won't say 'terrorist attack'
","Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson fired up the crowd during a speech at the state GOP convention June 11 by declaring that “we’re besieged today by political correctness.” To illustrate his point, he singled out Janet Napolitano, the former Arizona governor who joined President Barack Obama’s Cabinet. “We have a director of homeland security who cannot use and will not use the term ‘terrorist attack’ but instead substitutes ‘man-made disaster,’ ” Patterson said. Has the leader of an agency charged with keeping the United States safe indeed scrubbed “terrorist attack” from her vocabulary? When we contacted Patterson, he pointed us to congressional testimony that Napolitano gave in early 2009 and media accounts of the criticism that followed. On Feb. 25, 2009, Napolitano made her debut appearance before the House Homeland Security Committee. Before delivering her prepared statement, the committee’s ranking Republican, Peter King, R-N.Y., noted correctly that the word “terrorism” did not appear in the text of her remarks. King said that he was “not trying to get into semantics on this” but that “it’s important for us in positions of leadership to constantly remind people how real that (terrorism) threat is … and if we don’t do it, it’s going to be hard for us to get legislative support for the measures that we think have to be taken.” In an aside to King as she addressed the committee, Napolitano then invoked the “T” word to describe the agency’s mission: “to confront and prepare for threats that face this nation, be they man-caused -- and terrorism, Rep. King, I believe falls into that category and is central to that category -- or be they caused by nature.” The phrase “man-caused” deviated from Napolitano’s prepared text, which used “man-made” instead. The first instance we found of Napolitano pairing the man-made concept with “disaster” occurred a month earlier, in remarks prepared for her Senate confirmation hearing. Republicans, conservative commentators and other critics pointed to Napolitano’s word choice as evidence that the Obama administration was tip-toeing around the threat of terrorism. Patterson told us that he sees it as “some kind of reluctance to use words that others may take offense at even if those terms are accurate and truthful.” Napolitano was asked about her terminology in March 2009 by a German news magazine, Der Spiegel. Using the term “man-caused disasters,” she replied, “demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur."" In April 2009 remarks to an Anti-Defamation League conference, Napolitano offered further explanation for her use of “man-caused disaster.” She said that “so often we think of terrorism and the mindset is just al Qaeda … But it is not the only such group, and so to use a different phrase is an effort to cause people to think more broadly about what we are dealing with, and that is those who seek to commit violence to impact broader societies through their economies, through the exercise of their freedoms, and the like.” In early 2010, a writer for The New York Times cast the dust-up over Napolitano’s language as an example of how the Obama administration has rejected some of the Bush administration’s terrorism-related rhetoric (such as Bush references to “evildoers” and “Islamo-fascist”). So Napolitano says she’s trying to expand the public’s thinking about the kinds of threats the U.S. faces. Does that mean she cannot and will not say “terrorist attack,” as Patterson claims? It doesn’t look that way. During her January 2009 confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Napolitano spoke the word “terrorism” five times and “terrorist” once; we counted. In March 2009, at a conference in Kansas City, Mo., she employed “terrorist attack” in response to a question about the role of the private sector in so-called “fusion centers” enabling law enforcement agencies to analyze and share intelligence information. And in a July 2009 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Napolitano used “terrorist attack” twice and “terror attack” once. An example: “Make no mistake, Americans continue to be targeted in terror attacks,” Napolitano said. “Just two weeks ago, American hotels were the target of bombings in Jakarta that killed eight people and injured six Americans.” More recently, Napolitano told CNN on May 2, 2010 – the day after a sport-utility vehicle holding a bomb was found in New York’s Times Square – that the incident was being treated “as if it could be a potential terrorist attack.” And on Friday, Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said: “The secretary speaks publicly about terrorism often, including in a speech less than 90 minutes ago to the American Constitution Society.” Patterson said Friday that Napolitano’s continued use of “man-made disaster” proves his point. We disagree. The essence of his charge at the convention was that the secretary can’t and won’t say “terrorist attack.” News accounts, congressional testimony and speeches prove otherwise. We rate Patterson’s statement as False.",/factchecks/2010/jun/21/jerry-patterson/patterson-says-napolitano-wont-say-terrorist-attac/
