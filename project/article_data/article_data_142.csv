Obama health plan does not call for government-run health care
","
When Sen. Tom Coburn said that under President Obama, ""all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government,"" it was like a golden oldie PolitiFact has heard many times before.
 
During the campaign, we heard the same tune from vice presidential candidate

Sarah Palin

, who said Obama was calling for a ""government-run plan"";

Mitt Romney

, who said Obama ""wants the government to take over health care""; and

Rudy Giuliani

, who called Hillary Clinton's similar plan ""socialized medicine."" (We rated their statements

Barely True

,

Barely True

and

False

.)
 
Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, made his remarks while criticizing Obama on a different matter. Obama is moving to rescind Bush administration rules that protected medical workers from performing procedures such as abortion that conflicted with their religious or moral beliefs.
 
Coburn, who is against abortion, said rescinding the order would be only a first step for the Obama administration.
 
""Remember, under the Obama plan . . . all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government,"" Coburn said in an interview on Fox News on March 4, 2009.
 
""So it's part of an incremental creep towards eliminating any objection, both as us as taxpayers and then individual physicians in terms of not complying with a government-run bureaucracy,"" he added.
 
Coburn and Obama can fairly disagree about conscience protections for health care workers who oppose abortions. But he's wrong that Obama's plan offers government-run health care.
 
In fact, Obama's plan leaves in place the private health care system, but seeks to expand it to the uninsured. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. It also outlines strategies to rein in costs for everyone, such as electronic medical records and preventive care.
 
""I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken,"" Obama said at a health care conference he hosted on March 5. ""So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive.""
 
Would Obama's plan result in closer regulation of the health care system? Very likely so. It includes provisions that require health insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and disclose more information about how they treat patients. Obama's plan also calls for evidence-based health care standards, so that government can stop paying (through programs like Medicare) for treatments that don't get good results. But the plan is very different from some European-style health systems where the government owns health clinics and employs doctors.
 
We asked Coburn's office about his remarks. ""What matters is not just President Obama’s intent, or what his plan states, but the likely effect and consequences of his plan,"" said spokesman John Hart. ""Under Obama’s approach, the only plans left standing will be those controlled by the government.""
 
That may be Sen. Coburn's opinion on what could happen, but it's definitely not part of Obama's plan. And Coburn was very specific in saying that ""under the Obama plan, all the health care in this country is eventually going to be run by the government."" That gives the incorrect impression that Obama is promoting a government-run health care system. He's not. We rate Coburn's statement False.

McConnell contends Democrats have already exceeded Iraq, Afghanistan and Katrina spending
","
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says it took only one month for the Democrats to exceed three of President Bush's big-ticket items in spending.
 
It was red meat for the crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, where the Kentucky Republican spoke on Feb. 27. But cut into it and it starts to look overcooked.
 
McConnell recalled that Democrats had relentlessly criticized Bush's spending. ""But now the shoe is on the other foot. And what have we seen?"" he said. ""Well, in just one month — just one month, the Democrats have spent more than President Bush spent in seven years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina combined — in one month.""
 
This is quickly becoming a Republican talking point. Rep. John Boehner, the House Minority Leader, used the same line in a statement on March. 4.
 
Asked to back up the claim, McConnell spokesman Josh Holmes pinned the Democrats' spending in one month at $818 billion. That's the $31 billion expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program passed in January plus the $787 billion stimulus bill passed in February.
 
That $818 billion exceeds the $655 billion the Defense Department spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2008, plus the $132 billion the government spent responding to Hurricane Katrina, Holmes said. He cited this

Government Accountability Office report

as the source of the war-spending figure, and the Congressional Research Service for the Katrina figure.
 
We'll grant that Katrina cost about $132 billion and the SCHIP bill will spend $31 billion (that spending is paid for, mostly with an increase in cigarette taxes).
 
But we take issue with McConnell's calculations of Democratic spending and Bush's war spending.
 
First, about $326 billion of the $787 billion cost of the stimulus is from tax cuts, according to

this report

by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. That is not generally considered ""spending"" — certainly not by McConnell's audience at CPAC. And even if it were, it was unfair to say the Democrats ""spent"" the entire $787 billion in one month; the spending will take place over the next seven years, with the bulk of it coming not the month it was passed, or even this year, but in 2010.
 
If McConnell believes that to schedule spending is effectively to spend, then he'll have to take another look at his war figures. The very report that his spokesman used to justify a war-spending estimate of $655 billion through 2008 said, ""As of September 2008, Congress has appropriated a total of about $808 billion"" for the global war on terror. The difference is made up of future obligations to which Bush committed, and McConnell did not count those.
 
And even $808 billion does not include all the necessary war spending for fiscal year 2009, which began October 2008. Traditionally all 2009 spending would be included in the budget President Bush drafted in February 2008, but Bush chose to fund the war through emergency supplemental appropriations instead. He did not ask Congress for a 2009 supplemental appropriation before he left office, choosing instead to leave that to the next president. (President Obama asked for another $76 billion for the wars for fiscal 2009.)
 
And the wars will continue beyond 2009. If McConnell is saying the Democrats spent the entire cost of the stimulus in one month, doesn't he have to hold Bush responsible for at least some of the longer term costs of the war? ""If you look at the total cost of the stimulus bill it seems to me you also need to look at what the costs of Iraq and Afghanistan will be for the next few years,"" said Charles Konigsberg, chief budget counsel for the Concord Coalition.
 
Some experts have said that once costs like veterans' benefits are factored in, the war in Iraq will cost

several trillion dollars

.
 
In any event, the lowest estimate of Bush's war spending through 2008 that is even remotely defensible is $808 billion. Tack that onto the $132 billion cost of Katrina and you get $940 billion for the wars and Katrina.
 
That's well over the expenditures expected from the Democrats' stimulus and children's health insurance bills, which total $686 billion once tax cuts are subtracted. Even if we included the cost of the tax cuts (for a total of $818 billion), he would still be wrong because that's less than the $940 billion that uses a more accurate cost of the war spending.
 
And even that analysis, remember, is generous to McConnell since it includes several years of spending from the stimulus and SCHIP bills, not ""one month.""
 
McConnell's claim stands up only if you treat tax cuts as spending, accept an incomplete estimate of the wars' costs and group several years of planned spending into a one-month spending spree by the Democrats — but not for Bush. That is, it doesn't stand up at all. We find this claim False.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'John Boehner']","
Spending bill wasn't candidate Obama's ""type,"" Boehner points out
","
Speaking on the House floor, Republican Leader John Boehner railed against a spending bill with some 9,000 earmarks, calling on President Obama to veto it and insist on one free of pet projects.
 
""The president campaigned against this type of legislation, this number of earmarks,"" the Ohio Republican said on Feb. 25, ""and I would hope that the president would veto this bill because Republicans in Congress will be here to uphold his veto of this piece of legislation.""
 
Several news organizations made even harsher claims. The

New York Times

, for example, 

reported

that Obama would sign the bill, earmarks and all, ""despite campaign promises to put an end to the practice.""
 
That's incorrect. Obama did not promise to end earmarking, only to ""reform"" it, and eliminate ""screwy"" or wasteful earmarks.
 
Boehner, however, was more careful than the

New York Times.

His claim that Obama ""campaigned against this type of legislation"" could be read a number of ways.
 
Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said Boehner meant that Obama had broken his campaign pledges, referenced on the

White House Web site

, to ""slash earmarks to no greater than 1994 levels and ensure all spending decisions are open to the public."" That's a reasonable interpretation of what Boehner said.
 
Obama did indeed make those pledges during the campaign. Sen. John McCain, the Republican candidate, pledged to eliminate earmarks and ""veto every earmark pork-barrel bill,"" and Obama, though stopping short of that, did pledge to get tough on them.
 
For example, here's Obama in the first

presidential debate

: ""Absolutely, we need earmark reform. And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.""
 
On March 10, 2008, Obama said in a

statement

: ""We can no longer accept a process that doles out earmarks based on a member of Congress' seniority, rather than the merit of the project. We can no longer accept an earmarks process that has become so complicated to navigate that a municipality or nonprofit group has to hire high-priced D.C. lobbyists to do it. And we can no longer accept an earmarks process in which many of the projects being funded fail to address the real needs of our country.""
 
And here he is on

Feb. 21, 2008

: ""I have been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks. Now, keep in mind a lot of these are worthy projects in our states, and I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says this is the kind of spending that I think is important.""
 
The closest he came to saying he would eliminate earmarks, as far as we could find, was when he said, in the

third presidential debate

, ""Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget. There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated. But it's not going to solve the problem."" (Given his other campaign statements on earmarks, it's clear he meant ""screwy,"" or wasteful, earmarks should be eliminated, not all earmarks.)
 
So the question is, is the omnibus spending bill the ""type of legislation"" that Obama campaigned against with respect to earmarks? That is, did it lack transparency, include earmarks based on a congressman's seniority and ones that are wasteful? And was the amount more than the 1994 level of $7.8 billion a year?
 
The answer to most of those questions is largely yes, said Keith Ashdown, investigator for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington watchdog group. Ashdown said the earmarking process for the omnibus bill was not any more transparent than it was when Obama was campaigning. He said seven of the top 10 earmark recipients in the Senate are on the Appropriations Committee, suggesting that access was more important than merit when it came to deciding what projects would get earmarks.
 
And though the total cost of the earmarks in the bill, $7.7 billion, is slightly less than the 1994 level, there were another $6.6 billion in earmarks in three previous spending bills for this year that Congress passed last year.
 
Are there wasteful projects in the bill? Ashdown said he hasn't had time to research that. ""There likely is, but I just don't know,"" he said. He cautioned against leaping to conclusions about projects that ""sound goofy."" For example, some critics have mocked a $1 million earmark to control Mormon crickets in Utah — but Ashdown said the Mormon cricket, a type of katydid, is a very serious threat to agriculture.
 
The White House has argued that Obama should not be held responsible for the earmarking process in this legislative package — which is nine of the 12 spending bills for the current budget year rolled into one — because it is ""last year's business.""
 
And there's some truth to that. These are bills that Congress was supposed to pass last year.
 
But that doesn't nullify Boehner's point that the bill is — in featuring earmarks added by senior members of Congress in a process that lacked transparency and pushed earmark spending for the year well over $7.8 billion — the ""type of legislation"" Obama campaigned against. We find Boehner's claim to be True.

Democrats too low with $3.8 billion earmark estimate for Omnibus
","
Stung by charges that the economic stimulus bill that passed last month was packed with pork, Democrats are claiming the big 2009 spending bill they're now considering has a relatively small number of earmarks.
 
Many news outlets have cited Democratic estimates that there are only $3.8 billion in earmarks in the $410 billion bill, which is known as the Omnibus because it is the product of nine bills that failed to pass last fall. But Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that tracks federal spending, says the number is $7.7 billion.
 
Why the big difference?
 
The Democrats count the number differently.
 
Before we explain, here's a little context. These numbers aren't just a matter of arcane bookkeeping. They are significant because earmarks have become a key political issue. As a candidate, President Obama

promised to reduce earmarks

to the levels from 1994, the year that Republicans took control of Congress. So it's important to measure them accurately.
 
The Democrats' $3.8 billion figure has been widely reported. We found it in

Congressional Quarterly

, the


New York Times

,

the

Associated Press

and


USA Today


, among others. Most stories attribute the number to the Democratic leadership in Congress, while

USA Today

specifically cited Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic staff of the House Appropriations Committee.
 
Brost told us that she specified to reporters that the number was for ""non-project-based"" federal programs, such as water projects for dams, navigational improvements and beach renourishment. These programs have such a high percentage of earmarks that Democrats exclude them from their totals. Their reasoning is that if they promise to cut earmarks by a certain percentage, as they have in the past few years, these programs will be disproportionately cut.
 
But Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said they should be included in the definition of earmarks because the projects being excluded meet Congress' own definitition — the funding is requested by lawmakers for specific projects that in most cases are in their districts or home states. (For more on the definition, see

this earlier PolitiFact item

on White House claims that there were no earmarks in the stimulus bill.)
 
""According to Congress, these are earmarks. So to say there are $3.8 billion in earmarks (in the Omnibus) is misleading at best,"" Ellis said.
 
Ellis invoked a weight-loss analogy to explain what the Democrats are doing.
 
""It’s easier to make your weight loss goals if you don’t count your rear end,"" he said.
 
Brost says she has been precise with reporters that she was referring to the ""non-project-based"" numbers. But judging from the number of times we found the number cited as the Democratic estimate for earmarks, her nuance was not caught by reporters or by Democrats who have cited the figure.
 
Either way, the number is not a fair account of the total earmarks. We find the Taxpayers for Common Sense estimate to be right and we find the statement False.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
McCain says Obama will leave troops in Iraq — wishful thinking?
","
On the day President Obama unveiled his strategy for pulling out of Iraq, Sen. John McCain offered tepid support from the Senate floor.
 
""I am cautiously optimistic that the plan as laid out by the president can lead to success,"" McCain said on Feb. 27. ""The American people should be clear: The president's plan, even after the end of its withdrawal timeline is reached, will leave in place up to 50,000 U.S. troops.""
 
If true, that would be an important vindication for McCain, who argued during the campaign that the United States should station peacetime troops in Iraq for the long term as it has in other theaters. 
 
""Maybe a hundred, make it 100 (years),"" is how McCain put it at a campaign appearance in January 2008. ""We've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That'd be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed.""
 
But did Obama really say he would leave in place 50,000 U.S. troops?
 
In his speech at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, Obama said he would ""remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months"" and ""retain a transitional force ... likely (to) be made up of 35-50,000 U.S. troops.""
 
We suppose this is the basis of McCain's claim (though his office did not respond to our inquiry).
 
But Obama went on to offer more detail: ""Through this period of transition, we will carry out further redeployments,"" he said. ""And under the Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011.""
 
So McCain's claim is true only if Obama's ""withdrawal timeline"" ends at the start of the transitional period beginning in September 2010. That is, McCain was accurate only if he was talking exclusively about the withdrawal of combat troops. 
 
Clearly, though, Obama laid out a more complete timeline that extends through the end of 2011, when all U.S. troops are to be out of Iraq. And that timeline effectively rebukes McCain's argument for a long-term troop presence.
 
In a background conversation with reporters, a senior Obama administration official said his aides had rejected the idea of a long-term peacetime presence like that in Germany and South Korea.
 
“The path we're on here, the path is not towards any sort of Korea model,” the

New York Times

quoted the official as saying. “The path is towards reducing, in a fairly substantial way, U.S. forces in 2010 and then down to what's currently anticipated, down to zero, by the end of 2011."" (We prefer not to quote anonymous officials, but feel comfortable doing so here because the statement merely reinforces what Obama said in his speech.)
 
So it was inaccurate for McCain to suggest otherwise.
 
McCain may simply have been speaking imprecisely, rather than trying to claim a policy victory he has not won.
 
Still, we thought it important to note that on the question of a long-term troop presence in Iraq — one of the most fundamental areas of disagreement about the war among policymakers — Obama has thus far rejected McCain's vision, despite McCain's claim to the contrary. We find McCain's claim to be False.

"['National', 'Stimulus', 'Transportation', 'Bobby Jindal']","
Jindal's not as off the rails as some have said
","Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal used a moment in the national spotlight to claim the stimulus bill was ""larded with wasteful spending,"" including money for what sounded like a theme-park ride. ""It includes $300 million to buy new cars for the government, $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, such as a 'magnetic levitation' line from Las Vegas to Disneyland, and $140 million for something called 'volcano monitoring,'"" Jindal said of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, responding on national television to President Obama's first speech to Congress on Feb. 24, 2009. Critics questioned the premise that any of these was a waste of money, and some, including a few  news   organizations  , suggested the high-speed rail claim was a well-worn lie. Republicans had been blasting the $8 billion expenditure — and playing fast and loose with the facts at times — ever since the House-Senate conference committee stuck it in the final version of the bill. Neither the House nor Senate versions had anything close to $8 billion for rail funding, and Republicans alleged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid added the money in conference specifically for a high-speed rail line from Anaheim, Calif., to Las Vegas, in Reid's home state. That proposed project would be powered by magnetic levitation, a technology in which opposing magnetic fields along the track and in the train's undercarriage levitate the train a quarter-inch and propel it forward. ""Maglev"" trains, currently in use in China and Japan, are frictionless and fast. Proponents say the proposed Anaheim-to-Vegas train would reach 310 mph, zipping passengers between the cities in 80.5 minutes. Reid has backed the project for years, and critics such as  Rep. Thaddeus McCotter  of Michigan and  Sen. John McCain  of Arizona alleged that's where all $8 billion was headed.   That charge was widely, and appropriately, criticized as false. The money is not an ""earmark."" Nothing in the bill stipulates that it has to go to the Anaheim-to-Vegas project. In fact, it's all but certain dozens of other projects — such as in the Northeast corridor, where key Republican supporters of the stimulus bill reside, or in the Chicago area, hometown of another influential individual — will compete and win a share of the money.  Now back to Jindal. It's not quite fair to lump his comment in with the prior claims. He was more careful than some of the other Republican critics. Though he may have left some listeners with the incorrect impression that the Vegas-Anaheim project would definitely get some or all of the money — and he may have done so intentionally — technicially he did not say that. He said it would go to projects ""such as"" Reid's project. Indeed, that project is an example of the sort that the $8 billion may fund, as proponents of it have pointed out repeatedly. ""It would be great if this was one of those projects that would happen to benefit from it,"" Reid spokesman Jon Summers said in an interview. (He was vague about Reid's role in getting the $8 billion in the bill, saying ""it was something that President Obama wanted and Senator Reid as a conferee supported."") Other boosters of the project also expressed optimism that they'll get some of the $8 billion. Anaheim-to-Vegas is not a federally designated high-speed rail corridor, but that doesn't mean it's out of the running. The Senate version of the bill, which had $2 billion for high speed rail, limited the money to such corridors, but the conference committee removed that requirement. That's not to say that Jindal's claim didn't have some problems. For one, the train would not stop at Disneyland. The plan is for it to stop 2 miles away at a proposed new transportation hub called the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center. Jindal may have said Disneyland rather than Anaheim to make the project sound recreational or frivolous — but in doing so he stretched the truth a tad. We also want to point out that although Jindal and just about everyone else who has talked about the $8 billion has said it's for high-speed rail, it's not just for high-speed rail. It's for high-speed rail and conventional ""intercity"" rail service. States and agencies all over the country can apply for a share of the money for all sorts of expenses related to city-to-city rail service, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. So Jindal was imprecise on a couple of counts — the train won't go to Disneyland and all $8 billion is not for high-speed rail. But he was not out of bounds in employing the Anaheim-to-Vegas train as an example of the sort of project that may be funded by the $8 billion. We find his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2009/feb/27/bobby-jindal/Jindal-on-high-speed-rail/

McCain says presidential helicopters now more costly than Air Force One
","At a White House forum on fiscal responsibility on Feb. 23, Sen. John McCain complained to President Obama that cost overruns have dramatically increased the price tag for new presidential helicopters. ""Just one area that I wanted to mention that I think consumed a lot of our conversation on procurement was the issue of cost overruns in the Defense Department,"" McCain said at the forum. ""We all know how large the defense budget is. We all know that the cost overruns — your helicopter is now going to cost as much as Air Force One.  I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money."" We wondered if it was true that the Marine One presidential helicopter that carries 14 passengers could cost as much as the huge version of the Boeing 747 that is specially built for the president. The Air Force One cost comparison has been frequently cited by critics of the helicopter contract, which has nearly doubled in cost since Lockheed Martin won it in 2005. The original estimate was $6.1 billion for 28 helicopters, but it is now estimated at $11.2 billion. That works out to $400 million each. The two planes known as Air Force One, specially built Boeing 747 jets, were paid for in the late 1980s and delivered in 1990. We found a variety of price estimates for them. Several sources, including the book  Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes  by Kenneth T. Walsh, mention an overall cost of about $330 million per plane (in 1990 dollars). If that number is used for the comparison and adjusted to current dollars — about $517 million — then McCain is wrong because the plane costs more. But taxpayers actually paid only $200 million per plane (about $315 million in current dolllars), according to an Air Force spokesman. Boeing had a fixed price contract with the Air Force and had to absorb the cost overruns. So under that figure ($315 million for the plane vs. $400 million for the copter), McCain is close. In fact, he could have said the helicopter would cost  more.  So this one boils down to a question of what you consider to be the ""cost"" of Air Force One. It cost $550 million in current dollars  to build  , but the government  paid  just $315 million. We think most people would judge it on the cost that taxpayers paid, since that's the comparison being made with the helicopter contract (which is not a fixed price contract), but McCain could have been clearer if he had specified that. So we find his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/feb/27/john-mccain/presidential-helicopters-more-costly-air-force-one/
"['National', 'Education', 'Stimulus', 'Barack Obama']","
For the feds, yes, this is big school spending
","As President Obama signed the $787 billion stimulus bill, he said it marked a historic investment in education.  ""Because we know America can't outcompete the world tomorrow if our children are being outeducated today, we're making the largest investment in education in our nation's history,"" Obama said at a bill signing ceremony at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science on Feb. 17, 2009. That's quite a claim — the largest ever? It's true that a substantial chunk of the stimulus is targeted to education. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in  this press release  that the bill ""provides more than $100 billion in education funding and college grants and tuition tax credits, as well as billions more for school modernization."" This  chart  from the Wall Street Journal indicates $115 billion of the $787 billion goes to education in one way or another. That includes, among other things, $22 billion for school construction and repair, $41 billion for states to balance education budgets, $650 million for computer and science labs, $17 billion for Pell Grants, and $14 million for Education Department spending oversight (which we dare say seems like money well spent in light of what precedes it). That money will be spent over the next two years, a spokesman told us. For Obama to even be in the ballpark of being the largest ever, we have to assume that he was comparing the funding to prior spending by the  federal  government exclusively. It's important to realize that the vast majority of money spent on education in this country is spent by states and localities. Of the money spent at the elementary and secondary level, over 91 percent comes from nonfederal sources, according to the Education Department. Even $115 billion won't change that balance substantially. So we'll assume that Obama meant the largest single investment by the federal government. As we look back on the history of federal education funding, we find no single effort comes close, even after adjusting for inflation. The New Deal contained little in the way of education spending. After the Soviet Union succeeded in placing the  Sputnik 1  satellite in orbit, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act in 1958 to bolster math and science education — but that was a modest program by today's standards. Lyndon B. Johnson dramatically increased federal support for education with the Great Society programs, persuading Congress to pass the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965, the Higher Education Facilities Act of 1965 and Project Head Start. Those efforts marked a turning point in federal support for education, but experts in education budgeting told us they received just a few billion dollars — very little compared to today's education spending, even before the stimulus. For example, the Elementary and Secondary School Act was funded with $1.3 billion initially, according to the book  Depression to Cold War  , which amounts to around $9 billion in current dollars. Head Start received less than $1 billion. These programs have grown over time, so that the real competition to Obama's stimulus spending, several experts said, comes from the Education Department's annual budget from recent years. As  this chart  shows, it has risen steadily over the past 30 years, from $13.1 billion in 1980 (in 2007 dollars) to $23.2 billion in 1990 to $34.1 billion in 2000 to $73 billion in 2007. Tom Skelly, director of budget service at the Education Department, said via e-mail that the stimulus money is ""in addition to our 2009 regular appropriation that will be over $59 billion. So in the department alone, we will have about $160 billion in discretionary appropriations."" That's far higher than the department's budget has ever been. Other departments in the federal government also spend money on education through scholarship programs, school lunches and the like, amounting to total federal spending of about $170 billion a year. But there's no reason to believe those other programs won't continue this year as well, pushing total federal education spending to new heights. ""It is the largest federal investment in education,"" Skelly wrote of the stimulus money, standing behind Obama's claim.

Sanford incorrectly describes Rivlin comment on stimulus bill
","To bolster his claim that the economic stimulus bill won't work, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said the bill had drawn bipartisan criticism and named Alice Rivlin, budget director in the Clinton administration, as a prominent Democrat who said the bill would not help. ""From both sides of the political aisle — from conservative economist Martin Feldstein, who originally supported a stimulus, to former Clinton administration budget director Alice Rivlin — we hear that this particular bill won't actually stimulate the economy,"" Sanford, a Republican, wrote in  an op-ed  in the  Washington Post  on Feb. 23. The mention of Rivlin surprised us because the stimulus plan has drawn strong support from Democrats. So we asked Sanford's office to show us where Rivlin had said the bill ""won't actually stimulate the economy."" They pointed us to an article in the  Washington Post  headlined,  ""Democrats Among Stimulus Skeptics,""  which was published Jan. 28. The article focused on concerns by some Democrats that the stimulus package ""may fall short in its broader goal of transforming the American economy over the long term."" It said Democrats were especially concerned that Congress was rushing to include elements in the bill focused on long-term change without a thorough discussion. The article cited congressional testimony by Rivlin and said she ""suggested splitting the plan, implementing its immediate stimulus components now and taking more time to plan the longer-term transformative spending to make sure it is done right.""   It quoted Rivlin as saying, ""Such a long-term investment program should not be put together hastily and lumped in with the anti-recession package. The elements of the investment program must be carefully planned and will not create many jobs right away."" The risk, she said, is that ""money will be wasted because the investment elements were not carefully crafted."" But the focus of that comment was on the long-term plan and did not support Sanford's claim that she said ""this particular bill won't actually stimulate the economy."" We examined her full testimony and found that she made it clear that she thought the first phase of the stimulus package was urgently needed. She told the Budget Committee that ""the government should act quickly to mitigate the downslide with spending increases and revenue cuts that will stimulate consumer and investor spending, create jobs and protect the most vulnerable from the ravages of recession."" To make sure we were right, we called Rivlin. (This reminded us of  that scene  in  Annie Hall  where a man in line for a movie is making claims about media scholar Marshall McLuhan, and Woody Allen is so annoyed that he pulls McLuhan himself from behind the ticket counter and McLuhan tells the man, ""You know nothing of my work..."") Asked about Sanford's description of her comments in his op-ed, Rivlin told us, ""I did not say that at all, anywhere. I can’t imagine where he got that."" She said she believed the bulk of the bill was an effective stimulus to the economy but that she wished the smaller portion of the bill aimed at long-term investment had been discussed longer.   But, she said, ""to suggest I thought the stimulus is not effective is just wrong. That’s not true."" So we find nothing to back up Sanford's claim and find his statement False. (Gov. Sanford's office initially stood by the claim, but just as we were about to publish this item, Sanford communications director Joel Sawyer called and said they had misinterpreted what Rivlin said. ""In retrospect, we think we were wrong on that,"" he said.)",/factchecks/2009/feb/25/mark-sanford/sanford-incorrectly-describes-rivlin-comment-stimu/

 McCain says Omnibus bill packed with earmarks and pork
","
Despite all the talk during the campaign about cutting earmarks, Congress is still packing them into appropriations bills.
 
Case in point: the big appropriations bill for 2009 that never got passed last fall and is now before Congress. It's an amalgamation of nine spending bills known on Capitol Hill as the Omnibus.
 
Members of Congress have talked a lot about cutting earmarks, the provisions that specify money for pet projects, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the Omnibus. On CNN's

American Morning

on Feb. 25, Sen. John McCain complained that the bill was packed with them.
 
""On the floor tomorrow or the next day of the Senate will be a bill with 9,427 pork barrel items,"" McCain said, noting that one provision would provide $2 million to promote astronomy in Hawaii.
 
Other Republicans have made similar claims. ""There are nine appropriations bills that [Democrats] are going to wrap together that are $30 billion over budget in a bill that contains 9,000 earmarks. This is absolutely crazy,"" Rep. John Boehner, the House Majority Leader, said

in a Web video

.
 
We wondered if their numbers were right.
 
We should start by noting that there are differences in how groups define an earmark, something we explained when we checked the

White House claim that there were none

in the economic stimulus package. The House, Senate and the executive branch have different definitions, while we prefer the one in

Safire's Political Dictionary

that defines an earmark as money  ""that individual senators or representatives specify be directed to projects and activities that will benefit particular people, institutions or locations in their home constituencies.""
 
McCain's office told us the 9,427 was a ""preliminary number"" that staffers got by simply counting member-sponsored projects in a draft of the House version of the bill.
 
Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that tracks federal spending, has a slightly lower number — 8,570 (down from 8,811 last year). That number includes anything defined by Congress as an earmark that doesn't mention the president as the person making the request. If you also include items requested by the president's budget that have been jointly requested by a member of Congress, the number comes to 9,287, according to TCS.
 
A McClatchy News Service story put the total earmarks at 9,000, attributing it to ""congressional officials.""
 
So McCain's number is in the same range as other counts and given slightly different definitions, it's possible to get different tallies. We find his claim to be True.

Jindal says unemployment measures in stimulus will cost the state money
","Since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act became law on Feb. 17, 2009, a few Republican governors have said they don't intend to accept some of the money, saying it comes with too many strings attached. That includes Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who appeared on  Meet the Press  on Feb. 22. ""Why would you turn down $100 million for federal unemployment assistance for your state?"" asked moderator David Gregory. ""You're talking about temporary federal money that would require a permanent change in state law,"" Jindal said. ""The $100 million we turned down was temporary federal dollars that would require us to change our unemployment laws, that would've actually raised taxes on Louisiana businesses. We as a state would've been responsible for paying for those benefits after the federal money disappeared."" Gregory then quoted Louisiana's Democratic senator, Mary Landrieu, saying that Jindal's claims were ""inaccurate,"" but Jindal stuck by his statement.  First, we have to note that while $100 million sounds like a lot, it is actually a relatively small portion of Louisiana's stimulus package. Jindal has said he intends to accept federal money that will pay for a $25 per week increase in benefits for unemployment recipients, as well as money for transportation projects. Landrieu says the transportation money should total $430 million, and that the state will get $718 million in stabilization funds aimed at schools, and another $752 million for agriculture and rural development. When you factor in money to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal projects, Louisiana will ultimately receive ""billions"" from the package, Landrieu said. But Jindal is rejecting money that the federal government is offering states to loosen their rules governing unemployment compensation. (Find it under  Sec. 2003, ""Special transfers for unemployment compensation modernization.  ) The incentive varies by state, but Louisiana's take is about $100 million, or more precisely $32.8 million with the potential for another $65.6 million. The first change the federal government wants is known by the lovely jargon ""alternative base."" It makes slight changes to the formula states use when determining if workers qualify for cash payments. Basically, it would allow more low-wage and seasonal workers to be eligible for unemployment, a method already used by 19 states. Jindal believes this change would cost Louisiana up to $12 million a year, and the experts we consulted said that estimate sounded about right. After Louisiana used the $32.8 million, it would have to come up with $12 million a year on its own. If Louisiana agreed to that measure, it could try for the $65.6 million by extending its unemployment provisions even further — such as covering people who seek part-time work or those who leave their jobs for a ""compelling family reason."" To take only the first provision into account, Jindal is saying that Louisiana would get $32.8 million in funds up front for potential ongoing expenses of $12 million a year, which he says is not much of a deal. And he is saying businesses, which pay the taxes that fund unemployment compensation, would get a tax increase to pay for that. But he sidesteps two key points: The $12 million a year is not a solid number — it could conceivably drop if the economy improves and more people get jobs. And state officials may decide to pay for it in ways other than a tax increase. Wayne Vroman, an economist with the nonpartisan Urban Institute who studies unemployment insurance, said there's a good chance the tax increase would not be needed. ""There's a kind of balance through having more stimulus that would tend to reduce future taxes,"" Vroman said. A business-oriented group, UWC-Strategic Services on Unemployment & Workers' Compensation, was less optimistic about avoiding a tax increase, but the group's president said it's not clear how much taxes would have to go up. ""I think it's fair to say that there would be some increase in taxes to pay for additional payouts,"" said Doug Holmes. ""How much will that be? When would the tax kick in? It's really hard to speculate about that."" Holmes also said that business taxes for unemployment in most states will rise dramatically next year regardless of whether states take the incentive money or not. That's simply a function of the downturn in the economy and the way the taxes are calculated. Clearly, Jindal's comment is speculative in some respects. But it's also logical to think that expanding unemployment insurance will cost more, and that the government will have to find that money, possibly increasing taxes on the employers who pay into the fund. On the other hand, some states might be better off giving workers the money and getting their local economy back into gear. Certainly the stimulus bill itself does not specify tax increases for unemployment. Given all these factors, we find that Jindal's statement is largely correct. He is right that the $100 million he turned down would have required Louisiana to change its unemployment law. But he can't be sure that it would mean higher taxes based on that alone. It depends how the economy rebounds and how the costs are allocated. The law itself does not require tax increases. For this reason, we find his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/feb/24/bobby-jindal/jindal-unemployment-measure-stimulus/

Sanford distorts impact of stimulus bill
","A week after the economic stimulus bill was signed into law, it continues to come under fire from Republicans who say it won't do enough to jump-start the economy. In an op-ed in the  Washington Post  on Feb. 23, Mark Sanford, the Republican governor of South Carolina, wrote that the bill would not only fail to boost the economy, but that it would actually make things worse. ""Now that the so-called stimulus plan is law, we're left with one question: Will this package help us or hurt us? Unfortunately, I believe it is the latter, for a few reasons,"" wrote Sanford. ""First, this package will ultimately mean less, not more, economic activity. The Congressional Budget Office has found that this bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019. That translates into our economy losing tens of billions of dollars."" When we asked Sanford's communications director to provide the source for his data, he pointed us to a Feb. 4 letter from CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf to senators and House members that projects the impact of the stimulus bill. We should note that the CBO is a nonpartisan agency that has the thankless task of projecting the cost and impact of bills being considered by Congress. CBO does not take a position on legislation and its estimates are widely quoted (and occasionally, misquoted) by both parties. The  Feb. 4 letter  that Sanford cites is about the Senate version of the stimulus bill. It gives an overview of CBO's estimates. (It's worth noting that there is  a newer estimate  written Feb. 11 that has slightly different numbers, but the patterns are the same. And CBO is likely to update that estimate in the near future.) The letter says, in the cautious language of government economists, that the stimulus bill would indeed stimulate the economy. It says that the Senate version of the bill would boost GDP — the key measurement of the economy's output — by 1.2 percent to 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010. The bill would add 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. And it would reduce the unemployment rate 0.7 percentage points to 2.1 percentage points below the baseline forecast of 8.7 percent. The letter says that the stimulus, intended as a short-term program to get the economy moving again, would have short-term effects. So if the letter shows the stimulus bill will boost the economy, how can Sanford claim there is a decline in 2019? He's quoting a single number out of context and distorting what it means. His office pointed us to a section of the letter that discusses the long-term impact. It says that by 2019 the Senate legislation ""would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on net."" That's not worded very clearly and it has led many people — including many conservative critics — to misunderstand what CBO meant. Bill Beach, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that was referring to the long-term impact of the debt from the stimulus bill on the economy. CBO estimates that all of the debt from the stimulus could have effect of ""crowding out"" private investment, meaning that investors wouldn't put as much of their money into private capital, which has an negative impact on the economy. But the effect is relatively small. It would lower the GDP from its ""baseline"" level by only 0.1 to 0.3 percent. And contrary to the way Sanford said it, the economy is still growing by 2.5 percent annually at that point, according to CBO. It's just wouldn't grow  as fast  because of the big debt. Sanford is quoting the number out of context and neglecting to point out that it is a reduction from the baseline, which itself was going up. So he gives the impression it is a decline in the real GDP, when it's really a decline in GDP growth. Big difference. To say Sanford is cherry-picking the letter would be too generous. He has taken one number from a letter that seems to support his thesis and distorted it. And he's ignored several more prominent measurements that show the stimulus bill would help the economy. So we find his claim to be False.",/factchecks/2009/feb/23/mark-sanford/sanford-distorts-impact-stimulus-bill/

Congresswoman's portrait of a toothless FDA is correct
","
Is our food-safety system really that weak?
 
We realized the recent outbreak of salmonella poisoning from peanut products exposed serious problems with food manufacturing and plant inspections.
 
But Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, alleged it also exposed the federal Food and Drug Administration as toothless when it comes to recalls. 
 
""When the salmonella source was finally identified, FDA officials had to wait for industry approval before they could go live with the recall,"" the congresswoman said at a Feb. 4, 2009, news conference.
 
DeLauro was speaking amid great public concern about the outbreak, which was discovered in January 2009 after it killed eight people and sickened more than 500 in 43 states. It was traced to tainted peanut butter and paste from a Peanut Corporation of America plant in Georgia and possibly another in Texas.
 
Those ingredients had been distributed nationwide in all sorts of products, prompting recalls of more than 2,100 products from energy bars to ice cream.
 
DeLauro's comment evoked an image of FDA officials meekly asking company executives if it was okay to protect the public from tainted peanuts. We wondered whether she was stretching the truth to drum up support for a bill she proposed to strengthen the FDA's recall process.
 
A spokeswoman said DeLauro was referring to the voluntary nature of food recalls. And indeed, the FDA recall process is almost entirely voluntary — strictly speaking.
 
This is poorly understood by consumers, the media and even some food companies, the FDA says in this

primer

on its recall policies.
 
""The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not generally authorize FDA to 'order' a manufacturer to recall a food, cosmetic or supplement,"" the online brochure says. Only when it comes to medical devices, human-tissue products and infant formula can the agency order a recall.
 
DeLauro's office said she got her information partly from this

New York Times article

, which reported that the government ""needed the company’s permission last week before announcing a huge recall of its products.""
 
There's an important bit of context to add, though.
 
In reality, companies do not generally refuse FDA requests to issue a recall. In fact, none has ever done so, at least in the memory of Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
 
""I don't think there's ever been a case to my knowledge where a company has refused to recall products when we told them in very specific terms that we would be taking additional actions,"" Sundlof told a Senate committee in a Feb. 5, 2009, hearing on the salmonella outbreak.
 
Additional actions the FDA can take against any company that refuses to recall food can include seizing products and enjoining the company from doing further business.
 
Bill Marler, a personal injury lawyer who specializes in foodborne illnesses, concurred with Sundlof. He said companies have little motivation to refuse the agency's recall requests, or even delay the process, because doing so would expose them to more legal liability.
 
""In my experience, there is very seldom a delay, because most of the time you've got a company who wants to solve the problem and not poison any more of its customers than it already has,"" said Marler, who is based in Seattle.
 
Plenty of food-safety advocates argue the FDA should have the authority to mandate recalls. But their main concern is not that companies refuse to issue recalls voluntarily, it's issues such as FDA's limited control over how aggressively to recover products, and that ""voluntary recalls"" might not sound serious enough to consumers.
 
DeLauro arguably made our food-safety regime sound weaker than it is, since there is little question as a practical matter that companies will quickly agree to recalls. And it was imprecise for her to say the FDA waited for the company's approval to ""go live"" with the recall — the FDA did not ""go live"" with the recall at all; it was the company that issued it.
 
But ""go live"" is a vague term, and DeLauro seems to have meant ""announce."" And it's true that the FDA could not post on its Web site

this press release

announcing the recall, which came from the Peanut Corporation of America, until the company agreed to issue the recall and wrote the release.
 
So while DeLauro's depiction of the recall process was not full and complete, it was technically accurate. We find her claim to be True.

Preckwinkle inflates role in shedding light on McDonald case
","Cook County Board President and mayoral candidate Toni Preckwinkle has a campaign ad claiming she had a big role in exposing details behind the deadly police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. ""Sixteen shots. Nine in the back. Facts that the police and city officials tried to bury. Facts that Toni Preckwinkle brought to light,"" a narrator says in the 30-second spot. ""It was Toni who made sure Laquan McDonald’s autopsy went public. Toni, who called for the dash cam footage to be released."" McDonald was shot and killed on Oct. 20, 2014, by then Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, later convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated assault. But for more than a year after McDonald’s death the city withheld video footage of the shooting and Van Dyke remained on the force. Preckwinkle’s ad was quickly met with a flurry of criticism from both her opponents in the mayoral race as well as community activists. They accused her of politicizing McDonald’s death and exaggerating her role in bringing the facts of the shooting to light for personal gain. We wondered how much credit Preckwinkle could reasonably take for helping to make public two key pieces of evidence which contradicted the city’s official narrative that Van Dyke shot McDonald in self-defense. The first claim in Preckwinkle’s ad checks out. Preckwinkle used her authority over the Cook County medical examiner’s office to unearth the details of McDonald’s death that were being kept under wraps. She first described the autopsy results to Jamie Kalven, an award-winning writer whose Invisible Institute has played a central role in investigating police abuse cases in Chicago. Kalven broke the story behind the McDonald shooting in February 2015, revealing that Van Dyke pumped 16 shots into McDonald and nine of those struck the teen in the back. Kalven has recounted multiple times the story of Preckwinkle’s assistance in helping him pry loose details of the McDonald autopsy. ""She agreed to see what she could find out and I was out for a run headed to Washington Park in the snow on a winter night in Chicago and Toni pulled up alongside me on 51st Street and gestured to me to get into her vehicle, which I did. She didn’t say hello, she clearly was shaken. And she said, ‘16 shots — front and back,’"" Kalven later recalled for WBEZ. However, we could find no evidence to support the second beat of Preckwinkle’s TV ad claim — that she had pressured the city to make public the police dash cam video of the incident. The Emanuel administration resisted release of the video for more than a year after the shooting even in the face of a lawsuit filed by independent journalist Brandon Smith. But on Nov. 19, 2015, Cook County Judge Franklin Valderrama ruled in Smith’s favor and ordered the video’s release, which came five days later. We asked Preckwinkle’s campaign for evidence that she had spoken up about the video prior to Valderrama’s order. Spokeswoman Monica Trevino sent us several articles quoting Preckwinkle criticizing city officials for having delayed releasing the footage. But the articles all made clear that Preckwinkle weighed in only after the judge did and the video release was a fait accompli. We also checked with Matt Topic, the government transparency and media lawyer who represented Smith in his suit. Topic also provides outside counsel to the Better Government Association, but the BGA, which operates PolitiFact Illinois, had no involvement in the legal case brought by Smith. Topic told us in an email he was not aware of Preckwinkle calling for the video’s release ahead of the judge’s order and said she filed nothing with the court to support Smith’s position in the case. Topic was among those who called Preckwinkle out last week for inflating her role in bringing the true story of McDonald’s death to light. ""Rather than use this any further for political purposes, I'd like to hear the candidates acknowledge that there is a serious ongoing secrecy problem requiring immediate attention on day one and their specific proposals and commitments on how they are going to address it,"" Topic wrote in a Twitter thread. Preckwinkle claims she was instrumental in releasing the details of McDonald’s autopsy. That much is true. But Preckwinkle’s ad also asserts she called for the city to release the dash cam footage of the shooting. We could find no evidence of her doing so before a judge had already ordered the release. Preckwinkle’s ad is partially accurate and leaves out important details, so we we rate it Half True.

Did lettuce kill more Americans than undocumented immigrants?
","  As the country was slogging into the third week of a government shutdown, a claim about federal paralysis caught fire on social media. Over an image of leafy vegetables growing in a field, a meme posted on Jan. 9 said, ""Lettuce killed more Americans this year than undocumented immigrants."" (The accompanying comment on the Facebook post was, ""lettuce prey."") The shutdown stemmed from President Donald Trump’s desire to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and Democrats’ opposition to funding it at levels Trump considers sufficient. The resulting lapse in federal appropriations has shuttered many parts of the government, including some food-safety inspections handled by the Food and Drug Administration. The assertion was amplified when a Hollywood writer tweeted it the following day. ""Last year lettuce killed more Americans than undocumented immigrants so it's a good thing we're halting food inspections over a wall that won't work,"" tweeted Ally Maynard, a television producer with 80,500 followers. It inspired at least 67,000 retweets and 209,000 likes through Jan. 15. Last year lettuce killed more Americans than undocumented immigrants so it's a good thing we're halting food inspections over a wall that won't work. Social media users wondered if what she wrote was accurate. Some searched the Centers for Disease Control looking for more information. We decided to help everyone out. The number appears to be at least five. There were two high-profile E. Coli outbreaks from romaine lettuce in 2018. The first, in May 2018, resulted in five deaths and at least 210 illnesses, about half of which resulted in hospitalizations. The second, in November, resulted in a few dozen illnesses but no reported deaths. Don’t assume that the nonfatal illnesses were minor, however. E. coli O157:H7, the pathogen involved in these outbreaks, ""can cause a life-threatening complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome among the very young or elderly,"" said Craig Hedberg, a University of Minnesota epidemiologist. There were 27 such cases in the first outbreak, and two in the second. As for undocumented immigrants and crime, let’s start with the big picture: They have been found to be no more likely than U.S.-born individuals to take part in crime. One study published earlier this year by sociologists from the University of Wisconsin and Purdue University, for instance, concluded that ""undocumented immigration does not increase violence."" And there’s a bigger body of academic research that suggests that immigrants, regardless of legal status, are no more likely to commit criminal acts than native-born Americans, said Christopher P. Salas-Wright, an assistant professor at Boston University’s School of Social Work. ""We continue to find that areas with higher concentrations of immigrants have lower violent crime rates,"" said Charis E. Kubrin, a University of California-Irvine criminologist, citing a recent paper she wrote.

Kubrin added that for the most part, studies find that people who migrate are a self-selecting group who want to better their lives, provide for their families back in their home countries and don’t want to risk getting in trouble with the law. There were some high-profile examples in 2018 of undocumented immigrants being charged with homicide. One was Cristhian Bahena Rivera, a farmhand who was charged with murdering 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts. Another was Gustavo Perez Arriaga, who was charged with killing police officer Ronil Singh in Newman, Calif. Neither case has been adjudicated yet. But while anecdotes exist, hard data about killings by undocumented immigrants is hard to find. As we’ve noted previously, it is not a statistic that is calculated on a national basis. So the best we can manage is guesswork. We know that there have recently been about 19,000 homicides every year in the United States, and presumably some fraction of them have been committed by undocumented immigrants. Comparing the estimated size of the undocumented immigrant population (10.7 million) and the full U.S. population (327 million), the roughest possible calculation would suggest that about 600 of those homicides would have been committed by undocumented immigrants per year. That’s not far off another data point we have — the number of convictions of illegal immigrants for homicides in Texas. Cato Institute senior immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh pointed to a Texas Department of Public Safety website that reported 238 homicide convictions of undocumented immigrants between June 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2018. Based on his communications with the agency, Nowrasteh was able to pinpoint 39 convictions that occurred in Texas in 2018. These are convictions for homicides that occurred in a variety of years, so it’s not perfectly comparable, but it’s a rough estimate. If you prorate Texas’s 39 homicide convictions to the country as a whole — simply using population — it works out to 445 nationally. As we’ve emphasized, these are back-of-the-envelope calculations. But even if these estimates — a couple hundred homicides by undocumented immigrants — are high by a factor of 10, they almost certainly outpaced the five lettuce deaths in 2018. So the statement that rocketed around social media is wrong. But a small change in wording could have made a big difference. If the statement had used the word ""food"" rather than ""lettuce,"" it might well have been correct. (This is also a fuller description of what the FDA inspects anyway.) A 2011 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used models to estimate the annual number of deaths due to 31 pathogens to be 2,612, or 1,351 if you include only domestically acquired foodborne illnesses. Either figure would be larger than the estimate of couple hundred deaths every year at the hands of undocumented immigrants. (These numbers are also larger than the number of confirmed deaths from foodborne illness in recent years, but that is generally chalked up to gaps in reporting and medical uncertainties about what actually led to a person’s death.) For her part, Maynard told PolitiFact that her comparison ""was definitely meant in jest,"" and that finding hard data on the question was difficult. The meme said, ""Lettuce killed more Americans this year than undocumented immigrants."" To the best we can tell from imperfect data, that’s incorrect. However a small tweak -- changing the term to ""food,"" which is the FDA’s full responsibility -- would likely have supported the meme’s point. On its own, we rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2019/jan/15/viral-image/did-lettuce-kill-more-americans-undocumented-immig/

Trump wants to lift sanctions related to a Russian oligarch. Here’s why
","Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote to block the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The sanctions relief requires the Russian billionaire, who has ties to President Vladimir Putin, to divest himself of large corporate ownership stakes, including a controlling interest in the world’s second largest aluminium production company, Rusal. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, expressed skepticism about the administration's proposal during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to force a vote against the sanctions relief shortly.   Warner said the Treasury Department has ""a scheme to try to take (Deripaska’s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45"" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. But he doubted the arrangement would curb Deripaska’s influence. ""As more and more of this information comes out about ties between Trump and Trump officials and the Russians,"" Warner said, ""it is the worst time to signal that we're going to take the pressure off of oligarchs like Deripaska."" Warner’s partial description of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska is right, but it leaves out important details. Furthermore, several experts we spoke to had a different read of the Trump’s administration’s reasons for wanting the sanctions lifted. We asked Warner's office for comment, but didn't hear back.  Warner was right about some of the mechanics of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska. Here’s the quick backstory on the sanctions. Last April, the Treasury Department placed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, as well as a dozen companies the oligarchs either owned or controlled. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC — the Treasury Department’s sanctions arm — said in a report that ""the action aggressively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites that further the Kremlin's global malign activities."" The misbehavior included ""attempts to subvert Western democracy, support for the (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad regime, malicious cyber activities, occupation of Crimea, and instigation of violence in Ukraine."" Among the dozen sanctioned companies were three that were connected to Deripaska, who the Treasury Department referred to as ""a Kremlin insider."" Deripaska held a 70 percent ownership stake in EN+, the holding company for the aluminum powerhouse Rusal, and energy company ESE. The department agreed to lift sanctions on the three companies in exchange for Deripaska’s ownership stake in EN+ dropping from 70 to 44.95 percent. Doing so clears a key threshold. With Deripaska no longer the majority owner, the company becomes eligible to have sanctions lifted under the Treasury Department’s ""50-percent rule,"" a process known as delisting. But the deal tacks on additional conditions that Warner didn’t mention. It includes a corporate restructuring, designed to limit Deripaska’s (and Kremlin) influence over the companies, plus additional reporting and transparency requirements.   Unless lawmakers block it, the sanctions are due to be lifted very soon, by Jan. 18. While this would relieve some of the economic pain inflicted on Deripaska’s companies, it’s worth noting that the sanctions on Deripaska personally would remain in effect. ""Deripaska won't see a penny of the income from the shares until he himself is delisted — and that is not in the cards with this divestiture deal,"" said Samantha Sultoon, a visiting senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Most of the foreign policy experts we talked to — though not all — shared Warner’s skepticism that the corporate reshuffling plan would keep Deripaska in check. ""Given how business is done by influential, Kremlin-connected oligarchs in Russia, I have no question that if Deripaska wants to be in control, he will be,"" said Joseph DeThomas, a former high-ranking State Department official who teaches international affairs at Penn State University. Warner is among a group of Democrats who have raised questions about the Trump administration’s motives for granting sanctions relief to the Deripaska-linked companies, which they see as helping out a Putin crony. However, most experts we spoke to said this is a case of the Trump administration’s clumsiness, not coziness. Back in April, when the sanctions hit the aluminum giant Rusal, it sent shockwaves through the global aluminum markets. The price of aluminum soared over the following weeks. Europe, which relies heavily on Russia’s metals market, faced the prospect of plant closures and lost jobs. Even now, the European Union strongly supports the lifting of sanctions. The move also disrupted Rusal’s global supply chain. According to the Treasury Department, Rusal subsidiaries in the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica, Guinea, and elsewhere ""faced imminent closure,"" before the Treasury stepped in to mitigate some of the damage. According to experts, the Treasury discovered it had bitten off more than it could chew. ""They were done clumsily,"" Alina Polyakova, of the Brookings Institution, said of the sanctions. ""It seems clear that the administration did not plan for the dramatic effects on aluminum markets and the knock-on effects on European businesses."" Warner himself acknowledged this aspect, saying, ""I know there's concerns from our European allies about these sanctions."" That seems to undercut Senate Democrats’ suggestion that sanctions-relief is a sign of undue coziness between team Trump and Russian oligarchs. Still, in the midst of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Moscow, the optics of the sanctions relief plan are not good. ""The Treasury was in a hopeless situation and does not want to state clearly that they made a mistake,"" said Anders Åslund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""Therefore they now look as if they are helping Deripaska."" Warner said the Trump administration has ""a scheme to try to take (Deripaska’s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45"" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. Warner’s description of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska is partially right, but it leaves out important details. The plan also entails corporate restructuring, plus additional reporting and transparency measures. And the sanctions against Deripaska himself would remain in place. Most experts we spoke to said sanctions relief wasn’t a ""scheme"" so much as it was the Trump administration’s way of ending the disruption it inflicted on the global metals market when it sanctioned Deripaska’s aluminum company Rusal. In other words, it’s more likely a case of clumsiness, rather coziness with Russian oligarchs — as Senate Democrats suggest. We rate this Half True.

"['Immigration', 'Congress', 'Virginia', 'Tim Kaine']","
Tim Kaine is mostly accurate about Trump nixing a $25 billion border proposal
","Sen. Tim Kaine says President Donald Trump was once offered all the money he wanted for Southern border security, and turned it down. His comments came during a Jan.9 interview on CNN, amid a federal government shutdown over disagreements on funding to expand a security wall on the Southern border. Trump is demanding $5.7 billion for project; congressional Democrats are drawing the line at $1.3 billion. Kaine said his fellow Democrats have tried in the past to compromise with Trump on border security, but to no avail. ""We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago - $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way - and the president blew up the deal,"" Kaine said. We wondered whether Kaine’s statement is accurate. Miryam Lipper, the senator’s spokesperson, referred us to a short-lived bill the senator co-sponsored in February 2018. The Senate was intensely debating immigration. Trump had announced that on March 5, he would begin winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program - or DACA - that protects from deportation children who were brought to the U.S. as illegal immigrants. The Senate was seeking a broad compromise with Trump on immigration policies that would save DACA before the March 5 deadline. Trump backed a Republican bill that would have appropriated $25 billion for border security. The legislation honored four conditions the president set for continuing DACA: Provide money to build the wall; Establish a path to citizenship for DACA children, or ""dreamers;"" End the visa lottery program that promotes ethnic diversity of immigrants, and Severely limit family-based immigration - what Trump calls ""chain immigration."" Ending the diversity visa lottery and restricting family-based immigration - which the Democrats call ""family reunification - were anathema to Democrats. Without bipartisan support, the bill couldn’t reach the 60 votes needed to end debate on it and to advance to a pass-or-fail roll call. So Democrats and a handful Republicans - on Feb. 14, 2018 - introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would muster enough bipartisan backing to pass the 60-vote cloture rule. The measure called for $25 billion in border spending over 10 years for wall construction and a host of other security measures. The bill, however, did not address Trump’s demands to end the lottery and narrow family-based immigration. On Feb. 15, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement threatening Trump would veto the substitute bill. Trump, in tweets, called the bill ""a total catastrophe,"" that would create ""mass amnesty for over 10 million illegal aliens, including criminals."" The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that Trump also objected that the bill would allocate the $25 billion over 10 years, instead of all at once. Later that day, the bill failed. Although a bipartisan group of 54 senators voted for cloture - a majority - they came short of the 60 votes needed to advance. Minutes later, the Republican bill backed by Trump also died. Congress failed to reach the March 5 deadline to protect DACA, but the phase-out of the program has put on hold by several courts. Our ruling Kaine said, ""We took a deal to the president just last February, less than a year ago - $25 billion over 10 years in border security done the right way - and the president blew up the deal."" He’s referring to a 2018 bill backed by Senate Democrats and a few Republicans that would have provided $25 billion over a decade to significantly expand the wall and fund other programs to improve Southern border security. Trump vehemently opposed the bill and threatened to veto it because it did not contain two immigration reforms he demanded: ending the visa lottery and deeply restricting family-based immigration. We quibble, however, with Kaine’s use of the term ""deal,"" which suggests everything was guaranteed for passage if the president went along. Republicans lawmakers never made that promise. It was really a proposal. So we rate Kaine's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/jan/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-mostly-accurate-about-trump-nixing-25-bi/

McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 never banned Muslims from public office

Both men worried about communists infiltrating the country through the immigration system, and they wanted to limit who could come to the United States. The resulting McCarthy era-law codified an existing quota system for immigration. It also introduced a new system that gave preferences to some immigrants based on their skill sets and whether they would be reunited with their families. As the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Historian notes, the new act revised the 1924 National Origins Quota System by admitting people of different nationalities to the United States at a rate of one-sixth of 1 percent of however many immigrants from a country were living in the United States in 1920. That meant that 85 percent of about 154,000 visas available annually went to people from northern and western European lineage. President Harry Truman worried that the law was discriminatory, but Congress had enough votes to override his veto. Still, the law does not mention religion nor Muslims.

New NC law makes small but significant changes to campaign finance investigations
","The North Carolina elections board — which is investigating possible fraud in the 9th Congressional District race — was left leaderless last month after a court found its structure to be unconstitutional. So Republican legislators crafted a bill to install a new board, which Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed. He said the bill ""mandates secrecy for campaign finance investigations by the Elections Board."" ""Not only that, the new bill makes it harder to prosecute people and groups that violate campaign finance laws,"" Cooper said in a Dec. 26 Facebook post. The bill, which became law after the legislature overrode Cooper’s veto, does make campaign finance investigations less transparent. (Under the old law, the existence of investigations were considered public record as soon as someone filed a complaint. Under the new law, as PolitiFact NC recently wrote, an investigation would become known to the public only if charges are filed or if the person who filed the complaint decides to inform the public about it.) But does the new law make it harder for authorities to ""prosecute"" people who might have violated campaign finance laws? Cooper’s post, along with the word ""prosecute,"" are somewhat vague. Contacted by PolitiFact, Cooper spokesman Ford Porter argued that the bill introduces new hurdles that could impede prosecution of campaign finance violations. PolitiFact NC reviewed the new law and the changes explained by legislative staff. There’s a new requirement for filing a complaint, a new statute of limitations on investigating complaints, and a new step the North Carolina elections board must take before referring campaign finance violations to prosecutors. Complaint restrictions Under the old law, complaints could be made informally, by email. Under the new law, complaints have to be signed and sworn under oath. The old law didn’t provide a statute of limitations for investigating complaints. The new law says: No investigation shall be initiated more than four years from the earliest of the following dates: The facts constituting the violation are known to the State Board or county board with jurisdiction. The facts constituting the violation can be determined from the public record. The complainant knew or should have known of the conduct upon which the complaint is based. A new review process The new law also creates a new procedure that must be followed before the elections board can refer campaign finance cases to prosecutors. Under the old law, the elections board and ethics commission were one agency — the N.C. State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. And the agency could refer cases to prosecutors without waiting on a recommendation. Under the new law, the agency will be divided into the state elections board and the state ethics commission. The new process is: The elections board investigates a campaign finance complaint. The elections board sends its findings to the ethics commission. Within 90 days, the ethics commission makes a recommendation to the elections board on whether or not it should refer the case to prosecutors. The elections board is free to refer the cases to prosecutors (with or without the ethics commission’s support). Hypotheticals Supporters of the new law might argue that it won’t change the outcome of the review, referral and prosecution process — and they could be right. It’s possible that the new requirement to have a complaint signed and sworn won’t discourage anyone from coming forward with legitimate allegations, that having the ethics commission involved won’t get in the way of prosecution, and that no cases will emerge that predate the new four-year statute of limitations on the election board. However, there’s also a chance the new statute of limitations could prevent the board from holding someone accountable for something that happened more than four years ago. It’s also possible that the ethics commission and elections board would disagree on whether to pursue criminal charges. The ethics commission will be composed of eight members, who could potentially deadlock. And it’s possible that, if county prosecutors are aware of a disagreement between the elections board and the ethics commission, it would influence their decision to withhold charges. John Wallace, an attorney who has represented the N.C. Democratic Party, noted that the law requires the elections board to send some campaign finance cases to a politician’s home district. He noted that some district attorneys ""may not be knowledgeable or experienced with respect to the prosecution of campaign finance matters."" Our ruling Cooper said a bill passed by GOP legislators ""makes it harder to prosecute people and groups that violate campaign finance laws."" The new law will require complaints to be signed and sworn, the elections board to abide by a new statute of limitations, and the state ethics commission to weigh in on cases. Supporters of the law could argue that those additions to the process are relatively small obstacles to clear to prosecute someone for campaign finance violations. And they may have a point. But the new requirements are hurdles, nonetheless. We rate this claim True.

Story mischaracterizes Tlaib's tenuous association with controversial imam
","One of the newest claims roaming the internet involves a freshman Democratic U.S. Representative and her supposed link to an unindicted terrorist. According to a recent article published by conservative news website the Columbian Post, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has links to Siraj Wahhaj, a prominent but controversial New York Imam who has attracted the attention of authorities in the past. The story’s headline reads: ""Democrat Congresswoman linked to UNINDICTED Terrorist!"" It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So, let’s just get this part out of the way: We checked this claim and found that while Tlaib and Wahhaj were both featured speakers at a November event in California, that appears to be the extent of any so-called ""link."" Is that a ""link?"" In its weakest form, perhaps. Regarding Wahhaj: His name was included on a list of people with a possible connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, though he was never charged. While the headline acknowledges Wahhaj has never been indicted, it still makes him out  to be a terrorist. The headline also inflates any Tlaib association. Let’s take a closer look. Siraj Wahhaj, 68, born Jeffrey Kearse, is an African-American imam of the Masjid At-Taqwa mosque in Brooklyn, NY, and the leader of the Muslim Alliance in North America. Wahhaj does have a checkered past. As we mentioned earlier, his name was included on a list of people that prosecutors said ""may be alleged as co-conspirators"" in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He was never charged and denies any involvement with the bombing. Wahhaj also testified as a character witness for Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the notorious ""blind sheikh"" who was convicted in 1995 of plotting terror attacks in the U.S. In August 2018, Wahhaj’s son (also named Siraj Wahhaj), along with his two daughters, a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law, was arrested on 11 felony counts of child abuse at a New Mexico compound. It is also important to note that the elder Wahhaj was one of the people who led authorities to the compound after he received a plea from his daughter saying that they were starving, he has claimed. While incredibly controversial, Wahhaj is still a prominent cleric in the Muslim community who books speaking engagements around the country and has held executive roles in influential Islamic organizations over the years.  Starting with the Colombian Post story, we eventually tracked down an article on FMshooter.com, a conservative blog originally founded to focus on promoting ""free market economies and responsible gun ownership."" That story’s headline takes it a bit further: ""Trump-Ranting Democrat Rashida Tlaib Linked To Imam Who Sees Homosexuality As A ‘Disease,’"" it reads, before spending the first four paragraphs of the story referencing Tlaib’s use of an expletive while vowing at a reception following her swearing-in to impeach President Donald Trump. ""Delving deeper,"" the story goes on, ""we find that Tlaib – no more than two months ago – was a featured speaker at a CAIR event with Siraj Wahhaj."" It then displays a screenshot of a CAIR promotional flyer for the event. That claim checks out. The Council on American–Islamic Relations, or CAIR, is a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group that often sponsors events like the one referenced in the article. On Nov. 10, Tlaib and Wahhaj were both featured speakers at the organization’s 16th Annual Banquet at California State University’s Sacramento campus. ""My appearance at an event does not indicate that I support the views of another person who just so happened to speak there as well,"" Tlaib said in a statement to PolitiFact. Tlaib is the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress and she is one of the first two Muslim women. ""I have always been and remain committed to fighting for the acceptance of every individual no matter who they are or who they love. Throughout my life, I have spoken up for LGBTQ rights and I will continue to do so,"" she added, in regards to the second story’s headline. Besides that speaking engagement, we could find no other connection between the two and the congresswoman said she may have seen Wahhaj at other events, but doesn’t recall any other link to him. A story with the headline, ""Democrat Congresswoman linked to UNINDICTED Terrorist!"" is being spread online about new U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Siraj Wahhaj has certainly been a controversial figure and, according to documents, was considered by authorities to be someone who may have had a connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. But he was never charged and remains a significant figure in the Muslim community. The only connection we could find between Wahhaj and Tlaib is that they were both featured speakers at a November 2018 CAIR banquet in California. While the Columbian Post story contains some truth regarding Wahhaj’s past, the clickbait headlines -- especially regarding a supposed ‘link’ between Wahhaj and Tlaib -- are exaggerated and make it appear more sinister. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/jan/14/blog-posting/does-new-us-rep-rashida-tlaib-have-connection-unin/

Majority of opioids come to U.S. through points of entry, Lowey says
","The federal government’s partial shutdown has amplified disagreements over how best to secure the southern border. U.S. Rep. Nita Lowey, whose 17th Congressional District includes Rockland County and part of Westchester County, contends building a wall would not prevent the influx of opioids to the United States. ""I think there are serious differences about what we should be doing for border security,"" Lowey, a Democrat, told WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer. Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, called the amount of opioids coming through ports of entry a ""real threat."" She said people should know that opioids arrive in the United States through smugglers approaching legal points of entry. ""The facts are, the majority of opioids and all kinds of other things that are connected to the opioids are coming through the point of entry,"" she said. ""They’re not coming with an individual person, maybe some are. But they’re coming in trucks, they’re coming in cars, they’re coming right through the point of entry."" She added later: ""The fence, the wall, the concrete wall that the president is talking about, from most of the experts, doesn’t make a difference."" Given the debate over building a wall along the southern border, and also the lives lost to opioid addiction, we wondered if Lowey is right. Do most opioids come through legal ports of entry and not across the border where President Trump wants to build a wall? Trump, to bolster his case for a wall, at times has said it would stop the flow of drugs. In a 2019 budget memo, the administration stated, ""Building the wall is critical to impeding and denying the flow of illicit drugs into our country."" The southwest border ""remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States,"" according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.   The United States has more than 300 ports of entry, where U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents screen travelers and cargo. Enforcement at these ports of entry, such as airports and shipping facilities, are the responsibility of the Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Field Operations. Enforcement between ports of entry is the responsibility of the CBP’s Border Patrol. People inside and outside government use U.S. Customs and Border Protection data to understand how heroin and other drugs flow into the United States, but it should be noted that the data reflects drug seizures and cannot account for drugs that come in undetected. The Congressional Research Service warned in December that ""data on seizures are available, but these reflect an unknown portion of total drugs traversing U.S. borders."" While we cannot measure the heroin that comes into the country undetected, it should be noted that federal data since at least 2012 have been consistent in showing that agents encounter far more heroin at ports of entry than between ports of entry.  Lowey’s spokesman, Mike Burns, pointed us to enforcement statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to support her claim. The data show that far more drugs are detected at ports of entry than between ports of entry. The Office of Field Operations, working at ports of entry, seized 4,813 pounds of heroin during the first 11 months of fiscal year 2018, through Aug. 31, 2018. During the same period, U.S. Border Patrol, which works between legal ports of entry, seized 532 pounds of heroin. CBP statistics from 2012 through 2017 show similar disparities between heroin seized at ports of entry and heroin seized between ports of entry. The data also show that fentanyl, another opioid, was seized at ports of entry at a higher rate than at points between ports of entry. The Drug Enforcement Agency reports similar findings, noting in its 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment that ""a small percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between ports of entry."" The agency reports that most heroin flows into the nation through privately owned vehicles entering through legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers, where the heroin is co-mingled with legal cargo. ""Body carriers"" account for a smaller percentage of heroin movement across the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the agency. The agency said 85 percent of the fentanyl that came across the U.S.-Mexico border in 2017 entered through the San Diego port of entry. Data and analysis from the drug enforcement and customs agencies have been used by the Congressional Research Service, Cato Institute, and Brookings Institution, among others, to explain the flow of drugs and recommend policy changes.   David Bier, an immigration analyst who writes about border security at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that by saying a ""majority"" of opioids come through ports of entry, Lowey had ""understated the case."" ""By weight, the average port inspector seized 8 times more cocaine, 17 times more fentanyl, 23 times more methamphetamine, and 36 times more heroin than the average Border Patrol agent seized at the physical border in early 2018,"" Bier wrote in an email. ""Given these trends, a border wall or more Border Patrol agents to stop drugs between ports of entry makes little sense,"" Bier wrote in a paper for Cato. The Cato Institute advocates for drug legalization. A 2017 report by Vanda Felbab-Brown, who led the Brookings Institution’s project on global drug policy, used the same statistics and argued that a border wall would not affect the flow of drugs in the United States. Brookings is a public policy think tank that has fellows of different points of view. In early 2018, PolitiFact North Carolina factchecked a related claim from Ann Coulter, in which she tied ""100 percent"" of the opioid epidemic to the lack of a wall, and rated it ""Pants on Fire."" In 2017, PolitiFact National wrote about Trump’s claims about how a border wall would stop drugs from entering the country, and found that much of the illegal drugs coming into the United States come through legal ports of entry. In a conversation about the federal government’s partial shutdown and Trump’s desire for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, Lowey said that the majority of opioids come through points of entry, not between points of entry where a wall would be. Data from Customs and Border Protection and analysis from the Drug Enforcement Agency confirm that when heroin and fentanyl come into the U.S., most come through ports of entry in private vehicles, not between ports of entry.

Mendoza stretches the facts on the commuter tax
","In a recent radio interview, Illinois Comptroller and Chicago mayoral candidate Susana Mendoza took a swipe at rival Bill Daley for suggesting a new commuter tax could be one way to help the financially troubled city pay its bills. Daley didn’t endorse the idea but only said it was worth exploring. Still, Mendoza flatly panned it on WBBM Newsradio. ""Every city that has a commuter tax — look at Detroit, Philadelphia — they are actually stagnating in terms of their economy. It’s been a job-killer,"" Mendoza said. ""This is just, again, going back to an easy well that panders to a public that doesn’t understand the real ramifications of what these ill-fated policies will do."" The sweeping nature of her statement caught our attention. Are commuter taxes effectively desperation moves that are doomed in the long run to hurt the economies of every city that implements them? It should be noted upfront that the term ‘commuter tax’ is a misleading shorthand for an array of revenue-raising schemes that affect not just those who commute to work from outside a city but city residents as well. ""The only thing that term is really conveying is that non-residents also pay the tax,"" said Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Chicago once had what could loosely be referred to as a commuter tax, the so-called head tax, which levied a $4-per-worker monthly charge on larger employers. The fee was imposed regardless of whether a worker lived in or outside of Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel campaigned in 2011 to do away with the head tax, and it was eventually phased out. Other cities with commuter taxes impose them as add-ons to local income taxes, with suburbanites who work in the city sometimes paying the same rate as city dwellers and sometimes getting a discount. That scheme is impossible in Chicago because the state does not allow cities and counties to impose income taxes. Central to Mendoza’s argument is her claim that commuter taxes always backfire. When we reached out to her campaign, spokeswoman Rebecca Evans pointed us to a 2011 Chicago Inspector General report that noted how major cities with commuter taxes such as Detroit, Cleveland and Philadelphia also had stagnant economies. Evans also referenced studies of the commuter tax in Philadelphia that blame it for contributing significantly to job loss there. However, experts we spoke with said it’s a stretch to blame the economic woes of those troubled cities on their commuter taxes alone. Pointing to the decline of Detroit and Cleveland, Auxier said the commuter tax was likely just one factor amid larger manufacturing and population trends sweeping the Rust Belt. It’s possible, he acknowledged, that the tax could have aggravated an already bad situation by helping to nudge businesses and residents out of the city. ""But (the commuter tax is) often a reaction to some of these other, larger issues that are going on,"" he said. Philadelphia’s commuter tax, for instance, was implemented in 1939 as the city sought to avoid bankruptcy in the wake of the Great Depression. Evans told us Mendoza doesn’t claim that in every city with a commuter tax it is the sole source of economic difficulties. But she stuck by her candidate’s claim that cities with such taxes all suffer from economic problems. The problem with that sweeping generalization is that some U.S. cities with commuter taxes are thriving. Denver, for instance, is frequently lauded for its booming economy, despite operating since 1988 under a $9.75-per-worker monthly head tax split between employers and employees. Employment in Denver is up more than 60 percent since 1990, according to census data. The unemployment rate currently sits at 3.3 percent, below the national average. What’s more, the average weekly wage in the Denver metro area, which includes both Denver and its adjacent suburb of Aurora with a similar head tax, ranked 8th highest in the nation in 2017. And Denver added nearly 3,000 new businesses between 2007 and 2016. Louisville, Kentucky, and Columbus, Ohio, are other large, financially healthy cities that impose commuter taxes. ""I think you should always be careful with these taxes, and there’s good reason to not make this your first choice,"" Auxier said. ""But there’s plenty of successful cities that have these taxes."" Mendoza said every city with a commuter tax is stagnating economically under a tax that’s been a job-killer. Mendoza isn’t wrong to point out that commuter taxes carry the risk of discouraging business and employment in a city, and have been proven to do so in select cases like that of Philadelphia. But she didn’t stop there. Instead, she contended that because some cities with commuter taxes are underperforming economically, all cities with such taxes must be doing badly as well. That is simply not the case. We rate her claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

How many 'criminal aliens' were stopped at the border last year?
","Fox News host Sean Hannity pushed back against Democrats who say President Donald Trump’s insistence on building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is nothing more than a ""manufactured crisis."" In an emotional rebuttal, Hannity pointed to a number of incidents in which Americans were killed at the hands of immigrants in the country illegally. He also cited a host of statistics to bolster the case for enhanced border security. ""I wonder if (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi) would tell these families that lost their loved ones that that doesn't really count as real data, that this is a ‘manufactured crisis,’ "" Hannity said. He went on to note that last year, ""17,000 individuals with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the border."" The figure Hannity cited is basically correct. But it’s important to place his claim in a broader context, which is that many of these people had criminal records for previous attempts to enter the United States illegally, or other nonviolent crimes. And, a majority of these people were trying to cross at legal points of entry, so Trump’s wall wouldn’t have made a difference. U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that 17,000 people with criminal records were stopped last year. That’s out of a total of more than 566,000 people apprehended between ports of entries, stopped from coming in at ports of entries and other enforcement actions, or 3 percent. Border security officials are able to determine a non-U.S. person’s criminal history by running their records against CBP’s database of conviction information. Those who register a hit on the system are deemed ""criminal aliens."" CBP defines such persons as having been ""convicted of crime, whether in the United States or abroad"" — so long as the conviction in a foreign court also constitutes a crime under U.S. criminal law. Current data covers fiscal year 2018, except for the final month of September. (The CBP website won’t be refreshed while the government is shut down.) So the final 2018 number is likely to be higher than the current 17,000 figure. Hannity often uses his platform to bring attention to cases where illegal immigrants committed crimes against Americans. So his viewers might assume that violent criminals sneaking across the border make up a large share of illegal immigrants. Certainly some fit this profile. But the vast majority — around 63 percent — of the 17,000 criminal aliens did not try to evade border authorities. Rather, they were stopped after arriving at ports of entry. It’s worth noting that in these cases a border wall would have been of no consequence. The other 37 percent of criminal aliens were nabbed by U.S. Border Patrol. Among this subset, violent offenders made up a small share. Nearly half of the convictions were due to previous attempts to enter the United States illegally. Of the other named crimes, drug offenses and driving under the influence made up the next largest proportions. (CBP states only that ""Other"" includes any conviction not included in the categories above.)    Here’s a breakdown of the types of crimes behind their prior convictions:    Hannity said, ""17,000 individuals with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the border"" in 2018. Broadly speaking, Hannity’s statistic includes people with criminal records stopped trying to come into the United States. But it’s important to note that non-U.S. persons with violent criminal records make up a small share of this population, and many of those people were attempting to enter the country through legal points of entry. They were not trying to sneak across the border. We rate this Half True.",/factchecks/2019/jan/11/sean-hannity/how-many-criminal-aliens-were-stopped-border-last-/

Donald Trump falsely says there's 'never' been so many border apprehensions
","Surrounded by Texas’ Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and by Border Patrol agents, President Donald Trump said people from the Middle East and all over the world were coming through the southern border and that a barrier is needed to prevent them from coming in. He also said there have never been as many apprehensions as there are now. That’s verifiably wrong. ""Whether it’s steel or concrete, you don't care. We need a barrier, and they have done a fantastic job,"" Trump said Jan. 10. ""Never so many apprehensions ever in our history."" His comment came as an effort to sway public and lawmakers’ support for funding for a border wall at the southern border. The federal government is in a partial shutdown as Trump and Democrats in congress disagree over the appropriations of taxpayers’ funds for the wall project. U.S. Customs and Border Protection on its website has southwest border apprehension data going back to fiscal year 1960. In fiscal year 2000, Border Patrol recorded more than 1.6 million apprehensions at the southwest border. How many in 2017? Close to 304,000. In 2018? Just under 400,000. Trump made his remark in McAllen, Texas. McAllen is part of Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley Sector. Were the sector’s apprehensions in 2017 and 2018 the highest ever? No, they weren’t. In 2017, the Rio Grande Valley sector made 137,562 apprehensions; in 2018, it recorded 162,262 apprehensions. In 2014, Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley made 256,393 apprehensions. The latest available monthly data for southwest border apprehensions is for November (part of fiscal year 2019). This past November, Border Patrol recorded 51,856 apprehensions. Is that the highest apprehension number in one November? No. In November of fiscal year 2000, Border Patrol logged 76,196 apprehensions. The Rio Grande Valley Sector recorded more apprehensions in November of fiscal year 2017 than it did in November of fiscal year 2019. By multiple metrics, Trump’s claim doesn’t add up.

Roger Roth incorrectly says lame duck bills didn’t take any power from governor or attorney general
","After taking it on the chin from Democrats in the fall 2018 election, Republicans passed a litany of last-minute bills in December. The lame-duck actions — approved in a special session of the Legislature and signed by outgoing Gov. Scott Walker — changed a variety of things, in many cases giving the GOP-held Legislature control over matters previously left up to the governor and attorney general. Democrats Tony Evers and Josh Kaul unseated Republican incumbents to take over those two offices. They were sworn in Jan. 7, 2019. The lame-duck bills drew criticism from many corners, including former Republican Gov. Scott McCallum and longtime Republican donor and former Walker supporter Sheldon Lubar. Some Republican leaders were up front about their reasoning. For instance, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said without those protections Evers could take actions counter to what Republicans believed in. ""We are protecting some of the public policy that’s been passed through both houses of the Legislature and signed into law over the last eight years,"" Fitzgerald said on WISN-TV’s UpFront with Mike Gousha on Dec. 9, 2018. ""The legislature feels like we need to just maintain a balance (of power) and protect a state that’s in great shape."" But a week later on the same program, another Republican leader — state Senate President Roger Roth — told a very different story. ""The end result here is there will be more legislative oversight in a lot of areas, but no power was taken away from the governor,"" said Roth, R-Appleton. ""Power was not taken away from the attorney general. ""Just some common sense oversight measures put into place."" That’s a very different tune. And a clear and bold claim. Did the lame-duck actions really take away no power from the two incoming Democrats? Asked for backup, Roth spokeswoman Angela Roidt said the powers of the governor and attorney general are spelled out in the state Constitution, and that wasn’t changed. So, she said, their powers were not affected by the bills. But that’s a very narrow and technical view. Merriam-Webster defines power as ""the ability to act or produce an effect."" Roidt also argued the bills only affected ""legislative oversight."" But power and oversight are generally a zero-sum game — if one entity is gaining it, another is losing. The bills signed into law included the following limits on Evers: • Gave the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. board the power to appoint the head of the agency, a power previously given to the governor. This is a temporary move that reverts in September to allow the governor to again appoint the head of the agency. • Gave lawmakers the ability to permanently block state rules written by the Evers administration (these rules are more detailed than state statutes and carry the force of law). As a result, Evers would need lawmakers’ OK to get rid of work and drug screening requirements for public benefit programs. • Required the Legislature’s budget committee to approve certain economic subsidy packages approved by the governor. Walker signed the law implementing this change a day after announcing $28 million in subsidies for Kimberly-Clark, a package that would have to be approved by the budget committee under the new law. • Required Evers to get permission from lawmakers to ban guns in the state Capitol. • Required Evers to get permission from the Legislature before asking the federal government to change programs that are run jointly by the state and federal governments. • Required Evers to go along with a plan seeking to reduce premiums for insurance plans offered through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace for individuals. And the bills included a few limits for Kaul as well: • Allowed legislators to intervene in lawsuits when state statutes are challenged using private attorneys, instead of limiting that intervention to the attorney general’s office. • Gave lawmakers — instead of the attorney general — control over how court settlements are spent. Our ruling Roth said lame-duck laws didn’t take any power away from the incoming governor or attorney general, contradicting even the explanation from other leaders in his party. His camp is promoting a narrow reading of ""power,"" that refers only to the powers laid out in the state constitution. That’s a tremendous stretch that contradicts the dictionary definition. The lame-duck bills transparently limited Evers’ and Kaul’s power on numerous fronts, including appointments, spending and rule-making. Roth’s claim is not only wrong, it’s ridiculous.

Trump says he didn't say Mexico would write US a check for border wall. But he did
","As his border wall fight with Democrats continues, President Donald Trump finds himself in the awkward position of having to explain what happened to the idea that Mexico would pay all the costs. Trump tried to dance out of the apparent contradiction on the White House lawn Jan. 10, the 20th day of a partial government shutdown. ""When during the campaign I would say ‘Mexico is going to pay for it,’ obviously, I never said this, and I never meant they're going to write out a check,"" Trump told reporters. ""I said they're going to pay for it. They are."" Later on the same day while visiting the border in Texas, Trump offered the same logic: ""When I say Mexico is going to pay for the wall, that's what I said. Mexico is going to pay. I didn't say they're going to write me a check for $20 billion or $10 billion."" We’ve seen the president try to say he never said something that he very much said before, so we wondered about this case. Spoiler: Trump has it wrong. We found several instances over the last few years, and in campaign materials contradicting the president’s statement. In an April 2016 memo, Trump’s campaign outlined the steps he could take to get Mexico to pay for the wall. ""It's an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year,"" the memo said. Trump proposed measures to compel Mexico to pay for the wall, such as cutting off remittances sent from undocumented Mexicans in the U.S. via wire transfers. Then, the memo says, if and when the Mexican government protested, they would be told to pay a lump sum ""to the United States to pay for the wall, the Trump Administration will not promulgate the final rule, and the regulation will not go into effect."" The plan lists a few other methods if that didn’t work, like the trade deficit, canceling Mexican visas or increasing visa fees. (Experts have told us there isn’t a connection between the U.S.-Mexico trade deficit and finding money for a wall.) Trump has amended his ""Mexico will pay"" pledge many times, though this is the first day we’ve heard him deny that he once called for a large check. The earliest mention we could find of him pitching a Mexico-funded wall came during a visit to New Hampshire in April 2015 (hat-tip Washington Post). He said he would ""take it out"" of the trade deficit: ""I will take it from out of just a small fraction of the money they’ve been screwing us for over the last number of years."" Then he outlined the lump-sum-in-exchange-for-allowing-remittances idea. As president, he has also thrown out ""reimbursement/other,"" the trade deficit and a ""solar wall"" that would cut down on Mexico’s bill. More recently, including during his border trip, Trump says the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA) trade deal will result in Mexico ""indirectly"" paying for the wall. That argument is also faulty: The deal has not been ratified by each country’s legislature, it lacks new tariffs on Mexican goods coming into the country, and the benefits would go to private businesses. We’ve compiled a number of his mentions here: ""I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."" - Trump presidential announcement speech, June 16, 2015 ""And, you know, we're building a wall. And it's going to be a great wall. OK? And, by the way, Mexico will pay for it."" - CBS Face the Nation, Aug. 23, 2015 ""They said, ‘The president of Mexico said they will not, under any circumstance, pay for the wall, what is your comment?’ I said, ‘the wall just got 10 feet higher.’"" - Tampa rally, Feb. 12, 2016 ""We have a trade deficit with Mexico, that’s why Mexico is going to pay for the wall .. It’s 100 percent … We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year, the wall is going to cost $10 billion. You’re telling me I can’t make that deal? That’s an easy deal.""- Trump press conference, March 8, 2016 ""We’re going to build a wall, we’re going to build a wall. And Mexico, as sure as you’re standing here, Mexico is going to pay for the wall."" - Trump rally in Kansas City, MO, March 12, 2016 ""Mexico will pay for the wall!"" - Trump tweet, Sept. 1, 2016 ""I want to get the wall started. I don’t want to wait a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico … so in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for it, but it’ll be reimbursed."" - Trump press conference, Jan. 11, 2017 ""Ultimately, it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico. We're going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon. And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which I've always said."" - ABC News interview with David Muir, Jan. 25, 2017 ""Well, we're working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route."" - Republican retreat in Philadelphia, Jan. 26, 2017 ""Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall."" - Trump tweet, April 23, 2017 ""We're talking about the southern border, lots of sun, lots of heat. We're thinking about building the wall as a solar wall so it creates energy and pays for itself. And this way, Mexico will have to pay much less money."" - Trump rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, June 21, 2017 ""With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other."" -  Trump tweet, Aug. 27, 2017 ""One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. That’s right. It may be through reimbursement, but one way or the other, Mexico will pay for the wall."" - Joint press conference with Finland President Sauli Niinistö, August 28, 2017 ""I don't want to cause a problem. I don't want to cause it. But, in the end -- in the end, Mexico is going to pay for the wall."" Trump rally in Nashville, TN, May 29, 2018 ""I often stated, ‘One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.’ This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!"" - Trump tweet, Dec. 13, 2018 Trump said, ""When I say Mexico is going to pay for the wall, that's what I said. Mexico is going to pay. I didn't say they're going to write me a check for $20 billion or $10 billion."" Trump’s campaign called a one-time payment of $5 billion-$10 billion ""an easy decision for Mexico."" The country’s other option would be to lose billions more in impounded remittances from immigrants working in the United States and increased fees on U.S. temporary visas and border crossing cards. Trump as president has thrown out a number of other ways for Mexico to pay for the wall. Now he says it will be ""indirect"" through the trade deal (though that’s unsupported).

The same in-state vs. out-of-state distinction holds for the second part of Justice’s assertion -- the number of foster children who are eligible to be legally adopted.

Trump repeats overly simplistic, False claim on California’s wildfires
","President Trump blamed a lack of ""proper Forest Management"" for California’s deadly wildfires in a tweet on Tuesday, repeating his overly simplistic claim about the cause of the infernos that have ravaged the state in recent years. Eighty-six people were killed and 14,000 homes destroyed in November when the Camp Fire tore through Northern California’s Butte County, making it the most deadly and destructive fire in state history. With better forest management, the fires ""would never happen,"" Trump asserted in his tweet. The president also repeated his threat to withhold billions of dollars in federal fire recovery money. ""Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!"" We fact-checked a similar claim in a November Trump tweet and rated it False: ""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,"" Trump charged. We'll review the facts on what causes California's fires, and rate Trump's latest claim. Our research California’s firestorms aren’t caused by just one factor. Instead, climate change, forest management and urban sprawl all contribute, according to forestry, fire and climate experts.    Thinning out forests, setting prescribed burns and clearing brush can help reduce the severity of fires. But California’s stronger winds, higher temperatures and drier conditions, all attributed to climate change, make fires worse. So does the fact that more people and power lines are now situated in forested areas, increasing the chances of sparking an inferno. ""It is a complex situation. Simple pronouncements on a subject like this are almost always in error,"" Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, told us in November. Additionally, Trump’s claim suggests the state controls most forest management decisions. In reality, California owns just 2 percent of forest land in the state while the federal government owns upwards of 60 percent.   The rest is owned by private landowners, timber companies and Native American tribes. Responses to Trump’s tweet California Professional Firefighters President Brian Rice responded in a statement on Tuesday to Trump’s tweet: ""The president’s attempt to pin sole blame for California’s wildfire problems on the state’s forest management is flat wrong. While forest health can be a contributing factor in large fires, more than 60 percent of these forests are controlled by the federal government, not California. And yet, the federal government has cut $2 billion from the US Forest Service even as California has spent more on forest management."" Meanwhile, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents Butte County where the Camp Fire destroyed 14,000 homes and killed 86 people in November, said he shares ""the President’s great frustration with California’s choking regulations from the stranglehold environmental groups have on the state,"" and the need for more forest management. The congressman added, however, ""the immediate problem for fire victims is the first need, and threats to FEMA funding are not helpful and will not solve the longer term forest management regulatory problems."" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the president’s threat, saying on Twitter: ""Mr. President -- Just yesterday, @OregonGovBrown, (and Washington) @GovInslee, and I sent a letter asking the federal government to work with us in taking on these unprecedented wildfires. We have been put in office by the voters to get things done, not to play games with lives."" Our ruling President Trump claimed California’s deadly wildfires ""would never happen"" with ""proper Forest Management.""

Claim about 63,000 Americans being killed by illegal immigrants is still wrong
","As the deadlock over funding of a border wall drags on, an already-debunked claim about the dangers of immigrants is getting new attention. ""On Sept. 11th, 2001 2,996 people died,"" reads a Dec. 31 Facebook post. ""Since 2001, 63,000 of us were murdered by illegal aliens. That’s equal to 21 9/11 attacks."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the claim and, on Jan. 7, Vincent Picard, a deputy assistant director at ICE’s public affairs office, directed PolitiFact to two reports by the agency. According to the fiscal year 2018 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations report, the criminal records of people arrested by ICE for being illegally in the country included 2,028 homicide offenses (387 charges and 1,641 convictions). According to the fiscal year 2017 report, the criminal record of people arrested included 1,886 homicide offenses. Those offenses didn’t necessarily happen during that fiscal year—it just means they were on someone’s arrest record when they were picked up that year. Still, what about the years prior? Picard said he didn’t have anything going back to 2001, but he said there might be more information on a Department of Homeland Security web page about immigration data and statistics. The website has immigration enforcement actions reports going back to 2004, but they don’t mention murder or homicide. Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think-tank, called the number nonsense, and pointed to a June 22 Washington Post article about the claim. Back in June, President Donald Trump said that at least 63,000 Americans had been killed since 9/11. But, the Post reports, the stat dates back to a 2005 blog post written by Rep. Steve King, who ""seems to have basically made the number up … and, since there isn’t good data on the number of crimes committed by people who immigrated illegally, it was embraced by those looking to put a number to it."" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said no one keeps track of murders committed by undocumented immigrants. ""I believe the 63,000 figure is meant to include deaths, not just homicides,"" she said in an email, ""but I don’t know where you are getting these figures."" Neither did we, so we asked others who study immigration to weigh in. ""I can’t think of any evidence that could support a number like 63,000,"" said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute.
