An old hoax about the Clinton Foundation resurfaces on Facebook
","It’s not 2016 anymore. But on Facebook, misinformation is still targeting Hillary Clinton and her family’s charitable foundation. One post published in the form of an image on Nov. 18 claims most of the money the foundation brings in doesn’t actually go to charity. ""They took in $177 million in so-called ‘donations,’ gave ONLY $5 million to charities, spent $85 million for their salaries & travels and KEPT the rest = $87 million,"" the post reads. The image, which has been shared thousands of times, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A popular Facebook image claims the Clinton Foundation only gave $5 million to charity in 2014. We rate it False. (Screenshot from Facebook) This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a claim about the Clinton Foundation’s charitable giving. In 2015, we fact-checked a similar statement from conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. ""Eighty-five percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits,"" he said during his show. ""Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary."" We rated that claim Mostly False. In 2016, we rated  a similar claim False from Reince Priebus.  This case is similarly inaccurate. The Facebook post’s claim is built on the assumption that the primary charitable contributions made by the Clinton Foundation are grants. But that’s not the case. Instead of giving all of its money away, the philanthropy keeps its money in-house and hires people to carry out its own humanitarian programs. That means the Clinton Foundation’s finances get complicated. ""Although it has ‘foundation’ in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity,"" wrote Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, in the Chronicle of Philanthropy in 2015. ""In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment."" What kinds of projects does the foundation work on? The Clinton Development Initiative has helped farmers in Malawi grow and sell more crops and assisted coffee farmers in Haiti. The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership has helped to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia. ""While measuring charitable endeavors by the amount of grants awarded may be appropriate for many private foundations, it is not for an organization that acts as a direct service provider like the Clinton Foundation,"" Mittendorf wrote. The Facebook post took the Clinton Foundation’s tax filings out of context to paint an inaccurate picture of how it spends its money. We looked at both the Clinton Foundation’s 990 tax form and audited financials from 2014. Mittendorf said the latter is a more complete measure of the organization’s finances, as it includes all entities related to the foundation, such as the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Upon first inspection, the numbers in the 990 form look like they affirm the Facebook post. But there’s more to these figures than meets the eye. RELATED: No, Russia did not donate $145 million to the Clinton Foundation First, $177 million is the total revenue for the Clinton Foundation — which includes money from program services and investments, not just donations, as the Facebook post claims. And the group’s 2014 audited financial report puts the group and its related affiliates’ revenue closer to $242 million. Second, the post inflated the importance of the $5 million the Clinton Foundation spent on grants. Since most of the foundation’s work is done in-house, all of its charitable expenses aren’t classified as grants on tax forms.  Charity Navigator, a nonprofit organization that evaluates charities, reported that 86.6% of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses go toward program expenses. The foundation’s audited financials show that it spent $217 million on programs in 2014. And 10.7% of the Clinton Foundation’s money goes toward administrative expenses, according to Charity Navigator. That proportion actually distinguishes the foundation from most other organizations. Third, the Clinton Foundation did not spend $85 million ""for their salaries and travel,"" as the Facebook post claims. The foundation’s audited financials show that it spent about $20 million on travel and $95 million on salaries and benefits in 2014. But not all the money allocated for salaries and travel in 2014 went to the group’s employees — the bulk of it went to program services. About $13 million fell under the ""management/general"" category. The Clintons themselves did not receive compensation from the foundation in 2014, according to the foundation’s 990 form. A Facebook post claimed that, in 2014, the Clinton Foundation only gave $5 million to charity while spending $85 million for salaries and travel. The foundation hires people to carry out its own humanitarian programs instead of giving it all away, meaning its charitable contributions show up as program expenses instead of grants on tax forms. The Clinton Foundation spent $217 million on programs and about $13 million for salaries and travel in 2014.  The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.","[('Charity Navigator, The Clinton Foundation, accessed Nov. 21, 2019', 'https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=16680'), ('Charity Navigator, Glossary, accessed Nov. 22, 2019', 'No link'), ('Charity Navigator, Methodology, accessed Nov. 21, 2019', 'https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=470'), ('The Chronicle of Philanthropy, ""How to Understand the Clinton Foundation,"" June 8, 2015', 'No link'), ('Facebook post, Nov. 18, 2019', 'https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5593#rating'), ('PolitiFact, ""Reince Priebus\' False claim that 80% of Clinton Foundation costs are overhead,"" Aug. 25, 2016', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Rush Limbaugh says Clinton Foundation spends just 15 percent on charity, 85 percent on overhead,"" April 29, 2015', 'https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Opinion-How-to-Understand-the/230745'), ('The Clinton Foundation, ""Facts about the Clinton Foundation,"" accessed Dec. 6, 2019', 'No link'), ('The Clinton Foundation, Full text of ""Form 990"" for fiscal year ending Dec. 2014', 'https://www.facebook.com/AlishaRich2015/photos/a.1075838792428832/2869895029689857/?type=3&theater'), ('The Clinton Foundation, 2014 audited financial statement, Nov. 16, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/dec/09/viral-image/old-hoax-about-clinton-foundation-resurfaces-faceb/

No, Harry Reid doesn’t have a horse thief ancestor named Remus Reid
","A wild tale about a horse thief ancestor of former Democratic Sen. Harry Reid continues to spread online despite being debunked for several years The online story has been circulating since at least 2000, targeting not only Reid but several political figures. Other versions have featured the surnames of President Donald Trump, former President George W. Bush, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore, among others. A Reid version was posted to Facebook in 2013 and is being re-shared recently. The post claims a genealogy researcher named Judy Wallman was working on her family tree when she found that the former senator from Nevada has a great-great uncle, Remus Reid, who was ""hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889,"" and whom Wallman also shared as an ancestor. The post displays a black-and-white photograph that is supposedly Remus Reid standing on a platform as a noose is tightened around his neck. It isn’t him. The image actually depicts outlaw Tom ""Black Jack"" Ketchum, who was hanged in New Mexico in 1901 for attempted train robbery, among other crimes. All versions of this claim end with the politician’s office — in this case, Harry Reid’s office — issuing a statement to Wallman that attempts to spin the life-story of the supposedly criminal ""great-great uncle"" into something more legitimate, calling the ancestor a ""famous cowboy,"" who ""passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Bakersfield has far more jobs in oil than solar, despite Schwarzenegger’s false claim
","Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger likes to boast about his home state’s move to clean energy sources such as wind and solar.  But on Sunday’s Meet the Press on NBC, the GOP politician and climate activist may have gone too far.  Schwarzenegger was on the show promoting World War Zero, a coalition of scientists, politicians and celebrities hoping to bring greater urgency to climate change, ahead of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference.  He said California’s embrace of renewables is evident even in Bakersfield, a city of 380,000 better known for oil derricks and country music than solar arrays and wind turbines.  ""I just want to tell you that, for instance, in California, in Bakersfield, where there’s a lot of oil drilling going on, there’s more solar jobs now in Bakersfield and around that area than there are oil jobs,"" Schwarzenegger claimed. ""People are leaving the oil fields and going to work in solar and clean energy and stuff like that.""  More solar jobs than oil jobs in the Bakersfield area?  We drilled down on a fact check.  Our research  Our reporting, along with a fact check by Bakersfield NBC TV affiliate KGET, calls Schwarzenegger’s specific claim into question. But it also shows renewable energy jobs are growing in the region.  Asked about the claim solar jobs have overtaken oil positions, Kern County spokesperson Megan Person told the station ""we know that not to be true.""  She said the county is home to approximately 2,500 solar jobs, most of which are temporary and tied to construction and installation.  By comparison, it has about 14,000 jobs directly connected to the oil and gas industry, most of which Person said are permanent oil jobs. She said the figures come from private service JobsEQ.  It’s the same amount listed in a 2017 Oil and Gas in California report by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.  Bakersfield is the largest city in Kern County, located south of Fresno and north of Los Angeles. The region, like much of the state, has seen a jump in renewables, but not to a level matching traditional energy jobs.   ""Kern County is seeing a rise in solar installations, and I don’t mean just residential. I mean giant commercial projects,"" Person said, citing a new solar field that will generate 850 solar construction jobs.  ""It could be confusion related to that,"" she continued. ""I don’t know where [Schwarzenegger’s] numbers came from. We can’t substantiate them."" 'It was a mistake'  The former governor’s spokesperson, Daniel Ketchell, told PolitiFact California that Schwarzenegger ""meant to say new jobs. What he said was not meant to mislead. It was a mistake.""  Ketchell clarified that he intended to say the San Joaquin Valley has gained more new clean energy jobs than oil jobs. There’s some evidence for that, but it’s a far different claim than what the governor said on TV. The Valley includes a much bigger area, running from Stockton to Bakersfield, and clean energy goes beyond just solar.  ""Yes, it’s on the rise,"" Carol Zabin, director of the Green Economy Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, said of solar and other clean energy sources. ""The big solar farms are located in various parts of the state. But there’s a concentration in the San Joaquin Valley."" Zabin said the Center does not have figures comparing solar and oil jobs in the Bakersfield area. But in a 2017 study, it reported that California’s clean energy initiatives ""created 88,000 total jobs, including 31,000 direct jobs"" in the San Joaquin Valley from 2002 to 2015.  She added that automation has led to a decrease in some oil and gas jobs in the Valley, though she noted demand for fossil fuels continues to be strong.  Our ruling  Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed there are more solar jobs than oil jobs in the Bakersfield area.  A spokesperson for Kern County said the area’s solar jobs amount to just 2,500 while the oil and gas industry includes 14,000 positions.  Schwarzenegger’s spokesman told us he meant to say the San Joaquin Valley is seeing more new clean energy jobs than oil jobs.

Wisconsin Assembly Speaker's new take on red-flag gun laws still misses target
","Wisconsin state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, has a new take on how red-flag gun laws work. Generally speaking, the laws allow judges to temporarily take guns away from people who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. Republicans and Democrats in the state Legislature have been widely divided on a bill that would create such a law in Wisconsin. Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, called the Legislature into special session to consider a red-flag law proposal and a separate measure expanding background checks to cover all gun sales, but the GOP quickly adjourned the session without taking action on either. In a Nov. 10, 2019 appearance on WISN-TV’s UpFront, Vos told host Adrienne Pedersen:  ""What (Democrats) wanted to do was say, ‘I think you might do something so I’m going to take away your gun and make you prove you wouldn’t do it.’ ""  In other words, the claim is the proposed law would allow a gun to be taken away, and then put the burden of proof on the gun owner to show they are not a threat in order to get the gun back. But that’s counter to one of the basic foundations of the U.S. legal system.  It would be akin to saying someone charged with a crime has to prove their innocence -- not that a prosecutor has to convince a judge or jury of the defendant’s guilt.  Is Vos right? Let’s dig in. Defense misses the mark Asked for backup, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed to the language of the proposed bill that says once an injunction is issued, a judge can vacate it ""if the respondent demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent is no longer substantially likely to injure the respondent or another person if the respondent possesses a firearm."" The language is accurate, but Vos is misapplying it. He argues this standard applies to the process from the beginning, when the language actually refers to a step later in the process, when a gun owner can ask the judge to reconsider the original decision. Joseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University, said the burden of proof is always with the petitioner when it comes to seeking red-flag seizures.  ""What that burden is -- ‘clear and convincing’ or ‘preponderance of the evidence’ -- varies state by state and depending on whether it’s a temporary ex parte order or a final order,"" Blocher told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""But in all cases, a judge has to be persuaded of the risk.""  Indeed, the proposal from Evers would allow guns to be seized if a judge finds ""reasonable grounds that the respondent is substantially likely"" to harm themselves or others. How would it work? The process varies a bit state-to-state, but always begins with a petition to a court that argues an individual is a danger to himself (or herself) or others. Such a petition typically comes from law enforcement officials, but may also come from family members or friends. Under Evers’ proposal, a judge or court commissioner would hear the request and then decide whether to issue a preliminary order without first having to notify or hear from the gun owner. A temporary order is then put in place for up to 14 days.  So, there would be a short period where a gun could be taken before an owner has a say, but with the burden placed on the other party. A judge would then schedule a second hearing to make a final determination. The gun owner would have a chance to be present for this hearing. This is where whomever filed the original petition would make their case. The burden would be on them to convince the judge the gun owner was a danger. The final order would be valid for up to one year, though requests could be made to extend it. Additionally, the gun owner could ask the court for an early end to the order This is the step the language Vos cited actually refers to. It is then -- when a gun owner is seeking an early end to an order -- that the burden of proof would fall on the gun owner. Laws are relatively new The first red-flag law was put in place in Connecticut in 1990, but it wasn’t until 2005 that the second law was approved in Indiana. Following the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., many other states passed similar laws. Now, at least 17 states and Washington D.C. have a red-flag law in place.  Each state allows law enforcement to seek the removal of guns, while 12 states also allow family or household members to do so.  A handful of states also allow petitions from medical professionals, colleagues or school officials, according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and gun control advocacy organization.  There are already several spots in Wisconsin law that relate to when guns can be taken. Under current law, a person is prohibited from having guns or must surrender their firearms if they’re ""subject to a domestic abuse injunction, a child abuse injunction, or, in certain cases, a harassment or an individuals-at-risk injunction."" If the person surrenders a firearm because of one of those convictions, the firearm can’t be returned to them until a court determines that the injunction has been vacated or has expired, according to a November 2019 analysis by the Legislative Reference Bureau. The law also says people must surrender their firearms as a result of certain proceedings, such as mental health commitments and restraining orders.  Our rating Vos said of red-flag laws: ""What they wanted to do was say I think you might do something so I’m going to take away your gun and make you prove you wouldn’t do it."" The laws in effect now, and the proposal in Wisconsin, would allow guns to be taken away temporarily, until a full court hearing is held. However, Vos is far off when it comes to where the burden of proof falls when a judge is considering a seizure request.  Experts say it would fall on the person seeking the seizure  -- not the gun owner.  We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('WISN-TV, ‘UPFRONT’ recap: Assembly Speaker says governor is playing politics with special session, Nov. 10, 2019', 'https://www.wisn.com/article/upfront-recap-assembly-speaker-says-governor-is-playing-politics-with-special-session/29731550'), ('PolitiFact, Do red flag laws allow gun seizure without a judge’s OK?, Oct. 28, 2019', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin Legislative Council, Firearm Possession ""Red Flag"" laws, issue brief, Oct. 2019', 'https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2019/oct/28/robin-vos/do-red-flag-laws-allow-gun-seizure-without-judges-/'), ('PolitiFact, Wisconsin firearms coalition misfires with claim against Evers, Kaul and Vos, Jan. 29, 2019', 'No link'), ('Giffords Law Center, ERPO procedures by state, Sept. 10, 2019', 'https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lc/issue_briefs/2019/firearms/ib_red_flag_laws_ao_2019_10_01'), ('Gov.

Does West Virginia rank sixth in the nation in at-risk youth?
","Woody Thrasher, a Republican who is challenging West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice in the 2020 GOP primary, took to Twitter to call out the state’s level of at-risk youth on his opponent’s watch. ""‘West Virginia is sixth overall in the average number of at-risk youth.’ Let’s turn this around and grow our workforce by supporting post-secondary training programs. #TimeToGetToWorkWV #wvpol,"" Thrasher tweeted. “WV is 6th overall in the average number of at-risk youth...”Let’s turn this around and grow our workforce by supporting post-secondary training programs. #TimeToGetToWorkWV #wvpolhttps://t.co/seTT9ZhXgO Here, we won’t address whether or how much post-secondary training programs can help at-risk youth. Instead, we’ll focus on the credibility of his statement that ""West Virginia is sixth overall in the average number of at-risk youth."" There are certainly warning signs about West Virginia’s youth, many of them traceable to the opioid crisis. We have rated as True the statement that West Virginia ""has the highest overdose rate per capita of any state in our nation."" The drug epidemic is ""the driving force in (the) child welfare crisis,"" the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said in a statement in February 2018. The department said that the opioid crisis has made it difficult to help get children back on their feet and is making them more prone to mental-health issues.  But how does West Virginia compare nationally? In his tweet, Thrasher linked to a July 18 editorial in the Exponent-Telegram newspaper of Clarksburg. The editorial includes the exact sentence Thrasher quoted, and it says the source is the most recent edition of an annual survey by the website WalletHub. Thrasher’s campaign also confirmed to PolitiFact West Virginia that the WalletHub survey was the source. As Thrasher indicated, the WalletHub report does show West Virginia ranking sixth in at-risk youth, behind Louisiana, the District of Columbia, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Nevada.  The website determined the overall rankings by weighting 15 different metrics. They include the population aged 18 to 24 years who are not attending school, not working and have no degree beyond a high school diploma; the labor force participation rate, the poverty rate, and the homelessness rate for the population aged 16 to 24 years; the rate of teen pregnancy; the percentage of those under age 21 who are detained in residential facilities in the criminal justice system; and the percentage of youth who are overweight, who use drugs, who have alcohol problems, or who have clinical depression. We reached out to several of the academic advisers to the WalletHub study. The only one to answer us was Rigaud Joseph, an assistant professor of social work at California State University San Bernardino. However, Joseph said that he ""did not have any statistical input in the study. WalletHub decided on the criteria for the rankings."" So we turned to independent experts, who said that WalletHub’s study was credible. ""The WalletHub methodology seems fine and it generates a credible ranking of states,"" said Gary Natriello, a professor of educational research, sociology, and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. ""Other rankings would be possible if different combinations of indicators were used, but West Virginia would likely be among the states with the most at-risk youth, as Thrasher’s statement suggests."" Thrasher said that ""West Virginia is sixth overall in the average number of at-risk youth."" He is correctly citing a study by the website WalletHub that came up with its ranking by using 15 metrics on youth health, employment, and education. An expert said this is a reasonable way to compare states against each other, though it’s hardly the only way; the use of other data points or weighting of the factors could produce somewhat different rankings.

Is West Virginia short of 20,000 skilled workers its economy needs?
","Is West Virginia falling significantly behind in the job skills required for today’s economy? West Virginia University President E. Gordon Gee said so in an address to students at Musselman High School in Berkeley County. ""In West Virginia, we have 20,000 jobs in which we don’t have skilled workers,"" Gee told students at the high school.  Gee’s office told PolitiFact West Virginia that they could not point to the original source of the statistic. However, we were able to reverse-engineer data that falls short of Gee’s number. This gets a bit complicated, so bear with us. Here’s the overall concept. First, we’ll estimate the total number of job openings in West Virginia that require skilled workers. Then we’ll look into how hard these jobs are to fill, based on the educational shortcomings of West Virginia’s workforce.   On the job openings side, Brian Lego, a research assistant professor at WVU’s College of Business and Economics, suggested we look at data produced on an experimental basis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s chief agency for employment statistics. This data in question is a spinoff of the longstanding Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, which produces monthly estimates of job openings, hires, and employee departures on a national basis. For several years, the bureau has also produced an experimental study of this data on a state-by-state basis, which is what Lego was referring to. We looked at the most recent data for West Virginia, which covers the first six months of 2019. We found that in each of those six months, West Virginia had 38,000 job openings. (BLS acknowledges that this is an estimate, though the agency says it isn’t sure what the margin of error is.) This 38,000 figure represents all job openings in West Virginia -- not necessarily those requiring advanced skills. However, we found a way to estimate the percentage requiring advanced skills, using data in a report published by Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce. The report is from 2010, but it offered projections for the share of jobs in every state by 2018 that would require various levels of educational attainment, so it should offer a rough guide. For West Virginia, the report said, 9% of jobs would be open to high school dropouts, 38% would require a high school degree, 12% would require some college but not a college degree, 15% would require an associate’s degree, 17% would require a bachelor’s degree, and 8% would require a master’s degree or higher. All told, the Georgetown data sees 25% of jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree or higher. And 25% of 38,000 job openings in West Virginia works out to 9,500 job openings in any given month that require a bachelor’s degree.  This 9,500 figure refers to the number of high-skill job openings in West Virginia -- the demand side. What about the supply side -- the share of West Virginia workers who have the necessary skills to fill those jobs? We found a way to estimate that number, too.  Statistics from the U.S. Education Department show that in 2016, about 21% of West Virginians age 25 and up had a bachelor’s degree. Meanwhile, in October 2019, West Virginia had 38,052 unemployed workers.  If one assumes that this group of unemployed workers is a representative cross-section of the state’s educational attainment patterns, this would mean there are just under 8,000 unemployed West Virginians who could fill a job requiring a bachelor’s degree. But in reality, better-educated workers tend to be more likely to be employed, meaning the actual number of unemployed workers with a bachelor’s degree is probably well below 8,000.  Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told PolitiFact West Virginia that a reasonable guess is probably 4,000. So of the 9,500 West Virginia job openings requiring a bachelor’s degree, qualified workers who are currently unemployed could potentially fill a 4,000 of those. That leaves 4,500 bachelor’s-level jobs unfilled.  And that’s quite a bit smaller than Gee’s 20,000 figure. We should emphasize that our estimates involve a lot of moving parts, each with a source of statistical error. We also focused on bachelor’s-level jobs. If we were to instead define ""skilled"" positions as requiring at least some college experience, the supply of skilled jobs could go as high as 53%, according to the Georgetown University data. That works out to 21,400 jobs requiring advanced skills, rather than 9,500. Using this broader number could make Gee’s figures closer to accurate. Finally, we should note that in the Georgetown comparison, West Virginia ranks 51st in the nation -- dead last among the 50 states and the District of Columbia -- in the percentage of jobs requiring advanced skills. So West Virginia may require advanced skills to fill many of its jobs, but the pressure to fill these advanced-skill jobs is weaker in West Virginia than it is in every other state. ""Gee's argument could have been better supported by focusing on the deficit of college educated workers in West Virginia compared to the rest of the U.S. -- 21% versus 31%,"" Sinclair said. ""That seems to be a really big problem. That might actually be the driver of West Virginia’s ranking in terms of jobs requiring college degrees: Employers go where the workers are."" Gee said, ""In West Virginia, we have 20,000 jobs in which we don’t have skilled workers."" Gee has put his finger on what experts say is a genuine concern for West Virginia -- the mismatch between educational attainment and skills requirements for job openings -- but he’s overestimated the specific figure. He was unable to back up this figure, and when we tried to come up with an estimate, we found that the number is probably around 4,500. We rate his statement Half True.","[('Register-Herald, ""West Virginia programs provide promise,"" June 21, 2019', 'https://www.register-herald.com/opinion/editorials/west-virginia-programs-provide-promise/article_e04252fe-7c31-5087-8dab-96bc32cf2928.html'), ('West Virginia Department of Education, ""Survey of Employer Skill Needs,"" March 2019', 'No link'), ('Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, ""Help Wanted: Projections of Jobs and Education Requirements Through 2018,"" June 2010', 'https://wvde.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/WVDE-Survey-of-Employer-Skill-Needs-FINAL.pdf'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""JOLTS Experimental State Estimates,"" accessed Dec. 5, 2019', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""JOLTS Experimental State Estimates Methodology,"" accessed Dec. 5, 2019', 'https://1gyhoq479ufd3yna29x7ubjn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/fullreport.pdf'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey: Frequently Asked Questions,"" accessed Dec. 5, 2019', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment statistics for West Virginia, accessed Dec. 5, 2019', 'https://www.bls.gov/jlt/jlt_statedata.htm'), ('National Center for Education Statistics, ""Table 104.85: Rates of high school completion and bachelor\'s degree attainment among persons age 25 and over, by race/ethnicity and state: 2016,"" accessed Dec. 5, 2019', 'No link'), ('Register-Herald, ""Skills gap cited as challenge for W.Va.,"" Sept. 1, 2017', 'https://www.bls.gov/jlt/jlt_statedata_methodology.htm'), ('Email interview with Tara Sinclair, economist at George Washington University, Dec. 5, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Brian Lego, research assistant professor at WVU’s College of Business and Economics, Dec. 5, 2019', 'https://www.bls.gov/jlt/jltprovq.htm')]",/factchecks/2019/dec/06/e-gordon-gee/west-virginia-short-20000-skilled-workers-its-econ/

Walker: Mexican border state as dangerous as Syria
","A North Carolina Congressman appears to support President Trump’s move to designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups. U.S. Rep. Mark Walker, a Greensboro Republican, tweeted a thank you to President Trump on Nov. 27. ""Thank you @realDonaldTrump. These cartels endanger Americans and threaten our country’s national security. The problem is so bad that @StateDept issued a ""Do Not Travel"" advisory to a Mexican state that has a 230m border with the US–the same designation as Syria,"" Walker tweeted.  Walker, who has 26,000 Twitter followers, tweeted his comments in reaction to a story about the U.S. designating drug cartels as terrorist groups. But Walker’s claim — about a Mexican state having the same travel warning as Syria — isn’t addressed by the New York Times story he tweeted.  So we wondered whether the claim by Walker was true. And, from our research, he’s on-point. We analyzed Walker’s claim in three parts: Did the U.S. government issue a ""Do Not Travel"" advisory for a Mexican state? Did the U.S. government issue the same travel advisory for Syria?  And how long is that Mexican state’s border with the U.S.? Travel advisories The State Department labels the safety levels in foreign countries using a four-step scale: 1- Exercise normal precautions. 2- Exercise increased caution. 3- Reconsider travel. 4- Do not travel. The State Department considers Mexico as a whole to be a Level 2 country, meaning travelers should ""exercise increased caution."" The department also assigns advisory levels to individual states. Five states are at the ""do not travel"" level: Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas. A ‘lawless’ border state Only one Level 4 state, Tamaulipas, shares a border with the United States. And it is known for being dangerous. The Associated Press has described the Tamaulipas as a ""lawless border state."" The state department website says this about the area:
""Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common. Gang activity, including gun battles and blockades, is widespread. Armed criminal groups target public and private passenger buses as well as private automobiles traveling through Tamaulipas, often taking passengers hostage and demanding ransom payments."" As it turns out, Tamaulipas has the same travel advisory as Syria.  Length of the border Walker’s tweet about the length of the border — 230m — might give readers pause. The letter ""m"" is an abbreviation for a meter of length. A meter is about 39 inches. So, at first glance, one might think Walker was referring to a border slightly longer than two football fields. But, given the U.S. isn’t on the metric system, it’s more likely that Walker was referring to miles. And indeed that was the case, according to spokesman Jack Minor.  (Quick fact: the correct abbreviation for a mile is ""mi,"" according to Dictionary.com.) Asked for the source of Walker’s information, Minor emailed a link to a 2012 McClatchy DC story, ""Along Mexico border, drug taint on politicians lingers."" The second paragraph describes Tamaulipas as ""a muggy Gulf Coast state that shares a 230-mile border with Texas and is a major conduit for licit and illicit trade."" And that length estimate checks out. A page found on the Mexican government website describes the Tamaulipas-U.S. border as being 370 kilometers, which is equal to 230 miles. Our ruling Walker said Mexican cartels are so bad that the U.S. ""issued a ‘Do Not Travel’ to a Mexican state that has a 230m border with the US–the same designation as Syria."" That state is Tamaulipas. It has the same ""Do Not Travel"" advisory warning as Syria. And the border is roughly 230 miles long. We rate this claim True.","[('A tweet by U.S. Rep.

Ives wrongly calls Casten’s public town halls ‘invite-only’
","Before Republican Jeanne Ives can challenge freshman Democrat Rep. Sean Casten for his 6th District Congressional seat, she has to win her party’s primary in March. But that hasn’t stopped Ives from focusing her attacks squarely on Casten, who flipped the once ruby-red west suburban district blue in 2018. Ives, a former state lawmaker from Wheaton, Ill., made a name for herself the same year by nearly defeating then-incumbent Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the GOP primary. Several months ago, when Rauner’s former lieutenant governor was also vying for the chance to oust Casten, Ives claimed her conservative opponent had not denounced a controversial bill that expanded public funding for abortions. We rated that False. Now, Ives is making a baseless claim about her Democratic foe. ""His numerous (invite-only) town halls don't make up for a failure to take action to save jobs & protect independent biz,"" Ives wrote in a tweet about Casten. The press release attached to that tweet repeated that claim, and included a link to another one she published in October, which explained what she meant. ""Rep. Sean Casten announced a series of town halls that are invite only. Tickets required,"" that release stated. But it linked to a public eventbrite page advertising a series of town halls Casten held on Oct. 5 to which anyone could book a ticket for free by providing a name and email. So we reached out to Ives’ campaign to find out whether the congressional hopeful had any evidence showing only those who received some kind of invitation to Casten’s town halls were allowed to attend. Neither she nor her staff responded to our repeated calls and emails. We also contacted Casten’s team to learn more about how people can participate in the congressman’s town halls. Spokeswoman Chloe Hunt said they use the online sign-up as a way to track attendance. ""It’s all first come, first served, it’s all posted online,"" she said. ""There’s no additional vetting. It’s literally just if you sign up."" Even those who don’t sign up can still attend if there is enough space, Hunt added. Getting a ticket simply reserves their spot at the events, which are advertised online ahead of time. Casten posted on Facebook and tweeted about the series of town halls Ives focused on several days before the events took place, inviting readers to RSVP at the same eventbrite link. His office also sent out an email the day before to his subscriber list. All told, Casten has held 20 town halls this year, according to Hunt. They are live-streamed on Facebook so those who can’t make it can follow along virtually. What’s more, it’s clear participants with views different from Casten’s were able to attend his October events. A report from Politico on Casten’s town hall marathon describes several heated exchanges between the congressman and constituents. In one, he was taken to task for labeling Trump’s immigration policies ""racist."" In another he was pressed to ""push back"" against progressive House Democrats, including New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar, whom the speaker referred to as ""crazies."" Ives said Casten has held numerous ""invite-only"" town halls. But her own press release on the subject makes clear she was referring to a public event page the congressman’s team created that allowed anyone interested in attending to reserve a seat for free.

Fact-checking Donald Trump on libel law and prison
","At a NATO summit in London, President Donald Trump took aim at one of his adversaries back across the pond: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a key figure in the inquiry into impeaching the president. Trump has repeatedly referred back to the time when Schiff paraphrased Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — an event at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.  Trump has portrayed Schiff’s words as a fabrication that twisted what he said, but Schiff prefaced his remarks by saying they were not verbatim but were rather ""the essence of what the president communicates"" and ""in sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate."" In a press conference at the NATO summit, Trump once again attacked Schiff over his remarks, suggesting that Schiff could be arrested for what he said. ""This guy (Schiff) is sick,"" Trump said. ""He made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn't do that in the halls of Congress, he'd be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he's given immunity. This is a sick person. He's a liar."" We found it hard to believe that, outside of the walls of Congress, someone who fabricated and lied would be ""thrown in jail."" Experts said there is something to what Trump is saying that deserves explanation, but ultimately he’s still wrong that Schiff could be subject to prosecution, even if he wasn’t in Congress. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Trump has a point that members of Congress have special speech protections that members of the general public do not. The Constitution’s ""Speech or Debate Clause"" says that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, (Senators and Representatives) shall not be questioned in any other Place."" It aligns with the Constitution’s determination that the House, and not another branch of government, should have the power to sanction its own members for abuses. ""The Speech or Debate Clause protects legislators from all criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits for legislative conduct, broadly understood as anything within the sphere of legitimate legislative activity and necessary to the deliberative process,"" said Howard M. Wasserman, a law professor at Florida International University. ""This includes the sort of legislative oversight and investigation in which Schiff is engaged when discussing that phone call."" There are limits. In the 1979 Supreme Court decision Hutchinson vs. Proxmire, the justices ruled that Sen. William Proxmire was not immune from civil or criminal challenge made in a press release or constituent newsletter. ""But the clear implication is that the same statements, had they been made on the Senate floor or in a committee hearing, would have been immune,"" Wasserman said. The vast majority of libel or slander cases are civil rather than criminal, said Leonard Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor. This means the speaker’s money could be at risk if they lose a libel or slander case, but they would not be imprisoned. However, criminal libel laws of one kind or another do exist on the books in almost half the states. According to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Committee to Protect Journalists, two dozen states have criminal libel laws.  The Supreme Court ruled in the 1964 case Garrison vs. Louisiana that the standard for criminal conviction is the same as in the landmark case from the same year, New York Times vs. Sullivan, that addresses civil libel cases. ""The prosecution must prove falsity and actual malice, beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Wasserman said. Some of today’s 24 state laws wouldn’t be relevant to the Schiff example. The laws in Illinois and Texas only cover slanders against financial institutions, while the one in Massachusetts concerns hate speech based on race or other classifications. Three others specifically exclude imprisonment as a possible sentence. (The states that do set maximum prison sentences top out at one year, possibly including fines.) In addition, the Committee to Protect Journalists cites court cases in seven of these states that would seem to make these laws unconstitutional today, meaning that their existence on the books is archaic. Even the states that have criminal libel laws rarely use them. ""As a general proposition, prosecutors have vastly better things to do with their time that pursue charges of criminal libel,"" Niehoff said. In addition, such laws ""would likely be deemed unconstitutional under the First Amendment if they were applied,"" said Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. Importantly for Schiff’s case, there’s no criminal libel statute for the District of Columbia, or an equivalent federal statute. Nor is there one in Schiff’s home state of California.  ""So even if Schiff's summaries of the conversations were knowingly false and he were not immune, I am not sure what law he could be prosecuted under,"" Wasserman said. Trump said Schiff ""made up the conversation. He lied. If he didn't do that in the halls of Congress, he'd be thrown in jail. He did it in the halls of Congress, he's given immunity."" It’s an exaggeration to say Schiff ""made up"" a conversation.

In the jurisdiction where Schiff spoke — the District Columbia — such law doesn’t exist. Nor does it exist in federal law or in the law of his home state of California.

Geithner's 'common' tax error
","
In the efforts to dismiss Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy Geithner's tax problems as a little more than an embarrassing speed bump on the way to confirmation, supporters have repeatedly characterized his tax error as a common one.


Barack Obama made a just such an argument in Geithner's defense on Jan. 14.


""Look, is this an embarrassment for him? Yes,"" Obama told reporters. ""He said so himself. But it was an innocent mistake. It is a mistake that is commonly made for people who are working internationally or for international institutions. It has been corrected. He paid the penalties.”


Here’s the quickie background: The IRS audited Geithner in 2006 and found that he failed to pay self-employment taxes on compensation he received as an employee of the International Monetary Fund for tax years the IRS was looking at, 2003 and 2004 (by law, the IRS could not audit him for years before 2003). So Geithner paid $16,732 in back self-employment tax, plus interest. The IRS waived penalties for those years.


Then in late 2008, when Obama made known his intention to nominate Geithner to his Cabinet, the presidential transition team vetted Geithner and discovered a few more problems in Geithner's tax returns, including the fact that in addition to not paying self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, he also didn't pay them for 2001 and 2002. So in December 2008, Geithner voluntarily amended his tax returns for those years and wrote a check to the IRS for another $25,970. His nomination followed immediately after.


The question here is whether Geithner's failure to pay self-employment taxes related to his employment at the IMF was a common problem.


By some accounts, it can be confusing for IMF employees to figure out their tax obligation. As an international organization, the IMF is exempt from the FICA and Social Security taxes that most Americans get deducted from their paychecks automatically. U.S. nationals who work for the IMF in the United States are required to pay them on their own, and do so by filing as self-employed taxpayers.


""It is a strange situation,"" said the Tax Policy Center's Eric Toder, who admitted that he has struggled trying to figure out his own tax obligation when he did some consulting work for the IMF.  ""You wouldn't know from looking at the tax forms what you are supposed to do.""
 
Some Republicans note, however, that the IMF gave ample documentation to its workers about what they should do. The Senate Finance Committee overseeing Geithner's confirmation hearing posted several documents given to Geithner by the IMF designed to help employees understand their tax obligations.
 
For one, there's the IMF Employee Tax Manual given to new hires, which describes how to pay self-employment taxes. The IMF pays additional money to U.S. employees, on top of their regular salary, to offset self-employment taxes, and quarterly and year-end wage statements include the amount of self-employment taxes added to wage income. Lastly, IMF employees are required to annually file a form requesting the self-employment ""gross ups"" to wages.
 
Still, said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, ""the rules are just really complicated. I suspect this really was just an honest mistake.""


The Obama campaign hangs its argument that Geithner's was a ""common mistake"" on a Nov. 17, 2006, document in which the IRS estimates that as many as half the employees of foreign embassies, foreign consular offices and international organizations who are subject to U.S. tax ""either fail to report their wages, claim deductions they are not entitled to, incorrectly establish SEP/IRA retirement plans, fail to pay self-employment tax or fail to file tax returns at all.""


The IRS offered a one-time settlement to these employees to pay up, with interest. No penalties would be levied, and the IRS said the employees would not be required to pay beyond three years back.


Geithner's audit came before that settlement, but since the deal specifically includes employees of international organizations (like the IMF) failing to pay self-employment taxes (as was the case with Geithner), Obama would seem to be on firm footing.


But does that 50 percent estimate apply to IMF employees specifically?
 
William Murray, a spokesman for the IMF, doubts it.
 
""There has been no indication of widespread noncompliance by IMF employees,"" Murray said.
 
There's no question the tax obligations for IMF employees can be confusing, particularly for new hires, Murray said.
 
""Mistakes happen,"" he said ""But not paying taxes? That is not common.""
 
It's extremely rare for the IRS to garnish an IMF employee's wages due to failure to pay taxes, Murray said. But other than those being garnished, the IMF has no way of knowing how many others are misreporting their taxes. Geithner's audit, for example, would not have triggered any notification to the IMF, he said.
 
Bottom line: It's impossible to know exactly how many, or what percentage, of the IMF's employees fail to pay their self-employment taxes. You might argue that even if half of the employees at international organizations (IMF or any other) failed to pay self-employment taxes, you would hope the guy heading up the U.S. Treasury would be among the 50 percent to get it right.
 
Nonetheless, the IRS did generally flag employees of international organizations failing to pay self-employment taxes as a problem area. So we think Obama was on pretty firm gound when he called it common. And so we rate his statement Mostly True.

Geithner's second crack at squaring taxes
","
Honest mistake. That's the line from the Obama team about the tax problems that have sparked controversy about treasury secretary nominee Timothy Geithner.


The IRS audited Geithner in 2006 and found that he failed to pay self-employment taxes on compensation he received as an employee of the International Monetary Fund for tax years the IRS was looking at, 2003 and 2004. By law, the IRS could not audit him for years prior to 2003.


So Geithner paid $16,732 in back self-employment tax and interest. The IRS waived penalties for those years. As far as the IRS was concerned, case closed.


Fast forward to late 2008. The Obama transition team began to vet Geithner in preparation for Obama nominating him to his Cabinet. The transition team found a few problems in Geithner's previous tax returns, including the fact that in addition to not paying self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, he also didn't pay them for 2001 and 2002.  So last month, Geithner voluntarily amended his tax returns for those years and wrote a check to the IRS for another $25,970. His nomination followed immediately after.


Some opponents of Geithner's nomination find this second payment particularly troubling.


""Treasury Secretary Nominee Timothy Geithner's failure to pay four years’ worth of self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare is absolutely astonishing,"" John Berlau, director of the Center for Investors & Entrepreneurs at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in a news release on Jan. 14, 2009. ""And as more details are released, Geithner's actions seem even more disturbing. According to the New York Times, Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years. To have him leading the department that manages the IRS would be a slap in the face to the millions of self-employed Americans who fulfill their responsibilities to correctly asses their tax burdens.""


Berlau's organization is a conservative think tank ""dedicated to the principles of free enterprise and limited government."" His criticism is typical of those who are opposing Geithner's nomination.


By some accounts, it can be confusing for IMF employees to figure out their tax obligation. As an international organization, the IMF is exempt from the FICA and Social Security taxes that most Americans get deducted from their paychecks automatically. U.S. nationals who work for the IMF in the United States are required pay them on their own.


But let's put aside for the moment the issue of whether Geithner should have known he was obligated to pay the self-employment taxes (Republicans have correctly noted that Geithner got ample documentation from the IMF informing him of his tax obligation). There's still the issue of the 2001 and 2002 taxes that Geithner didn’t pay until the presidential transition team pointed it out.


First off, tax experts say that due to a statute of limitations, Geithner was under no legal obligation to pay the taxes related to 2001 and 2002. The IRS could only go back three years. So Geithner was legally in the clear.


But considering that the IMF pays extra money to U.S. employees, on top of their regular salary, to offset those self-employment taxes, some have questioned whether Geithner had a moral or ethical obligation to square up with the government. After the IRS pointed out in 2006 that Geithner had not paid his self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, it stands to reason Geithner would then have known that he also didn’t pay in 2001 and 2002.
 
""You have to ask yourself, 'Would you do it?'"" asked Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center.
 
That's an issue the Senate Finance Committee overseeing Geithner's confirmation hearing will have to weigh.
 
But as for Berlau's statement that Geithner ""still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years,"" Berlau is right. Geithner didn’t make good on the previous years until he learned he was in line to be treasury secretary. We rule the statement True.

Tax cuts for rich not biggest deficit factor
","
At a news conference on Jan. 8, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was asked about the U.S. budget deficit.


The reporter noted that the Congressional Budget Office projected a relatively small deficit in 2012 if the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of 2010 and tax rates go back to what they were during the Clinton administration.


""You face a major decision next year on tax rates, since the rates do expire at the end of 2010,"" the reporter said. ""Isn't it inevitable that many taxpayers will face a significant tax increase in 2011?""


""Let me just say that the tax cuts at the high end that you were referencing have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit,"" Pelosi said. ""Don't take my word for it, that's the word of the Congressional Budget Office when the Republicans had control of the Congress.""


She continued, ""Put me down as clearly as you possibly can as one who wants to have those tax cuts for the wealthiest in America repealed,"" adding that it should happen ""as soon as possible."" She cited the same cutoff point that Barack Obama used during the campaign: Taxes should go up for people making about $250,000 or more.


Pelosi was clear about her position, but we wondered about her assertion that the Bush tax cuts ""at the high end"" were indeed ""the biggest contributor to the budget deficit.""


When we started this item, we thought it would be relatively straightforward. How wrong we were.


We should start off with the easy stuff: First, there is no CBO report that says tax cuts for the wealthiest are the biggest contributor to the deficit.


We asked Speaker Pelosi's office about her statement, and they pointed us to the left-leaning

Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Congressional Budget Office data show that the tax cuts have been the single largest contributor to the re-emergence of substantial budget deficits in recent years,"" said the center's analysis.


It also created a

handy pie chart

that shows tax cuts are responsible for 48 percent of the costs of new legislation between 2001 and 2007. This is second to military spending, the Iraq war and homeland security spending, which together contributed to 35 percent of legislative costs.


But that didn't satisfy us, because that 48 percent number included all tax cuts, not just for the wealthy. It also shows only the costs of new legislation, not the overall deficit.


So we went asking around: For what part of the deficit are tax cuts at the ""high end"" responsible?


""The real problem is that the deficit is a composite of revenues and spending. You can't say where we would be if we hadn't had any part of that,"" said Bob Williams, the principal research associate of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. (He also worked for the Congressional Budget Office from 1984 to 2006.)


Having said that, Williams said it's very unlikely that overall tax cuts for the wealthy outpaced the tax cuts for everybody else.


So what is ""the high end""? During the campaign, Barack Obama called for repealing the tax cuts on singles making $200,000 or more and couples making $250,000 or more. This is roughly the top 3 percent of taxpayers.


The Tax Policy Center analyzed that plan and found that if Obama raised the rates on that group, it would generate roughly $350 billion over 10 years. Conversely, leaving in place the Bush tax cuts for everyone else would come to $850 billion over 10 years.


Another way to look at it: The Tax Policy Center calculated what share of the federal tax changes each income bracket gained from the Bush tax cuts. The top 5 percent of earners (those making about $225,000 or more) received 30.5 percent of the tax benefits in 2008, according to their analysis. But conversely, the bottom 95 percent of tax payers got 70 percent. Zoom out from the top 5 percent to the top 20 percent, and their share is 47.8 percent. Critics of the Bush tax cuts can call that disproportionate, but it's still less than half and therefore not ""the biggest.""
 
All of this indicates that Pelosi is mistaken. Although the wealthy did get big benefits from the Bush tax cuts, their benefits did not outweigh those of everyone else put together.


Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan nonprofit group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said there are three major contributors to the worsening budget picture presented by the Congressional Budget Office: tax cuts, the Iraq war and the economic downturn.


""Within the tax cuts, the largest numbers went to the middle class, and those are the tax cuts that are most likely to be extended,"" she said. ""I don't see how you could read the numbers to say otherwise.""


Certainly tax cuts for high earners have increased the deficit. Pelosi might have made a more convincing case if she had said high earners received a disproportionate benefit from the Bush tax cuts.
 
But Pelosi said tax cuts for ""the high end"" were the ""biggest"" contributor to the federal deficit. We looked at the numbers from a bunch of different angles and found no evidence that tax cuts for the wealthy are larger than those of everyone else combined. In fact, all the numbers we looked at showed that tax cuts for middle and lower incomes represent a bigger slice of the overall revenue pie. We think that evidence directly contradicts her, so we rate her statement False.

Surgeon General is more than spokesman, oversees public health
","
President-elect Barack Obama's widely reported intention to appoint Sanjay Gupta, a 39-year-old neurosurgeon and CNN reporter, as the nation's surgeon general has drawn flak from several directions.
 

Gupta is known primarily for his work as a TV reporter, though he's clearly identified as a medical doctor. A number of commentators have attacked Gupta's health care reporting for criticizing Michael Moore's film

Sicko

in a segment on CNN. A blogger at Gawker joked that Gupta must have beat out Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Some advocates of the Commissioned Corps, a team of federal health workers led by the surgeon general, say the job should go to someone who rose through the ranks.
 

Defenders of the choice, including former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean, and the consumer advocates at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, have cited Gupta's communication skills.
 

Here's how Dean put it in a Jan. 7, 2009, appearance on MSNBC's

Hardball

:
 

""I think he's a great appointment,"" Dean told host Chris Matthews. ""I'll tell you why he's a great appointment. The biggest job of the surgeon general is to translate health care and health care needs into plain English that people can understand, ordinary people can understand. That's what Sanjay Gupta has been doing for a living for quite a while.""
 

Communication is indeed a major part of the job. Surgeons general have long held the symbolic post of the ""nation's doctor,"" offering advice on smoking cessation, obesity, AIDS prevention and a host of other public health issues through speeches, news conferences, congressional testimony and formal reports.
 

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under which the surgeon general serves, lists this sort of public outreach as the first of seven official duties of the surgeon general.
 

In congressional hearings about the nature of the position in 2007, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said ""he or she should be the health educator for Americans par excellence."" A subsequent surgeon general, David Satcher, said the office has evolved since its inception in 1873 but ""what has not changed about the Surgeon General’s Office is its direct responsibility for communicating with the American people based on the best available science, and its responsibility for responding to public health emergencies.""
 

So yes, by job description, tradition and widespread consensus, the surgeon general is the medical communicator in chief, you might say.
 

But that's not the whole truth.
 

The surgeon general also oversees the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, 6,000 uniformed public health workers assigned to other government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. His administrative duties over the corps are limited, to be sure, because the positions are funded and the officers overseen day-to-day by the heads of the agencies to which they're assigned. But he sets standards for the corps, has significant administrative responsibilities and serves as the group's titular leader.
 

More significant is the surgeon general's customary responsibility to represent the federal government on various elite boards and commissions. Past surgeons general have sat alongside national and global health experts at the National Library of Medicine, the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization, for example. In these settings, medical gravitas would seem to matter far more than mass-communication skills.
 

But most importantly, Dean glossed over a crucial component of the public outreach part of the job — you have to know what to say. Surgeon generals don't just present public health initiatives, they craft them. Surgeon generals' reports — the landmark example of which is Smoking and Health, the 1964 report in which the government first spelled out to the public that smoking causes lung cancer — are generally years in the making.
 

""It's not like you just sit down and write this report,"" Richard Carmona, who served as the 17th surgeon general, from 2002 to 2006, said in a telephone interview. ""They take a long time and they only happen if you have the credibility and knowledge to extract this information properly. You're working with people at the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, you're looking at heart science, clinical science — your credibility comes in. Your peers have to respect you and see you as a nonpartisan arbiter of the best science.""
 
Gupta is a practicing neurosurgeon and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine, and he writes a column for

Time

magazine in addition to reporting for CNN. We'll leave it to Congress and others to decide whether that qualifies him to be surgeon general.
 
And if Gupta does get the position, he and Obama have a certain amount of latitude to make of it what they like.
 
But being doctor to the nation has traditionally involved more than just advising it on health issues — you have to check up on it first. Surgeon general is a public health position, not a public affairs position. Communication may be the ""biggest part of the job"" in a sense, but many other medical and administrative skills are required.
 
We find Dean's statement Half True.

Warren on gay marriage and incest
","
One of the first controversies faced by freshly elected Barack Obama came with his selection of evangelical Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his Jan. 20 inauguration.
 

Although viewed by some as a moderate, Warren's outspoken support of California's recently passed Proposition 8 — which amended the state constitution to ban gay marriage — angered some in Obama's liberal base, particularly those who support gay marriage.
 

In the days after Obama announced that Warren would deliver the invocation, one of the popular sound bites coming from opponents was an accusation that Warren recently likened gay couples to incest.
 

Leading the charge was U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is openly gay.
 

""Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest,"" Frank said in an interview on CNN's

Late Edition

on Dec. 21, 2008. ""I found that deeply offensive and unfair.""
 

Frank repeated his objections to Obama's pick during an interview with MSNBC the following day: ""I think Rick Warren's comments comparing same-sex relationships to incest is deeply offensive, wildly inaccurate and very socially disruptive.""
 

The comments Frank is referring to come from an interview Warren gave in mid December to Steven Waldman, editor in chief of Beliefnet.
 

Context is the critical thing here, so we'll provide a generous helping of Warren's statements to give you a complete view:


Waldman: Do you support civil unions or domestic partnerships?

Warren: I don't know if I'd use the term there. But I support full equal rights for everybody in America. I don't believe we should have unequal rights depending on particular lifestyles, or whatever stuff like that. So I fully support equal rights.

Waldman: What about partnership benefits in terms of insurance or hospital visitation?

Warren:  ""Not a problem with me ... I'm not opposed to that as much as I'm opposed to the redefinition of a 5,000-year-old definition of marriage. I'm opposed to having a brother and sister be together and call that marriage. I'm opposed to an older guy marrying a child and calling that a marriage. I'm opposed to one guy having multiple wives and calling that marriage.""

Q: ""Do you think those are equivalent to gays getting married?""

A: ""Oh, I do. For 5,000 years marriage has been defined by every single culture and every single religion...as a man and a woman.""


We'll note here that Warren's statement about the 5,000-year history of marriage seems wrong on its face, given that several cultures and religions have accepted polygamy. But we're not rating that statement here, just the allegation that he compared gay couples to incest.


On the one hand, Warren did throw out examples of brothers and sisters marrying (incest) or an adult marrying a child (pedophilia) in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage. But they were cited as examples of unions outside his definition of marriage. And he agreed that same-sex couples would be another.
 

Warren did not, however, compare ""same-sex relationships to incest"" or say they are similar. He only said they all fall outside his definition of marriage. That's an important distinction.
 

In fact, Warren noted that he is okay with partnership benefits for same-sex couples. Later in the interview, Warren noted that he has ""many gay friends. I've eaten dinner in gay homes. No church has probably done more for people with AIDS than Saddlebrook Church. Kay (his wife) and I have given millions of dollars out of the

Purpose Driven Life

helping people who got AIDS through gay relationships. So they can't accuse me of homophobia. I just don't believe in the redefinition of marriage.""
 

For his part, Obama opposes gay marriage, though he supports extending ""full and equal rights and benefits to same-sex couples under both state and federal law."" And Obama opposed Proposition 8, calling it ""divisive and discriminatory.""
 

While noting that he differs with Warren on some issues, Obama defended Warren's selection, saying, ""During the course of the entire inaugural festivities, there are going to be a wide range of viewpoints that are presented. And that's how it should be, because that's what America is about.""
 

Frank agreed that ""everybody should speak, and there could be a dialogue."" But, he said, ""giving that kind of mark of approval and honor to someone who has frankly spoken in ways that I and many others have found personally very offensive, I thought that was a mistake for the president-elect to do.""
 

You can argue the appropriateness of Obama's choice, and you can argue the appropriateness of Warren citing examples of incest in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage, but Frank distorts Warren's words when he says Warren ""compared same-sex couples to incest."" He didn't. He just cited them as types of relationships that should not be eligible for marriage. We rule his comment Barely True.

Group says Warren called some Christians Marxist
","
President-elect Obama's selection of evangelical Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration drew sharp rebuke from some of Obama's liberal supporters due to Warren's hard line against abortion and gay marriage.
 

Warren, senior pastor of the evangelical Saddleback Church in Southern California and author of the bestselling

The Purpose Driven Life

, is viewed in many circles as a social moderate, but he is on the outs with many liberal groups due to his outspoken support for California's recently passed Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to ban same-sex marriages.
 

Among the groups that expressed ""grave disappointment"" over Obama's inclusion of Warren at the inauguration was People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group.
 

In a news release issued on Dec. 17, the organization warned that despite an ""affable personality and his church's engagement on issues like AIDS in Africa,"" Warren has ""promoted legalized discrimination and denigrated the lives and relationships of millions of Americans.""
 

The organization attributes several recent statements to Warren to back its contention that Warren is more of an extremist than many people know.
 

""He has recently compared marriage by loving and committed same-sex couples to incest and pedophilia,"" the release states. And, ""He has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists.""
 

We looked at the contention that Warren ""has recently compared marriage by loving and committed same-sex couples to incest and pedophilia"" when U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., made similar comments (see PolitiFact statement ""Warren on gay marriage and incest"").
 

Here, we'll look at the claim that Warren ""has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists.""

The statements come from an interview of Warren in mid December by Beliefnet editor in chief Steven Waldman.
 

In the interview, Warren sought to provide historical perspective for the split between main-line Protestants and evangelicals a century ago. As with the incest comment, the Warren comments in question come in the middle of a fairly long quote to make a larger point, so bear with the lengthy excerpt, because we think context is critical.
 

 ""Along about the beginning of the 20th century there were some Protestant theologians who started using the term 'social gospel,' "" Warren said. ""And what they meant by that was, 'We don't really need to care about Jesus' personal salvation any more. We don't really have to care about redemption, the cross, repentance. All we need to do is redeem the social structures of society and if we make those social structures better, the world will become a better place.' Really, in many ways, it was just Marxism in Christian clothing. And it was in vogue at the time. If we redeem society then man will automatically get better. It didn't deal with the heart. And so they said, we don't need this personal religion stuff. So Protestants split into two wings. The main-line Protestants — Methodists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians — said, ‘We're going to take the body, and we're going to care about poverty and disease and charity and social justice and racial justice. And the evangelicals and fundamentalists ... said ‘We're going to take the soul and we're going to care about personal morality and pornography and protecting the family and personal moral issues and personal salvation.' Who's right? Well, in my opinion, they're both right. And part of my desire as a leader is to bring these two wings back together.""
 
 
 
Warren did liken the social agenda of some early 20th century Protestant theologians to ""Marxism in Christian clothing."" But Warren is referring to the ideas and agendas of theologians at a time when socialism and Marxism were part of the national dialogue. To put Warren's comment in the present tense — saying Warren ""has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists"" — is a serious distortion of his comment.
 

And we note that Warren concludes his thoughts by saying he believes both positions are right, and that he'd like to bring both wings together. We rate the People for the American Way's characterization of Warren's comments Barely True.

Big Three hourly wages inflated
","
In the debate over the bailout of the American auto industry, one number seemed to stick in the craw of a reluctant public: the oft-quoted figure that manufacturing workers at America's Big Three automakers — Ford, Chrysler and General Motors — make $75 an hour; some $30 more than nonunion workers at so-called ""transplant"" auto companies, like the U.S. plants of Honda and Toyota.
 

""My initial problem justifying these loans to the Big Three is when I speak to my constituents, and it is a fairness issue,"" said U.S. Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., a ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee during a hearing on the auto industry in November. ""The vast majority of my constituents are not making anywhere near what General Motors, Chrysler and Ford pay their employees.""
 

""Even with recent changes, the average hourly wage at General Motors is still $75 an hour,"" Bachus said. ""That's 50 percent, 100 percent or, in some cases, three or four times what my constituents are making.
 

""My constituents do not understand why their taxpayer dollars should go to support what they consider less efficient businesses.""
 

Who could resist doing the math?
 

Let's see ... $75 an hour, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks in a year ... $156,000 a year! And they want a taxpayer bailout?
 

Except the number isn't right.
 

In the case of GM (cited by Bachus), the wage for a traditional line worker is actually $29.49 an hour, according to GM spokesman Tony Sapienza. That comes to an annual salary of around $61,300. Comfortable, sure, but a far cry from $156,000.
 

According to Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, which tracks these things, the typical hourly wage for union employees at the Big Three is about $28 an hour. Wages at the nonunion transplant companies range from $14.60 to $28 an hour, she said. Wages vary even among different plants of the same companies, depending on regional wage standards. For example, Toyota pays $27 to $30 an hour at its plant in Kentucky, but just $20 an hour at a Mississippi plant.
 

""You can't just say that a transplant wage is this and that the Detroit Big Three is that,"" Dziczek said.

Let's factor in benefits.
 

According to Dziczek, in addition to making about $28 an hour, Big Three autoworkers gets benefits worth about $23. Add in overtime, vacation pay shift bonuses, health insurance, pension payments and other compensation, and it comes to about $62 an hour in labor cost per active employee. The cost for wages and benefits at transplant companies is about $40 to $55 an hour.
 

""They're not terribly far off,"" Dziczek said.
 

But Bachus and other congressmen who have cited similar hourly numbers didn't just pluck them out of thin air. What they are citing is an ""all-in"" labor cost for hourly wage employees. That ""all-in"" cost includes all pay and benefits to current employees. But here's the kicker: It also includes health benefits paid to retired workers.
 

Consider this: At the end of 2007, GM had 365,000 retired hourly employees, as opposed to 62,000 active hourly employees.
 

""We are a 100-year-old company,"" said Sapienza. ""We have significant obligations to retirees. We have stuck by our commitment. It does pose a competitive disadvantage.""
 

Among all the Big Three, Dziczek said, there are four retirees for every current worker.
 

Paying health benefits to those workers is a huge obligation that the transplant companies just don't have, as they just haven't been around long enough to have that many retirees. All of the transplants have many more workers than retirees, she said.
 

So while the cost of retiree benefits is not part of the compensation for active employees, it is a labor cost borne by the automakers. And so auto companies calculate the entire expense of hourly employees — including retirees — and then divide that whole sum by the number of current employees. For GM, that comes to $69 an hour, according to Sapienza. Other figures from the Big Three have put that figure just north of $70 an hour. That's where Bachus got his number.
 

There's one other major factor to consider. In 2007, the United Auto Workers union — which represents laborers at the Big Three — negotiated a historic deal that calls for a new voluntary employee benefit association that will allow the Big Three to contribute a one-time cost and subsequently allow the unions to run the health care benefits program of retired autoworkers. That will allow the companies to wipe out their health care obligations to retirees.
 

In addition, the unions agreed to a two-tiered pay system such that new (second-tier) hires will start at about $14 an hour. According to a Ford analysis presented to Congress, when the ratio of new, second-tier workers reaches about 20 percent of the overall work force, the difference between hourly labor costs at the Big Three and the transplant auto companies will nearly disappear.
 

Still, this much is true in the arguments posed by Bachus: Autoworkers generally make more than other manufacturing workers.
 

According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (November 2008), the average hourly earnings (wage only) for automobile production workers was $30.27 compared to $17.91 for all manufacturing production workers.
 

Auto workers are the kings of the industrial labor force, Dziczek said, and that surely breeds some resentment — particularly when it comes to talking about a taxpayer-funded bailout.
 

That might be a legitimate point to make, but when Bachus and others cited a figure suggesting Big Three autoworkers make more than $70 an hour, it is not only misleading, it's just wrong. That figure is a labor cost that includes the expense of health benefits for retirees. We rate the statement False.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Stimulus', 'Mitch McConnell']","
Postal Service employs just over 600,000
","President-elect Barack Obama has used a lot of big numbers when it comes to a major stimulus bill to jolt the economy back to life. The bill has to be big if it's going to work, Obama has said. ""Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don’t act swiftly and boldly, we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment and the American Dream slipping further and further out of reach,"" Obama said during a radio address on Jan. 3, 2009. The next day on the Sunday morning show  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  , Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell sounded a cautionary note, saying that Republicans will carefully vet Obama's plans. ""We want to make sure it's not just a trillion-dollar spending bill, but something that actually can reach the goal that he has suggested,"" McConnell said. Stephanopoulos countered, ""So how do you do that?"" McConnell: ""Well, let me make some suggestions. First of all, the incoming president, has said he would like for 80 percent of the jobs created to be in the private sector. Well, do we really want to create 20 percent of the jobs in the public sector? That would be 600,000 new government jobs. That's about the size of the post office work force. Is that a good idea? That's something that strikes us that we ought to take a look at."" Stephanopoulos: ""You don't think it is?"" McConnell: ""Well, it may not be, but I think, at least, hearings, and some kind of bipartisan considerations would be helpful."" We wondered two things: whether McConnell was accurately characterizing Obama's plan for public sector jobs, and whether that would result in an additional work force rivaling the size of the U.S. Postal Service. It turns out McConnell was right in his characterization of Obama's plan. Obama said in the radio address from the day before that ""the No. 1 goal of my plan"" is to ""create 3 million new jobs, more than 80 percent of them in the private sector."" To us, that seems like 20 percent of the jobs could then be in the public sector. Simple math tells us that 20 percent of 3 million is 600,000. Granted, Obama's words clearly allow some wiggle room. Maybe more than 80 percent would be in the private sector, reducing the number of public sector jobs. Nevertheless, the 80 percent minimum sounds like a benchmark to us. Obama also says that the jobs will be ""new,"" which means they will be additions to the current work force. So when McConnell says that Obama wants to add ""600,000 new government jobs,"" that sounds like a fair reading of Obama's words. Then McConnell added, ""That's about the size of the post office work force."" The number of U.S. Postal Service employees is in that ballpark. But you can crunch the numbers a few different ways. In its year-end report for 2008, the postal service reported that it employed 663,238 career employees as of Sept. 30, 2008. It also employed an additional 101,850 temporary or part-time workers, which would bring its total to 765,088. The Postal Service says that it’s the second-largest employer in the United States after Wal-Mart, which employs 1.4 million in the United States, though that number includes many part-timers. Getting back to the postal comparison, McConnell is not far off with his comparison if you count only the 663,238 career employees. If you included the temporary workers, the margin of difference becomes more significant. But we suspect Obama wants to create full-time jobs with benefits, not add temporary or part-time workers. So we offer a few minor caveats to McConnell's statement. Obama implied he would create 600,000 new public-sector employees at most, and the postal service is just a little bit bigger than 600,000. But McConnell is largely correct in what he says. We rate his statement Mostly True.  UPDATE:  Obama offered new job numbers for his stimulus plan during his weekly radio address on Jan. 9, 2009. His economic advisers believe the stimulus plan will create between 3 million and 4 million jobs, with at least 90 percent in the private sector, Obama said. The advisers' report estimates that 3.675 million jobs will be created, and that 244,000 of those will be government jobs — a much lower number than the size of the U.S. Postal Service. But McConnell was correct at the time he made his statements, so our ruling stands.","[('Barack Obama transition team Web site, ""  American Recovery and Reinvestment  ,"" (weekly radio address), Jan. 3, 2009', 'http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/american_recovery_and_reinvestment/'), ('ABC News, ""  This Week with George Stephanopolous  ,"" (transcript), Jan. 4, 2009', 'No link'), (' U.S. Postal Service Annual Report  , 2008', 'https://abcnews.go.com/print?id=6573506'), ('Wal-Mart,  Corporate Fact Sheet  (pdf download)', 'No link'), ('Update: Barack Obama transition team Web site, ""  The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan  ,""Jan. 9, 2009', 'https://www.usps.com/financials/_pdf/annual_report_2008.pdf'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('\xa0', 'http://walmartstores.com/download/2230.pdf'), ('\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2009/jan/05/mitch-mcconnell/postal-service-employs-just-over-600000/

The McCain campaign experiments with dishonesty
","
(Published Oct. 27, 2008)
 
Sen. John McCain's campaign has seized on Sen. Barack Obama's offhand remark that he wants to ""spread the wealth around"" to allege Obama is a socialist.
 
Even in the context of a heated presidential campaign, that's a remarkably incendiary accusation. It's become a standard part of the McCain campaign rhetoric, uttered by surrogates and candidates alike.
 
Gov. Sarah Palin's remarks in Springfiled, Mo., are a good example: ""Senator Obama says that he wants to spread the wealth, which means — you know what that means,"" she said at a rally on Oct. 24, 2008. ""It means that government takes your money, (handed) out however a politician sees fit. Barack Obama calls it spreading the wealth, and Joe Biden calls higher taxes patriotic. And yet to Joe the Plumber, he said it sounded like socialism. And now is not the time to experiment with socialism.""
 
She has repeated the line in Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado and most recently in Leesburg, Va., on Oct. 27, 2008. It consistently evokes boos and jeers from a crowd protective of the American system of government.
 
But is Palin stoking their anger honestly?
 
Socialism refers most commonly to a system in which the government owns the means of production and distribution of goods. That is, the state truly is responsible for creating and spreading the wealth. Let's look at the root of Palin's claim — Obama's Oct. 12, 2008, exchange with plumber Samuel J. Wurzelbacher, who has come to be known simply as Joe the Plumber — and see if that's what Obama was suggesting.
 
Wurzelbacher approached Obama on the street in his Holland, Ohio, neighborhood, and said he was close to buying a plumbing company that makes $250,000 to $280,000 a year. He complained that Obama would tax him more, punishing his success.
 
Obama responded that he was raising the top tax rate so he could decrease taxes for those who make less than $250,000.
 
""It's not that I want to punish your success,"" Obama said. ""I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success too.""
 
""Seems like you would be welcome to a flat tax then,"" Wurzelbacher said.
 
""You know, I would be open to it except for here's the problem with a flat tax,"" Obama countered. ""You'd have to slap on a whole bunch of sales taxes on it. And I do believe that for folks like me who have worked hard but, frankly, also been lucky, I don't mind paying just a little bit more than the waitress who I just met over there who — things are slow, and she can barely make the rent. Because my attitude is if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's going to be good for everybody. If you've got a plumbing business, you're going to be better off if you've got a whole bunch of customers who can afford to hire you. And right now, everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody. And I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.""
 
So when Wurzelbacher brought up a flat tax, Obama responded by endorsing progressive taxation – the principle of taxing those with higher incomes at a higher percentage than those with lower incomes. And it is in that context that Obama said he wanted to ""spread the wealth.""
 
Progressive taxes do indeed spread the wealth a bit. But they do so much more modestly than government owning the means of production.
 
Few serious policy makers — including McCain — consider progressive taxation socialist. In fact, on the Oct. 26, 2008 edition of NBC's

Meet the Press

, McCain stood by a comment he made in 2000 that ""there's nothing wrong with paying somewhat more"" in taxes when you ""reach a certain level of comfort."" 
 
""You put into different, different categories of wealthier people paying, paying higher taxes into different brackets,"" McCain told host Tom Brokaw, as if to say progressive taxes are a no-brainer.
 
Indeed, progressive taxation has been a cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863. It was based on the Tax Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed, and which imposed a ""duty of three per centum"" on all income over $600, and five percent on income over $10,000.
 
Obama's proposed top tax rate of 39.6 percent, (up from today's 36 percent) is considerably higher than that. But it's not particularly high in the context of modern times; as he pointed out to Wurzelbacher, it's about what top earners paid in the Clinton years. In 1987, the top tax rate was 38.5 percent. In 1944, it was 94 percent for the highest portions of high incomes.
 
So no, Obama's tax increase on those making more than $250,000 would not represent a transformation of the U.S. system of government. His desire to ""spread the wealth"" through progressive taxation makes him no less a capitalist than McCain, or Lincoln. Palin's allegation that Obama wants to ""experiment with socialism"" seems designed less to inform than to inflame. That's Pants on Fire wrong.

No, McCain's ads haven't all been negative
","
(Published Oct. 15, 2008)
 
One of the more pointed exchanges between Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain in the third and final debate on Oct. 15, 2008, was over the topic of negative ads.
 
Here’s how one exchange went:
 
Obama: ""And 100 percent, John, of your ads — 100 percent of them have been negative.""
 
McCain: ""It’s not true.""
 
Obama: ""It absolutely is true.""
 
(You can find the exchange on the YouTube version about 26:30 into the debate.)
 
Obama appears to be cherry-picking the ads run during a single week — from Sept. 28 to Oct. 4 — during which the Wisconsin Advertising Project found ""nearly all"" of McCain’s ads were negative. That week, they found that 34 percent of Obama’s ads were negative.
 
But McCain has aired many, many ads that were not negative. If you look at a report from the same organization on Sept. 17, they found that in the week after the conventions, for example, Obama aired a higher percentage of negative ads than did McCain (76 percent to 56 percent). 
 
In all, the Wisconsin Advertising Project has found that 73 percent of McCain’s ads have been negative, to date. That's far short of 100 percent. (It also found 61 percent of Obama’s ads have been negative.)
 
That’s up for both parties from the 2004 election, when 64 percent of George Bush’s ads were negative, compared to 34 percent of John Kerry’s.
 
So Obama might be right for one week, but he is way off for the overall campaign, when McCain's negative ads accounted for 73 percent. That's so far off that we find it Pants on Fire wrong.

A player, but not the captain

From the start of his presidential bid, Democratic nominee Barack Obama has touted ethics as a major campaign theme. He barred lobbyists and corporate political action committees from contributing money to his campaign, for example, and fairly or not he's repeatedly assailed his Republican rival's ties to lobbyists. 


But the Illinois senator's oft-repeated theme that he led the effort to pass ethics reform legislation in the Senate last year is much exaggerated, as

we pointed out last spring

.
 
Obama's 30-minute infomercial made the claim again on October 29, 2008, quoting Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. ""He's changed the rules in Washington,"" McCaskill said during the half hour campaign commercial that ran on major broadcast networks and cable channels. ""Gone are the free gifts from lobbyists. Gone are the fancy airplane rides for nothing. He did that.""


It's clear what McCaskill is referring to here: the 2007 ethics reform law that Congress passed and President Bush signed in the wake of the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal.


And to be sure, Obama backed the 2007 law, which barred gifts from lobbyists and required that a senator flying on a corporate jet reimburse the plane's owner at the full charter rate. (Senators didn't previously fly free, as McCaskill claims, but rather were required to pay whatever a first class ticket on a commercial airline would have cost for the same route.)


But Obama was not the leading player on the new law. Obama was most active on the issue a year earlier, when he was tapped by Democratic party leaders in early 2006 to lead the party's efforts on lobbying reform in the wake of the scandal created by Abramoff, a longtime Washington lobbyist for Indian tribes who pleaded guilty in January 2006 to conspiring to bribe members of Congress.


Obama proposed setting tougher rules for the disclosure of earmark requests and creating an outside ethics office, staffed with independent monitors, to evaluate complaints against senators.


But Obama was not pleased with what the Senate came up with and in March 2006 he was one of just three Democrats to vote against legislation, which ultimately passed 90-8, by then-GOP Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi that would have made it more difficult to add earmarks to spending bills, required members of Congress to wait two years after leaving public office to lobby their former colleagues and banned gifts from lobbyists.


Obama said Lott's bill was not tough enough. In the end, the House and Senate were not able to reconcile their differing versions of the legislation and Lott's bill died.


When Democrats took control of both chambers in January 2007, they moved quickly to pass ethics reform legislation, but most of the legwork was done by Obama's Democratic colleagues, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. They negotiated the final legislative language and moved it through both chambers in defiance of skeptical Republicans.


During the 2007 debate, Obama was a less central player than he had been in 2006. Though he supported the gift ban, he was not its most vocal backer.


In 2007, he continued to push, unsuccessfully, for an independent ethics office and, with Democratic colleague Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, drafted the provision on corporate jets that was ultimately incorporated into the final bill. On that score, then, McCaskill is right.


But to imply Obama was the leading force behind the 2007 ethics law goes too far. For that reason, we rate McCaskill's statement Half True.

Obama knows McCain's intentions better than McCain?
","
(Published Oct. 20, 2008)
 
Though both presidential candidates have spoken at length about how they would change the American health system, they’ve carefully avoided offering many specifics about Medicare, the government’s huge health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.

 

For good reason: Medicare is financially unprepared for the surge of retiring baby boomers, meaning future administrations and Congresses will have to consider making tough tradoffs, like cutting benefits or raising taxes. That’s hardly the kind of stuff a politician would willingly highlight in stump speeches or on a campaign Web site.

 

It is the sort of thing you just might accuse your opponent of favoring. And Barack Obama in recent days has tried to do just that, portraying John McCain’s health plan as filled with looming spending cuts for Medicare’s nearly 45-million beneficiaries.

 

""It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth. $882-billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived health care plan, even as Medicare already faces a looming shortfall,"" Obama said in an Oct. 17, 2008, speech in Roanoke, Va. He repeated the charge the next day, in St. Louis, declaring that under McCain’s plan, “you would have fewer places to get care, and less freedom to choose your doctors.  You’ll pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower quality care.”

 

The Obama campaign also has turned the charge into a TV ad. Obama might be hitting hard on a sensitive topic, but in the process, he’s offering more specifics about McCain’s plan than McCain has.

 

The $882-billion in cuts Obama cites comes from an analysis of McCain’s plan by the Center for American Progress Fund, a left-leaning think tank headed by John D. Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Clinton. The analysis, in turn, is based on an estimate by the independent Tax Policy Center that finds McCain’s overall health plan would cost the government $1.3-trillion over 10 years — a figure the McCain campaign doesn’t dispute.

 

Because McCain’s campaign says the health plan would be “budget neutral” — meaning it would be paid for by savings from Medicare and Medicaid — the Center for American Progress automatically assumes the savings would come from cuts to the big health programs. The center performed a series of calculations to determine how much McCain would have to reduce both programs’ projected spending growth, and concluded McCain would have to pare the program by roughly 13 percent over a decade, or $882-billion.

 

All fine, except that McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps. McCain’s senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin has talked about further policy changes, including extending tax credits so some low-income Americans wouldn’t have to enroll in Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. But he has stressed that the cost of these changes could be covered without cutting benefits or services.

 

McCain’s campaign responded to Obama's Roanoke remarks, saying the Democratic front-runner was committing “Medicare malpractice” and spreading lies by perpetuating the Center for American Progress Fund analysis.

 

It’s unclear whether McCain could extract sufficient savings using the methods he’s outlined to achieve his ""budget neutral"" goal. Still, the Center for American Progress Fund analysis flatly assumes McCain will cut Medicare benefits and services when McCain has not even broached the idea in speeches or statements. Obama is overstepping by repeating the analysis’ conclusion and portraying the dollar amount of the cuts as part and parcel of McCain’s plan. We rule his claim False.

McCain is further back than Gore was
","
(Published Oct. 24, 2008)
 
Sen. John McCain's chief strategist sought to downplay his candidate's deficit in the polls, comparing the current election to a contest so close it ended up in the Supreme Court.
 
""The McCain campaign is roughly in the position where Vice President Gore was running against President Bush one week before the election of 2000,” Steve Schmidt, McCain’s chief strategist, was quoted as saying on the front page of the Oct. 23, 2008

New York Times

. “We have ground to make up, but we believe we can make it up.”
 
The same day's

Washington Post

front page featured a similar argument by unnamed McCain advisers: ""Advisers believe the contest's margin is in the five-to-seven-point range, about the same deficit, they say, that then-Vice President Al Gore faced at this time eight years ago against then-Gov. George W. Bush,"" the paper reported.
 
Because Schmidt was so specific in the

New York Times

with his ""one week before the election"" comparison, we'll start there. Election Day 2000 was Nov. 7. A week prior would be Tuesday, Oct. 31. Let's see how Gore was doing in the polls around that time.
 
We averaged the results of the five polls we could find released right around Nov. 1 – three different tracking polls for ABC News

,

CBS News and CNN

/USA Today

/Gallup, as well as surveys from MSNBC/Reuters/Zogby and Pew Research Center – and found Bush at 46.8 percent to Gore's 43.
 
Those polls included third-party candidate Ralph Nader. Data from political scientists Christopher Wlezien from Temple University and Robert Erikson from Columbia University on the averages of all major polls show Gore trailing by 3 points in a two-man contest with Bush seven days before the election.
 
So Gore trailed by about 3 to 4 points a week before the 2000 election. How does that compare to how McCain is doing now?
 
As of early afternoon on Oct. 24, 2008, three Web sites that each average a wide array of national polls, Pollster.com, Realclearpolitics.com and Fivethirtyeight.com, had McCain down 8.2, 7.4 and 7.2 points respectively – about twice the deficit Gore faced.
 
""Obviously they (the McCain campaign) are simply looking at the map through red-colored glasses,"" said Larry Sabato, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia.
 
There are, to be sure, isolated polls that bode well for McCain. For example, a recent Associated Press poll had Obama at 44 percent and McCain at 43 percent, essentially a tie, given the 3.5 percentage point margin of error.
 
But that poll is so out of line with most others that experts largely discount it. ""Bad polls happen and you shouldn't get too excited about one unusual poll,"" said Charles Franklin, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and co-developer of Pollster.com.
 
Averages are far more trustworthy, Franklin said.

This chart

he compiled of polling trends from 2000, 2004 and 2008, shows vividly the dramatic gap between how McCain was doing as of Oct. 4, 2008, and how Gore was doing in 2000. (Franklin provided us an updated version of the chart by e-mail; the gap has since narrowed only slightly.)
 
Franklin also checked his data for the span of the past two weeks, a wider time frame than the snapshot we looked at above to cover the comment to the

Washington Post

about how the campaigns compared ""at this time."" He found: ""This year, Obama leads during these two weeks by an average of 7.1 points. In 2000 the Bush lead was an average of 3.1 points.""
 
Again, McCain's deficit is more than double Gore's.
 
We don't mean to suggest that McCain can't come back and win the election. The question we sought to answer was this: Is McCain running in about the same position that Gore was at this point in the 2000 election, as the McCain campaign says? Simply put, no. We find McCain's claim to be False.

Obama's no maverick
","
(Published Oct. 8, 2008)
 
John McCain has a well-earned reputation for bucking his own party in the Senate, most prominently on campaign finance reform and immigration.


So McCain has tried in the campaign to draw a contrast with his Democratic opponent, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, whom McCain says always toes the Democratic party line.


McCain made the point again at the second presidential debate in Nashville. ""Sen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue,"" McCain said.


Limiting our examination to Obama's four years in the U.S. Senate, it would seem that McCain is on mostly solid ground, even if his claim is one that the Obama campaign hotly disputes.


The Obama campaign cites a few examples where Obama crossed up his party, including an Obama-backed effort in the Senate in 2006 and 2007 to create an independent Office of Public Integrity to investigate congressional ethics cases.


Most Democrats voted for the new office in 2006, then a small majority opposed it in 2007, so Obama hardly could be seen as one against the crowd. And our view is that the votes Obama cites on the office cannot be called a ""major issue"" since the ethics office was mostly a secondary point in a much broader fight over ethics reform that most Democrats supported. Ultimately, the Senate passed a broad bill on ethics in 2007 that did not provide for the new office.


The Obama campaign also points to a vote in February 2005 in which he sided with Republicans and a narrow minority of his caucus in favor of a bill to give federal courts jurisdiction over some class action cases. The bill was opposed by Democratic allies in the plaintiffs' bar.


But this again, was hardly a vote in which Obama stood too far apart from his caucus. Eighteen Democrats supported the bill against 26 opposed. And this wasn't an issue where Obama was particularly outspoken, so it can hardly be argued that he had ""taken on his party leaders"" on tort reform.


Finally, the Obama campaign cites Obama's 2005 vote to confirm Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, but Senate Democrats overwhelmingly favored her confirmation. The final vote among Democrats was 32 in favor of confirmation, 12 opposed.



Congressional Quarterly

each year tallies what it considers the key votes that took place in the previous 12 months. Of the 41 Senate votes tallied by

CQ

between 2005 and 2007, Obama sided with a majority of his caucus on 36 of them. On three, he did not vote. On one, he voted with 21 colleagues against the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court, a vote that evenly divided the Democratic caucus. And last, there was the 2005 tort reform vote.

CQ

did not consider the Office of Public Integrity votes to be among the most important of 2006 or 2007.


None of the examples the Obama campaign provides could be seen as major issues on which Obama was at odds with his party leadership. Certainly nothing on the scale of McCain's unpopular positions on immigration and campaign finance reform, among others. McCain speaks in absolutes — Obama has ""never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue"" — but the record supports him. We say McCain's claim is True.

Accurate for some, not so much for others
","
(Published Oct. 22, 2008)
 
Barack Obama has been making a case that his tax plan gives most voters a better deal than John McCain's tax plan. His campaign recently unveiled

an online tax calculator

so voters can see how they fare under his plan versus McCain's. We decided to take the calculator for a spin to test its accuracy.
 
Keep in mind: Taxes are

complicated

. Here are a few things that can change your tax bill: how much money you make, whether you're married or single, whether you make your money through a job or through investments, and whether you claim deductions for children, mortgage interest, business expenses or education. So it's not easy to generalize how the candidates' tax plans will affect a particular individual. You can read the

Obama

and

McCain

tax plans at their Web sites, and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has also posted

a comprehensive analysis of both candidates' plans

.
 
Before we examine the calculator, we'll make a few general statements about the candidates' tax plans.
 

• If you have income of more than $200,000 as a single person or $250,000 as a married couple, you will pay lower taxes under McCain's plan, potentially much lower.

 
McCain intends to keep the Bush tax cuts in place for higher incomes, while Obama wants to roll them back to Clinton administration levels. The more money you make, the bigger hit you're going to take. For example, let's look at a single millionaire with no kids. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, for example, found that the millionaire's taxes would go up $38,200 under Obama's plan but stay the same under the McCain plan. If our millionaire makes $2-million, the taxes go up $107,024 under Obama's plan but still stay the same under the McCain plan.
 

• Obama's tax credits represent a tax cut to most workers who make less than $200,000.


 
Obama's plan offers a $500 tax credit to people who work as a way of offsetting payroll taxes. This is the policy proposal that allows Obama to make accurate statements such as that he gives 95 percent of workers a tax cut. The credit is refundable, which means that if you don't owe any taxes you will get a check from the government. Republicans have recently called this aspect of Obama's plan welfare, an attack

we checked out here

. In practice, though, Obama's plan means many people with incomes less than $200,000 will see reduced taxes or bigger refunds under his plan. The tax credits do phase out, however, and people who make around $150,000 may get only a partial credit or none.
 

• McCain offers increased tax deductions for children.

 
McCain's plan proposes to increase the child (or dependent) deduction, gradually doubling it from $3,500 to $7,000. For families making less than $50,000, it doubles in 2009. For everyone else, it gradually increases by $500 a year, doubling around 2016. But the deductions are not refundable, so if your taxes are already at zero, you don't get an additional benefit.
 
Now, let's look at the Obama tax calculator and evaluate its accuracy. We ran a number of scenarios through the calculator, which allows you to select an income range and plug in other factors that would be affected by Obama's plan. We also asked Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center to check it out for us. Generally speaking, if you accept its methodology and premises, the Obama tax calculator appears mostly accurate. That is, it does not significantly distort either candidate's tax plans. The Obama tax calculator has a lengthy ""

frequently asked questions

"" list that spells out its assumptions. But it does present Obama's tax policies in their best light, and it makes a few assumptions that may not be true for all taxpayers.
 
""It gets reasonable answers and is not really wrong,"" said Williams, the Tax Policy Center's principal research associate. ""That said, it is simplistic.   It allows only broad ranges of income, which results in only approximate answers. Some people with income in the given ranges would get larger cuts while others would get less.""
 
Here's some of the fine print on the Obama calculator.
 

• It's misleading for higher incomes.

 
If you have a higher income, the Obama tax calculator won't tell you how much of a tax increase you'll get. For example, tell the Obama tax calculator that you make more than $250,000, and the calculator says only, ""You will probably not get a tax cut under the Obama-Biden plan."" Probably not? Make that just about definitely. In some cases, the calculator tells people at higher incomes they save zero dollars but might be eligible for tax credits for retirement. Again, that's highly unlikely. In fact, people with incomes above $250,000 will get tax increases under the Obama plan.
 

• McCain's exemption for children increases over time.


 
The tax calulator computes taxes for 2009, so the calculator does not show the full effect of McCain's proposals to increase the child exemption. McCain proposes to increase this deduction from $3,500 to $7,000, and that kicks in immediately for families that make less than $50,000. But for families who make more than that, it will increase every year through 2016. The Obama calculator does not reflect the benefits in later years to families who make more than $50,000.
 

• Obama's calculator assumes both members of marrie


d couples work outside the home.

 
If you enter an income for a married couple that makes less $150,000, the tax calculator always says that you will get a $1,000 tax cut under the Obama plan. But this is true only if both members of the couple work and qualify for Obama's $500 tax credit to offset payroll taxes. If only one person works outside the home, it's only a $500 tax cut. Research indicates that about 70 percent of couples are dual earners, so the calculator is correct for the majority of couples. But for the 30 percent who aren't, the calculator overestimates tax savings under the Obama plan. But you would get a correct answer if you used the ""head of household"" option.
 

• No analysis of health care plans or business taxes.


 
Obama's tax calculator does not attempt to account for either candidate's health care policies. ""Both proposals would have a major impact on who is covered by health care, what type of coverage they receive, and the cost of that coverage as well,"" states the Obama Web site. ""As a result, it is beyond the scope of this calculator to model those complex interactions."" Arguably true, but be aware that this is the case. The Obama campaign does not claim that its health care plan would directly lower a person's taxes — rather, you would save money through overall lower health care costs. The McCain health care plan could lower your tax burden slightly, but his health plan is set up so that a refundable health tax credit would go to a special health savings account. In other words, it's not the same as a cash refund. For more on McCain's health plan,

read our coverage here

.
 
McCain also proposes a corporate tax cut, which can have an indirect effect on individuals, mostly reflected in very small increases to stock-based savings plans like 401(k)s. The models created by the Tax Policy Center account for this effect; the Obama tax calculator does not.
 

• Calculator uses best-case scenarios that have yet to be enacted into law.

 
We really can't say this enough: The candidates' tax proposals are their best-case scenarios, and they could change a great deal if enacted into law. The candidates' plans in some cases lack details that could affect individual taxpayers significantly. Under the Obama tax plan, for example, many benefits phase out as incomes rise. The Obama campaign has yet to spell out the details that would have to be part of a legislative package. Finally, every president has to negotiate its tax plans with Congress, which often demands significant changes. 
 

• A better calculator exists, but you might have to dig out last year's tax return to try it .

 
Williams of the Tax Policy Center recommends a Web site called

Election Taxes

, which was created by Jeff Gramlich, a professor of accounting at the University of Southern Maine. For increased accuracy, it includes many of the categories on actual tax forms. If you're like us, you'll have to pull out last year's returns to remember how much how much you spend annually on child care or how much you claim from itemized deductions.
 
And so we come full circle: Many factors can determine whether your taxes go up or down. “There’s a good reason why 60 percent of us go to a paid preparer to do our taxes,"" Williams agreed. ""People often don’t understand their own taxes because the rules get so complicated.""
 
The Obama tax calculator doesn't falsify information or make things up. But it's not entirely accurate, either, especially when it comes to tax increases for higher incomes. It's not accurate to say higher incomes don't get a tax cut when actually they get a tax increase. A calculator suggests a well-calibrated instrument that displays an objective answer, and we can't say that about the Obama campaign's device. So we issue a ""Buyer Beware"" and rate the Obama tax calculator Half True.

Official-looking receipt is a fake
","
(Published Oct. 28, 2008) 
A new e-mail claims to depict a $400 room service receipt signed by Michelle Obama. Guess what? It's phony. 
The e-mail is a graphic (  view it here  ) that has an accurate quote from Obama next to her photo: ""The truth is, in order get things like universal health care and a revamped education system, then someone is going to have to give up a piece of the pie so that someone else can have more."" Obama made the remarks on the campaign trail in North Carolina on April 8, 2008. 
The e-mail then says, ""Oh really? Who is the someone that gives up a piece of the pie? Keep the change!"" 
It then shows a receipt with the caption, ""Receipt signed by Michelle Obama at Waldorf Astoria on October 15, 2008 at 4:00 p.m., $447.39 for an afternoon snack."" The receipt then lists things like whole steamed lobsters and ""Iranian Osetra caviar."" 
The receipt is a phony mock-up, and doesn't even look like the receipts the hotel actually uses, said a spokeswoman for the Waldorf Astoria hotel. 
Obama was not staying at the hotel, and the story is ""completely made up,"" the spokeswoman said. Usually, the hotel doesn't comment at all on its guests, but was willing to deny the report in this case because it is false and ""it's escalated so much,"" the spokeswoman said. 
The basis for the e-mail appears to be a story that appeared Oct. 17, 2008, in the  New York Post  gossip column Page Six. The newspaper has since posted a correction: ""The source who told us last week about Michelle Obama getting lobster and caviar delivered to her room at the Waldorf-Astoria must have been under the influence of a mind-altering drug. She was not even staying at the Waldorf. We regret the mistake, and our former source is going to regret it, too."" 
We're not sure who created the e-mail, but it credits itself to PUMA PAC, a political action committee formed in the wake of Hillary Clinton's loss to Barack Obama in the Democratic Primary. PUMA says its acronym stands for ""People United Means Action,"" but among Democrats its common meaning is usually thought to be ""Party unity, my a--."" 
PUMA posted the graphic to its Web site a few days after the  New York Post  story appeared, but has since retracted it. PUMA PACs's executive director, Darragh Murphy, posted a message to the group's Web site that states, ""I sincerely regret repeating and amplifying what turns out to be a shameful attempt to embarrass and undermine Michelle Obama. I will take better care in checking sources in the future."" 
So the hotel where the event was supposed to have occurred repudiates the e-mail, the newspaper that originally reported it repudiates the e-mail, and the political group that promoted it repudiates the e-mail. 
Lest we be in the grips of a well-oiled conspiracy, we went back and checked on Michelle Obama's activities on the day in question. The date and time on the receipt are Oct. 15, 2008, at 16:04, or 4:04 p.m. That day, Obama was in Fort Wayne, Ind., speaking at a rally, and was onstage speaking at about 1:30 p.m. Even a charter flight from Fort Wayne to New York would take about two hours, and we don't think she could have rushed from the Fort Wayne event, flown to New York, checked into the Waldorf and ordered room service in that brief window of time. 
So the e-mail flying around the Internet that says Michelle Obama ordered $400 of lobster and Iranian caviar is just wrong, and because it's a mock-up based on a retracted news item, we rate it Pants on Fire!","[('\nCharlotte Observer, Obama meets working moms, April 9, 2008, accessed via Nexis', 'https://www.nypost.com/seven/10212008/gossip/pagesix/room_disservice_134490.htm'), ('\nNew York Post,  Room Disservice  , Oct. 21, 2008', 'No link'), ('\nPuma PAC,  I regret the error  , Oct. 21, 2008', 'http://pumapac.org/2008/10/21/i-regret-the-error/'), ('\nInterview with Waldorf Astoria spokeswoman', 'No link'), ('\nCNN transcript,  Michelle Obama speaks in Indiana  , Oct. 15, 2008', 'http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0810/15/cnr.05.html')]",/factchecks/2008/dec/02/chain-email/official-looking-receipt-is-a-fake/

Elections tighten almost every time
","


 
(Published Oct. 22, 2008)
 
In a recent interview on the

Today

show, Sen. Barack Obama predicted his lead in the polls would shrink, because that's what happens toward the end of presidential campaigns.
 
So let's start with some context from Obama's exchange with Matt Lauer:
 
""Do you see a path to victory for John McCain?"" Lauer asked.
 
""There's no doubt,"" Obama replied. ""I mean, I – we think that the race will tighten, just because that's what happens at the end of campaigns. They always have. They even – when there are substantial leads. And in each of these battleground states, you've got a lot of close races. One of the messages that I've had to my team is that we don't let up. We do not let up.""
 
The interview was taped Oct. 19, 2008, which was 16 days before the election. We looked at every election since 1944 to see if poll averages in early November were tighter than they had been at any time in the prior few weeks, a loose time frame we decided was an appropriate interpretation of Obama's somewhat vague claim that races get tighter at the ""end of campaigns.""
 
Fortunately, a pair of political scientists, Christopher Wlezien from Temple University and Robert Erikson from Columbia University, had done the hard part. They compiled averages of the incumbent-party candidate's standing – in a hypothetical match-up of the two major-party candidates – in all major polls in the run-up to the past 16 elections, broken down by day. They've used the data in several published papers, and several other political scientists told us it was the best available on the subject. Because these numbers reflect an average of several polls, even small changes in the average reflect more significant changes in the underlying polls.
 
Their spreadsheet enabled us to see, for instance, that in 1972, Richard Nixon was polling at 67.8 percent 17 days before the election. Just prior to Election Day, however, he was polling at 63.6 percent. So yes, that election did tighten at the end. (Nixon won with 60.7 percent of the vote, by the way.)
 
Some tightened far less. In 1984, Ronald Reagan was leading Walter Mondale with more than 61 percent in the average of all polls taken 11, 12 and 13 days before the election. Just prior to Election Day, his lead had shrunk to 60.2 percent. (Reagan won with 58.8 percent.) So that race tightened less – but still, it tightened. (Slight changes in polling averages are less significant the further back in time you go, because there were fewer polls, but we gave Obama the benefit of the doubt if the polling averages reflected even a minor tightening.)
 
Not every election got closer, though. In 1956, Dwight D. Eisenhower never topped a 59 percent average in polls until about the last week before the election. He peaked in early November at 59.4 percent.
 
The 1960 election didn't get any tighter at the end either. But every other one did.
 
That is, out of the past 16 elections, 14 tightened at least somewhat in the last few weeks.
 
A commonly cited explanation for this, Wlezien said, is that voters who are undecided toward the end of a campaign are not likely to feel strongly about either candidate, and thus are likely to split 50-50 between them. That pushes the race in the direction of a tie.
 
While we were at it, we looked in more detail at the elections since 1980, to see how the final results compared to the last few polls. Six of those seven elections have been tighter than the polls in the final few days indicated they would be.
 
That said, the candidate who was ahead in most polls two to three weeks before the election ended up winning every time. (Gore briefly polled better than Bush in 2000, but that was for just one out of the last 21 days. Similarly, Carter polled better than Reagan in 1980, but for only three out of the last 21 days.)
 
But we're not in the prediction business, we're in the fact business. And the fact is, 14 out of the last 16 elections have tightened in the final few weeks of the campaign. So Obama's claim that elections tighten at the end is Mostly True.
