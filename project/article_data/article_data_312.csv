Jeb Bush edited his own emails, says liberal PAC
","While all the attention is on Hillary Clinton’s email records, one left-leaning political action committee wants to remind everyone about a correspondence flap from another potential presidential candidate -- former Gov. Jeb Bush. American Bridge 21st Century posted on its website a reaction to a March 2 tweet Bush sent out about Clinton’s use of a private email account while she was Secretary of State. The PAC pointed out that Bush also had used a private account as governor, and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the Florida public record. ""Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose – apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails,"" the American Bridge website read. Does Florida’s open records law allow Bush (and all other of the state’s elected officials) to hand-select what emails they make available to the public? Sure enough, it does, but there’s more to it than just letting politicians self-report emails. Mail call Bush famously used the personal email address [email protected] for all eight years of his two terms, from 1999 to 2007. He cultivated an open and tech-savvy image by announcing in December 2014 he would post more than 250,000 emails from his time as governor, ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run. In February 2015, jebbushemails.com went live with a quarter-million emails and the first chapter of an e-book Bush was writing about being governor. But there are a few things about the release that sometimes get overlooked. First, those emails were selected from messages already available from the state archives as of December, so the disclosure wasn’t entirely new. Bloomberg reported Bush didn’t submit all of his email until earlier in 2014 -- more than seven years after he left office. The Sunshine Law states an official must turn in records ""at the expiration of his or her term of office."" Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush’s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007, most recently in June 2014. The last batch is described as ""Additional 2002-2003 emails."" Next, and this gets to the heart of what American Bridge said, is that the messages sent to the archives and subsequently posted on Bush’s website are only a portion of all his correspondence during his term. Bush in 2007 said that he had received 550,000 emails through the [email protected] address -- plus another 2.5 million through his public email address -- so obviously plenty were not included in the batch of about 250,000 that the Bush team posted in February. As American Bridge said, Bush decided what would go to the archives and what wouldn’t. The PAC told us that’s comparable to Hillary Clinton’s situation and is therefore hypocritical. (We’ll leave it to readers to decide what’s hypocritical and what’s not.) Bush’s camp told PolitiFact Florida that he had more than satisfied state reporting requirements. ""Governor Bush complied with Florida’s broad public records laws for more than 15 years, beyond what was even required by the law,"" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. ""His emails related to state business have been available via requests to the state for that entire period of time."" The emails Bush turned over to the state are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising -- although there are several emails from donors posted on the site. Bush acknowledged he kept his emails on a private server. But while American Bridge tried to draw a parallel between Bush’s self-selection and Clinton’s current dilemma, we found nothing to suggest Bush’s editing had violated Florida’s Sunshine Law. State statute allows officials or an authorized custodian to determine which emails go into the public record based on whether they pertain to state business. The state archives only receive and preserve them. Another big difference is that while Clinton was not open about her private email use, Bush was transparent about the fact that he was using a private account, according to First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen.   ""There’s nothing in the public records law about personal accounts,"" Petersen said about rules in Florida. ""Some agencies have policies discouraging the use of personal accounts, but that was after Bush left office."" If there is any question that emails had been left out of Bush’s disclosure, a person or group could make a public records request and file a civil suit if they think something’s missing, she said. State law does allow private inspections of electronic devices if warranted to find missing texts and emails. But no one has made that challenge of Bush, Petersen said. Overall, the emails provide Bush with a talking point leading up to 2016, said Bill Allison, senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation. He’s done what Florida law requires and exerted pressure on his presumptive Republican rivals. ""Once you create the expectation to become transparent about something, people will expect that,"" Allison said. ""I’m not sure this will catch on the same way as health records and tax returns, but it could make it very difficult for candidates who do not comply."" Our ruling American Bridge said ""Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose."" Bush did self-edit which emails were posted on a website he established in February, but the PAC doesn’t note one important point: State law allows him to do that. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C34D600>],/factchecks/2015/mar/13/american-bridge-21st-century/liberal-pac-says-jeb-bush-edited-his-own-emails/

Ted Cruz says Iran annually has Death to America holiday
","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, expressed concerns about Iran coming closer to having nuclear weapons should the United States reach a deal permitting Iran to have nuclear fuel. Problematically, Cruz said, President Barack Obama’s administration doesn’t recognize the religious zealotry of Iran’s leaders. Talking to conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Cruz said that zealotry has  been cemented into the country’s calendar. Indeed, Cruz said, ""every day, or every year, rather, Iran celebrates as a holiday what they call death to America day. That’s an actual holiday in Iran. Here, we have Thanksgiving, we have Christmas, we have the 4th of July. Every year in Iran, they celebrate death to America day, which is the anniversary of Iran in the 1970s taking Americans hostage."" We wondered if there is such a holiday. Cruz’s backup To our inquiry, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack emailed that every November, Iranians celebrate the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy. He pointed out a November 1987 Associated Press news story stating Iran’s leaders had just declared a national holiday to mark the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran ""and called on their people to take to the streets and make ‘America tremble in fear.’"" Tehran Radio had dubbed the special date, Nov. 4, 1987, ''Death to America Day,'' the story said. That date was eight years to the day of students taking over the embassy and holding 52  hostages who remained captives to the end of Jimmy Carter’s presidency in early 1981. The AP story said, too, the date marked the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed, founder of Islam, and the 25th anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's expulsion from Iran to Turkey by the Shah of Iran, who fled in January 1979; weeks later, Khomeini triumphantly returned. More recently, according to an October 2013 New York Times news story also noted by Novack, ""hard-liners"" in Iran planned to mark Nov. 4, 2013, as a ‘Grand Day of Death to America.’"" The same story said, though, the chant ""Death to America"" was falling out of routine use; Iran’s newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani, was saying the country no longer needed slogans. Other news stories Our search for news stories in the Nexis database yielded a Nov. 1, 2014, news report from BBC Worldwide Monitoring quoting from the ""Iranian conservative, privately-owned Fars News Agency website"" and saying: ""Since the 1979 takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iranians have been celebrating the occasion every year by holding rallies on the anniversary and marking it as the National Day against the ‘Global Arrogance.’"" Four days later, a BBC summary of programs aired Nov. 4, 2014, by Iranian Fars Province TV news mentioned a video report on ""the anniversary of the U.S. embassy takeover in Tehran in 1979 marked on 13 Aban (4 November) dubbed as ‘Day of fighting arrogance.’ Video shows archive footage of the embassy's seizure in Tehran."" And The (Glasgow) Herald newspaper printed a photograph Nov. 5, 2014 with this description: ""Thousands of Iranians have attended a major anti-U.S. rally marking the anniversary of the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The gathering outside the former embassy compound came days before a key meeting between the two nations’ senior diplomats over Iran’s nuclear programme. The crowds chanted ‘Down with America’ and ‘Death to Britain,’"" the newspaper said. So it seems that at least in Tehran, Nov. 4 is marked every year. Next, we looked for confirmation the anniversary date is a national holiday akin to Christmas or the 4th of July called, as the senator said, Death to America Day. A list of Iranian holidays posted online by Iran’s office in Washington, D.C., doesn’t show a special designation for Nov. 4. But that list might only cover days Iran’s American office is closed. Separately, we spotted a list of public holidays in Iran posted by Columbus Travel Media, a company that describes itself as ""dedicated to the provision of objective, accurate, informative and reliable travel content."" Its list doesn't show any November holidays in Iran. Academic authorities And when we queried specialists on Iran, they responded there are annual demonstrations marking the 1979 embassy takeover, but the date is not a national holiday nor is it called Death to America Day. Gary Sick, a scholar at Columbia University’s Middle East Institute, said by email ""Death to America"" is an Iranian revolutionary slogan shouted or chanted ""at most events related to the revolution. I am sure that it would be heard at the Nov. 4 demonstrations, but I am unaware that it is the formal name of the day or event. This slogan is shouted every Friday at the weekly prayer services held across Iran."" Similarly, Alex Vatanka of the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said annual Nov. 4 events are a ""regime-orchestrated show of anti-Americanism"" and not a national holiday. ""That said, the regime's history of spewing anti-Americanism is rich,"" Vatanka emailed. Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a Syracuse University political scientist, called the claim incorrect, saying by email: ""There are celebrations on Nov. 4 which is the anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy"" but ""no such thing as a death to America national holiday."" John Limbert, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and former Iranian hostage, said by email that Nov. 4 ""is marked with demonstrations and speeches, although former President"" Mohammad ""Khatami (1997-2005) limited those events while he was in office. I have never heard it referred to as ‘Death to America’ day. Nor, as far as I am aware, does it have the status of ‘national holiday’ during which presumably offices and schools would be closed."" Shahin Gerami, a specialist in Persian Studies at San Jose State University, called us back by phone the annual demonstrations are ""highly orchestrated"" by Iran’s government, like some such celebrations in Russia, she suggested. Stores, offices and banks don’t close, she said, because it’s not a holiday. She said she’d not previously heard anyone refer to Nov. 4 as Death to America Day. Cruz's response We alerted Cruz’s office to much of what we were hearing. Cruz spokeswoman Amanda Carpenter replied by email that the annual marking of Nov. 4 ""fits the working definition of a holiday. St. Patrick’s Day is an upcoming event that most Americans recognize as a holiday, although it is not considered a federal holiday. Just because Iran has not similarly designated 'Death to America Day' as a formalized holiday does not mean Sen. Cruz's characterization was wrong or the occurrence of these routine celebrations is any less disturbing."" Our ruling Cruz said that every year, Iran has a holiday like Thanksgiving, Christmas and the 4th of July called Death to America Day. Every year, demonstrations in Tehran mark the Nov. 4 anniversary of students taking over the U.S. embassy in 1979 and taking hostages. But that date doesn’t appear to be akin to the special American days Cruz singled out. In fact, it’s not a holiday on the calendar at all nor is it formally designated Death to America Day. We rate this claim, which has a strand of truth but ignores critical facts, Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d8e2d9a-3a10-42bf-98da-9231275df481   MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Has Scott Walker changed his view on ethanol mandates?
","Perhaps no issue is more important to Iowa farmers than the federal requirement that ethanol -- which is often made from corn -- be blended into America's gasoline supply. On March 7, 2015, Gov. Scott Walker was among potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates who visited the Iowa Ag Summit, where attendees wanted to know where each of the would-be presidents stood on the ""ethanol mandate."" For Walker, it was an especially interesting question. In 2006, he strongly opposed a state effort to require ethanol use in midgrade gasoline, on the grounds that the government shouldn’t be dictating such rules. In Iowa, he had this to say: ""It's an access issue, and so it's something I'm willing to go forward on continuing the Renewable Fuel Standard and pressing the EPA to make sure there's certainty in terms of the blend levels set,"" Walker said. ""Now, long term — we've talked about this before as well — my goal would be to get to a point where we directly address those market access issues and I think that's a part of the challenge. So that eventually you didn't need to have a standard."" In short, he’s for a mandate in the short run, and against it in the long run. That led some commentators and critics to say he had changed his views. Did he? Let’s return to the Flip-O-Meter, which has been getting quite a workout as Walker positions himself for a presidential run. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. More on the mandate Corn is king in Iowa, with a large segment of the state’s economy devoted to growing and refining the crop into ethanol. Enacted by Congress in 2005, the Renewable Fuel Standard has attracted support and opposition from all sides, in often unpredictable alliances. Supporters say the fuel helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, supports American farmers and drives down the price at the pump. Opponents include engine makers and consumer groups who say the blended fuel hurts performance, wastes a valuable food product and needlessly drives up the price at the pump. Free market advocates oppose the government mandate that covers ethanol. In 2006, when Walker was Milwaukee County executive and weighing a gubernatorial run, he fell cleanly in this camp when it came to ethanol mandates. Walker took to his blog and radio airwaves to rip a proposed state ethanol mandate. ""Mandates on individuals and businesses are bad for job growth and prosperity,"" Walker said in a March 9, 2006 blog post directed at the state Senate Republicans. ""I ask that you remember this when voting on the ethanol mandate today."" In a March 1, 2006 post he cited former president Ronald Reagan in his critique. ""Republican lawmakers should remember the principles of Ronald Reagan,"" Walker wrote. ""He warned that government is not the answer to our problems, but too often the problem is the government.  The recent legislation to impose a mandate on the use of ethanol is a good example."" And the Wisconsin State Journal dug up this 2006 statement, that indicated Walker’s interests were broader than the Wisconsin bill: ""Mandates hurt Wisconsin’s working families, and whether they are from Washington or Madison, we as fiscal conservatives should oppose them."" How does that compare to the comments in Iowa in 2015? We asked AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Our American Revival, the group Walker created in anticipation of his campaign for president to explain Walker’s position on ethanol mandates. ""Speaking directly to the RFS as a potential candidate he has not and does not support the passage of new laws that require a specific percentage of ethanol use,""Strong said in an email. ""He believes consumer choice should drive ethanol use, but first the EPA has to uphold the law on the books and set the level. Then, given the opportunity, he would work to address the root problem of market access and phase out the ethanol mandate. Additionally, he wouldn't get rid of it on day one because there’s a level of certainty that farmers and producers depend on and we have to factor that in when phasing it out."" In summary: Walker opposed a state law that would have mandated the use of ethanol. He now says he supports, for now, the federal law that for 2014 set a national target of 15.21 billion gallons of ethanol be produced and blended into gasoline. We define a Half Flip as a partial change in position or inconsistent statements on an issue. That’s what we see here. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3A8340>],/factchecks/2015/mar/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-loves-hates-federal-ethanol-mandate/

Marijuana legalization opponent says alcohol use by young people has been increasing
","Supporters of legalizing recreational marijuana last week unrolled the latest bill  to decriminalize possession of small amounts of cannabis, saying it could mean up to $58 million in tax revenue and give the state an economic boost. But those on the other side of the debate caution that legalization would lead to greater consumption of the drug and other social problems. Rhode Islanders may end up driving impaired and endangering others, for example.  Minors would find it even easier to obtain the drug, even if it would remain illegal for people under age 21 under the proposed law, they said. One such opponent is Nancy DeNuccio, chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a coalition that aims to limit the impact of marijuana on youth. In a   WJAR-10 news report about the latest legalization legislation, DeNuccio expressed her concern about the potential consequences to young people of legalizing marijuana for adults. ""We've seen the increase of alcohol use for under age kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21,"" she said. After a reader asked us to check her statement, we called DeNuccio, who immediately told us that she’d misspoken, that it was a mistake. Still, we decided that we’d look into her claim because whatever we found might help inform our readers as lawmakers take up the debate. Also, the statement was made in a television interview that remains publicly available. We found our answer in data from the Centers for Disease Control’s national Youth Risk Behavior Survey. It shows that, in Rhode Island, the percentage of teens who reported drinking alcohol at least once in the past 30 days had fallen dramatically since 1997 -- from 52 percent in 1997 to 31 percent in 2013. Similarly, the number of state high schoolers who said they consumed alcohol beyond a sip or two before age 13 had dropped over the same period, from 34 percent to 14 percent. The same goes for the percentage of teenagers who said they had five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers decreased from 32 percent in 1997 to 15 percent in 2013. As for the percentage of Rhode Island high schoolers who reported consuming at least one alcoholic beverage in their lifetime, those numbers dropped from a high of 79 percent in 2001 to a low of 62 percent in 2011. The Rhode Island numbers mirror what has been reported around the country. Nationally, the percentages of teenagers reporting drinking declined in three of the same four criteria. The only category to remain static was the percentage of high schoolers who said they drank five or more drinks in one sitting at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers showed gains and losses throughout the time period, keeping it steady, according to the survey. Our ruling Nancy DeNuccio said, ""We've seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21."" We note that DeNuccio immediately acknowledged that she had misspoken.

True: Legislation would open scholarship program to legal refugees
","Georgia opened the door to private school vouchers in 2007, with a law aimed at parents who felt their disabled children weren’t being adequately served in public school. In the 2013-2014 school year, the families of about 3,400 disabled students received taxpayer-funded vouchers to help pay their children’s tuition to private schools. The vouchers, or scholarships, vary in amount based on the severity of the disability. The maximum last year was $12,803, just shy of what’s reported as the average tuition at private schools dedicated to teaching special needs students. Public school groups have been generally opposed to this program and the much costlier private-school tax credit. They argue that both programs undercut public education, a claim that supporters deny. The special needs scholarships are for students with disabilities, such as autism, blindness or a behavioral disorder. But an observant PolitiFact reader ealier this week saw House Bill 296, called PolitiFact and asked if it meant a major change to the special needs scholarship program was afoot. ""It looks like the program is no longer just about helping handicapped kids,"" she said. ""It looks like they want to give out scholarships so immigrant children who can’t speak English can attend private school. Can that be right?"" PolitiFact Georgia decided to investigate. We found a five-paragraph story about the bill by The Associated Press. We also reached out to the authors of House Bill 296, which is pending in the Georgia General Assembly and would amend the special needs scholarship law. We heard back from the bill’s chief sponsor, state Rep. Randy Nix, R-LaGrange, who told us an estimated 700 school-age legal refugees could qualify under the legislation for scholarships to attend private school. ""They are legal, and Georgia is obligated to educate them,"" Nix said. The highest concentrations of these students are in metro Atlanta, mainly in the Clarkston area of DeKalb County, he said. These students ""create a significant problem for their schools,"" Nix said. ""This bill is good for those schools that are struggling to deal with these students,"" he said. ""It will be better for all concerned for them to attend a school which creates a learning environment more geared and welcoming to their unique needs."" To qualify for a scholarship, a student will have to meet the definition of legal refugee under Title I of the Immigration and Nationalization Act, said Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education.   The student will be required to have an I-94 clearance, with a refugee admission stamp, and be ""limited-English proficient as defined in 20 U.S.C. Section 7801."" Unlike other students in the special needs scholarship program, qualifying refugees will not be required to have individual education plans (IEPs) nor will they be required to attend public school in the prior school year. The original champions of the special needs scholarship program expressed surprise about the new bill when contacted Thursday by PolitiFact. ""There is no school choice program in the country related to refugees,"" the Friedman Foundation for Education Choice, the legacy foundation of Nobel economist and school choice founder Milton Friedman, said in a statement. ""We instead believe the one-year requirement to enroll in a public school to earn a scholarship should be removed for special needs students,"" said Susan Meyers, a spokeswoman for the organization.""This effort argues in favor of a voucher for all children. If a child needs a different school, he or she should be able to choose no matter what their personal circumstances."" The bill overwhelmingly passed the Georgia House on Monday and moves to the state Senate for consideration. The measure, which also would require approval of the governor to become law, ""pays attention to some often-overlooked children – exceptional education students who are either children of immigrants or those learning to speak English,"" said Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators (PAGE). ""That by itself is a positive since our legislators do not often look kindly on such students,"" Callahan said. He said the current group of political leaders are championing these students as ""part of their not-very-hidden efforts to splinter the public schools via defunding and diversion of funding, ie. vouchers posing as ‘scholarships."" ""The irony is that across the nation schools of choice -- charters, magnets, etc. -- are frequently criticized for either not accepting these types of students because they are labor intensive and more costly to educate … or for accepting them but forcing them out eventually. So I guess it is a mixed blessing."" Angela Palm, policy director for the Georgia School Boards Association, said she isn't sure of the goal. ""From a state policy statement, it makes little sense to single out one group of limited English proficient as being eligible for this unless they are trying to make sure a public benefit is not being given to an illegal immigrant,"" Palm said. Currently, K-12 schools don't check a student's immigration status. But this bill requires that scholarship candidates prove they meet the definition of legal refugee under Title i provision. School boards generally oppose vouchers because they allow public money to go to private schools without the same transparency and accountability required when public money goes to public schools, Palm said. Gov. Nathan Deal has taken issue with the number of refugees in Georgia. Last July, he fired off a blistering letter to President Barack Obama, saying he was shocked to learn that federal authorities had transferred 1,154 unaccompanied immigrant children to the care of sponsors living in Georgia. The children were placed in Georgia early in the year by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement as the Obama administration grappled with a surge of Central American children illegally crossing the southwest border. Our conclusion: Legislation has cleared the Georgia House that would expand the list of students eligible for a private school scholarship program created in 2007. The scholarships are now offered in varying amounts to students with disabilities. The bill would open the program to about 700 legal refugees who are not proficient in English. We rate the statement True.

George P. Bush says a majority of ""our students"" trapped in underperforming schools
","George P. Bush, the first-year Texas land commissioner, maintains that most students are stuck in bad schools. Bush, addressing a ""school choice"" rally outside the Texas Capitol Jan. 30, 2015, said: ""I believe that most teachers are doing the very best in very difficult situations when a majority of our students are trapped in schools that are underperforming. Some schools don’t work and refuse to change — and that’s why we need school choice and that’s why we need it now."" The Rev. Charles Johnson, executive director of Pastors for Texas Children, which describes itself as an independent ministry and outreach group supporting quality public education opportunities for Texas children, asked us to check Bush’s statement, which Johnson said he heard about from someone who watched the rally. We were curious too. Asked where Bush’s data came from, Brittany Eck, a General Land Office spokeswoman, pointed out a comment by the state’s chief education official in October 2013, when Texas received a waiver from the federal Adequate Yearly Progress requirement that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state’s standardized tests in reading and math, in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act that passed into law when George W. Bush was president. At the time Texas got its waiver, Eck said by email, the state’s education commissioner, Michael Williams, said 95 percent of the state’s school districts would not have met the federal law’s expectations, according to an October 2013 news story in the Dallas Morning News. Eck noted the same judgment was aired by a non-governmental group, the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. Meantime, Eck wrote, only 28 percent to 41 percent of Texas fourth- and eighth-graders chosen to take the National Assessment of Educational Progress, sometimes called the nation’s report card, met ""proficiency"" levels in math or reading in 2013. Some perspective: According to the 2013 results, 62 percent to 84 percent of the Texas students scored well enough to meet basic expectations or better. State accountability ratings Next, we asked the Texas Education Agency what it considers the best measurement of schools in Texas. Spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe said by email the state’s own accountability system is the only rating system in place. And according to the latest state summary of the ratings, released in December 2014, 949 of the state’s 1,025 school districts, 93 percent, ""met standard"" while 76 districts were rated ""improvement required."" The summary said 6,723, or 86 percent, of the state’s individual schools ""met standard"" with 142 meeting an alternate standard — leaving 636 campuses rated ""improvement required,"" meaning the campus missed the state’s standard on one or more performance indicators, according to the TEA. Those indicators include student results on the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and graduation and annual dropout rates, according to the TEA’s Accountability Manual. For 2014, the summary said, some 484 campuses weren’t rated and one school had ""data integrity issues."" (We did not consider charter schools to carve out these counts; there aren’t a lot of them.) Overall in the year, Ratcliffe said, 372,287 of the state’s 5,151,925 public-school students, 7 percent, were enrolled in schools that received the ""improvement required"" rating. Ratcliffe did not dispute that Williams had said 95 percent of the state’s districts would not have cleared the AYP hurdles. The waived expectation under the federal law was that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state’s standardized tests in reading and math. ""We do fall short of perfection,"" Ratcliffe said. Texas Classroom Teachers Association Given that Eck singled out the classroom teachers association, we asked that group, which advocates for teachers, to assess Bush’s statement. By email, Holly Eaton focused on doubts about the usefulness of the AYP standards, which she said have long been regarded as not attainable at the law’s stipulated pace, explaining why many states (more than 40, the News story said) got waivers, she said. ""Accordingly, the projection that 95% of Texas schools would have failed to meet AYP in 2014 shows that Texas was in the same predicament as every other state in the country due to a poorly conceived and widely discredited federal standard,"" Eaton said. By phone, she elaborated: ""We don’t think the federal AYP ratings are of any significance."" Broadly, Eaton said, the association disagrees with Bush’s characterization. Other perspectives We also reached out to other close observers of Texas schools. Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service, commented by email: ""I think the term ‘underperforming’ is really squishy. If one has exceedingly high standards for education, then every school is always underperforming."" Taylor pointed out the state’s 2014 accountability ratings — and called AYP an ""odd standard of performance"" because of the law’s everyone-must-pass requirement for a school to be considered acceptable. ""Most researchers are highly critical of AYP as a measure of performance, so schools that are performing badly by this measure are not necessarily underperforming as most folks understand the term,"" Taylor wrote. Also by email, Torey Tipton of Children at Risk, which analyzes test results and other indicators in its own way, said many Texas children are in failing schools. In spring 2014, she said, 2,275, or 30 percent, of more than 7,000 schools ranked by the group landed Children at Risk grades of D, needing ""significant improvement,"" or F, which the group defines as ""highly concerning.""

As Florida considers Medicaid expansion, Chamber makes claim about size of Medicaid budget
","After rejecting Medicaid expansion in 2013, the Florida Legislature is taking a serious look at it this session. The program pays for health insurance for the very poor. On March 10, a state Senate panel approved a proposal that would allow Florida to accept $50 billion in federal dollars to expand coverage to about 800,000 low-income residents. The plan would establish a state-run private insurance exchange for residents who earn less than $16,000 a year or $33,000 for a family of four. Though the bill won unanimous support of the GOP-dominated Senate Health Policy Committee, it faces an uphill battle in the more conservative House. Also, it would require the federal government to grant Florida a waiver. The feds might object to parts of the Senate proposal that require beneficiaries to pay a monthly premium based on their salary, ranging from $3 to $25. During the Senate hearing, the Florida Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Mark Wilson said he had met with legislators to discuss the chamber’s ideas for a Medicaid proposal. ""We recommended a 32 percent cap on state expenditures, we are coming close to 30 percent right now,"" he said. ""It's the biggest expenditure at the state and we’d like to protect taxpayers with a 32 percent cap."" Does Medicaid come close to eating up nearly one-third of the state budget and is it the state’s biggest expenditure? Medicaid and the state budget Medicaid is a joint state and federal program aimed at providing health insurance to the very poor. The 2010 Affordable Care Act encourages states to expand eligibility and agreed to pay 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years, declining to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. Twenty nine states adopted the expansion -- six including Florida are considering it, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Republican Gov. Rick Scott initially opposed Medicaid expansion but switched his position in 2013 when he came out in support of it. But Scott didn’t lobby the GOP-led Legislature, which ultimately rejected the expansion. In 2014, Democratic challenger Charlie Crist attacked Scott for not pushing for it and argued it would have led to increased jobs in Florida. Edie Ousley, a spokeswoman for the chamber, sent PolitiFact Florida state budget documents, as well as information from groups such as Florida TaxWatch, to show how much of the budget is devoted to Medicaid. We also examined documents we received from the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research. The original 2014-15 Medicaid appropriation was $23.6 billion from all state and federal funds. The total budget for all funds was about $77.08 billion, which means that Medicaid accounts for about 30.6 percent of the budget. On March 4, the state released its latest revision for how much is needed for Medicaid this year and concluded it was $23.52 billion -- about 55 percent is federal dollars and 45 percent is state money. ""For all funds, Medicaid is the largest program,"" Amy Baker, the state’s chief economist, told PolitiFact Florida. But education programs -- including K-12 and higher education -- have received on average slightly more than 52 percent of all state general revenue appropriations since 1997-98. The second-largest policy area is human services. ""Over this same period, the human services portion of the budget has grown from 25 percent to nearly 30 percent, primarily because of the state’s Medicaid program growth,"" Baker said. Nationwide, Medicaid accounts for about 20 percent of state general fund appropriations while K-12 accounts for about one-third, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Medicaid eats up such a large chunk of the budget due to rising health care costs and growing caseloads -- and it continues to grow at a faster rate than education spending, said Arturo Perez, fiscal affairs director for the NCSL. The National Association of State Budget Officers found that if they combined state and federal spending, on average about 26 percent of states’ budgets were for Medicaid in 2014. When combining those federal and state dollars, ""there is no question it is the biggest chunk of the budget in total -- no question,"" said Kurt Wenner, of Florida TaxWatch. George Washington University health policy professor Leighton Ku said that as far as state-based fiscal burdens, a better measure is to focus on how much of the state general fund goes to Medicaid. That level is about 20 percent of state general fund expenditures, he said. ""The general fund corresponds better to what state taxpayers contribute and takes out stuff like federal revenue.  Still a lot, but much lower than 31 percent. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that Medicaid is a large component of state budgets, so there is reason for legislators to be concerned about the costs."" But the majority of Medicaid costs that are paid by the federal government are not a burden to state taxpayers, but essentially an influx of federal funds to the state that promotes economic growth in the state, Ku said. ""Thus, the actual ‘burden’ to state taxpayers is far less than 30 percent of their state tax dollars,"" he said. ""In terms of state/local expenditures, education costs are always much higher."" Our ruling Medicaid is close to 30 percent of the state budget and ""the biggest expenditure at the state,"" Wilson said. There are two ways to look at Medicaid spending. The 30 percent figure is correct if Wilson counts both the state and federal dollars that go toward Medicaid, and it is the biggest expendituree. However, if we only count state dollars, then education eats up a bigger piece of the budget. It's important to understand that the federal government contributes to Medicaid, so the statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097545DC0>],/factchecks/2015/mar/12/florida-chamber-commerce/florida-considers-medicaid-expansion-chamber-makes/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Foreign Policy', 'Joe Biden']","
Joe Biden says 'vast majority' of international commitments are struck without congressional role
","The complicated process of forging international agreements has burst into the spotlight now that the Obama administration is trying to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran. Recently, 47 Republican senators penned an open letter to Iranian leaders. It was structured as a civics lesson -- one intended to remind Iran that even if it is negotiating with the executive branch, Congress has powers to derail any deal it finds objectionable. Among other things, the March 9 letter said that the next president could revoke an agreement struck by Obama ""with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time."" (We rated that Mostly True.) The senators’ letter raised eyebrows, particularly among Democrats, for seeming to break with the precedent that the executive branch is the primary driver of foreign policy. Just hours after the senators released their letter, Vice President Joe Biden released a toughly worded statement taking issue with the senators’ perspective on how international agreements are negotiated. Biden said in part: ""Around the world, America’s influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments. Some of these are made in international agreements approved by Congress. However, as the authors of this letter must know, the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval. And that will be the case should the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany reach an understanding with Iran."" We wondered whether Biden was right that ""the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval."" So we took a closer look. As it turns out, it’s more complicated than it looks. The numbers game Several statistical tallies show that there is a large and growing reliance on what are known as ""executive agreements,"" at the expense of approving treaties, which require a two-thirds vote in the Senate. The upside of pursuing an executive agreement is that they are easier to negotiate -- they don’t require approval from Congress, which removes a major obstacle. The downside of an executive agreement, however, is that it’s easier to reverse. Research published by Jeffrey S. Peake of Clemson University and Glen Krutz of the University of Oklahoma found executive agreements accounting for a steadily rising percentage of international agreements. • Between 1789 and 1839, about 31 percent were executive agreements rather than treaties. • From 1839 to 1889, the share rose to 52.5 percent. • From 1889 to 1939, it climbed again to 63.6 percent. • From 1939 to 1989, it rose even further, to 94.3 percent. They also found that since 1949, treaties exceeded 10 percent of all international agreements during just three two-year periods -- once under President Harry Truman and twice under President Bill Clinton -- and never exceeded 17 percent of agreements. The average for any given two-year period between 1949 and 2012 was 6 percent treaties, 94 percent executive agreements. When executive action needs Congress But if you use this data set, there’s a problem for Biden’s claim. While executive agreements are, as a whole, less reliant on congressional action than treaties are, that’s not the same thing as saying that all of them are entirely unaffected by congressional action. That’s because there are actually three kinds of executive agreements, each with a different degree of congressional input. Here’s the rundown: • Congressional-executive agreements. For these agreements, both houses of Congress are involved in the authorizing process by passing a statute through both chambers, according to the Congressional Research Service. The North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were done this way. • Executive agreements that follow an earlier treaty. For these agreements, the Senate has already had a say on the topic when it approved the earlier treaty. • Sole executive agreements. This type of agreement stems from the president’s constitutional authority, and does not require authorization by Congress. Peake estimates that the first two types of agreements account for 90 percent of executive agreements, with sole executive agreements accounting for perhaps 10 percent. This estimate is based on old data. It stems from a 1984 scholarly study by Loch Johnson titled, The Making of International Agreements: Congress Confronts the Executive. In the book, Johnson found that 87 percent of agreements fit into the first two categories. But Peake said that no updated study has been completed since, though he noted that in his conversations with State Department officials while writing his own book in 2006, they indicated that the figure had remained more or less constant since then. Using these figures, then, only a small percentage of international agreements escape congressional input entirely. These agreements may not be vetted by Congress in the same way, and to the same degree, as treaties are, but Biden’s phrasing fuzzes the differences. Biden’s response When we checked with Biden’s office, they said that looking at the question in this way is misleading. Biden’s staff said the numbers used by Peake and CRS refer to ""binding"" agreements and ignore ""non-binding"" arrangements. Because Iran’s nuclear program is a major geopolitical issue, we think many Americans would assume that any deal would at least be considered binding. But in the wake of the senators’ letter, the Obama administration has made clear in testimony to Congress that any agreement with Iran would actually fall into the non-binding category. This means the agreement isn’t binding under international law, though a State Department guidance adds that ""a non-binding instrument may carry significant moral or political weight."" Experts told us the distinction between binding and non-binding agreements is often lost even among professionals. And Biden’s staff emphasized to PolitiFact that non-binding arrangements aren’t trivial.   For one thing, a number of significant commitments have been considered non-binding. Recent examples include the framework for disarming Syria of chemical weapons, greenhouse gas targets agreed to last year by the United States and China, and, just days ago, a joint statement of principles between Biden and the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Collectively, these are more common than binding agreements, which are the ones counted by Peake or the CRS, Biden’s staff said. Biden’s office added that non-binding doesn’t equal non-enforceable. The United States has methods to enforce them, such as sanctions. Independent experts said Biden has a point, but they expressed concern that he used the phrase the ""vast majority of our international commitments"" without being able to show his arithmetic. Without it, Biden’s claim is not much more than speculation. ""The problem I have (with Biden’s claim) is that I have no idea how anyone would figure out how many non-binding agreements there are, or indeed what even counts as a non-binding agreement,"" said Michael D. Ramsey, law professor at the University of San Diego. ""The president and his diplomats are constantly making arrangements with foreign officials on many issues large and small, but most of these are not extensively negotiated or directed to important matters."" Our ruling Biden said ""the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval."" When looking at binding agreements -- the only types of agreements for which we have good data -- Biden is likely off base. While it’s true that formal treaties represent a small minority of all binding international agreements, most of the other types of non-treaty, binding agreements do have some congressional input, even if it’s less than treaties have. Biden may be on safer ground once you add in non-binding agreements. However, Biden’s office did not provide statistics to back up this claim, and independent experts said they aren’t aware that such a tally exists. So the claim that agreements negotiated without congressional input represent ""the vast majority of our international commitments"" is essentially informed speculation. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C418300>],/factchecks/2015/mar/12/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-vast-majority-international-commitm/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Education', 'Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says he unsealed his records from college: False
","The circumstances around Gov. Scott Walker's withdrawal from Marquette University were murky enough to arouse questions, more than two decades later, about whether bad grades or misbehavior may have led him to quit school roughly a year short of a degree. Deep dives into Walker's college days by PolitiFact Wisconsin -- and later by national media as he emerged as a Republican presidential hopeful -- showed Walker was in ""good standing"" when he dropped out in 1990, taking a job with the American Red Cross and running unsuccessfully for the state Assembly. But no actual documents, such as a college transcript, turned up to shed light on Walker’s academic performance or on a controversy involving his run for student government president. Yet on Feb. 27, 2015, while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington, D.C. with other potential White House contenders, Walker suggested there was nothing murky at all about his time at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee. During an interview with Dana Loesch, a conservative radio and Blaze TV talk show host based in Dallas, Walker made a claim as Loesch prepared to ask a question. ""A lot of folks like myself thought it a little elitist -- because everybody’s vetting you now. You’ve already been more vetted than the current commander-in-chief,"" Loesch said. ""Yeah,"" Walker interjected, with a chuckle. ""And more written about my college days than the president. I unsealed my records."" Really? 2010 Let’s start with a closer look at Walker’s claim -- that he ""unsealed"" his records. First, it suggests he did something proactively -- the way presidential candidates often release their tax returns. Second, it clearly suggests the information involved is complete and unfiltered -- that is, the documents themselves. In 2010, during Walker’s successful campaign for governor, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel requested college transcripts from Walker and two other leading candidates, former Republican Congressman Mark Neumann and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat. Neumann and Barrett provided them. Walker refused. Instead, his campaign said Walker had a grade point average of 2.59. (On a 4-point scale, that's in the range of a C-plus or a B-minus.) Walker also released a letter from Marquette that showed he attended the school for four years, from 1986 to 1990, and would have needed to stay there for at least another year to get a degree. 2013 PolitiFact Wisconsin published its article on Walker’s college days in December 2013. At the time, he was gearing up for re-election and raising his national profile, yet the story of his formative political years remained surprisingly disputed.   Indeed, Wisconsin Democrats were claiming the governor was ""kicked out"" of student elections at Marquette (a claim we rated False) -- and maybe was booted from Marquette altogether. The article reported on Walker’s run, as a sophomore, for student government president. After the Marquette Tribune student newspaper endorsed Walker’s opponent, on the day before the election, there were allegations that Walker supporters emptied editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings. Walker’s camp denied the allegations, but Walker lost the election. Marquette ordered an investigation, but details of the alleged dumping of the newspapers were not readily available in the public record, much less evidence of who may have been behind the acts. Asked by PolitiFact if he was ""forced out"" of Marquette for any reason, Walker said: ""I can say unequivocally that isn’t true."" And PolitiFact found no evidence that he had. But the article made an important point -- that ""publicly available documents cannot fully resolve the question, in part because a federal privacy law blocks release of information on former students unless the person consents. In addition, Walker told us he was sticking to an earlier decision not to release his transcript."" With that in mind, PolitiFact asked Walker if he would allow Marquette to comment on his academic and conduct record. He did. Marquette confirmed in a statement that Walker was a student from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and, when he voluntarily withdrew, was a senior in good standing. At Marquette, being in ""good standing"" means a student is eligible to register and has no academic or non-academic conduct issues restricting registration. PolitiFact then asked Marquette whether any conduct issues were on Walker’s earlier school record, and was told Walker would have to permit release of that information. Walker did so. Walker was in good standing during each term while he was enrolled at Marquette, and was not suspended or expelled at any time, the school said in a letter. The school made clear that Walker had authorized only that limited release of information and only to PolitiFact Wisconsin. In other words, there was no general release or unsealing of documents. 2015 The pattern continued as Walker’s stock as a presidential contender rose. In February 2015, two weeks after lengthy stories about Walker’s college days appeared in the Washington Post and Boston Globe, Walker released a one-sentence letter showing he had authorized Marquette ""to confirm my academic standing for each term and that I voluntarily withdrew from Marquette University in good standing in the spring of 1990."" Nothing new there. When we contacted the governor’s office for this fact check, spokeswoman Laurel Patrick forwarded us a copy of that letter. When we asked if that meant there had  been no unsealing of documents, she replied by saying: ""This effectively unseals his records, which is what he said. It gives Marquette University authorization to provide information about his record."" But the limited comments Walker allowed Marquette to make about his record, of course, are far from any unsealing of the records themselves. It is more akin to a statement that you paid your taxes on time, rather than producing the returns themselves. Our rating Walker said he ""unsealed"" his student records at Marquette University. In fact, he has taken only the very limited step of authorizing the school to confirm that he was in ""good standing"" during his time at Marquette and that he voluntarily withdrew. We haven’t seen any records. We rate Walker’s statement False.

"['Ethics', 'Transparency', 'PunditFact', 'David Shuster']","
Private email use alone didn't sink the U.S. ambassador to Kenya
","Hillary Clinton’s press conference about her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state basically came down to two points. She wants people to trust that she turned over every email that she should have, and that she ""fully complied with every rule."" But before she even left the podium, Clinton got pushback on whether she truly did follow State Department rules. David Shuster, a New York reporter for Al Jazeera America, brought up the 2012 resignation of Scott Gration, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya. ""What about Scott Gration, who was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails?"" Shuster asked. ""David, I think you should go online and read the entire IG (inspector general) report,"" Clinton replied. ""That is not an accurate representation of what happened."" The case of ambassador Gration has come up frequently in recent days. The man himself was a guest on CNN’s State of the Union where he said that on the email issue, he was the victim of a double-standard. We thought it would be worth getting to the bottom of the assertion that Gration was forced to resign because of his personal use of emails. One of Obama’s biggest fans President Barack Obama appointed Gration to head the American embassy in Kenya in 2011. Gration was a retired Air Force general who had spent years in East Africa as the child of missionaries. Gration toured Africa with Obama in 2006 and was completely won over by the man who would become president. He was an early and key foreign policy adviser to Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and was tapped by the president to serve as Obama’s special envoy to Sudan. He moved from that post to lead the embassy in Nairobi. Less than a year and half later, Gration departed, saying in his resignation letter that ""differences with Washington regarding my leadership style and certain priorities lead me to believe that it’s now time to leave."" Gration stepped down about a month before the release of an internal management audit by the State Department’s Office of Inspector General. In keeping with standard process, Gration had seen that report and was given the chance to respond before it came out. A damaging assessment The first bullet point in the inspector general’s report is a global indictment of Gration’s capacity to serve as chief of mission. It reads: ""The Ambassador has lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission. Of more than 80 chiefs of mission inspected in recent cycles, the Ambassador ranked last for interpersonal relations, next to last on both managerial skill and attention to morale, and third from last in his overall scores from surveys of mission members. The inspectors found no reason to question these assessments; the Ambassador’s leadership to date has been divisive and ineffective."" The auditors noted that many of the 19 federal agencies operating out of the embassy had little or no access to Gration, who they said showed an ""ongoing unwillingness"" to meet with agency heads. The auditors reported confusion and disruption. ""Unless corrected there is a risk that the country team will become dysfunctional,"" the auditors wrote. Other issues included that Gration did not read classified cables and that an initiative he launched redirecting nearly $550 million in U.S. health assistance proved ""disruptive."" Communications with Washington were a significant source of friction, and Gration’s use of a personal email account was just one example of a larger pattern. The inspector general’s report said Gration ""does not read classified front channel messages and has not established a system to have his staff screen incoming cables relevant to Kenya and U.S. interests in the region."" Relating to emails, the report said:  ""The Ambassador’s greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear-cut U.S. Government decisions. He made clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe-havening in Nairobi of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts; the creation of a freestanding Somalia Unit; and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business, including Sensitive But Unclassified information. Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the right thing, the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite."" The report goes on to say that Gration ""ordered a commercial Internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the Department email system,"" and that Gration ""very infrequently logs onto his classified account, which would allow him to read cables and classified emails.""   To our reading, Gration’s email habits were one point in a series of issues. Ronald Neumann, who served as American ambassador three times, most recently in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007, agreed. Neumann, who is now president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, said he finds it hard to miss the main message of the inspector general’s report. The message, Neumann said, is, ""The ambassador is completely incompetent and should be removed as quickly as possible before he does any more damage to American interests."" Neumann said from his experience, the staff in the Inspector General’s Office are credible and objective. He had no direct experience with the embassy in Kenya, but his reading of the report suggested the email issue played a minor role. ""It could be an important issue, but when you screw up as many things as this guy did, it’s hard to get through to that one,"" Neumann said. We reached out to Shuster via email and through Al Jazeera’s press office and did not hear back. In an email to several news organizations, Gration said he was ""‘'fired’ for the use of Gmail in the U.S. Embassy, my insistence on improving our physical security posture, and other twisted and false allegations."" Our ruling Shuster said Gration was forced to resign because of his use of personal email accounts. That was one issue State Department officials raised. But just one of many. The State Department Inspector General’s report paints a much more troubling picture of an embassy in disarray under Gration’s leadership. In the words of the auditors, Gration ""has lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission."" Gration ranked at or near the absolute bottom among other ambassadors assessed by the department. His use of email was an issue, but according to an ambassador with much experience, it was a relatively minor one. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978EDA80>],/factchecks/2015/mar/11/david-shuster/no-email-use-didnt-sink-us-ambassador-kenya/

Florida has more black, Hispanic university students after ending affirmative action, Jeb Bush says
","Former Gov. Jeb Bush still hasn’t announced a 2016 presidential run, but he is trumpeting his conservative record on subjects like affirmative action. ""I eliminated affirmative action by executive order -- trust me, there were a lot of people upset about this,"" Bush said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 27, 2015. ""But through hard work we ended up having a system where there were more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system than prior to the system that was discriminatory."" It’s been some time since Bush ended race-based admissions policies, so we wondered if more African American and Hispanic students are attending state universities now than when affirmative action was in place. 'One Florida' Bush signed an executive order implementing the ""One Florida"" plan in 1999, which banned racial preference in state school admissions. It also created a program guaranteeing that the top 20 percent of high school graduates would gain admission to a post-secondary institution and some funding for need-based financial aid. Florida is now one of a handful of states preventing race-based admissions policies and the only one to do so by executive order. Other states had done so by ballot initiative, a route that ran into obstacles in Florida when supporters tried and failed to put a constitutional amendment on the 2000 ballot. Bush’s spokeswoman did not comment, but the first thing we should note is that in terms of sheer numbers, Bush has some evidence to back himself up. From 1999 to 2013, the latest year for which data is available, overall enrollment for black students went up from about 33,000 to almost 44,000. It was the same for Hispanics (students from a Spanish-speaking culture), which shot up from just less than 33,000 students to almost 80,000. But those numbers were going up as overall enrollment was going up dramatically. From 1999 to 2013, the State University System increased enrollment by 45 percent, much higher than the national average of around 25 percent in the same time period. The question really is, did the ratio of black and Hispanic enrollment go up after Bush’s executive order? Well, yes and no. We took a look at all state university fall enrollment, broken down by black and Hispanic students, going back to 1995. Data from the Florida Board of Governors show that black enrollment declined slightly in recent years from 14 percent in 1999 to 13 percent in 2013. Hispanic enrollment, meanwhile, have almost doubled to nearly 24 percent. One thing to keep in mind is that post-2010 data can’t be fairly compared to pre-2010 data. That’s because the U.S. Department of Education in 2007 decided to change racial and ethnic classifications by the 2011-12 school year. The new categories included a ""multiple races"" choice and weighted classifications for students who answered ""yes"" when asked if they are Hispanic. Choosing Hispanic overrides racial selections and results in more students categorized as Hispanic. The reclassification also has resulted in fewer students reporting as black and white, according to the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System. But as the graph shows, the trend for more students to report as Hispanic started even before the Department of Education decided to change the categories. Experts told us there are several reasons for these changes, but it doesn’t appear it’s because of the One Florida program. Troy Miller, associate director for research and policy for the student advocacy group the Florida College Access Network, said demographics are part of the equation. Overall enrollment is up because there are more K-12 students in the state than there were in 1999, and more of them (including black and Hispanic students) are graduating than before. Also, college admissions are going up in large part because of the Bright Futures program, started in 1997. Our ruling Bush said that eliminating affirmative action in admissions led to ""more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system"" universities than before. The raw numbers of black and Hispanic students are up, but the percentage of black students in the State University System is down slightly since Bush’s 1999 executive order. The number of Hispanic students has gone up considerably, but that is partly because of a recent change in how students report ethnicity during the admissions process. There’s no hard evidence Bush’s One Florida program had much to do with the enrollment changes. Experts say demographics, graduation rates and state-sponsored scholarship money have had more influence. We rate the statement Mostly False.

Is the letter to Iran from 47 Republican senators correct about Congress' role in nuclear deal?
","The Obama administration’s efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran were already contentious. But they got more so -- if that’s possible -- on March 9, 2015, with the release of a letter by 47 Republican senators. The missive, labeled ""an open letter to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" was structured as a civics lesson -- one intended to underscore that even if Iran is negotiating with the executive branch, Congress is not powerless in the process. A key portion of the 286-word letter says that the undersigned senators ""will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei.  The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time."" Critics called the letter unprecedented for seeming to meddle with the president’s authority to handle negotiations with foreign countries. Vice President Joe Biden said the letter ""is beneath the dignity of an institution I revere."" Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the letter ""has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy."" At a State Department briefing the day the letter was released, spokeswoman Jen Psaki went so far as to say the letter was factually incorrect. ""Congress doesn't have the power to alter the terms of international arrangements negotiated by the executive,"" Psaki said at the briefing. ""The letter is incorrect when it says that Congress could modify the terms of the agreement at any time."" We were intrigued by the crossfire between the State Department and Congress about whether this passage of the letter was accurate, so we took a closer look. (Neither spokespersons for the letter’s primary author, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., nor the State Department responded to emailed questions for this article.) The independent experts we spoke to said the Republican senators’ letter was generally correct, but also was something of an oversimplification. Treaties vs. executive agreements To answer this question, it’s important to understand the differences between two types of international agreements. Treaties with foreign countries are negotiated and signed by the executive branch, but ratification only occurs after the Senate gives its approval in a two-thirds vote. But there’s another kind of agreement beyond treaties -- indeed, they represent a growing share of agreements in recent decades. They are known as ""executive agreements."" The procedure for treaties is spelled out in the Constitution, but there’s little in the Constitution about executive agreements. Their authority comes instead from longstanding practice, as well as the support of such Supreme Court cases as United States vs. Belmont (1936), United States vs. Pink (1941), and Dames and Moore vs. Regan (1981). ""Presidents since Washington have concluded such agreements, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the president has the authority to conclude such agreements,"" said Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. The upside of pursuing an executive agreement is that they are easier to negotiate -- they don’t require approval from Congress, which (as the current episode makes clear) removes a major obstacle. The downside of an executive agreement, however, is that it’s easier to reverse. ""It is clear, constitutionally, under internal law, that a future president could do this,"" said Jeffrey S. Peake, a Clemson University political scientist. Arend concurred that such an action would likely be constitutional. As for Congress, ""what it can do is legislate, and a valid federal statute will prevail in a conflict with an executive agreement,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania legal scholar. This stems from the Supreme Court decision in Whitney vs. Robertson (1888), which held that a treaty is placed on the same footing as an act of legislation, and that if they cannot coexist, ""the one last in date will control the other."" ""So in that sense, the senators are right,"" Roosevelt said. It’s worth noting that the design of the potential deal with Iran would seem to include a role for Congress in any case. The deal in the making is widely believed to include a temporary lifting of sanctions in the short term, and a permanent lifting of sanctions in the longer term. The temporary easing could be accomplished by the administration, but a permanent easing will most likely require congressional action. We’ll also note that there is some debate among legal scholars about whether the president alone has the power to negotiate something as major as a deal over nuclear weapons without any say by Congress. However, the senators’ letter suggests they don’t quarrel with the fact that he can do so, at least for an agreement that doesn’t extend beyond his term in office. The process isn’t so simple But while there’s support for the senators’ claims, most of our experts added that the letter oversimplified the matters at hand. Here are a few reasons why: • It is an exaggeration to say that future Congresses could ""modify"" an agreement ""at any time."" The possible agreement with Iran is being negotiated between the five permanent United Nations Security Council members plus one: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China, plus Germany. So for the agreement to be truly modified, the other signatories would have to sign off, Peake said -- something that is hardly a sure thing. Instead, Congress could pass legislation that conflicts with the agreement, effectively ""modifying"" it. But Congress' ability to carry this out is more difficult than the senators' blithe language suggests. ""It would take presidential acquiescence or a supermajority -- two-thirds to override a veto -- for Congress to act independently to stiffen sanctions,"" Peake said. ""It is very complex."" Cotton's letter was signed by 47 senators, significantly less than the 67 senators needed to override a presidential veto. The 2016 elections are months away, but given the electoral map, it seems unlikely Republicans would be able to pick up that many more seats. Of course, the GOP could win the White House, in which case they may not need to override, but given the typical Senate threshold for taking up legislation, they would still need 60 votes, a challenging task. • Going back on an executive agreement may violate international law. While Congress has the power to violate international law -- and the ability of the international community to punish a violation is debatable -- ""the real question, which I think both sides are missing, is whether overriding would violate international law,"" which requires compliance with binding agreements, said Michael D. Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego. • Going back on an executive agreement could have significant, if intangible, consequences for the nation’s diplomatic credibility. Retreating from one executive agreement would be a pretty radical step historically and could endanger the nation's ability to both ensure that old agreements stand and to strike new agreements. ""For the president to vacate an executive agreement would be quite problematic,"" Peake said. It ""would be largely unprecedented and cause the U.S. a great deal of grief in diplomacy, especially since 95 percent of international agreements are done via executive agreement rather than the constitutional treaty process."" Indeed, Peake said, ""It could call into question America’s commitment to the vast majority of her international agreements."" Our ruling The letter written by Cotton said that if Obama strikes a nuclear deal with Iran, ""the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time."" We found broad agreement among experts that a future president or a future Congress could indeed undo or modify the kind of agreement that’s currently being negotiated with Iran, but the senators’ letter makes the process sound more clear cut and easier than it actually is.  The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D66B00>],/factchecks/2015/mar/11/tom-cotton/letter-iran-47-republican-senators-correct-about-c/

Advocate for craft beer brewers correct on claim
","As the popularity of craft beer continues to grow, so do the legislative fights over how to regulate the industry. In Georgia, craft beer brewers say they are at a competitive disadvantage both regionally and nationally because state law prohibits them from selling directly to consumers. They’ve been trying for about a decade to change state law. They are back lobbying the Georgia General Assembly this year. In the meantime, craft beer, generally defined as beer brewed by relatively small regional breweries, continues to become more popular and profitable. The national Brewers Association, based in Colorado estimates that, 207,000 barrels of craft beer were produced in Georgia in 2013 and that the industry contributed $33.9 billion to the national economy, $671 million to Georgia’s economy, taking into account its impact on breweries, wholesalers, retailers, jobs even brewpub restaurants and taprooms. Legislatures across the country in recent years have wrestled with changing their alcohol and tax laws while weighing the competing interests of the craft beer brewers, the powerful big  beer manufacturers and wholesalers. Part of the argument for the law change in Georgia is the relatively unique restrictions that exist here on beer brewers. Georgia  ""is one of only five states that do not allow beer factories or 'production breweries' to sell beer for neither on-premise consumption (pints) nor off premise consumption (packaged beer),"" Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild said Monday. Politifact decided to check the claim. We reached out to Palmer, who warned us that  ""this issue is a little complicated."" ""Section 2 of the 21st Amendment provides huge amount of leeway to the states to regulate alcohol, and each has come up with as many laws about it as there are stars in the sky,"" she said. ""The laws on alcohol vary from state to state significantly more than gun control or the control of illicit drugs."" She said her research showed that only four states, besides Georgia, have laws prohibiting direct sales by breweries to consumers. They are West Virginia, Hawaii, Mississippi and North Dakota. We contacted Palmer’s counterpart with the brewers’ associations in Mississippi. Mark Henderson of Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company confirmed that Mississippi does not allow its breweries to sell beer for on-site or off-site consumption. 
Todd Sattler, with the brewers association in North Dakota, said, however, that restrictions are not as tight there. ""We have on premise sales and growler sales,"" he told PolitiFact. In West Virginia, a brewer or resident brewer ""cannot even sample or sell a pint for on- or off-premise consumption,"" said Brian Arnett with Mountain State Brewing Company. But there’s a loophole in West Virginia: ""You can buy a brewpub license that allows sampling and pint sales, Arnett said. Palmer said Hawaii has already addressed the issue by incorporating brewpubs with its breweries so direct sales can take place, similar to what Arnett mentioned is happening in West Virginia. Direct sales are believed to be critical to a brewery’s success in much the same way wine sales contribute to a winery’s bottom line, she said. Craft brewers have been pushing Senate Bill 63, which initially would have allowed breweries to sell pints of beer to the public in an amount not to exceed 72 ounces per person per day and to sell no more than 144 ounces of packaged beer to-go per person, per day. However, a substitute passed out of committee Friday that prohibits direct sales by breweries. It alters the current tour structure so that brewers can give away 36 ounces on-premises during the tour (compared to the current 32 ounces) as well as a ""souvenir"" malt beverage container of no more than 64 ounces to-go. Our ruling The Georgia Craft Brewers Guild is lobbying for breweries to have the right to sell directly to ""consumers. The group argues craft beer breweries in the state are at a disadvantage because ""Georgia is one of only 5 states where breweries can’t sell you a pint of beer to drink or sell you any to go."" They were identified as West Virginia, Hawaii, Mississippi and North Dakota. But we found that at least North Dakota doesn't belong on the list with Georgia. 'It's clear that most states have already cleared the path for these sales. Others are moving in that direction. That’s the Georgia guild’s over-arching point. We rate the statement as Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097547C80>],/factchecks/2015/mar/11/georgia-craft-brewers-guild/advocate-craft-beer-brewers-correct-claim/

This story about National Guard doctors finding hospitals with no COVID patients is fake
","Some Facebook users are sharing a headline of what looks like a news article, but it comes from a self-described satire site with a history of publishing fabricated stories. ""National guard doctors find hospitals empty of COVID patients,"" the Jan. 18, 2022, headline says.   This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

We’ve previously investigated and written about both the site and Baxter, which is a pseudonym, and we’ve fact-checked and found false multiple claims from stories published on Real Raw News.   This particular story has two supposed sources: Lt. Michael McKenzie, a physician assistant with the New Jersey Army National Guard and Beth Johnson, a member of the administrative staff at Hudson Regional Hospital in Secaucus, New Jersey. According to the story, McKenzie was among the military medical workers dispatched to hospitals grappling with a surge of COVID-19 cases. He was attached to ""Task Force Secaucus,"" which was assigned to Hudson Regional Hospital. It was there that he found not ""a single COVID patient,"" the story says.  ""Four of the hospital’s 14 ICU beds were occupied, but none with COVID patients,"" McKenzie allegedly told Real Raw News.  But we reached out to the National Guard, and a spokesperson told us that there is no such task force, and no Lt.

No, New York has not delayed COVID-19 treatment for white people
","At an Arizona rally, former President Donald J. Trump stirred up the crowd with inaccurate claims about how white people are being put at a disadvantage when seeking health care during the pandemic.  ""The left is now rationing life-saving therapeutics based on race, discriminating against and denigrating, just denegrating white people to determine who lives and who dies. If you’re white, you don’t get the vaccine, or if you’re white you don’t get therapeutics,"" he said. ""In fact, in New York State, if you’re white, you have to go to the back of the line to get medical help. Think of it. If you’re white you go right to the back of the line.""  New York State’s guidance for distribution of Covid-19 treatments has been a hot topic in conservative media and also the subject of lawsuits by a Cornell University law professor and a pro-Trump advocacy group.   So, what is Trump talking about? Do whites have to ""go to the back of the line to get medical help"" in New York State?  The context for Trump's remarks is a state Department of Health memo from Dec. 27, sent to health care providers and facilities about treatments meant to prevent worsening conditions in people already sick with the virus.  The memo addressed the recent authorization of Covid-19 oral antiviral treatments, such as Paxlovid, as well as a severe shortage of those treatments and monoclonal antibodies. It warned that supplies of oral antivirals ""will be extremely limited initially,"" and that only one monoclonal antibody product is effective against the omicron variant, the dominant variant in New York.  The state told health care providers to prioritize the therapies for people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised regardless of their vaccination status, or those 65 and older and not fully vaccinated with at least one risk factor for severe illness.  Patients have to meet other criteria for oral antiviral treatment, including being at least 12 years old, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, having mild to moderate symptoms, not being hospitalized for those symptoms, and being able to start the treatment within five days of starting symptoms. Other criteria include having a medical condition or other factors that increase their risk for severe illness. ""Non-white race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity should be considered a risk factor, as longstanding systemic health and social inequities have contributed to an increased risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19.""  We asked the state Department of Health about Trump’s statement that white people have to go to the back of the line to get treatment.  ""No one in New York who is otherwise qualified based on their individual risk factors will be turned away from life-saving treatment because of their race or any demographic identifier,"" said spokesperson Erin Silk.  The Department of Health is advising health care providers to consider a number of health-based risk factors when providing this treatment, Silk said. ""These are neither qualifications nor requirements for treatments,"" she said. These risk factors include medical conditions, age, and vaccination status. The state included non-white race or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity based on guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she said. The CDC has recognized that Covid-19 mortality rates are higher among certain demographic groups, including senior citizens, immunocompromised individuals and non-white/Hispanic communities.  CDC data show that compared to white people, the risk of death from Covid-19 is nearly twice as high for Black people and twice as high for Hispanic and Latino populations. Adjusted for age, those who are Hispanic, Black, or American Indian and Alaska Native are at least twice as likely to die from Covid-19 as their white counterparts, according to the health care research organization KFF.  White people who are immunocompromised still receive treatment under the guidance, said S. Matthew Liao, director of the Center for Bioethics in the School of Global Public Health at New York University. The policy acknowledges that Black and Hispanic people are twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as white people, he said.  To get the treatment, you already have to be sick and have other risk factors. Race and ethnicity is one risk factor under this guidance, Liao said.  David Larsen, a public health professor at Syracuse University, said New York considers being Black and Hispanic a pre-existing condition. But that does not mean the state is withholding treatment from white New Yorkers.  Erika Martin, an associate professor and applied health policy researcher at the University at Albany, said health care providers already account for risk factors for severe Covid-19, such as chemotherapy treatment. This guidance reminds them that race and ethnicity can put someone at risk of severe infection.  When health authorities talk about scarce resources, such as these Covid treatments, they want to distribute them in a way that will provide the most benefit, Martin said. In this instance, the way to do that is to distribute them to people at the highest risk for severe disease.   A CDC report released on Jan. 21 found that distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments were not equitable along racial and ethnic lines, according to data from 41 health care systems.  We reached out to Trump’s office for any additional supporting information but did not hear back.  Other fact-checkers have found no evidence for Trump’s statement and that he wrongly interpreted New York’s policy.  Trump said white people in New York State have to go to the back of the line for medical care. He makes a nonsensical claim that ""if you’re white, you don’t get the vaccine."" There's plenty of vaccine. There's no need to withhold it from anybody. There is no evidence that white New Yorkers who are sick with COVID-19 and have other risk factors are being denied treatment because patients of other races are receiving it. The Department of Health memo instructs health care providers to consider several factors when distributing Covid-19 treatments that are in short supply. Race and ethnicity are factors to consider because the risk of death for Black and Hispanic Covid-19 patients is twice as much as for their white peers.   Trump did not acknowledge the ways that white New Yorkers qualify for these treatments, nor did he say that race and ethnicity is only one risk factor on a list of many others that health care providers should consider.  He distorted a state health guidance to make a ridiculous claim. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971BC740>],/factchecks/2022/jan/27/donald-trump/no-new-york-has-not-delayed-covid-19-treatment-whi/

No truth to claim that Medicare is offering free dental care
","Open enrollment is underway for certain private Medicare plans, and it has brought an onslaught of misinformation about what benefits are available from the traditional federal health insurance program for senior citizens and those with disabilities.  ""Biden announces Medicare stimulus that provides free dental work to all Seniors who need it! Crowns and implants included,"" says a Jan. 6 post on Facebook. The post links to a website that says senior citizens can receive free dental work if they apply by Jan. 31.  The website also says, ""Thanks to this new Medicare update, those aged 64+ are able to take advantage of no-cost dental work. This includes crowns, implants, x-rays, fillings, cleanings, and more!""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is wrong. Biden did not announce a Medicare stimulus for dental work; footage in the post of him speaking is from before he was elected president. And free dental work is not available through traditional Medicare insurance.  Some private insurance companies sell certain Medicare plans, called Medicare Advantage, that are allowed to offer coverage for dental work. The plans must be purchased and coverage varies.  Video footage in the post shows Biden saying, in part, ""So here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs, gets us universal coverage quickly, when Americans desperately need it, now."" But the clip is from a June 25, 2020, campaign appearance, when Biden spoke about ""the Affordable Care Act and his plan to make it available to every American,"" according to C-SPAN. By law, Medicare cannot cover most dental care or dental procedures, according to a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That includes cleanings, fillings, tooth extractions, dentures and dental plates. There are some limited exceptions, such as certain dental services provided in a hospital setting as part of another covered procedure, the spokesperson said. An example would be reconstruction of a jaw following an accidental injury.  Biden’s stalled Build Back Better social-spending bill originally included a proposal to add dental, hearing and vision coverage to the traditional Medicare program. But the dental portion of the proposal was scrapped during early negotiations.  Medicare Advantage plans from private insurance companies are allowed to offer coverage for things that aren't covered by original Medicare, including dental care. But unlike the post’s claim that dental work will be free to all seniors, the Medicare Advantage plans must be purchased, and coverage varies by plan.  The Facebook post, on a Facebook page called Latest Medicare, links to a website called LatestMedi.com, which is a single webpage with a question asking users whether they are older than 64. Whether users click yes or no, the link leads to the same place, a website called Medicareplan.com, which indicates it is owned and operated by Assurance IQ, an insurance company.  Media inquiries regarding Assurance IQ are directed to Prudential, which purchased the company in 2019. We contacted Prudential for comment but have not received a reply.  A Facebook post says, ""Biden announces Medicare stimulus that provides free dental work to all Seniors who need it! Crowns and implants included.""  Biden did not make such an announcement; footage in the post of him speaking is from before he was elected president.  Free dental work is not available through traditional Medicare insurance.

No, Biden, Stalin didn’t say the same thing about counting votes
","Though divided by countries, decades and ideologies, former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and President Joe Biden are being compared in a recent Facebook post that looks at the purported words of both men.  ""It’s not who votes that counts,"" Stalin supposedly said. ""It’s who counts the votes.""  Biden, meanwhile, is quoted as saying: ""The struggle’s no longer just who gets to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s start with Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union for nearly three decades. In 2019, we checked a similar claim that he said: ""It is enough that the people know there was an election. The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.""  We rated that attribution false because there’s no authoritative source that proves Stalin said it. The abbreviated version that appears in this Facebook post also lacks a credible citation.  Members of an editorial board for the Stalin Digital Archive, a database of documents and images that resulted from a collaboration between the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History and Yale University Press, have told us that they don’t think Stalin said this, or anything close to it.  J. Arch Getty, a history professor at UCLA, said he wasn’t aware of any original source for the quote.  ""In my extensive archival research in Stalin’s personal archive, I found nothing like this,"" Getty said. ""There are many apocryphal quotes wrongly attributed to Stalin and I think this is one of them."" ""Almost certainly apocryphal,"" agreed James Harris, a senior lecturer in modern European history at the University of Leeds in England. ""Many things that are attributed to Stalin are false,"" warned Ron Suny, a professor of social and political history at the University of Michigan.  But Mark Kramer, director of the Cold War studies program at Harvard University, pointed us to something close to the various voting statements that have been attributed to Stalin. In memoirs written after his retirement, Stalin’s former personal secretary, Boris Bazhanov, claimed Stalin said:  ""Я считаю, что совершенно неважно, кто и как будет в партии голосовать; но вот что чрезвычайно важно, это кто и как будет считать голоса.""  It translates to: ""I regard it as completely unimportant who in the party will vote and how, but it is extremely important who will count the votes and how."" Bazhanov said Stalin was talking about the voting procedures for higher organs of the Communist Party, according to Kramer. ""There is no way to know for sure whether he is accurately recounting Stalin’s words, if Stalin in fact said such a thing,"" Kramer said. ""Hence, I regard this as a statement attributed to Stalin by his former secretary Boris Bazhanov."" David Brandenberger, a history professor at the University of Richmond, said Bazhanov fled the Soviet Union in 1928 and then published his ""rather unreliable muckraking memoir in 1930."" ""Most experts consider Bazhanov’s Stalin quotation to be apocryphal,"" he said. Now for Biden.  The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions about the post, and searching for the exact quote that appears in it, we found only one hit: a Reddit post. But Biden has made similar remarks on several occasions, referring to his concerns about the threat of election subversion. In July, for example, Biden said: ""It’s no longer just who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible voters to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote — who gets to count whether or not your vote counted at all. It’s about moving from independent election administrators who work for the people to polarized state legislatures and partisan actors who work for political parties. To me, this is simple. This is election subversion. It’s the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history. Never before have they decided who gets to count — count — what votes count.""  ""This struggle is no longer just over who gets to vote, or making it easier for eligible people to vote,"" Biden said in a video his account tweeted in October. ""It’s about who gets to count the votes — whether they should count at all. Jim Crow in the 21st century is now a sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion.""  In December he said: ""Today, the right to vote and the rule of law are under unrelenting assault from Republican governors, attorney generals, secretaries of state, state legislators. They’re following my predecessor deep into the abyss. The struggle is no longer just who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible people to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all. It’s a sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion. It’s un-American, it’s un-democratic, it’s unpatriotic. And, sadly, it is not unprecedented now."" And speaking to reporters on Jan. 13 after meeting the Senate Democratic Caucus, Biden said: ""State legislative bodies continue to change the law not as to who can vote, but who gets to count the vote — count the vote. Count the vote! It’s about election subversion, not just whether or not people get to vote. Who counts the vote? That’s what this is about. That’s what makes this so different than anything else we’ve ever done.""    We sought some insight from the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit law and public policy institute at the New York University’s law school. Wendy Weiser, vice president of the group’s democracy program, said there’s been a push in some states to ""politicize the election administration process and to put partisans in a position where they might be able to engage in election sabotage.""  In other words: Legislation like a bill in Arizona that would have empowered state legislatures to reject the results of an election, or a Texas bill that would have granted that power to an elected, partisan judge, according to the center.  But Biden’s comments were criticizing these efforts, Weiser said — not endorsing them. And suggesting that what he said is similar to a Russian dictator’s election policies ""seems very implausible as an interpretation, and just not remotely believable."" Even if Stalin said the words about counting votes that have been attributed to him — and experts have told us they don’t think he did — context matters. Stalin consolidated power and oversaw an election that only allowed uncontested candidates. Biden, who is lobbying for the passage of voting rights legislation backed by Democrats, has been speaking out against efforts he says will give non-neutral parties control over election outcomes.  We rate this post False.  CORRECTION: This story was updated to correct the title of David Brandenberger.

Blog post ignores important context about COVID-19 immunity study
","A blog post claims that according to a study, people who are unvaccinated and previously infected with COVID-19 have better protection against the coronavirus than some fully vaccinated people. ""BOMBSHELL: The CDC admits that natural immunity from prior infections is superior to vaccinated immunity alone,"" the Jan. 19 post claims, citing a study from the federal health agency Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The blog post gives the impression that COVID-19 vaccination is not helpful for people who have had the virus, and that previously infected people will be able to avoid hospitalization and death if they get COVID-19 again. But that ignores the limited scope of the study and dismisses the conclusion made by researchers — that vaccination can help prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death.  A previous COVID-19 infection does not guarantee that a person will not need medical care if they get the virus again. The blog post cites a CDC study that looked at how people fared against the COVID-19 delta variant between May and November 2021. The delta variant was first reported in India before making its way to the United States in March 2021, according to the CDC. Researchers looked at infection and hospitalization rates among four groups of people in New York and California: Researchers found that people who had a natural immunity from a previous COVID-19 infection were better protected against the virus during the delta-fueled surge than vaccinated people who had never been infected. But the CDC offered several caveats about its analysis.  The CDC said it completed its study before the extensive spread of the more infectious omicron variant, ""for which vaccine or infection-derived immunity might be diminished."" The study also happened when most people didn’t have access to a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, which would provide additional protection against the virus. The study also had a limited sample size and did not include information about the severity of previous infections or factor in deaths from the virus.  The CDC study’s main takeaway ""clearly shows"" that vaccination is the safest form of protection against COVID-19, and it provides additional protection for people who have already been infected, Dr. Erica Pan, state epidemiologist for the California Department of Public Health, told PolitiFact. ""It shows that people who remain unvaccinated are at the greatest risk of hospitalization and death,"" she said. ""Outside of this (CDC) study, recent data on the highly contagious omicron variant shows that getting a booster provides significant additional protection against infection, hospitalization and death."" Another CDC report, from October 2021, affirmed that people who have been infected with the virus should still get vaccinated. Vaccinations coupled with a prior infection provide stronger protections against severe disease, hospitalization and death related to the virus than natural immunity alone.  A study from the Mayo Clinic found that unvaccinated people who have previously been infected are twice as likely to get the virus again as those who are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, a Johns Hopkins Medicine study shows that a fully vaccinated person who has been previously infected will have higher levels of antibodies that can help stave off another COVID-19 infection than an unvaccinated person who has had the virus. A blog post claims, ""the CDC admits that natural immunity from prior infections is superior to vaccinated immunity alone.""  The post is misleading and omits key details.  CDC researchers found that during the COVID-19 surge driven by the delta variant, unvaccinated people who had already had the virus were less likely to get COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people who never had the disease. However, the study concluded that unvaccinated people are still at a high risk of reinfection and that the best defense against the virus remains being fully vaccinated.  The study was done prior to the surge from the omicron variant and before COVID-19 vaccine booster shots became widely available.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975BF600>],/factchecks/2022/jan/26/blog-posting/blog-post-ignores-important-context-about-covid-19/

Numbers back Joni Ernst claim of record Iowa voter turnout
","U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, spent time this past week defending Republican-led efforts to beat back Democrat-led proposals for how elections are handled in the United States. Speaking on ABC News’ ""This Week"" Sunday morning news program, Ernst told co-anchor Martha Raddatz: ""I would also say, since we have put a number of the voting laws into place over the last several years — voter ID is one of those — we've actually seen voter participation increase, even in off-election years."" She was talking about Iowa when making the comment. And, indeed, Iowa’s 2020 election attracted record-high turnout of 1.7 million voters, with a little more than 1 million voting by absentee ballot. In 2018, when state offices were on the non-presidential year ballot in Iowa, 1.3 million people voted, 547,200 by absentee ballot, state election records show. Iowa turnout hit a record for off-year voting in 2021, when 425,000 Iowans cast ballots for school board and local elections, the Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate’s office reported. Voter turnout in the off-year 2019 election reached 359,000. The 2021 total amounted to a little fewer than 20% of eligible voters — not great for elections Pate says are important because of their local impact, but an improvement from when city and school elections were held separately, Kevin Hall, Pate’s spokesperson, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. Before a change in Iowa law, effected in 2019, Iowa school board elections were held in September during odd-numbered years. Some context is needed for the 2020 election turnout, because Iowans had more options for casting votes than in previous years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, election officials sent absentee ballot request forms to every active registered voter in Iowa that year for what Pate said were safety concerns during the pandemic. County election officials used drop-box guidelines to ensure that absentee votes were cast. Rules for drop-offs varied county to county before the 2021 law enacted uniform rules. Presidential election years traditionally draw more voters, but Iowa’s 2020 efforts to get more to vote absentee affected that turnout, state election officials said.  ""I believe Secretary Pate’s mailing of absentee ballot request forms to every active registered voter ahead of the June 2020 primary election unquestionably helped propel that to record turnout due to the uncertainty of COVID and many Iowans choosing to vote absentee,"" Hall wrote to PolitiFact Iowa. The ABC News appearance wasn’t the first time Ernst, who ran Montgomery County’s elections as auditor from 2005 to 2011, had made her point about Iowa’s election laws not negatively affecting turnout. She wrote in her Jan. 14, 2022, newsletter: ""In 2017, when the Iowa legislature modernized our state’s election laws — which included requiring voter ID — many Democrats warned the law was ‘dangerous,’ an ‘unnecessary hurdle,’ and a ‘significant barrier’ for anyone who is not a white male. They could not have been further from the truth.  Hall said Iowa does not have statewide data on people turned away for failing to have an identification card. The state gives registered voters who don't have an Iowa driver’s license or other picture identification free Voter ID PIN cards and allows another person to attest to the voter’s identity, he said. The law began with a soft rollout in 2018, when voters who didn’t have a photo ID signed an oath attesting to their identity, before it was implemented fully in 2019.   Iowans could vote as far out as 29 days before Election Day in 2020, which was fewer than the 40 days allowed in elections up to 2017, the year to which Ernst refers in her newsletter. The national average for early voting in person is 23 days, up one day from what it was nationally in 2021. The time to cast an absentee ballot in Iowa was shortened by the 2021 election law to 20 days and those ballots now must arrive at the county auditor’s office by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Before the new law, ballots could be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day and arriving at county auditors’ offices by noon the following Monday. County auditors in Iowa reported receiving more than 6,000 Iowa absentee ballots after Election Day in 2020 that counted then but would not under the 2021 law. Other changes were made, too, in 2021. Voters wanting absentee ballots need to request them and no longer can rely on county auditors sending one unsolicited. On Election Day, Iowa’s polls close at 8 p.m. instead of 9 p.m., as had been the case.   We reported previously that Republican and Democratic party leaders said Iowa’s election laws before and after the 2020 election promoted election integrity and were sound. But Republicans lawmakers said when approving the GOP-backed 2021 law that Iowans wanted changes to ensure that elections were secure. Democrats said elections were secure and the new law would drive some voters from the polls.   The American Civil Liberties Union in Iowa disputes Republican claims that voter ID laws like Iowa’s are fair. Having an ID requires drivers’ licenses or some other form of registration with a photo, having another person in the voting district attest to the person’s identity or filing Election Day registration documents. About 11% of Iowa’s adults didn’t have a drivers’ license, according to a 2014 congressional report, and those wanting a picture ID for voting have to endure bureaucracy, take off work during business hours, get child care and someone to drive them to get the ID, the ACLU says. Registered voters in Iowa without a driver's license or non-operator ID are automatically mailed a voter ID card from the Secretary of State's office, and people with IDs can request them for free. Photos are not required on the cards. Ernst said voter turnout has gone up in Iowa since the state’s Republican-led Legislature enacted tighter voting laws. The numbers confirm the claim.  Voting in 2018 was done in Iowa with less time than in previous years for absentee ballots and a required picture ID because of a 2017 state law. The same was true in 2019. The 2021 off-year turnout was a record after more changes that reduced the time for casting absentee ballots from 29 days to 20 days. Turnout reached records for off-year elections, thanks in large part to combining school and local elections, elections officials say. Turnout reached an all-time record with the 2020 presidential election, too, although special efforts to get voters to cast absentee ballots during the pandemic in 2020 figure into that year’s turnout. We rate this claim True. EDITOR'S NOTE: We updated this story Jan. 27 to clarify information about Iowa's voter ID requirements. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C223700>],/factchecks/2022/jan/26/joni-ernst/numbers-back-joni-ernst-claim-record-iowa-voter-tu/

John Stockton’s claim that ‘hundreds’ of athletes are abruptly dying from COVID-19 vaccines is bogus
","NBA All-Star John Stockton made headlines after he revealed in a recent interview that his alma mater, Gonzaga University, suspended his basketball season tickets after he refused to comply with the school’s mask mandate for sporting events.  Masks aren’t Stockton’s only issue. The former Utah Jazz player has detailed his stance against COVID-19 vaccines and lockdowns for some time and appeared in a 2021 documentary called ""Covid and the Vaccine: Truth, Lies and Misconceptions Revealed.""  Now, he’s made a series of false claims about the pandemic in an interview with his hometown newspaper the Spokesman-Review in Spokane, Washington, and notably repeated a persistent myth about professional athletes abruptly dying from the vaccines. ""And I think it’s highly recorded now, there’s 150 I believe now — it’s over 100 professional athletes dead, professional athletes, the prime of their life, dropping dead that are vaccinated, right on the pitch, right on the field, right on the court,"" Stockton told the newspaper on Jan. 23. PolitiFact could not reach Stockton to ask him about his evidence. But we have debunked similar claims that said professional athletes were supposedly collapsing due to heart issues brought on by the COVID-19 vaccines, and while the narrative continues to be spread by critics of the pandemic like Stockton, there is still no credible evidence to support it.  Previous lists of athletes who purportedly died from the COVID-19 vaccines have included people who hadn’t died or hadn’t gotten the vaccine. There have been no official reports linking the vaccines to heart issues in athletes, and multiple sports cardiologists have called the claims unfounded.  ""To date, I am not aware of a single COVID vaccine-related cardiac complication in the professional sports,"" said Matthew Martinez, a sports cardiologist who works with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, National Hockey League and Major League Soccer and who is the director of sports cardiology at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey. The same goes for Jonathan Kim, an associate professor of medicine and chief of sports cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta. ""I am not aware of any reports that vaccines in athletes are causing cardiac issues,"" he said. While the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines have been well documented, the shots have been associated with inflammation of the heart muscle, called myocarditis, with teenage boys and young men most likely to be affected. But the risk is very low, and most cases are mild with a quick recovery. Doctors say the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of myocarditis. While still rare, the risk of myocarditis also appears to be higher following a COVID-19 infection, with one study finding that boys and young men infected with the virus are up to six times more likely to develop the heart condition than those who have received the vaccine. The CDC says it has not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that the COVID-19 vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths, outside of nine confirmed deaths following the Janssen vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. These deaths resulted from complications of thrombosis, a rare and serious adverse reaction involving blood clots, the agency said.  One person who appeared in previous lists about athletes who died while playing is Italian soccer player Giuseppe Perrino. But Perrino’s death hasn’t been linked to the COVID-19 vaccines. He died of a heart attack on June 2 while playing in a soccer game honoring his brother, who had died of a heart attack while cycling in 2018. A headline on a news story about Perrino’s death reads, ""Heart attack kills Giuseppe Perrino like brother Rocco."" Stories about his death do not mention COVID-19 vaccination. Another person cited, Dutch speed skater Kjeld Nuis, 32, did have a heart problem in July 2021 a week after he received the COVID-19 vaccine, according to news coverage at the time, but he didn’t die. Nuis posted on Instagram later that month saying that he was fine and that he was at training camp. He did not say whether he believed his COVID-19 vaccination contributed to his heart problem or whether it was linked to his athletic activity. Nuis had tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020.  Other examples include: Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen, 29, collapsed during a match on June 12, and his team director said he wasn’t vaccinated for COVID-19. He is still alive. Former French soccer player, Franck Berrier, 37, died of a heart attack in August while playing tennis — two years after retiring from soccer because of heart problems. Stories about his death do not mention any link to COVID-19 vaccination. Keyontae Johnson, a 22-year-old University of Florida basketball player, collapsed on Dec. 12, 2020, days before the COVID-19 vaccine was made available to people in the U.S. His collapse wasn’t related to COVID-19, according to a Feb. 3, 2021, statement from his family. A young athlete experiencing cardiac arrest is not common, but it’s also not unprecedented. And there are different reasons an athlete might collapse. Michael Emery, co-director of the Cleveland Clinic Sports Cardiology Center, said that dehydration, heat stroke and genetic heart conditions, among other factors, can lead to collapse. NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar criticized Stockton over his remarks.  ""I think John’s reaction to the vaccine is extreme and not based on reality or facts,"" Abdul-Jabbar told CNN. ""If John could just check the facts out, he would understand that this vaccine is saving lives and preventing people from having serious reactions to the virus. It won’t eliminate the virus overnight, but it will stop people from dying and will stop people from becoming seriously ill.""  Stockton claimed over 100 professional athletes who are vaccinated are ""dropping dead, right on the pitch, right on the field, right on the court."" This is not backed up by any science or actual data. There have been no official reports linking the vaccines to heart issues in athletes and sports cardiologists said they haven’t seen athletes collapse after getting vaccinated against the virus. Lists of athletes this has supposedly happened to have included people who didn’t die, didn’t get the vaccine, or had a family history of heart issues.

Wisconsin legislators did not vote to remove Biden’s electoral votes.
","The 2020 presidential election results have been checked, affirmed and certified every way they’re supposed to be, but futile efforts to overturn them keep popping up, and feeding misinformation. In Wisconsin, Republican state Rep. Timothy Ramthun introduced a resolution at an Assembly floor session on Jan. 25 seeking to recall the state’s 10 electoral ballots awarded to President Joe Biden, alleging they were fraudulently certified. His effort failed, but that didn’t stop some people on social media from claiming victory. A Facebook post reads: ""It begins. Wisconsin Assembly votes to remove electoral votes from Biden,"" above a link to an article from United America First. The headline says, ""BOMBSHELL: Wisconsin Assembly Votes to Withdraw Its 10 Electors for Joe Biden in 2020 Election."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article links to another article by the conservative outlet The Gateway Pundit, which says the Assembly voted to advance Ramthun’s resolution. That is not what happened. There was no vote. Here’s what Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, a Republican, tweeted late Tuesday night: ""Disinformation spreads quickly. Here’s what happened in the assembly tonight: “Disinformation spreads quickly. Here’s what happened in the assembly tonight: • Ramthun introduced a resolution with zero support (no cosponsors) • B/c it was a privileged resolution, it has to be referred to committee. It was referred to Rules • There was no vote on it.” Here’s how the Wisconsin Assembly handles privileged resolutions, according to its rulebook:  ""Any resolution or joint resolution relating to the officers, members, former members, procedures, or organization of the assembly or legislature is privileged in that it may be offered under any order of business by a member who has the floor and may be taken up immediately before all other proposals, unless referred by the presiding officer to a standing committee or to the calendar."" So Steineke, as required, referred Ramthun’s resolution to the Rules Committee he chairs. It appears he has no interest in moving the resolution forward. Earlier on Jan. 25, he tweeted that Ramthun’s attempt to recall Wisconsin’s presidential electors is illegal and unconstitutional. ""As chair of the Rules Committee, there is ZERO chance I will advance this illegal resolution,"" he tweeted, with the hashtag #EndofStory. Ramthun has been a vocal denier of Biden’s election victory and was recently disciplined by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos for making false election claims, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  Biden won the state by more than 20,000 votes and there has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud. A recount of state results actually awarded Biden 87 more votes, the Associated Press reported. A Facebook post says that Wisconsin state legislators voted to remove electoral votes from President Joe Biden. That didn’t happen. A state lawmaker who disputes Biden’s 2020 victory in Wisconsin introduced a privileged resolution seeking to recall electoral votes from Biden. By Assembly rules, privileged resolutions must either be taken up immediately or referred to a committee. It was referred to the Rules Committee. There was no vote.

GOP Ariz. Senate hopeful Lamon falsely claims that Biden wants to give ‘illegal immigrants’ $450,000
","Businessman Jim Lamon is seeking to win a GOP Senate primary in Arizona, defeat Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly and possibly help Republicans retake control of the Senate. One path he sees is through immigration rhetoric. The political newcomer is running one ad that says Kelly ""supports an open border"" and another that says Kelly ""admits there is no plan to address (the) border crisis.""  Perhaps the most explosive claim, however, attacks President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. A Lamon ad that’s running on Facebook and Instagram shows an image that resembles a bank check and bears the Biden-Harris 2020 campaign logo. The purported check is written to ""Illegal Immigrants"" for $450,000.  Text around the check says: ""Do you support giving illegal immigrants $450,000 checks?"" Together, they give the impression that this was something Biden wants to do. The ad, which started running Jan. 11 and was still active as of Jan. 26, links to a page that solicits donations to Lamon’s campaign.  But the claim is inaccurate, and the basis for it is several weeks out of date.  The claim relates to the aftermath of a Trump administration policy that led to thousands of children, including infants, being separated from their parents upon their arrival at the southern border. The policy was a key component of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, aimed at deterring people from coming to the U.S. without permission. But it also affected families who were seeking asylum due to persecution or security fears in their home countries. In those cases, they were following the protocols for seeking asylum. Amid a public outcry, Trump in June 2018 issued an executive order to keep children and parents together in detention. Federal authorities have since struggled to reunite all the families who were separated because of poor recordkeeping when the policy was in place, and trouble locating parents who had been deported. Biden denounced the policy as a ""moral and national shame"" and set up a task force to coordinate reunification of families. In late October, news reports said the Biden administration was in talks to settle lawsuits filed on behalf of parents and children who were separated.

""Many of the lawsuits describe lasting mental-health problems for the children from the trauma of the months without their parents in harsh conditions, including anxiety, a fear of strangers and nightmares,"" the Wall Street Journal reported. The settlement offers being discussed were up to $450,000 a person, the reports said. On Nov. 3, a few days after the news reports, Biden was asked by a reporter about the prospect of $450,000 payments.  ""That’s not going to happen,"" Biden replied.  The next day, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden had reacted to ""the dollar figure,"" but that he was ""perfectly comfortable"" with the Justice Department trying to settle the cases. She said the department ""made clear to the plaintiffs that the reported figures are higher than anywhere that a settlement can land."" On Dec. 16, news reports said the Justice Department had pulled out of the settlement talks. We emailed Lamon’s campaign asking for information to back up the statement in his ad. A reply referred to a fact-check we did on a claim about Biden and the talks that was made in October — before Biden’s remark and before the settlement talks ended. But even that fact-check cited reporting that Biden had ""​​seemingly expressed disagreement with the $450,000 figure."" Lamon gained attention earlier this month with another ad that attacked Biden with a phrase that has become a proxy for an anti-Biden epithet. Yahoo said it refused to run the ad because the phrase is ""overly inflammatory and offensive,"" according to news reports. Lamon said the Biden-Harris administration ""wants to hand out $450,000 to illegal immigrants."" It was reported in October that the Biden administration was in talks to potentially offer settlements of up to $450,000 a person to resolve lawsuits filed on behalf of parents and children who were separated at the border under the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policy. The families included people who were legally seeking asylum in the U.S. When asked a few days later about the $450,000 figure, Biden said, ""That’s not going to happen."" By Dec. 16, settlement talks ended. We found no evidence to support the claim that the Biden administration wants to hand out $450,000 to any group of immigrants.  We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096CA35C0>],/factchecks/2022/jan/26/jim-lamon/gop-ariz-senate-hopeful-lamon-falsely-claims-biden/

There’s no evidence Americans pay $155 billion each year to cover the cost of illegal immigration
","Another year, another false claim about the cost of illegal immigration going viral.  Although former President Donald Trump is no longer in office trying to rally support for his border wall, the debate about illegal immigration continues, and one old immigration post is regaining traction on Facebook. ""Chuck Schumer: ‘why should American citizens be responsible to pay 5 billion to fund the wall?’"" asks a screenshot of a Tweet that was shared on Facebook. ""Better question. Why should American citizens be responsible to pay $155 billion annually to make sure illegal immigrants are taken care of better than American citizens?"" The 2019 post, which people were sharing and commenting on as recently as Jan. 20, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The original tweet came from an account that has since been suspended and we could not find the date it was first posted, but Sen. Chuck Schumer was frequently at odds in 2018 and 2019 with then-President Donald Trump over the president’s plan to build a wall at the southern U.S. border. In years past, PolitiFact has debunked claims that illegal immigration costs taxpayers $113 billion, $130 billion and even $250 billion annually. We searched news clips and asked experts, but PolitiFact was unable to find a report that estimated illegal immigration costs American taxpayers $155 billion annually.  ""The internet is full of a wide range of estimates of the costs of unauthorized immigrants and also of the benefits they bring to the United States,"" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute. ""These estimates all focus on different types of costs and contributions, and many do not give a clear explanation of their methods.""  She said she was not aware of ""any good, well-researched and well-documented estimates"" of the costs and benefits of immigrants illegally in the U.S. that she could recommend.  Even so, she said that the claim seemed far-fetched: ""$155 billion sounds high for the estimated costs, but it is difficult to assess this claim without knowing what data and information was used to generate that estimate."" Regardless of the cost, that doesn’t mean immigrants in the country illegally are ""taken care of better than American citizens."" In many cases, immigrants in the country illegally are ineligble for the assistance programs available to U.S. citizens. Determining the exact cost of illegal immigration is difficult, but some analysts have tried. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, produced a 2013 report that estimated that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally ""impose a net fiscal burden of around $54.5 billion per year."" But that estimate, which is now eight years old, is still more than $100 million off from the post’s claim.  One of the highest more recent estimates available comes from a 2017 report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform or FAIR, a group that advocates for reducing legal and illegal immigration. Its report concluded that ""In 2017, the total cost of illegal immigration for the United States – at the federal, state, and local levels – was approximately $116 billion."" The authors of the report said they estimated the total cost of illegal immigration by subtracting the tax revenue paid by immigrants here illegally from ""the total economic impact of illegal migration,"" though there is no clear consensus on the overall economic impact. Critics of FAIR’s 2017 report said the organization vastly overestimated the net cost of illegal immigration.  The Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy think tank, called the report ""fatally flawed"" and published a detailed critique of FAIR’s work: ""FAIR’s report reaches that conclusion by vastly overstating the costs of illegal immigration, undercounting the tax revenue they generate, inflating the number of illegal immigrants, counting millions of U.S. citizens as illegal immigrants, and by concocting a method of estimating the fiscal costs that is rejected by all economists who work on this subject."" Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that uses data to argue for low levels of immigration, said he conducted his most comprehensive analysis of the cost of immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2017.  He said he tried ""to take into account all their taxes and all the services they use in their lifetime, while excluding U.S. born descendants."" Camarota noted that his lifetime estimate heavily discounts future costs and more heavily weights current costs.  In 2018, he adjusted that estimate to 2018 dollars, suggesting that each immigrant in the U.S. illegally costs nearly $70,000 during their lifetime.  ""The numbers are large, but remember it is over a lifetime,"" he said. When asked what immigrants in the country illegally cost each year, on average, Camarota said ""​​a back of the envelope estimate"" based on his lifetime cost analysis would fall somewhere between about $24 billion and $48 billion annually, depending on the methodology used.  That’s significantly below the $116 billion estimate reached in the FAIR report and the $155 billion claimed in the Facebook post. A Facebook post claimed American citizens ""pay $155 billion annually to make sure illegal immigrants are taken care of better than American citizens."" We couldn’t find evidence suggesting illegal immigration costs $155 billion annually.  Determining the exact cost of illegal immigration is complex and a source of ongoing debate among experts. Available reports estimate that immigrants in the U.S. illegally cost less than $155 billion annually — with one of the highest totals estimating a cost of $116 billion annually. Regardless of the cost, that doesn’t mean immigrants in the country illegally are ""taken care of better than American citizens.""

5G health concerns unfounded, not linked to aviation issues
","A social media post draws a misleading comparison between humans and airplanes to raise concerns about the U.S. deployment of 5G wireless technology. The Jan. 19 Facebook post says, ""If the FAA is worried about what the 5G deployment will do to the planes, what do you think it will do to our bodies?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post implies that the Federal Aviation Administration’s concerns about 5G causing problems for airplanes are also applicable to humans; that is inaccurate. The concern about 5G is that it could cause wireless interference with instruments onboard aircraft operating on nearby frequencies, potentially imperiling safety. And current evidence does not support the claim that 5G technology is a health hazard. 5G, which stands for the fifth generation of cellular networks, is not brand new; several carriers have been using the networks for a few years. Until now, the 5G networks used either low-band spectrum, with speeds that don’t differ much from 4G, or high-band millimeter wave, which has limited coverage. Beginning Jan. 19, Verizon and AT&T introduced C-band 5G networks, which operate at a frequency range between 3.7 and 3.98 gigahertz, according to the technology media site CNET. ""That frequency falls under what is known as midband spectrum."" Midband spectrum offers faster speeds than 4G and better coverage than high-band millimeter wave, CNET reported. For customers with compatible cell phones, the new network means downloading a movie in seconds or playing graphics-heavy games with no delays. But the 3.7-to-3.98-gigahertz frequency range for the C-band networks in the U.S. is where the aviation difficulties come into play. Aircraft use an electronic instrument called radar altimeter to help gauge altitude. It’s important in certain situations, such as when pilots are landing in poor weather conditions. Radar altimeters operate on a spectrum between 4.2 and 4.4 GHz. ""The problem is that wireless signals are not 100% confined to the bands of spectrum they're assigned to,"" Randall Berry, a professor of electrical engineering at Northwestern University, told NBC News. ""The concern here is that signals from the 5G band could leak over into the band that airlines are using and confuse these altimeters."" In European countries where midband spectrum 5G networks have already been rolled out, the networks use a slower range of frequencies, between 3.4 and 3.8 GHz. And some countries have restricted the placement of 5G antennas near airfields, according to CNN. For now, Verizon and AT&T are temporarily limiting C-band 5G services around some airports while they work with federal agencies to find a longer-term solution. Regardless of where or how 5G is rolled out, current evidence does not support the claim that the technology is harmful to people’s health. The radiofrequency waves used by 5G networks ""are higher frequency (higher energy) than those used by older generations, (but) they are still forms of non-ionizing radiation, so they still lack the ability to directly damage DNA,"" according to the American Cancer Society. Non-ionizing radiation, which includes FM radio waves and microwaves, is not harmful and is different from ionizing forms of radiation, such as X-rays and ultraviolet rays, which can be harmful. The World Health Organization, which has been investigating the potential health impacts of radio frequency exposure since 1996, concurs: ""To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies."" A Facebook post says, ""If the FAA is worried about what the 5G deployment will do to the planes, what do you think it will do to our bodies?"" The post inaccurately implies that the FAA’s concerns about radio interference are also applicable to human health. That’s not the case. The concern about 5G is that it could cause wireless interference with instruments onboard airplanes, potentially imperiling safety. Current evidence does not support the claim that 5G technology is a health hazard. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809770AB80>],/factchecks/2022/jan/25/facebook-posts/5g-health-concerns-unfounded-not-linked-aviation-i/

Image of news broadcast with mannequin in hospital is doctored
","A social media post uses a doctored image to make the baseless claim that news about hospitals being overwhelmed by patients with the omicron variant of COVID-19 is trickery. The image, shared in a Jan. 7 post on Instagram, has been altered to look like a screenshot of a TV news broadcast. It includes a photo of a medical setting with a mannequin that has no left arm lying on a bed under a plastic tent; the logo of French station BFM TV; and a chyron written in French. A headline above the image says, ""France: Hospitals are so saturated with the omicron variant that there is not even time to put the arms to the mannequins for the media."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image of the purported news broadcast was assembled from other images, and does not depict a real TV news story. And the photo of the mannequin was from a simulation that did not depict real events. The caption on the Instagram post furthers the falsehood that the COVID-19 pandemic has been exaggerated or manufactured. It says, ""Why did I see so many mannequins on TV during a so-called pandemic? That’s like the fifth time I’ve seen one of those LMAO."" The hashtag says #Plandemic, a reference to a 2020 video that was full of conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. The hospital photo in the image is a screenshot from an April 2020 promotional video by the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute in Canada; it shows medical staff practicing procedures on a mannequin. The video is labeled as a simulation. The news station logo and chyron are from a Nov. 22 television news broadcast by BFM TV. The segment was about French Prime Minister Jean Castex testing positive for COVID-19 and showed Castex standing behind a podium.

Doctors dispute claim that COVID-19 pneumonia is actually an allergic reaction
","It's well known that a severe case of COVID-19 can cause a series of complications, including pneumonia, an infection that causes inflammation of the air sacs in the lung. But according to a claim spreading on social media, pneumonia triggered by COVID-19 isn't pneumonia at all, but rather a type of fast-occurring allergic reaction to the virus. Multiple Facebook users reposted a message claiming that the condition occurring in COVID-19 patients is really ""mast cell degranulation"" of the lungs.  ""Put simply, it's an allergic reaction occurring after the viral phase ends, most likely to something in the viral particles left over after the body deals with the virus,"" the post says. ""The reason you can't tell it's an allergic reaction is because it's happening in the lungs, so you experience only symptoms of chest tightness and fatigue!"" The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The Facebook posts cite a doctor's findings as evidence. However, doctors we spoke to disputed the theory, and reiterated that COVID-19 pneumonia is just that — pneumonia.  For clarification on the term ""mast cell degranulation,"" we turned to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. It describes mast cells as allergy cells responsible for immediate allergic reactions. During an allergic reaction, these cells are triggered to release ""mediators,"" which can bring on symptoms of an allergy, such as swelling or shortness of breath. The release of these mediators is called degranulation. The Facebook post cites the findings of Dr. Shankara Chetty, who is described as a natural science biologist and general family practitioner in South Africa.  Chetty has become known for his belief that COVID-19 is ""allergic in nature."" He has promoted alternative treatments on platforms like YouTube. Other interviews with Chetty have also been published to social media platforms such as Twitter. The posts claim that Chetty had treated thousands of patients and monitored differences in the progression of symptoms between people with regular pneumonia and those with COVID-19 pneumonia. Chetty noticed that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia symptoms suddenly got worse after several days, ""unlike"" regular pneumonia, the posts say. And he observed that the patients’ flow of oxygen wasn’t restricted, but that they faced a rapid restriction in lung expansion, ""unlike pneumonia."" ""It was then that he recognized the similarity this condition had with an allergic reaction,"" the posts read. ""The second an allergic reaction happens, inflammation creates instant symptoms."" The claim is ""unintelligible nonsense,"" said Dr. Mark Schleiss, a pediatrics professor and faculty member in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Minnesota. COVID-19 pneumonia is not an allergic reaction, Schleiss said, but mast cell activation — the triggering of the release of mediators — is one of the body’s reactions to COVID-19 pneumonia. ""Mast cell activation is just a part of the myriad of downstream phenomena that occur with viral pneumonia,"" Schleiss said.  Many things other than allergies can trigger mast cell activation, said Schleiss, including eczema, swelling from an injury, or an infection like pneumonia. It’s a part of the reaction to something — not the cause. He likened the Facebook claim to a person suffering a broken nose from a fistfight, and blaming the redness and swelling on mast cell activation, rather than the punch or the fracture. Dr. Pranatharthi Chandrasekar, division chief of infectious diseases at Wayne State University in Detroit, said people shouldn’t even use the word ""allergy"" in describing COVID-19 pneumonia. That’s not how the illness works.  ""It’s wrong to say. It gives the wrong representation that … the person may be allergic to the virus,"" Chandrasekar said. ""This is (a) virus attacking the body, and in return, the immune system is reacting."" Chandrasekar explained how COVID-19 can turn into pneumonia: Within seven to 10 days, the virus first attacks the throat, and then begins descending into the lungs. It attacks the lungs, which causes viral pneumonia.  ""The immune system is triggered because of the viral illness, so the immune system (goes) astray,"" he said.  Dr. Meilan King Han, professor of medicine in the division of pulmonary and critical care at the University of Michigan, pointed to a published study in the open-access journal Nature. It showed that  COVID-19 has triggered mast cell degranulation, which resulted in hyper-inflammation and injury to the lung. But, Han said, this certainly isn’t the only thing that the virus does to our lungs. Symptoms of COVID-19 induced pneumonia include shortness of breath, increased heart rate and low blood pressure. Houston Methodist, the big hospital and health system, says that COVID-19 pneumonia can occur in both lungs, and recovery can take from several weeks up to many months. Healthline reports that treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia often requires oxygen therapy, and antibiotics if the viral pneumonia causes a bacterial infection.  ""After severe pneumonia, lung capacity is reduced, and muscles may be weak from being so ill,"" Houston Methodist says on its website. Both Chandrasekar and Schleiss agree that COVID-19 induced pneumonia is unlike other forms of pneumonia. But just because it can strike quickly, that doesn’t mean it’s similar to allergies.  ""I have been at the bedside of children who died of COVID pneumonia, I’m sad to say,"" said Schleiss. ""It comes on pretty fast.""  A widespread Facebook claim states that COVID-19 pneumonia is ""actually mast cell degranulation of the lungs,"" which is an allergic reaction.  Doctors we spoke to said there is no basis for the claim.  They said mast cell activation is a part of the body’s reaction to COVID-19 pneumonia. It’s an immune response that can be caused by pneumonia or other triggers, such as an injury or skin condition. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972BAA80>],/factchecks/2022/jan/25/facebook-posts/doctors-dispute-claim-covid-19-pneumonia-actually-/

Claim that the U.S. Navy 'halted' communication between sailors and their families lacks evidence
","A web show host set off alarms on Facebook by posting that the U.S. Navy had suddenly cut off communications between military members and their families. Brad Barton, who hosts a pro-Trump show called ""The Lil’ Talk Show with Brad,"" wrote a brief post on Jan. 21: ""Hearing rumblings that all communications to families from the US Navy have been halted. Something may very well be about to go down y'all!!""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no evidence to substantiate it. PolitiFact reached out to Barton for more information regarding this claim, but he did not respond. Some Facebook users commented on his post that they had, in fact, heard from their family members in the Navy.  Neither the Navy nor the Pentagon would comment on whether any communication blackout between service members and their families had occurred. A Navy spokesperson, Lt. Cmdr. Devin Arneson, said the Navy makes every effort to maintain open communication between sailors and their families. The Navy’s ombudsman program ""plays a vital role in establishing and maintaining current and accurate communication between the command and its family members,"" Arneson said. Communication between military personnel and their families or loved ones can be difficult or restricted at times, the news site Military.com reports. Internet or phone connections can be hindered depending on where the service member is stationed, or if their schedule has changed. Missions could also hinder communication. But we found no evidence for Barton’s claim that the Navy cut off all communication with families of service members.

Biden didn’t ‘exempt’ Congress from vaccine mandate. He simply lacks authority to include them.
","Since President Joe Biden first issued an executive order in September requiring federal workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19, some have expressed outrage at what they wrongly assumed was an exemption given to elected officials. ""Why are elected officials exempt?"" read the caption on a Jan. 22 Facebook post that showed a meme depicting White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki standing in the White House press briefing room. ""Does President Biden’s mandate include Congress?"" read words on the image. Then, below Psaki, a caption explained the supposed answer: ""No, members of Congress are exempt from the vaccine mandate."" Underneath, Morgan Freeman looked off to the side in apparent puzzlement: ""This sh-- right here is why people know the vaccine mandate is a hoax.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden instituted his mandate on Sept. 9, 2021, as the delta variant was raging through the U.S. He ordered that healthcare workers, executive branch workers and contractors who do business with the federal government be vaccinated.  He also ordered private businesses with more than 100 employees to require vaccination or weekly tests for their workers. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that part of the mandate on Jan. 13, saying that Biden overstepped his authority by targeting private businesses. But the court did allow the mandate on health care workers to continue. The mandate for federal contractors is on hold after being blocked by a federal court in December, and a federal judge in Texas on Jan. 21 blocked Biden’s mandate that federal workers be vaccinated. Neither case has been heard by the Supreme Court. While the question of whether Biden’s vaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors can be enforced is for the courts to ultimately decide, the question of why members of Congress are exempt is a simple one: Biden doesn’t have the authority to impose a vaccine mandate on them. ""Another way to think about it is that members of Congress work directly for the people, not for President Biden,"" said David Super, a professor of law and economics at Georgetown Law. ""He therefore has no power to give them orders. The same is true of federal judges."" The U.S. government is divided into three separate, but equal branches of power: the executive, the legislative and judicial branches. Congress makes up the legislative branch, which passes the laws that the executive branch must then enforce. As the name implies, Biden’s executive order only applies to workers in the executive branch of government. It states that ""each agency shall implement, to the extent consistent with applicable law, a program to require COVID-19 vaccination for all of its federal employees, with exceptions only as required by law."" It also defines an agency as an ""executive agency"" under title 5 of the U.S. code, which reads ""for the purpose of this title, ""executive agency"" means an executive department, a government corporation, and an independent establishment. Members of Congress and their staff are not subject. A Facebook post says that Biden gave an exemption to his COVID-19 vaccine mandate to members of Congress. That is not true. Congress belongs to the legislative branch of government, and therefore was never subject to the president’s executive order, which applies only to the executive branch. Biden did not have the authority to mandate vaccines for members of Congress.
