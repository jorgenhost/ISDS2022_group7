Bernie Sanders claim that childhood poverty is cut in half is premature
","Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt., said on an August tour to Republican-led states where he pitched the Senate’s $3.5 trillion budget plan that the American Rescue Plan cut U.S. childhood poverty in half.  One of the stops where he said this was in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sunday, Aug. 29.  ""It is a result of the $300 per month that working parents are now receiving for their young children that we have reduced childhood poverty in the United States by 50%,"" Sanders said. On Feb. 23, before the American Rescue Plan was enacted, President Biden made the same claim, saying the plan’s increased child tax credit would cut childhood poverty in half if the law passed. He, since, has repeated the assertion.  The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,200 and $3,600 for children under six, or $300 a month. The plan also made more people eligible for the credit which increased the total granted to $4,000 for one qualifying individual and $8,000 total for two or more.  Biden’s assertions, repeated by Sanders, are true in one regard: the projected poverty rate for 2021 would cut the rate by more than one-half. But we haven’t been through the year to see whether or not the projection will be true. A U.S. Census Bureau report released Sept. 14 showed the poverty rate for Americans under the age of 18 and younger was 16.1 percent in 2020. That is up from the Census Bureau report of 14.4 percent in poverty in 2019 but lower than any rate before 2019 since 16 percent in 1976. In-depth reporting for the plan previously done by PolitiFact showed that the prediction was made using a poverty reduction analysis report by Columbia University on Jan. 14, 2021.  The Columbia report predicted that the number of people under the age of 18 living in poverty would decrease 51.1 percent because of several proposed policy elements including the expanded Child Tax Credit. The analysis did not account for other policy elements that would impact policy rates like an increased minimum wage, child care assistance and rental assistance.  According to a July 28 report from The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, the projected poverty rate for children in 2021 is 5.6%. Additionally, the report said that federal stimulus checks in general have a larger antipoverty impact than unemployment insurance or means-based benefits. ""If all other programs were in place but the stimulus checks had not been paid, we project 12.4 million more people would be in poverty in 2021,"" the report said.  During the week of March 14, 2020, the number of Iowa families who requested food and financial assistance increased by over 1,000 to 4,672. The same relative week a year before, 3,173 had sought the assistance. By the week of April 4, 2020, 7,342 families had requested assistance.  Alex Carfrae, Iowa Department of Human Services’ public information officer, said that, while the American Rescue Plan is providing direct financial relief to Iowa families, it is too early to know whether or not child poverty in Iowa has dropped since the plan became law.  In 2019, 12.8% of children in Iowa were experiencing poverty, That was down from 13.5% from the previous year.  Carfrae said the Department of Human Services does not keep track of poverty numbers in the state but rather through program utilization.  ""Many of the assistance programs that the DHS administers saw dramatic shifts in utilization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, making any analysis based on DHS programs or enrollment data challenging,"" Carfrae said.  Sanders was specific in his Cedar Rapids statement, that the $300 monthly payment working parents receive has reduced U.S. childhood poverty 50%. He stated that as fact, not a projection.  Researchers from Columbia University and the Urban Institute project that childhood poverty in the U.S. will fall this year by more than one half, from 16.1% in 2020. However, this is just a projection; more than three months remain in 2021, and it will take additional time for official data to be released.  Because this drop is expected by credible research but hasn’t happened yet, we rate the statement Half True. ",/factchecks/2021/sep/15/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-claim-childhood-poverty-cut-half-pr/

No, California Does Not Have 1.8 Million Ineligible Voters
","A false claim is circulating online that California has 1.8 million ineligible registered voters.  The California Globe, a conservative news outlet, published a story in June citing a report by the Election Integrity Project California, a watchdog group that scrutinizes voter registration records. The article has been viewed more than 60,000 times on Facebook since it was posted earlier this summer.  The EIPCa claims that they found ""1,834,789 more registered voters than eligible citizens"" throughout 23 of the Golden State’s 58 counties, which they called ""an indication of increasingly poor list maintenance.""  The group highlighted several counties where they claim to have found an ""astoundingly high number of ineligible registrants,"" including Sacramento, San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, and Alpine counties.  Former State Congressional Candidate Chris Bish tweeted a screenshot of the EIPCa’s letter in July, repeating and proliferating the claim that Sacramento County had more than 37,000 ineligible voters registered.  Bish’s claim has already been debunked by local fact-checkers and election experts say the same about the EIPCa’s false claims, too. Facebook flagged the California Globe article as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) We’ve fact-checked other misleading and erroneous claims made by the ElP in the past, and decided to check out if this claim had any teeth to it.  Our Research In June, EIPCa president Linda Paine sent a letter to the California Secretary of State’s office alleging that the group found more than 1.8 million ineligible voting registrants in California.   The EIPCa determined the total number of eligible citizens per country based on census estimates listed on the Secretary of State’s website as of October 19, 2020. In order to determine the total number of ineligible registered voters, the EIPCa  ""compared the total number of voter registrations (Active plus Inactive) to the number of eligible citizens as listed on the Secretary of State website.""  By this metric the EIPCa determined that 23 of 58 counties in California have more registered voters than citizens eligible to vote, with a total of 1,834,789 ineligible registered voters statewide. The California Globe article flagged San Diego, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Orange, and Alpine counties as having ""an astoundingly high number of ineligible registrants.""  All of the experts we spoke to said that this allegation by the EIPCa is deceptive and relies on misguided and flawed data analysis.  Registrar of Voters for Orange County Neal Kelley said that the data used by the EIPCa was out of date, even at the time that the EIPCa wrote the letter to the Secretary of State.  ""We can tell by some of the data they're presenting that it looks like their data was about three months old,"" Kelley said. ""It does not include same day voter registration, it doesn't include the ebb and flow of voter databases where you have minute-by-minute updates to it."" According to the EIPCa’s letter, they obtained their data on February 9, 2021. But voter registration data is constantly being updated by people at the county and state levels, according to Kelley and other registrars we spoke to across the state.  According to county voter participation statistics compiled by the Secretary of State, there were 25,090,517 Californias who were eligible to vote in the 2020 Presidential election. Of that group, there were 22,047,448 individuals registered to vote — just under 88% of folks who are eligible to vote.  The Secretary of State’s office only counts active voters when tallying up the total number of registered voters per county. Experts say that it is inaccurate to add up active and inactive registered voters, as the EIPCa has done, in order to determine the total number of voters participating in elections.  ""Voters will be given an ‘inactive’ status when a county elections official receives information (for example, from the post office) indicating the voter has moved out of state or mail is returned undeliverable without a forwarding address,"" according to the Secretary of State’s website.   According to experts, including inactive voters inflates the amount of registered voters because some of these inactive voters have moved, have passed away, or haven’t voted in multiple elections.  ""They're concluding that there are more registered voters than eligible voters when it's flawed to include inactive voters in that data. You can't do that,"" Kelley said. ""That's just like basic election 101. You can do that any day of the week and come up with inflated numbers. But what they need to only look at are the active registrations."" The Orange County Registrar of Voters’ website states that ""inactive voters are registered voters and are eligible to vote; however, they do not receive election related mail such as sample ballots and vote-by-mail ballots."" In California, voters must be inactive for a certain period of time in order for their name to be purged from the county’s voter roll, as per the rules stipulated by the National Voter Registration Act. As a result, there are a number of inactive voters on county voter rolls which could make it appear as if there is a greater number of registered voters than people who are eligible to vote.  Jenna Dresner, a spokesperson for California Secretary of State Dr. Shirley Weber, explained that there are a few processes specific to California that make it more difficult for folks to be removed from voter rolls when they are inactive.  The National Voter Registration Act ""outlines vote list maintenance processes designed to protect voters from illegal purges from the voter rolls,"" Dresner wrote in an emailed statement. ""Specifically, the NVRA prohibits removing persons from the voter registration list solely because of a failure to vote and also places restrictions related to the notice and timing on removals from the voter rolls based on a change of residence."" Instead of removing people from voter rolls due to inactivity, those voters are instead designated as ""inactive."" Those voters do not receive election materials or mail-in ballots. In order to reactivate their voter registration, people need to formally contact election officials. If an inactive voter shows up to the polls to vote and they are on the county’s list of inactive registered voters, they may cast a provisional ballot.   Sacramento County currently has about 200,000 inactive registered voters, according to Courtney Bailey, Registrar of Voters for Sacramento County.  ""Yes, if you add the active and inactive together, it does exceed our estimated population count,"" Bailey said. ""But the fact of the matter is, a lot of those voters haven't voted in two general elections."" In their June letter, the EIPCa remarked that the difference between the total registered and eligible voters in California was an indication of poor list maintenance. However, experts on California elections say that is not the case.  Dresner said that the EIPCa’s claims ""recklessly and inaccurately claim that inactive voters are ineligible,"" adding that ""these types of claims unnecessarily erode public confidence in the integrity of our elections."" ""We are going above and beyond what's required in federal and state [law],"" Kelley said. ""We're doing extra audits. We're doing partnerships with the likes of Cal Tech University [The California Institute of Technology], doing third party audits. We're doing all of these things that people just don't take the time to learn about."" Last March, the EIPCa filed a lawsuit against Gov. Gavin Newsom, the California Secretary of State, and nine county registrar of voters over these findings and other claims regarding ""irregularities in California’s 2020 Election.""  However, federal Judge Andre Birotte dismissed the lawsuit last June, writing that the lawsuit amounted to ""an incremental undermining of confidence in the election results, past and future."" All of the voting experts we spoke to mentioned this lawsuit when discussing the validity of the data and claims put forth by the EIPCa.  ""This is the same group, by the way, that sued nine of us counties and the Secretary of State to attempt to overturn the November election results using some of the same data that they shot out in the letter,"" Kelley said. ""The federal court a few weeks ago dismissed the entire case and gave them a stinging rebuke.""  Mike Sanchez, the spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters, added in an email, ""the allegations made by the Election Integrity Project are unfounded and aim to undermine the confidence in the November 2020 General Election results."".  Our Verdict  In June, Election Integrity Project California president Linda Paine sent a letter to the California Secretary of State’s office alleging that the group found more than 1.8 million ineligible voting registrants in California.   The EIPCa combined the number of active and inactive voters on California county voter rolls in order to determine the total number of registered voters in the state. The group then compared that number of total voters to census data showing the total pool of people eligible to vote county by county. By this metric, the EIPCa claimed to have found that there are a significantly greater number of registered voters than there are people eligible to vote in California.  However, California elections experts said that it was misleading and inaccurate to combine the numbers of active and inactive voters on voting rolls in order to determine the amount of people voting in elections throughout the state like the EIPCa has. That’s because inactive voters are not participating in elections or receiving election materials.  The Secretary of State data only counts the amount of active registered voters in their count of individuals registered to vote. According to their county voter participation statistics, there were 25,090,517 Californians who were eligible to vote in the 2020 Presidential election. Of that group, there were 22,047,448 individuals registered to vote — just under 88% of folks who are eligible to vote statewide.  In California, voters must be inactive for a certain period of time in order for their name to be purged from the county’s voter roll, as per the rules stipulated by the National Voter Registration Act. As a result, there are a number of inactive voters on county voter rolls which could make it appear as if there is a greater number of registered voters than people who are eligible to vote. Inactive voters do not receive election materials or mail in ballots, and must follow state protocol in order to start receiving those materials again and participate in elections.  We rated the claim that there are 1.8 million ineligible registered voters in California as Pants on Fire.

A rip on AOC’s dress misses with claim that the top 1% pay 90% of income taxes
","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. used her invitation to the Met Gala — ""the buzziest event in the New York glitterati calendar,"" as Bloomberg Wealth put it — to make a political statement, and she created a buzz that her critics couldn’t resist.  ""TAX THE RICH"" was emblazoned in red letters on the back of the off-the-shoulder white gown she wore to the annual Metropolitan Museum of Art benefit, where tickets cost $30,000 to $35,000.  One image criticizing Ocasio-Cortez on Facebook included a photo of her at the event with her back to the camera, showing the political message. The image claimed she was ""wearing a $10,000 designer dress that says tax the rich, who already pay 97% of the taxes in the United States."" Conservative influencer Christian Walker (son of U.S. Senate candidate and former football player Herschel Walker) made a similar point in calling out the Met Gala’s ""disgusting display of hypocrisy"" on his social media channels.

We weren’t able to find out the cost of the dress, which Ocasio-Cortez said she borrowed from a store in Brooklyn. The store’s founder told CNN she hasn’t calculated a cost. But the claim we’re checking relates to the other part of the post: Do the top 1% really pay the lion’s share of federal income taxes? No. In 2018, 97% of federal income taxes were collected from about half of the taxpayers, according to March 2021 Senate Budget Committee testimony by the Tax Foundation.  It cited the latest figures from the Internal Revenue Service, noting they account for the 2017 tax cuts adopted under President Donald Trump. That top half included people who had an adjusted gross income of more than $43,614. The top 1% — those earning $540,009 or more — accounted for 40% of the federal income taxes paid. The picture looks a little different when talking about all federal taxes. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group, uses a different approach and makes estimates. It divides taxpayers into five income groups, or quintiles, and calculates all federal taxes, including personal income taxes, payroll taxes and the worker and shareholder shares of corporate taxes.  ""By our numbers, 95% of all federal taxes are paid by households in the top two quintiles — those making about $98,000 or more,"" said Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman.  A Facebook post criticizing the message on a dress worn by Ocasio-Cortez said that ""the top 1% pays 90% of income taxes.""

Fact-checking the misleading claim about uncounted ballots in 2020
","Former President Donald Trump and his allies haven’t abandoned their argument that voting by mail can’t be trusted. ""Stunning report: nearly 15 million mail-in ballots were not counted in the 2020 election,"" stated a Sept. 4 Instagram post from a pro-Trump site. The image in the post was a headline on an article from the site, 100percentfedup.com. The article cited a report by the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative group headed by J. Christian Adams, who served on Trump’s short-lived voting integrity commission and has been critical of voting by mail. The group’s report highlights the number of mail ballots that were ""unaccounted for"" because they were undeliverable, rejected or listed in federal data as ""unknown."" Trump touted the foundation’s report in a fundraising email stating: ""We. Cannot. Trust. Mail. In. Ballots."" Trump’s website also promoted Adams’ interview with Breitbart, a conservative news outlet, in which Adams argued that voting by mail is a ""mess."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The reference to a ""stunning report"" gives the impression that a major voting irregularity was uncovered in the report. That’s not the case. Moreover, the post implies that 15 million mail ballots that should have been counted were not tabulated. That’s a misinterpretation of data from a federal report about mailed ballots of ""unknown"" status. It’s an example of how a bit of government data can be twisted to tell a misleading story.  The caption on the Instagram post cited the statistic as evidence that there are ""serious risks of relying heavily on mail-in-ballots.""  This ignores the evidence from election officials nationwide, including some in Trump’s administration, affirming that the 2020 election was ""the most secure in American history.""  And, election experts say, it ignores the principal reason that millions of mailed ballots legitimately end up in the ""unknown"" category: Some people just don’t vote.  Adams’ group released a two-page report in August that stated that of the 90.6 million ballots sent to voters, the outcome of 14.7 million ballots was ""unknown."" That works out to about 16.2% of the mail ballots. ""This report is about comparing mail balloting to in person voting,"" Lauren Bowman, a spokesperson for the group, told PolitiFact. ""We are pointing out major system breakdowns that occur when elections are conducted by mass vote by mail."" The foundation wrote that there are various reasons why a ballot may be in the ""unknown"" category: ""A ballot can be put in the wrong mailbox and land in an unfriendly neighbor’s trash. It can be thrown out with your unpaid bills. It can be left outside for the wind to carry the last mile (like seen in Nevada in 2020). Election officials simply do not know what happened. Unknown ballots are the greatest blind spot in the American electoral system."" (The Nevada reference pertains to news reports about 10 ballots found on a road in the Las Vegas area in November.) But that characterization of unknown ballots leaves a misleading impression, because it fails to mention the obvious reason many ballots ended up in the ""unknown"" category: A lot of mail ballots in 2020 were sent to voters automatically and then not returned by them, said Charles Stewart, an MIT political scientist. The numbers in the conservative group’s report come from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s report about the 2020 election, based on data collected from election officials nationwide. The agency, established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002, is an independent, bipartisan commission that develops guidance to help election administrators meet the law’s requirements. The EAC asked election officials to provide data on the outcome of mail ballots, including how many they sent that were undeliverable, surrendered, spoiled or replaced or had an unknown status. The data is only as good as the data provided by the election officials. About a half dozen states reported that the data for unknown ballots was not available or that it didn’t apply, or they reported zero unknown ballots. In some states, the number of unknown ballots was available for only some jurisdictions. The commission’s report showed that of the approximately 90.7 million ballots sent by mail to voters in the United States, about 16.8% ultimately landed in the unknown status. That works out to about 15 million, which is close to the figure cited by the foundation. The commission doesn’t break down the ballots in the ""unknown"" category, but says it ""included voters who were transmitted a mailed ballot but chose not to vote."" Millions of these ballots are in states that mail ballots to every active voter — including states that have done so for years and those that did so in 2020 because of the pandemic. Adams’ group compiled a list of the 10 counties that it said had the highest number of ""unknown"" ballots, and nine of them were in states that mailed ballots to everyone, including California, Nevada and New Jersey. The other county was Maricopa County, Ariz., where about 75% of voters were on the permanent early-voting list, which means they get a mailed ballot for every election. ""The five states that decided to mail ballots to all active-status voters solely because of the pandemic saw an awful lot of those ballots unreturned,"" Stewart said. ""There is no evidence of fraud related to these unreturned ballots in these states."" A high percentage of unknown-status ballots is a logical result of ballots being mailed automatically to all voters, said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin political scientist.  ""But it would be a mistake to call people choosing not to vote a ‘mess,’"" Burden said. States generally have procedures to ensure the security of the system so that unused mail ballots are not submitted fraudulently, Burden said.  An unreturned mail ballot is not so different from an unused ballot at an in-person polling place,  election experts said. It represents someone who chose not to vote. ""In a state that makes it hard to vote by mail and requires almost everyone to vote in person, we don’t say that the number of registered voters who don’t cast an in-person ballot are ‘unknown voters’ and that there is something nefarious about that,"" Stewart said. The Election Assistance Commission’s report stated that while the number of ballots mailed by election officials more than doubled in 2020 compared with 2016, ""the mailed ballot return count and rejection rates were not significantly different."" In its own report, Adams’ group said that in 2016, there were 41.6 million ballots sent and 5.9 million that landed in the ""unknown"" category, or about 14.3%. That means that as a percentage, slightly more ballots in 2020 ended up in the unknown category, which isn’t surprising considering that more states sent mail ballots to all active voters because of the pandemic. An Instagram post said, ""Stunning report: Nearly 15 million mail-in ballots were not counted in the 2020 election."" The post leaves the impression that these ballots  should have been tabulated but were not. That’s a misleading interpretation of federal data about mailed ballots that ended up in the ""unknown"" category, which includes ballots that were mailed to people but not sent back because they chose not to vote.  The U.S. Election Assistance Commission said that of about 90.7 million mail ballots sent out for the November 2020 election, about 15 million were ultimately placed in an ""unknown"" category.  Millions of these ballots were in states that issued ballots automatically to all registered voters because of the pandemic. There’s no evidence that these ballots were improperly excluded from tabulation. This claim has an element of truth, but leaves out important context that could give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.  PolitiFact senior correspondent Louis Jacobson contributed to this fact-check.",/factchecks/2021/sep/14/facebook-posts/fact-checking-misleading-claim-about-uncounted-bal/

 There’s no evidence farmers stood aside to allow someone to ‘buy back’ his family farm
","Although it’s often nice to see a bit of good news on the internet, not all feel-good stories are created equal. One of the more persistent stories that has circulated on social media for years appears to have stemmed from a vague tale on an obscure travel blog.  A Facebook account called In the NOW that Facebook has deemed ""Russia state-controlled media"" most recently shared this claim in a post that featured an image of a crowd of people gathered outdoors on a vast green lawn.  ""Farmers stand in silence at auction so a young man can buy back his family farmhouse,"" reads the text beneath the photo. Below the text is another photo, this time of a man in a plaid shirt with his hands on his hips. A label on the photo completes the meme, indicating the man represents ""the bank.""  ""It's about time banks learned who REALLY has the power,"" In the NOW wrote in the post.   The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence to support that this wholesome farm story actually happened. (Screenshot from Facebook) We conducted reverse image searches of the first photo in the post using websites such as Google, Bing, Yandex and TinEye. The earliest appearances of the crowd photo that we could confirm were from 2018.  In an Aug. 29, 2018, entry on what is titled ""Mike Brandly, Auctioneer Blog,"" the author references ""the full story"" about the farmer appearing on a travel blog called the ""Cornwall Holiday Guide."" The Cornwall Holiday Guide website appears to primarily provide people tips for vacationing in Cornwall, England. It’s not clear to us when the website first featured the farmhouse auction talle, but we found this page of the blog was archived Sept. 2, 2018. The original blog post has since been taken down.  The story shared on the travel blog went like this: An unidentified relative of a man named David sold an 80-acre family farm, and David and his father set out to buy the farm back when it went to auction.  ""When the auction actually took place, some 200 different farmers were at the auction and David and his father thought they would never be able to afford to buy it back,"" the blog post said. ""When David and his father placed their bid, they took a deep breath and hoped for the best. That is when something fascinating happened. Nobody else tried to put in a bid, and not one single person spoke up. Eventually, the auctioneer had to slam down the gavel and give them the winning bid."" The blog post quoted David as saying, ""I’ve had two profoundly humbling days in my life. The first was the day my son was born. The second was that unforgettable day at the auction house.""  We were unable to reach out to the blog to ask where they got the story from or why they took it down because the site provides no contact information or details about who manages it, and we found no reliable contact information in our searches.   And searching that quote verbatim on Google, Yahoo and through Nexis news archives did not reveal any further details or credible evidence to support the story. Although the story was later shared indicating the farm was located in Nebraska, it is unclear where that claim originated. The Cornwall Holiday Guide blog post lacked specific biographical details such as when the auction supposedly happened, David’s last name and the location of the auction or the farmhouse. The second photo in the post is a popular meme known by a few titles, including ""Disappointed Cricket Fan.""

Snafu at polling site did not target GOP voters in Calif. recall election
","A local TV news interview with one California voter led to a chorus of claims of a conspiracy against GOP voters in the Sept. 14 recall election for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. One misleading statement was this headline by the conservative Breitbart website: ""WATCH – California Recall: Polling Center Tells Some Republicans They ‘Already Voted.’"" Conservative outlets such as RedState and One America News network also reported on the TV interview, suggesting a threat to Republicans.  ""California viewers getting screwed again!"" claimed an Instagram post by conservative commentator David Harris Jr., who has 1.4 million Instagram followers. His post included the local TV report.  ""Why is it happening now in CA recall?"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said in a tweet.  We have found no evidence of any rigging ahead of the Sept. 14 recall election.  The evidence is of a snafu at two polling places, which was remedied, during early voting — not of a problem that targeted GOP voters specifically.  KTLA-TV in Los Angeles reported on Sept. 11 that several voters said they believed ""something wonky was going on"" at the polling place at El Camino Real Charter High School, in the Los Angeles neighborhood Woodland Hills. When they went to cast a ballot,  they were told that computers showed they had already voted. The school was open for early voting in the election.  One of the voters, Estelle Bender, appeared on camera. She said that when she told an election worker that she had not already voted in the recall, the worker told her: ""This has been happening all morning.""  Bender, who said she is a Republican, said she cast a provisional ballot but was ""really angry."" Asked by a reporter if that made her suspicious, she said: ""I would think so, and still I would like to know how I voted."" A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk told PolitiFact that the problems at that voting site and at a second site in Woodland Hills were ""an isolated incident.""  The office issued a statement in response to the TV report, saying voters were given provisional ballots, to ensure their votes would be counted. ""Provisional ballots are regular ballots, and once the eligibility of the voter is verified, they are processed and counted."" The statement also said that ""the equipment at the locations was replaced and voting continued."" The conservative Newsmax interviewed a man who said that when he was told he had already voted, an election worker told him that was happening to about 70% of the people who tried to vote that day. That man did not identify his polling location, but the report said it was in Woodland Hills on Sept. 11.  Los Angeles County has one of the highest percentages of registered Democrats in California. As of Aug. 30, it ranked eighth among the counties, with more than 53% of registered voters registered as Democrats. The Breitbart headline said, ""Polling center tells some Republicans they ‘already voted’"" in California recall election, suggesting that GOP voters were being targeted. The evidence indicates not rigging, but an election error, which happened at two polling places and was remedied. It affected potentially any voter, not just Republicans. And people were allowed to vote by casting provisional ballots. Those ballots will be counted so long as the voter is eligible.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2021/sep/14/breitbart/snafu-one-polling-site-did-not-target-gop-voters-c/

Japan has not approved ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment, and it's still using Moderna vaccine
","In a 30-second video on Instagram, a woman made several inaccurate statements regarding Japan's response to the pandemic and its use of the Moderna vaccine. The caption: ""Japan says goodbye Moderna, hello ivermectin."" ""It was just a few days ago that the Tokyo chairman of the Medical Association made the recommendation to hospitals and doctors to discontinue using Moderna, and to begin prescribing ivermectin to all COVID patients,"" she says. She cites ""tremendous results"" in India, Mexico, Argentina and parts of Bangladesh as proof of ivermectin’s effectiveness. ""Honestly, I’m guessing the metal contaminants they found in many of the bottles had something to do with it, too,"" the woman says at the end of the video. This take joined similar claims about Japan’s alleged switch to ivermectin on the internet. The anti-parasitic has gained popularity in recent months, especially in the U.S., as an alternative to the COVID-19 vaccines, even though U.S. health agencies have not approved ivermectin as a coronavirus treatment and have warned against its misuse. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram owns Facebooks. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  While the chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association, Haruo Ozaki, has recommended the use of ivermectin on COVID-19 patients, neither he nor the organization is associated with the Japanese government. The group is akin to the American Medical Association in the United States. It can make suggestions, but cannot enact government policies, according to its parent organization, the Japan Medical Association. Ivermectin is not listed by the Japanese government as an approved medicine to treat COVID-19. Moderna, on the other hand, remains an approved vaccine in Japan, along with Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Although there have been studies into the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients, they’re far away from the ""tremendous results"" cited in the Instagram video. PolitiFact has previously found many of the studies lacked scientific standing. The studies used small sample sizes and, in one case, had a clear conflict of interest where researchers were linked to a group that lobbied for ivermectin to be used as a treatment While at least three men in Japan have died several days after receiving a dose of the Moderna vaccine, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has not found a link between the vaccinations and deaths. The country’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare had to recall more than 1.6 million doses of the vaccine in late August after multiple vials were found contaminated with black particles.   More than 3,700 people were vaccinated using the contaminated vials, but none have reported any health issues, according to the BBC. The three men’s vaccinations were not from the contaminated vials, and their deaths are still under investigation, the Japan Times reported. An Instagram user claimed Japan has dropped its use of the Moderna vaccine in favor of using ivermectin to treat the coronavirus after two people died following their vaccinations. The Japanese professional association that recommended ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment has no power to enact policy changes for the country.  There has also been no conclusive evidence linking the Moderna vaccine to the deaths of three Japanese men. While more than 1.6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine were recalled because of contamination issues, Japan continues to administer shots of the Moderna vaccine.  We rate the claim that Japan said ""goodbye Moderna, hello ivermectin"" Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/sep/14/instagram-posts/japan-has-not-approved-ivermectin-covid-19-treatme/

The Pentagon announced in August that service members would be required to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel have until Dec. 2. Anyone who refuses to receive the COVID-19 vaccine without an approved exemption or accomodation, according to the Air Force, ""may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."" Potential disciplinary action under the code includes non-judicial punishments, such as having to do extra duties, and court martials.    But it doesn’t track that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would send an early-morning text message demanding all active military personnel to get the vaccine or face a court martial.

Miyares' claim about Herring's role in paroling convicted murderers lacks merit
","Jason Miyares, the Republican nominee for attorney general, is blaming Democratic incumbent Attorney General Mark Herring for the 2020 parole of seven people who had been convicted for different murders. The most notable parolee was Vincent Martin, who was sentenced to life in prison for murdering Officer Michael Connors in 1979, during a Richmond traffic stop. The Office of the State Inspector General issued reports in the summer of 2020 finding the Virginia Parole Board skipped procedures in freeing the 64-year-old Martin and the others.  Republicans have made the parolees central in their efforts to paint Democrats as soft on crime. Glenn Youngkin, the GOP gubernatorial nominee, has stressed in TV ads that the five members of the Parole Board were appointed by Democratic governors including Terry McAuliffe, his opponent this fall. Miyares tweeted on Sept. 2 that Herring is complicit in the Parole Board’s actions. ""The Parole Board operates with Mark Herring’s advice and consent,"" Miyares wrote. ""Mark Herring and Terry McAuliffe oversaw this Parole Board and as a result, we now have some of the most violent criminals back on our streets."" McAuliffe, who was governor from 2014 to 2018, was not in office when the inmates were released, although he appointed four of the Parole Board members who made the decisions. But what about the attorney general? We fact checked Miyares claim that the board runs with Herring’s advice and consent and found it far-fetched. ""Advice and consent"" is a term describing shared power between two different branches of government for certain decisions. It usually applies to judicial appointments made by the executive branch that must be approved by legislators; for example, the president nominates Supreme Court candidates but the U.S. Senate must approve them. Virginia’s Constitution does not mention advice and consent among the responsibilities of the attorney general. It simply says, ""He shall perform such duties and receive such compensation as may be prescribed by law…"" The state law setting out the powers and duties of the Parole Board does not mention the attorney general. Why does Miyares say the agency operates with Herring’s advice and consent? His campaign points to a Virginia law that establishes the attorney general as the lawyer for the state and its agencies in all civil matters. In listing those agencies, the law mentions the Parole Board. But the law Miyares cites does not refer to advice and consent which, again, means a shared power in making decisions. It sets out the attorney general’s responsibilities to give advice if agencies seek it and to represent them in legal issues that arise.  The attorney general’s website describes the office’s responsibilities this way: ""Provide legal advice and representation to the Governor and executive agencies, state boards and commissions, and institutions of higher education. The advice commonly includes help with personnel issues, contracts, purchasing, regulatory and real estate matters and the review of proposed legislation. The Office also represents those agencies in court."" The inmates were released on several days in April 2020 as Adrianne Bennett was ending her tenure as Parole Board chairperson to become a judge in Virginia Beach.  Miyares says Herring was likely looped into the decision making because a lawyer from the attorney general office attends Parole Board meetings in person or virtually. Herring says the board did not seek advice from his office before the April parole decisions and Miyares offers no contrary evidence. Most of the information Miyares’ campaign sent us took issue with Herrings’ actions after the releases began. The campaign accurately notes that Herring did not speak out against the releases.  Investigations by The Office of the State Inspector General in 2020 found that the Parole Board, spurred by Bennett, violated procedures for notifying the families of victims and prosecutors before paroling the inmates.  Top officials in Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration said the investigation was biased and the Democratic majority in the General Assembly appropriated $250,000 for a probe into the inspector general’s report.  At this point, Miares and other Republicans say Herring had conflicts of interest; the attorney general hired the law firm that conducted the probe, and his office was simultaneously representing the Parole Board and the inspector general. Herring said different, independent divisions in his office were representing the two state clients. Miyares says, ""The Parole Board operates with Mark Herring’s advice and consent."" But he falls short in his effort to tie the attorney general to the board’s decision to parole six men and one woman convicted for different murders. ""Advice and consent"" means shared power for decisions. In Virginia, the attorney general represents the parole board but has no authority over its decisions. Herring says his office was not involved in the parole decisions, and Miyares offers no evidence to the contrary. He mostly defends his statement by questioning Herring’s actions - and lack of actions - after parole was granted. We rate Miyares’ statement False.  ",/factchecks/2021/sep/14/jason-miyares/miyares-claim-about-herrings-role-parole-board-lac/

Experts say climate change can make hurricanes more intense, not cause them
","A viral image circulating on social media ridicules the idea that climate change is to blame for a recent hurricane in Florida, noting the many hurricanes that have hit the Sunshine State over the better part of two centuries.  ""Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850, but the last one was due to climate change,"" claims the image, which includes a picture of a monkey. The image was shared in a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes what is the consensus view among hurricane researchers. Their message is not that climate change caused recent hurricanes, but that there is evidence that it might have made them more serious. The post also misstates the number of hurricanes. Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said there have been 140 hurricanes in Florida since 1850. The Sept. 8 post was shared by conservative commentator James T. Harris, who has more than 537,000 followers on Facebook. But neither his post nor the viral image cites a particular hurricane. The post came one day after President Joe Biden walked through a New York City neighborhood devastated by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, where he said, ""the evidence is clear. Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives.""  But the text in the image has circulated since at least September 2017, when Hurricane Irma hit Florida, and some versions of the post insert the word ""manmade"" before ""climate change."" Here’s what we found in a fact-check published Sept. 9,  and one from October 2020: Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980 found that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled. The number of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. each year has not increased since a century ago, but researchers said it’s likely that global warming will cause future hurricanes to be more intense. We asked several hurricane researchers about the claim in the viral image; they agreed that climate change doesn’t cause hurricanes, but could make them more severe. ""The way we think about climate change impact on extremes, including hurricanes"" is that climate change from human activity ""can modify their characteristics,"" said Suzana Camargo, a research professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. For example, the most intense hurricanes occur more often, or the precipitation associated with particular hurricanes increases, she said. As for climate change’s effect specifically on Florida hurricanes, ""it is hard to make the assessment on a specific region, as the sample size is small,"" she said. Climate change is not the cause of hurricanes, because hurricanes occur naturally, said Kevin Trenberth, distinguished scholar at the National Center of Atmospheric Research. ""But climate change alters the ocean and atmosphere environment to make them more active. This can and is manifested in several ways: more intensity, bigger, longer lasting, and perhaps more hurricanes."" Phil Klotzbach, research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, said ""we don't expect to see more hurricanes in the future due to climate change — in fact we actually see fewer — but the warmer water temperatures may lead to stronger storms in the future."" He added: ""These trends may be hard to detect for many years to come, especially for landfalling hurricanes."" A viral image claimed: ""Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850, but the last one was due to climate change."" The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes their view.

Atty. Gen. candidate says he’s 'the only front-line prosecutor' that’s used Crime Lab
","Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney really wants you to know he’s a front-line prosecutor that uses the Wisconsin State Crime Lab and that state Attorney General Josh Kaul isn’t. It’s a line the Republican candidate for attorney general has hit often in the past month in campaign literature and television appearances, such as an Aug. 22, 2021 one on WISN’s ""UpFront"":  ""I'm the only front-line prosecutor in this race that's actually used the resources of the Wisconsin Crime Lab in the prosecution of cases.""  Toney hopes to face Kaul, a Democrat, in the general election. University of Wisconin-Madison law professor Ryan Owens is also running in the Republican primary.  But Toney made the comment as part of a longer criticism of Kaul and his handling and use of crime lab resources, such as delays in processing DNA and firearm evidence -- topics for another day. So, we’ll evaluate the claim with Kaul in mind. Is Toney right about being the only prosecutor in the race, and the only one to use the state crime lab? Since taking office in 2013, Toney has prosecuted hundreds of cases, if not more, in Fond du Lac County, often leveraging the state crime lab to process evidence, according to Wisconsin Circuit Court records.  Meanwhile, Owens -- Toney’s primary opponent -- works as a law professor and has no prior criminal prosecution experience in Wisconsin, according to state circuit court records. But Kaul, as the attorney general, actually manages the Department of Justice and its 800 employees, including the state’s crime lab itself. He oversees a team of prosecutors who handle criminal cases that include homicides, sexual assaults, the distribution of narcotics, and fraud. Kaul campaign manager Sondra Milkie noted that the attorney general ""oversees investigators and prosecutors who use results from the Wisconsin State Crime Labs in investigating and prosecuting some of the most serious criminal offenses."" What’s more, Kaul served as a federal prosecutor in Baltimore from 2010 to 2014 where he used crime labs -- albeit not the Wisconsin one -- in the prosecution of murderers and drug traffickers.  So, while Toney may be on point with the specific words he used, he is ignoring other information and drawing a narrow and somewhat misleading picture for voters.  When asked about that missing context, Toney’s campaign essentially simply repeated its claim. In a TV interview, Toney claimed: ""I'm the only front-line prosecutor in this race that's actually used the resources of the Wisconsin Crime Lab in the prosecution of cases.""  The statement may be accurate -- Owens is a law professor and Kaul’s experience as a front-line federal prosecutor relied on crime labs in other states, not in Wisconsin’s -- but it needs clarification.

The post, which is a picture of two tweets, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) To say the ballots were ""identified as likely ineligible"" is a huge leap from the facts, which are scarce.  The claim appears to have originated with a tweet by Peoples Pundit, an account run by Richard Baris, who identifies himself as a data journalist and director of Big Data Poll. First, Baris said ""there are 132k CoA flags in Fulton County, alone,"" referring to change of address flags in voter rolls, which implies that those voters might have been ineligible to vote in that county. Then he cited two queries of a Georgia voter database and included screenshots of both searches.  One of the queries Baris ran was for Fulton County voters including people ""flagged"" in the records for change of address, and the other query excluded people flagged for change of address. Baris’ claim about potentially ineligible ballots is based on the number of ""unique individuals"" listed for each query: the number is 842,486 when including those with a ""change of address flag"" in the records, and 710,454 when excluding those who have a ""change of address flag,"" a difference of 132,032. The screenshots do not include any detail such as links that would allow others to replicate the search or verify its results. Baris did not indicate that the information had been verified with or vetted by election officials, who in many cases during the 2020 election have offered reasonable explanations for theories being floated. Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez, director of external affairs for Fulton County government, told PolitiFact the claim is ""completely unsubstantiated."" A county spokeswoman also provided a statement saying, ""Fulton County is aware of allegations of 132,000 ballots being ‘flagged.’ These claims are simply false and baseless.

North Carolina Republican falsely accuses election workers of misconduct
","President Trump says he might lose the election because of fraud.  And a couple of his supporters in North Carolina say they believe the unproven claims about fraud could be true. U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, a Republican who represents a southern swath of the state, says he’s seen hints of wrongdoing in his own district. ""Well, I’m echoing the President’s claims. Indications of grossly improper conduct from election officials right here in my district,"" part of his Nov. 5 tweet said. Is it true that there are ""indications of improper conduct from election officials"" in his district? We reached out to Bishop’s office and asked what he meant. Spokeswoman Hannah Hummelberg cited complaints about campaign volunteers at the lone early voting site in Anson County, which have been reported by WBTV and WFAE-FM public radio in Charlotte. These claims were investigated and addressed. But the actions in question were done by a candidate and his campaign volunteers -- not election officials. The complaints: Officials received complaints that supporters of an Anson County Register of Deeds candidate, Dannie Montgomery, broke the law during early voting by assisting voters into the site and allegedly the voting booth. One voter said she was specifically told to vote for Montgomery, WBTV reported. ""As soon as I pulled up and exited my vehicle a campaign worker came up to me and forced me to vote for Dannie Montgomery and told me not to vote Greg Eudy (the unaffiliated candidate). As a first time voter I felt it wasn’t fair to me,"" the voter said in the complaint. What the law says: A voter can receive help only from close relatives — unless that voter has a disability. Voters who have a disability may ask for help from any person, with a couple exceptions. The law also prohibits assistants from influencing someone’s vote. A response: On Oct. 23, the Anson County elections board held an emergency meeting to discuss the allegations. Meeting minutes show the board warned campaign volunteers about the behavior going forward.  The Anson board received and investigated more complaints after that meeting but could not substantiate the allegations, according to Gina Clarke, the board’s temporary assistant director. The state board of elections issued a press release on Oct. 31 to clarify North Carolina’s laws about assisting voters The outcome: No Anson County election observers or board staff were found to have done anything wrong, according to Clarke and Pat Gannon, spokesman for the state elections board. Unofficial election results show Montgomery losing to Eudy, the other Register of Deeds candidate, and underperforming compared to Democrats at the top of the ballot. Montgomery appears to trail by more than 500 votes. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, Cal Cunningham and Roy Cooper all lead their respective Republican opponents in Anson by at least 400 votes. Bishop has tweeted about the Anson County allegations several times. On Oct. 29, Bishop tweeted a video of the alleged campaign volunteer in question. On Nov. 1, Bishop tweeted a letter that he sent to top state and Anson County election officials. He asked them to produce video showing the campaign worker’s actions while inside the polling site. The same day, the North Carolina Republican Party sent a letter to Sherry Melton, director of the Anson County election board.  The NC GOP noted that there had been 18 incident reports about Montgomery and her supporters. The party asked for the alleged rule-breakers to be banned from the polling site. The Anson board investigated complaints about the campaign volunteers, said Clarke, the board’s temporary assistant director. She spoke to PolitiFact by phone on Nov. 10. Complaints filed after the Oct. 23 meeting were ""unfounded,"" she said. ""We looked into each one of them,"" Clarke said. She added: No election officials were found to have committed any misconduct. The distinction between campaign volunteers, who greet people outside polling sites, and actual election officials, who conduct elections and count ballots, is an important one. We pointed out to Bishop’s office that his tweet omitted this key context and asked if Bishop is aware of any direct misconduct by Anson County election officials. Hummelberg, the spokeswoman, said the congressman is ""just suggesting"" that the county elections officials have been ""permitting"" campaign workers to ""buttonhole voters in the buffer zone, accompany them into the voting enclosure and into the voting booth, and to direct them how to vote."" As we mentioned: the county and state boards addressed the complaints — just not in a manner that Bishop or the state GOP might have preferred. Anson officials held an emergency meeting, issued warnings and investigated the complaints,while the state elections board issued a press release. Bishop said there are ""indications of grossly improper conduct from election officials right here in my district."" His spokeswoman cited complaints about campaign volunteers outside a polling place. Complaints were filed against Anson County campaign volunteers accusing them of trying to coerce people into voting a certain way. And Bishop thinks local election officials didn’t do enough to stop campaign volunteers from improperly assisting voters with their ballots. But the North Carolina elections board says it’s not aware of any direct misconduct by Anson County election officials.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It seems to be based on a misunderstanding of how counting mail in ballots works. Some of the numbers are simply wrong, while others represent exaggerated versions of  misinformation we have already debunked. Let’s take it state by state. We previously debunked a Nov. 4 claim that said 112,000 ballots, all for Joe Biden, mysteriously surfaced in the middle of the night after Election Day in Wisconsin. Officials there said they didn’t know what the number could have been referencing; at the time they were still counting  absentee ballots overnight. This new post changes it up a bit, claiming instead that ""140,000"" ballots were found for Biden between 3 and 4:30 a.m. in the state, presumably the night after Election Day polls closed Nov. 3 and into the morning of Nov. 4. The figure is close to the number of mail in votes that were cast for Biden in Milwaukee County overall. There was a jump in votes for Biden on the night of Nov. 3 because a large batch of absentee ballots from the City of Milwaukee finished processing around 3:30 a.m., election officials told us. Election officials worked through the night in Wisconsin to tally the unprecedented numbers of mail in ballots, which under state law they were not allowed to start counting until Election Day. ""A batch of about 170,000 absentee ballots is what came in from the City of Milwaukee. That’s just the final tally, and when it arrived,"" said Brian Rothgery, public information manager at the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors, referencing the time cited in the post.  Biden has won 69% of the vote in the county. For comparison, Hillary Clinton won about 65% of the vote in the county in 2016. RELATED: Fact-checking the avalanche of Wisconsin election misinformation  We couldn’t find evidence that 200,000 mail in ballots for Biden were found overnight, any night, in Michigan.  The claim appears to be an exaggerated iteration of posts that falsely said Biden received a suspicious influx of 138,339 votes in Michigan overnight following Election Day, while other candidates received none.  That claim relied on a data error that appeared on the elections map powered by Decision Desk HQ, an election data and analysis service.  The error came from the central Michigan county of Shiawassee. Caroline Wilson, the county’s clerk, told fact-checking organization AFP that she added an extra zero accidentally, reporting 153,710 votes for Biden instead of 15,371. The difference, 138,339, was removed from Biden’s total within about 20 minutes, election officials said. We have seen no credible reports that Pennsylvania election workers discovered 1 million mail in ballots for Biden ""between 2 and 4 a.m.,"" or at any other time. The claim may have originated from this Gateway Pundit story, which says that, ""Democrats, in the privacy of the Philly Convention Center, without ANY GOP inspectors, added OVER ONE MILLION VOTES to Joe Biden’s totals in 2 days!"" That’s not the case. A judge ruled to let election observers watch the count in Philadelphia from closer up, but representatives from both parties have been allowed to observe the process all along. The counting is also being streamed live online. Election officials in the state told PolitiFact there is ""no truth to the claim"" that any votes were mysteriously ""found"" for Biden there. In Pennsylvania, both Trump and Biden gained around 1 million votes on the night of Nov. 3 and into the morning of Nov. 4, according to the FiveThirtyEight election graph, which showed that the biggest increase happened between midnight and 3 a.m. Facebook posts are spreading a tweet that claims election workers, overnight, ""found"" 140,000 mail in ballots in Wisconsin, 200,000 in Michigan and 1 million in Pennsylvania, and all were for Biden. This is inaccurate. The numbers are either wrong or exaggerated, and the post misinterprets the counting and reporting of legal mail in ballots as ""found"" votes. We rate this False.

Debunking the ‘Hammer and Scorecard’ election fraud conspiracy theory
","Some fans of President Donald Trump are sharing the theory that a package of CIA computer programs have hacked the 2020 election. One program, called Hammer, cracks into protected networks, while another, called Scorecard, changes vote totals. Pamela Geller, a right-wing activist and Trump supporter, has posted more than one piece about Hammer and Scorecard. On Nov. 9, her website Geller Report offered an item headlined, ""HAMMER / Scorecard Voter Software Fraud in Real Time."" Geller offered a video clip taken from CNN’s 2019 election coverage of the Kentucky governor’s race that she called, ""Vote switching right in front of your eyes."" Geller's post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Before we dive in, let’s be clear that independent election security researchers see no evidence that Hammer and Scorecard exist, and the head of the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency, a government body created by President Donald Trump in 2018, has said this theory of election interference is ""nonsense.""  To be crystal clear on ⬇️, I’m specifically referring to the Hammer and Scorecard nonsense. It’s just that - nonsense. This is not a real thing, don’t fall for it and think 2x before you share. #Protect2020 https://t.co/f2FpSbRXKy With that, let’s look at the CNN evidence that Geller takes to be telling. The video consists of a man giving a running commentary on shifting result totals in the 2019 Kentucky governor’s race in which Democrat Andy Beshear defeated incumbent Republican Matt Bevin. At one key moment in CNN’s live broadcast, the vote totals change inconsistently.  A large graphic shows Beshear with a total of 674,508, while a smaller running total at the bottom of the screen gives him 673,948. According to the man giving the commentary, the total at the bottom of the screen runs behind the more current one on the larger graphic. In that light, a difference of 560 votes makes sense. The one on the bottom has yet to catch up. But at the same moment, Bevin’s totals show 661,675 on the large graphic, while the one at the bottom shows 662,235. That’s 560 votes less than the most up-to-date one on the big graphic. In the view of Geller and the man speaking on the video, the fraud is obvious. ""You have just seen 25% of the loss amount of this race happen in front of your very eyes,"" the man giving the commentary said. In the final official tally, Beshear won by over 5,000 votes. Is this proof of shenanigans? Two election security experts we reached were unimpressed. ""The broader issue here is that the election night results are not official,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart III. ""There’s a post-election canvas period when results are checked and mistakes spotted and corrected."" Stewart said there’s a key flaw in the theory that the purported software package of Hammer and Scorecard could intercept the digital transmission of vote results and change them. He said the states that do send data that way also keep the data tapes of votes from the original machines. ""The results only become official after the election department has compared the paper tapes  — which are immune to supposed hack — to the initially transferred results,"" Stewart said. The CNN election night results are ""the sports aspect of elections, not the binding results,"" said statistics professor at the University of California-Berkeley Philip Stark. Stark cautioned that no election system comes with 100% ironclad protection against hacking. ""Nothing is perfect, and they are all vulnerable,"" Stark said. He advocates for greater use of paper ballots and careful post-election audits. But that said, Stark sees no evidence that any results have been altered in this election or past ones. Regarding the CNN inconsistencies, he noted that CNN contracted for the data feed from a third party vendor. That puts CNN’s number even further removed from the official tally. Stark said nothing in the CNN example holds up. ""That’s not how anyone would hack an election,"" Stark said. ""If you really wanted to change the total, you would not change it on election night, where everyone could see it. You would change it in the voting tabulation system."" And for those who think Hammer and Scorecard were deployed in the 2020 election, Stark said that raises the question of why skeptics look only at the presidential race. ""If the motivation was to put the Democrats in power, why didn’t they flip the Senate?""  Stark  posed. ""Biden will have a hard time without the Senate. Why would you leave the job half done?"" One of the main promoters of the Hammer and Scorecard theory is a discredited military contractor who claims to have created them.  We asked Geller to respond to the issues raised above. She didn’t address the specific matters but said that she sees ample evidence of fraud, including ""eyewitness accounts of tens of thousands of ballots coming in the back door (that) should give even you pause, despite your baked-in far-left bias."" We have debunked multiple claims of fraud, including 14,000 dead people voting in Michigan, and poll workers in Pennsylvania filling out ballots. Geller said that a 2019 CNN video clip shows the work of purported CIA-built hacking software Hammer and Scorecard in action. The clip shows a momentary glitch in election night totals. The head of the government agency created by Trump to protect against cyber attacks called the Hammer and Scorecard theory, ""nonsense."" Election security experts said election night totals are distinct from official results, and post-Election Day vetting by state officials catches discrepancies between local results and totals calculated at the central office. They also noted that if someone truly wanted to steal an election, the example Geller cited makes no practical sense. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

No, Rock County did not have a glitch that stole votes from Trump
","The latest baseless Wisconsin voter fraud claim centers on Rock County, where Eric Trump and other conservatives claim to have uncovered votes that switched from President Donald Trump to President-Elect Joe Biden. Eric Trump, the president’s son and adviser, tweeted this late on Nov. 9, 2020: ""BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: System 'Glitch' Also Uncovered In Wisconsin - Reversal of Swapped Votes Removes Lead from Joe Biden."" He linked to a story from the Gateway Pundit bearing similar text as a headline. Eric Trump and Gateway Pundit have both circulated misinformation since the election, claiming voter fraud without evidence — or even in the face of clear evidence to the contrary. This claim is baseless. Rock County votes were accurately recorded.  Here’s what actually happened. Gateway Pundit’s article claims they ""identified approximately 10,000 votes that were moved from President Trump to Biden in just one Wisconsin County."" They present as evidence two screenshots from Fox News’ election results showing President Trump listed with 46,649 votes at 11:43 p.m. on Nov. 3, compared to 37,133 for Biden. Those numbers then switched in a screenshot with a time of 11:57 p.m. Since current counts show Biden leading in Wisconsin by just 20,540 votes, the article notes switching those 9,516 votes back to Trump and away from Biden would make the state a virtual tie. But this projection only makes sense if Trump rightfully received those votes. And he didn’t. The article does not include any discussion of why those votes flipped, or interviews with election officials. Here’s what Gateway Pundit would have found if they had done that research. Vote totals reported by the Associated Press create the stream of data used by Fox News and many other election websites on Election Day. For Rock County, Wisconsin, that stream showed a steady increase for both President Trump and Biden from the first report around 8:30 p.m. until the last one just before midnight. When the final vote tallies were reported at 11:43 p.m. — after poll workers tabulated the absentee ballots — Biden’s total jumped from 30,453 to 46,649, while President Trump’s jumped from 31,343 to 37,133. (That difference in absentee ballots is consistent with the rest of the state and nation, as President Trump had repeatedly urged his supporters not to use mail-in votes, while Biden and Democrats had encouraged absentee balloting.) The Rock County Clerk’s Office website shows those tallies for the two candidates and has not been updated since 11:43 p.m. on Election Day, Clerk Lisa Tollefson said. However, the Associated Press sent an update at 11:45 p.m. that transposed the numbers, wrongly assigning the 37,133 total to Biden and the 46,649 total to President Trump. That was corrected minutes later to correctly show President Trump losing by 9,516 votes. That data is entered by the AP based on the clerk’s website, without involvement from election officials. ""There was a brief technical error in AP’s collection of the vote count in Rock County, Wisconsin, that was quickly corrected,"" Patrick Maks, AP spokesman, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""AP has myriad checks and redundancies in place to ensure the integrity of the vote count reporting. We are confident in what we have delivered to customers."" In other words, the ""glitch"" was in a media system, not a voting system. The wrong numbers were briefly loaded into an array of media websites, but the numbers were never counted or reported incorrectly by Rock County. ""Everybody’s human, but maybe you should check your source instead of jumping to conclusions,"" Tollefson said of the voter fraud claim. The 55% to 44% margin in Biden’s favor is in line with the 2016 election, when Trump drew 41% of the vote, compared to 52% for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Eric Trump claimed on Twitter that a glitch uncovered in Rock County removes Biden’s lead in Wisconsin. But there was no glitch in the election system. And there’s no ""gotcha"" moment or evidence that will move votes over to President Trump’s column. The presidential totals were transposed for several minutes due to a data entry error by the Associated Press, without any involvement by election officials. The votes were counted following standard procedures by the Rock County Clerk’s Office and show Biden winning the county by a margin of more than 9,000 votes.

Fact-checking social media posts about Biden’s lead in battleground states
","Every major television network and the Associated Press have said Joe Biden is the projected winner of the presidential election. But on social media, some say the race is still too close to call. ""Joe Biden is no longer the President-elect according to RealClearPolitics,"" says text in a Nov. 9 Instagram post, which is a screenshot of a tweet from Samantha Marika, a conservative internet personality and conspiracy theorist. On Facebook, some users shared electoral maps to support their claims that Biden has not yet clinched the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Others said President Donald Trump made up ground in battleground states where Biden was leading, such as Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania.

The site reported Nov. 9 that Real Clear Politics had ""REMOVED Pennsylvania from Biden's electoral vote total,"" but it later updated its story to indicate that’s not the case. Every major TV network and the AP have called Pennsylvania for Biden, which puts him past the threshold needed to win the election. The result will be finalized Jan. 6 when Congress counts the electoral votes. As of Nov. 10, only Fox News and the AP had called Arizona for Biden, despite what some social media posts say. The major networks and the AP have not called Georgia, where a recount is likely. CNN did not ""uncall"" Arizona or Georgia.  Even without those two states, Biden would have enough electoral votes to win the election. He is the president-elect. The Instagram post is inaccurate.

Siri glitch sparks misinformation about Biden, 25th Amendment
","After four days of counting ballots, the 2020 presidential race was called for Joe Biden on Nov. 7. But some Facebook users say his election was a Democratic plot to put his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, in the White House. Their evidence? Something Siri told some iPhone users over the weekend. ""God gave us a gift today--CONFIRMATION of the Democrats' sinister plan to REMOVE Sleepy Joe immediately using the 25th Amendment and instate Kamala Harris as President!"" wrote actor Darin Southam in a Nov. 9 Facebook post. The post includes several clips that show people asking Siri, a virtual, voice-activated assistant included in Apple’s operating systems, how old the president is. In response, Siri responds: ""Kamala Harris was born 56 years ago on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 1964."" Southam’s post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have been shared in hundreds of other posts, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. So we wanted to investigate. (Screenshot from Facebook) The 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides for the vice president to become president if the president is unable to do his or her job. But there is no evidence that Democrats are working to invoke the 25th Amendment against Biden — and if there were, it doesn’t stand to reason that Siri would reveal their plot. The Siri responses were the result of a bug involving election data supplied by Wolfram Alpha, one of the websites that provide information to form Siri’s responses. In one of the videos included in the Facebook post, Siri answered an iPhone user’s question with information from Wolfram Alpha, which describes itself as a ""computational intelligence engine."" Another version of the post shows that, at some point, Wolfram Alpha appeared to label Harris as president. In a Nov. 9 tweet, the company acknowledged a problem with some of its data about the election, but said it had been fixed. ""The brief issue affecting data on Wolfram|Alpha about the US presidential election has now been corrected,"" the tweet says. ""A bug in a new update process for handling uncertain/projected results caused garbled data to go live."" Danielle Rommel Mayer, director of outreach and communications, explained it this way: ""A small mistake made by a data curator, and quickly aborted, led to a chain of issues within our new update system that caused an inconsistency to be introduced, and not detected by our automated testing. The ultimate result of this was that certain natural language queries produced garbled results that incorrectly accessed mismatched parts of (the) internal knowledgebase, without correct tagging."" In layman's terms: A mistake made by a data curator at Wolfram Alpha gave some iPhone users incorrect results when asking Siri about the age of the president. Rommel Mayer said the bug was fixed by 2:22 a.m. CST on Nov. 9. The bug is not evidence that Democrats are trying to remove Biden, who will be the oldest president ever to take office. RELATED: Trump supporters falsely tie Nancy Pelosi to broader election misfire scheme The 25th Amendment has been the subject of conjecture and misinformation since House Democrats introduced a bill in October that would create a new body to take over the role of the Cabinet accordingly. The bill came days after President Donald Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19.  Trump tweeted Oct. 9 that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was ""looking at the 25th Amendment in order to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris."" There is no evidence that’s the case.  On Nov. 9, we tried asking Siri how old the president is. The assistant responded: ""Donald Trump is 74 years old.""

Trump supporters falsely tie Nancy Pelosi to broader election misfire scheme
","Elections are rarely error-free, and in a close election, every misstep draws scrutiny. In Michigan and Georgia, pro-Trump bloggers have aimed to turn lapses in three counties into signs of a broad pattern of deception. Bloggers posted a Nov. 6 story that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""has suspicious ties with election software ‘glitch’ company in favor of Biden ballots."" This blog post said that the same problem in Georgia and Michigan caused inaccurate vote tallies. The private voting company, Dominion Voting Systems, provided the voting machines in both states. ""Their DC lobbyist is Nancy Pelosi’s longtime aide,"" the post said. ""The company hired Brownstein Farber Hyatt & Schreck earlier this year. Nadeam Elshami, Pelosi’s former chief of staff, is one of the lobbyists on the account."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post gets some details right, but it’s wrong that the same problem lay behind the glitches in both states, and it overlooks that Dominion Voting Systems also hired lobbyists with solid Republican ties. The day after the Nov. 3 election, Antrim County, Mich., appeared to have swung to Joe Biden by about 3,000 votes. On Nov. 5, county officials changed that to a win by President Donald Trump by about 2,500 votes. There was an error, and our partners at the Detroit Free Press have been following this story. J. Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan professor and voting systems expert, dug into the problem and found that county officials had left an old version of a key file on some machines in their digital voting system. As a result, those machines failed to match votes to the right candidate when tallies at some precincts were added to the county total. The Michigan secretary of state’s office reported on the incident and said it came down to human error by the Antrim County clerk, not a failure in the underlying system. ""Because the clerk did not update software, even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly, those accurate results were not combined properly when the clerk reported unofficial results,"" the Nov. 6 statement said. The secretary of state noted that the initial results were unofficial, and that steps that followed to verify the count — carried out by representatives from both parties — would have caught the error. The mistake was limited to that one county. It is one of 65 counties in Michigan that uses equipment from a private voting technology company, Dominion Voting System. Dominion Voting Systems was also involved in a snafu that hit two Georgia counties. On the morning of Election Day, voters in Morgan and Spalding counties were unable to cast machine ballots for a few hours when the machines crashed. The issue there had to do with a breakdown between the digital list of voters provided by one company, and the voting machines provided by a second company, Dominion Voting Systems. Technicians resolved the problem, and a judge allowed the affected polls to stay open until 11 p.m. to make up for lost time. Georgia uses the same system statewide, and the glitch only took place in these two counties. There is no report that votes were miscounted. Trump easily carried both places, winning by a 40 point margin in Morgan County and by 20 points in Spalding. The blog post correctly notes that lobbyist Nadeam Elshami worked for Pelosi. It fails to mention that two other lobbyists listed on the company’s disclosures used to work for Republicans. William Moschella was a high-ranking Justice Department official in the administration of George. W. Bush. Brian Wild is the former chief of staff of Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa, and was a top staffer on the House Republican Steering Committee. Bipartisanship is alive and well in lobbying, with large firms putting people with both Democratic and Republican resumes on big contracts. A blog post linked Pelosi to a company that provides a voting system that favored Biden. Glitches did happen, but beyond that, the argument falls apart. The breakdowns touched three counties, while scores of other counties using the same system had no issues. The problems were caught and corrected. The one instance of flawed tallies had no impact on official results, and the returns came down strongly in Trump’s favor. The link to Pelosi rests on the private company hiring a lobbying firm that assigned Pelosi’s former chief of staff to the company. But the firm also assigned two men with strong Republican credentials. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Below the words ""PRESIDENT GORE,"" the page says: ""Florida pushes Gore over the top with bare majority."" After Trump spokesperson Tim Murtaugh tweeted the image as ""a reminder that the media doesn’t select the president,"" the Washington Times responded.  ""These photos have been doctored,"" the newspaper tweeted. ""The Washington Times never ran a ‘President Gore’ headline."" In a second tweet, it added: ""Mr. Murtaugh has been officially notified via email about this error."" Murtaugh has since deleted his tweet. In the 2000 presidential election, some TV news networks called Florida for Gore over George W.

No, the New York Post didn’t run a ‘You’re Fired’ cover
","As the host of ""The Apprentice,"" before he was elected president, Donald Trump would kick contestants off the reality show by saying, ""You’re fired.""  Trump’s detractors have co-opted the catchphrase since Democrat Joe Biden was projected as the winner of the 2020 presidential race.  The New York Post is not among them, though a fake cover circulating on social media could make you think otherwise.  ""My fellow Americans, our long NATIONAL NIGHTMARE is over,"" reads a quote on the fabricated page, next to a photo of the president walking with his tie undone after a campaign rally in June. Below the quote — an allusion to Gerald Ford’s speech when he acceded to the presidency in 1974 — the headline ""YOU’RE FIRED"" appears in all caps.  ""Even the NY Post has turned on him!"" wrote one Facebook account sharing the image. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The date on the image of the tabloid cover says Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020, though news organizations didn’t call the election for Biden until several days later. The cover also says ""FUTURE EDITION,"" whereas the actual Nov. 4 cover just listed the day, date and weather forecast.  That cover — the real one — read ""NAILBITER.""  ""Trump defies polls, election on razor’s edge,"" the cover said alongside an image of a woman biting her nails. On Nov. 8, the day after the race was called for Biden, the cover said: ""IT’S JOE TIME."" We rate this Facebook post False.

No, Fairfax officials in Virginia didn’t give 100,000 Trump votes to Biden
","A social media post falsely claimed that Fairfax County officials in Virginia gave 100,000 votes for President Donald Trump to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. ""Fairfax Virginia has switched 100,000 votes from Trump to Biden stating a ‘clerical error,’"" reads a recent Facebook post that made a series of claims.  A Fairfax County official did make a clerical error when they reported votes shortly after midnight on Nov. 4, which mistakenly reported about 100,000 more Biden votes, said Gary Scott, Fairfax County elections director. They realized the error and corrected it within 10 minutes, Scott said. The reported number of votes for Trump didn’t change. Biden has since been declared the winner of the presidential race by numerous media organizations, including the Associated Press and Fox News. An employee of the Fairfax County Office of Elections input a formula in a spreadsheet incorrectly. The incorrect report had been sent to both election officials and those who update the county’s website at the same time.  Scott said election officials noticed the mistake immediately and corrected the public information shortly after it was posted.  ""It was just a reporting error,"" Scott said. ""There was no change to votes cast."" The Facebook post claimed that Fairfax County officials in Virginia gave 100,000 votes for Trump to Biden due to a clerical error.  The county incorrectly reported Biden 100,000 more votes than existed due to an error with a spreadsheet.

No, the NAACP didn’t warn about white nationalist groups killing Black men
","A warning spreading on social media urges Black men and boys to not travel alone Nov. 6-8 because, according to some posts, the NAACP got a tip about white nationalist groups conducting initiation killings over the weekend.  But the NAACP has denied this.  ""The NAACP has received credible information that some of the white nationalist groups, neo nazi’s and white supremacist groups have initiations happening this weekend,"" one Facebook post said. ""As part of the initiation it is said that they will be looking to snatch black men and boys and hang them, shoot them, tortue them and kill them. So please spread the word.

NAACP has not come into contact with any such information."" The Georgia chapter of the NAACP has also said that the information circulating on social media ""is false and not credible."" ""We are calling on all Georgians to remain calm as election results surface throughout the week,"" the group’s president, Rev. James Woodall, said in a statement.

Georgia election worker falsely accused of discarding ballot is in hiding, official says
","A video that was widely shared on social media claimed to show an election worker in a ballot processing facility throwing away a ballot. The worker threw away only a piece of paper containing voter instructions — but has had to go into hiding for his safety after the false accusation, according to an election official. The Nov. 5 Instagram post of the video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The 30-second video shows a man sitting at a desk handling paper.  ""I’m wondering what’s going on here,"" the narrator of the video says. ""This dude has a fit about something. And then flips off the ballot. And then crumples it up. If that’s not voter fraud, I don’t know what is."" The man in the video, appearing somewhat agitated as he works, crumples up a piece of paper with one hand and puts it into a bin on a desk next to him. Richard Barron, the elections director in Fulton County, Ga., said on Nov. 6 that his office reviewed the video and found it shows a worker handling absentee ballots in a ballot processing area inside State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The worker’s job was to use a cutter to open envelopes containing ballots. The ballot processing was done at another station in the facility.  Barron noted that ballots are 8.5 by 19 inches long and that the piece of paper the worker discarded, which Barron said contained voter instructions, was much smaller. ""The answer is no, undeniably no,"" Barron said, as to whether the worker discarded a ballot. Barron said the worker is staying with friends and not driving his vehicle because his personal information had been released after the video went viral.  ""He is currently in hiding because he’s had threats. He’s had to shut down all of his social media and all of his personal information was released. Personally, I think it’s shameful,"" Barron said. The post claimed to show in a video that a poll worker committed voter fraud by throwing away a ballot. The man was throwing away a paper with voter instructions, elections officials said.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2020/nov/07/facebook-posts/georgia-election-worker-falsely-accused-discarding/
