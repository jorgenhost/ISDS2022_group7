Retired general says al-Qaida has grown 'fourfold' in last 5 years
","Al-Qaida has grown exponentially in recent years, retired four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane said. On Fox News Sunday Feb. 1, host Chris Wallace asked Keane if the administration has a strategy to combat Islamic extremism. Keane said, ""We do not. Al-Qaida has grown fourfold in five years. ISIS, which began when we pulled out politically and military from Iraq, grew from an organization less than 3,000 to an organization over 30,000 in three years. Radical Islamists spread from Western Africa through the Middle East, all the way to South Asia to sub-Indian continent."" Keane first mentioned the fact that al-Qaida has quadrupled since 2010 in testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee last week. We wondered if it was accurate. The short answer is maybe, depending on your definition. Experts cautioned that it’s nearly impossible to know how large al-Qaida is in terms of membership. And Keane’s figure is just an estimate extrapolated from an earlier analysis. It also relies on a broad definition of ""al-Qaida."" Defining al-Qaida So who is Keane talking about when he says ""al-Qaida""? Back in the early 2000s, and before 9/11, al-Qaida was generally understood to mean the several hundred people who swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden, said Larry Johnson, a consultant specializing in counterterrorism and a former CIA employee. Now when people think of al-Qaida, they usually think of a much broader category consisting of that core group, plus affiliates and other Sunni Islamic extremists, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, located throughout the Middle East, North Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Under this broad definition, Johnson said Keane’s claim that al-Qaida has grown fourfold since 2010 -- while impossible to verify -- is probably accurate. ""Fourfold is probably an underestimate,"" added Frederick Kagan, director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats project. But not everyone agrees to such a broad discussion. Anne Stenersen, a research fellow in terrorism at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, said the narrowly defined al-Qaida -- that is, its core members -- has stayed relatively stable at fewer than 300 members since 2010. She prefers this definition because the affiliates have varying strategies and objectives. For example, al-Qaida actually split from the Islamic State due to ideological differences. Johnson also noted that some regional groups that have al-Qaida in their names -- like al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb or al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- were given those names by the West, so they do not necessarily reflect how close those groups are to the core al-Qaida group. The evidence At the Senate hearing, Keane shared this map that shows various al-Qaida affiliates and other Islamic extremist groups throughout the region as of January:  Keane told us his advisers came up with the fact that al-Qaida has increased fourfold by relying on a  2014 report from the think tank RAND. The RAND report found that between 2010 and 2013, the number of Islamic jihadist fighters doubled, and the number of attacks tripled. Given the continued rise in activity since 2013 and based on discussions with experts, Keane and his advisers concluded that the size of al-Qaida and its affiliates has essentially doubled again since the RAND report was published. The RAND report relied on both unclassified and classified primary sources to come up with its counts. The trouble trying to count However, every expert we spoke with -- as well as government spokespeople -- said it’s not feasible to quantify the size of al-Qaida and its global affiliates. Other than this RAND report, there’s no official count of the number of Islamic extremists that we can use to see how the group’s manpower has grown since 2010. ""All that said, al-Qaida is almost certainly bigger than it was five years ago. It's the fourfold that I would question,"" said J.M. Berger, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""For each of these groups, we can only estimate their size, and all estimates are disputed."" Kagan, of the American Enterprise Institute, said several al-Qaida groups are much larger than they were five years ago because of the 2011 Arab Spring. The revolutions left many countries without stable leadership and institutions, making them vulnerable to the rise of extreme religious groups. This is what’s happening in Libya with the rise of al-Qaida affiliates, in Syria with the al Nusra front and Yemen with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Kagan added that in the past five years, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in West Africa, as well as Boko Haram in Nigeria, which doesn’t have official ties to al-Qaida, have grown tremendously. And the United States invasion and later removal from Iraq destabilized the country, Johnson said, giving way to the rise of the Islamic State. ""Al-Qaida and its affiliates have expanded enormously over the last five years,"" Kagan said. ""They have transformed from being terrorists to insurgent organizations and in some cases insurgent armies."" Kagan and Johnson both cited the United States’ limited response to the Arab Spring as well as its policies in dealing with Iraq and Iran as contributing to the rise in Islamic extremism throughout North Africa and the Middle East. Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Security Studies, said his research has shown that the number of al-Qaida affiliates has more than doubled from eight to 17 since 2008. Adding the Islamic State, once an affiliate, to that count would dramatically increase the number of fighters. ""I can’t pin an exact number to Gen. Keane’s assertion — but it doesn’t sound wildly off base to me,"" Hoffman said. Our ruling Keane said, ""al-Qaida has grown fourfold in five years."" There’s two tricky parts to Keane’s particular claim. The first is defining al-Qaida. While the group that previously followed Osama bin Laden has remained at about the same size, there is no doubt among experts that we’ve seen a rise in the number of jihadist fighters overall. Many of those fighters were inspired by al-Qaida. The second is pinning a specific number on the growth. RAND said the number of terrorists has doubled between 2010 and 2013. Keane basically estimates that the number of jihadist fighters has doubled again. Is that right? Maybe. Maybe not. The evidence is thin, but the experts say his claim is a reasonable estimate. Weighing everything, we rate this claim Half True.","[('Fox News Sunday, transcript, Feb. 1, 2015', 'http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday-chris-wallace/2015/02/01/president-obamas-foreign-policy-under-fire'), ('RAND blog, ""The accelerating spread of terrorism,"" June 3, 2014', 'No link'), ('RAND, ""Increase in Jihadist Threat Calls for New U.S. Strategy to Combat Terrorism,"" June 4, 2014', 'http://www.rand.org/blog/2014/06/the-accelerating-spread-of-terrorism.html'), ('USA Today, ""Al-Qaeda hasn\'t gone away, and is gaining,"" Jan. 8, 2014', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Map of Countries Where Al Qaeda and Its Affiliates Operate,"" accessed Feb. 1, 2015', 'http://www.rand.org/news/press/2014/06/04.html'), ('Wall Street Journal, ""Shadowy Figure: Al Qaeda\'s Size Is Hard to Measure,"" Sept. 10, 2011', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""David Gregory: Al-Qaida cast off ISIS as \'too extreme,\'"" Aug. 13, 2014', 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/01/07/al-qaeda-spread/4358845/'), ('PunditFact, ""Dick Cheney: Number of terrorists has doubled,"" June 22, 2014', 'No link'), ('Senate Armed Services Committee, Keane testimony, Jan. 27, 2015', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/12/world/12aqmap.html?_r=0'), ('Interview, Gen.

Do ‘common welfare programs’ pay the equivalent of a $20.83-per-hour job?
","Rhode Island's minimum wage just rose to $9 an hour. There's a push by Democrats to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10. That’s chump change if you believe a Jan. 10 tweet by the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity. It said you can earn the equivalent of $20.83 an hour by not working and being on welfare. The conservative think tank reported: ""RI should make working more attractive than welfare! Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour."" That struck us as very attractive. We wondered if it were true. First we asked the center's CEO, Mike Stenhouse, if there were any important caveats omitted from the tweet, which is restricted to 140 characters. With more characters available, he said in an email, the statement would have been something like: ""Estimating the combined value of certain public assistance programs available in Rhode Island, common welfare programs can give recipients a pretax income equivalent of up to $43,330 or $20.83 an hour."" Neglecting to say ""up to"" and ""equivalent to"" are important omissions. So the $43,330 represents the maximum value of the benefits, not actual cash income  that recipients can spend as they wish. The source for the claim, said Stenhouse, is a report from the libertarian Cato Institute called ""The Work Versus Welfare Trade-Off: 2013."" It examined the value of various welfare programs by state. The Rhode Island total comes from starting with the $6,648 a year in cash welfare that a single parent with two children could receive, which is the only unrestricted cash that recipients would see. (It's also 34 percent less than what recipients got in 1995, adjusted for inflation, according to Cato.) Then you add in $6,249 per year in food stamps (now called the SNAP program), $12,702 in housing subsidies, $11,302 as the cost of buying health care coverage comparable to Medicaid, $275 in heating assistance, $300 a year under the Emergency Food Assistance program (TEFAP), and $1,156 in food under the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program for pregnant women, new mothers and children up to age 5. The total -- $38,632 -- is equivalent to what a single parent with two children would get to keep after taxes if the parent earned $43,330 a year, or $20.83 an hour for a 40-hour work week, Cato said. ""Many welfare recipients, even those receiving the highest level of benefits, are doing everything they can to find employment and leave the welfare system,"" the Cato report concludes. ""Still, it is undeniable that for many recipients -- especially long-term dependents -- welfare pays more than the type of entry-level job that a typical welfare recipient can expect to find. As long as this is true, many recipients are likely to choose welfare over work."" But there's a problem: There's nothing typical about this amount because very few poor people are eligible for -- or take advantage of -- all these programs. The Cato report acknowledges that most people won't be getting close to the $38,632. For example, welfare recipients aren't eligible for WIC benefits unless they have children under age 5. Another example: Many poor people can't get a housing subsidy -- only 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders receiving cash welfare are also receiving housing assistance. Anticipating such criticism, Cato did another calculation, looking only at the welfare, food stamp and Medicaid programs that, they said, nearly all poor people would be eligible for. Cato found that the value of just those benefits was equivalent to being paid $17,347 a year, or $8.34 an hour. That's a far cry from $20.83 an hour. On the other hand, $8.34 an hour is still only 66 cents below the current Rhode Island minimum wage, with no need to punch a time clock, find child care, or arrange for transportation to and from a job. It's not clear how many welfare recipients are actually enrolled in the food stamp and Medicaid programs. Cato, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Progress Institute, a liberal think tank at Rhode Island College that studies poverty and other economic issues, didn't have that number. Finally, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity uses the value of the benefits to argue that the state ""should make working more attractive than welfare."" But Linda Katz, policy director of the Economic Progress Institute, argued there's already a huge incentive to working instead of being on welfare. She said a family of three, with the parent earning $13 per hour, can still receive food stamps, heating assistance, housing assistance and other benefits that Cato values at $28,000. ""Instead of having $6,000 in your welfare check, you have $27,000 in your paycheck. And you still keep everything else,"" she said. That's not true, said Justin Katz (no relation), the Center for Freedom and Prosperity’s research director. The food stamp allotment, for example, would be cut dramatically for someone making $13 an hour full time. We confirmed that with the state's SNAP administrator. A single mother at that pay level would not even be eligible for food stamps unless other expenses were taken into account. With monthly bills of $1,000 in rent, $60 in utility costs, and a friend or relative caring for the children, that mother would get about $2,000 in food stamps per year, far less than the $6,000 she would get if she has no income. The same with a housing subsidy. A single mother in Providence making $13 an hour would potentially be paying $8,112 a year for subsidized housing (if she could get it). That same mother with no income would have to pay just $600 a year for that apartment, according to Michael V. Milito, deputy assistant director of Rhode Island Housing. In a subsequent email, Linda Katz acknowledged that she had erred. Our ruling The Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity tweeted that ""Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour."" It's not income as most people think of it. It's how much a poor single parent with two children under age 5 would have to earn to get the equivalent value of all programs, including food stamps, medical care, heating assistance and housing subsidies, plus $6,648 a year in cash assistance. But that's a hypothetical maximum that only a small fraction of welfare recipients reach because they're not eligible for those specific benefits, they didn't apply for them, or a benefit is not available. The Center’s tweet suggests the scenario is more common than it is. It could have added the caveats and still stayed within Twitter’s 140-character limit. For example: ""RI should make working more attractive than welfare! Common welfare programs give income up to $43,330 or $20.83/hr for single parent of 2."" Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

Ted Cruz says top 1 percent earn more of national income than any year since 1928
","Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, lately have aired similar concerns about the future of working-class Americans, though they differ over what to do.   In his January 2015 State of the Union address, the Democratic president said he wants to work with Congress to offer free community college to students while creating other education, child care and retirement savings programs to help the middle class. Funding, he’s proposed, would come from a $320 billion tax increase on the nation’s highest earners and financial institutions including investment banks. After Obama’s speech, Cruz told Fox News he was disappointed with Obama’s goals to increase government spending and taxes, which he described as hurting hardworking Americans. Then Cruz said the country’s rich and powerful ""have gotten fat and happy"" on Obama’s watch. ""Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928,"" Cruz said. Take that, Mister President! And was Cruz right? Cruz cites West Coast economist By email, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack indicated Cruz does not agree with Obama, who said in his speech he wants to reduce the top 1 percent’s after-tax income. Novack said Cruz, rather than increase taxes on the wealthy, believes the only way to ""jumpstart the economy is by championing pro-growth policies like energy development and a flatter, simpler tax structure."" And, Novack said, Cruz drew his comparison to 1928 from a report by the Pew Research Center citing research by Emmanuel Saez, a University of California, Berkeley economics professor who studies wealth and income inequality. Saez helps steer the World Top Incomes Database, sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, a research center and conglomerate of French universities offering graduate degrees and post-graduate fellowships in economics. The database, in place since 2011, shows the distribution of top incomes for more than 20 countries using data from millions of tax returns collected over about 100 years. By email, Saez said he and economists including Thomas Piketty built the database from sources including public-use files of individual tax returns. The public-use micro-files are blurred to preserve each payer’s confidentiality, Saez said. A closer look To check on changes over time for ourselves, we built a chart from the database. The resulting data, covering 1913, the earliest checkable year, to 2012, shows 1928 and 2012 to be the top two years where the top 1 percent of the richest Americans (the richest of the rich) earned the greatest share of the nation’s income, which the government breaks down into 15 categories including wages, salaries and self-employment income plus income from dividends and interest. In 1928, the top 1 percent of earners, then comprised of about 1.2 million residents, together held 19.6 percent of the nation’s income. In 2008, the year Obama was elected president, the top 1 percent possessed nearly 18 percent. The 1 percent collectively saw its share of the nation’s income escalate nearly 5 percent through the first three years of Obama’s presidency. And in his fourth year, 2012, the 1 percent (nearly 314 million residents) controlled 19.34 percent. According to the database, that was the greatest share these wealthiest Americans had held since 1928, as Cruz said. (No. 3 goes to 1927, when the top 1 percent had 18.7 percent of U.S. income.) Top 15 years the richest American taxpayers had the greatest share of U.S. income  1913 through 2012   Year Top 1% income share 1928 19.6 2012 19.34 1927 18.68 1916 18.57 1929 18.42 2007 18.33 1914 18.16 2006 18.06 1926 18.01 1913 17.96 2008 17.89 2005 17.68 1936 17.64 1917 17.6 1925 17.6 Source: ""The World Top Incomes Database,"" 2011 (accessed Jan. 30, 2015) By email, Saez told us Obama and Congress (which shifted to Republican control in his tenure) did little to address wealth inequality up until 2012 as the country recovered from the Great Recession -- which officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. In a Sept. 3, 2013, report, Saez wrote that in 2012, average real  incomes per family in the top 1 percent of earners nationally increased by 19.6 percent, while average incomes among the rest of us grew 1 percent. The report said the entire surge in top 1 percent incomes in 2012 could be a result of income re-timing -- when people hold off on making payments so they can report a higher income to take advantage of lower tax rates. By email, Saez said he expects the top 1 percent’s income share for 2014 to prove slightly lower than in 2012 as a result of tax increases approved by Congress and Obama in 2013 raising the nation’s marginal income-tax rate from 35 to 39.6 percent for married couples earning more than $450,000 annually, starting in 2013. That deal, which also whittled tax deductions for high-earning businesses and individuals, helped the government avoid the ""fiscal cliff, a term describing the looming impact of tax cuts initiated by President George W. Bush expiring at the end of 2012 at the same time congressionally mandated spending reductions were due to kick in. Questions about income-inequality research The World Top Incomes Database and Saez’s work have become popular sources for politicians to cite when discussing income and wealth inequality. Still, some experts have raised doubts about what goes into the Piketty-Saez inequality measurements. By email, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said the Saez-Piketty data understate income growth by the bottom 99 percent. That is, he noted, Piketty and Saez limit their focus to pre-tax private income including wages, self-employment earnings, dividends, interest, rental payments and, in some cases, capital gains. The result, Burtless said, is the database doesn’t consider other sources of income such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps, government reimbursement of medical bills and untaxed fringe benefits such as employer contributions to health and retirement plans. ""If we include these income items, the bottom 99 percent of income recipients has enjoyed much faster increases in income"" than what’s ""shown by Piketty and Saez,"" Burtless wrote. Burtless suggested the best statistics on U.S. income inequality come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. ""That's because CBO constructs 3 measures of income -- ‘gross market income,’ ‘pretax income’ (gross market income plus cash and no cash government transfers), and ‘after-tax income’ (pre-tax income minus federal income, payroll, and excise taxes),"" Burtless said in his email."" CBO data indicates that from 2009 to 2010, the top 1 percent’s share of income increased from 13.3 percent to 14.9 percent. (To refresh, Piketty and Saez say their research shows the top 1 percent’s share of income escalating from 16.68 percent to 17.45 percent.) Next, we talked to Robert Litan, another economist with the Brookings Institution, about why income inequality escalated so quickly in Obama’s first term. By email, Litan said reasons for the rising share of the top 1 percent’s income include ""rising CEO pay relative to workers, extraordinary success of tech entrepreneurs in particular, made possible by Internet + globalization, and successful financiers, especially hedge fund managers."" A June 12, 2014 article by the liberal Economic Policy Institute also highlights inequality in earnings and compensation between CEOs and typical workers. Burtless and Litan also told us by email Congress and Obama could not have done much to affect the percentage increase of the top 1 percent’s income based on Piketty-Saez measurements. ""The Congress and president have a bigger direct impact on after-tax income than on pre-tax income because their decisions directly affect the tax burdens and government transfer payments of families in different positions in the income distribution,"" Burtless said. Our ruling Cruz said: ""Today the top 1 percent earn a higher share of our national income than any year since 1928."" Cruz accurately recapped calculations of income by respected researchers though this statement fails to note there are some income streams not part of the cited calculations that would tend to help those of us in the bottom 99 percent, relatively speaking. Also, tax changes that took effect in 2013 may slightly be reducing how much of the nation’s income is held by the top 1 percent. Mark this statement Mostly True.

John Cornyn says more than 80 percent of U.S. sex trafficking victims are U.S. citizens
","Sex trafficking, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn declared, isn’t confined to other countries. The Texas Republican said in a Jan. 27, 2015, floor speech: ""You might envision brothels in foreign cities or girls being smuggled across other borders, but the sad reality is human trafficking is a problem all across the United States and at all times of the year. ""But it's especially a problem surrounding big public events like the Super Bowl,"" Cornyn said, a theme that drew the attention of PolitiFact in Washington, D.C. ""Yes, human trafficking is happening right in our own backyard, and more than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens."" Sex trafficking is -- as defined by the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000 --  a circumstance ""in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age."" We were curious about citizens accounting for most U.S. sex trafficking victims. Cornyn relied on 2011 government report To our query, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out an April 2011 report from the Bureau of Statistics in the Department of Justice. ""This is the latest national study available that examines the citizenship status of trafficking victims,"" Brandewie said by email. That report says that from January 2008 through June 2010, 83 percent of confirmed U.S. victims in incidents opened for investigation of sex trafficking (including of prostitution or sexual exploitation of a child) identified by federally funded task forces were U.S. citizens. Confusingly to us, though, a chart in the report indicates 345 of 460 confirmed sex trafficking victims, or 75 percent, were U.S. citizens; the next-most-prevalent identities were undocumented (64) and of unknown citizenship (41). By email, bureau statistician Tracey Kyckelhahn, who contributed to the research, told us the report’s declared 83 percent figure was reached by setting aside (not considering) the victims of unknown citizenship in its calculation. ""If you don’t know whether a victim is a citizen or not, they cannot be included because you don’t know where to put them. You would have to make an assumption about their citizen status,"" Kyckelhahn wrote. This decision reduced total confirmed sex trafficking victims to 419, elevating the share of U.S. citizens among confirmed victims to 83 percent. More broadly, the bureau cautioned us against reaching national conclusions from its study. That is, Kyckelhahn emailed, the resulting ""numbers are not national numbers. They’re based only"" on ""some task forces."" The point: The counted victims were confirmed by 18 of 42 ""high quality"" federally funded task forces representing law enforcement agencies that regularly recorded new cases; provided individual-level information for at least one suspect or victim; and regularly updated case information, the report said. Asked if there is national research on what Cornyn singled out, Kyckelhahn replied: ""I seriously doubt there are national estimates,"" though there are probably city-specific numbers. Advocates' analyses We sought other expertise, starting with Malika Saada Saar of Rights4Girls, which describes itself as a human rights organization focused on gender-based violence and its impact on the country’s vulnerable young women and girls. Saar, recommended by Brandewie, said by email the idea most victims are citizens is consistent with data she has seen emerging from California, Florida, New York and Connecticut ""where many, if not most, of the children identified as trafficked and exploited are U.S. kids."" Also, she said, it’s consistent with what her group hears from organizations serving trafficked and exploited children and youth. A web search led us to Carol Smolenski, executive director of Brooklyn-based ECPATUSA, a group whose mission is to ""protect every child’s basic human right to grow up free from the threat of sexual exploitation and trafficking."" Smolenski, who said she’s worked against child trafficking for nearly a quarter century, said generally, the lack of valid trafficking data ""has always been the problem."" And, she said by phone, there isn’t comprehensive national research showing the citizenship of U.S. sex trafficking victims. Smolenski said it’s likely the 83 percent figure that Cornyn relied on overstates the prevalence of U.S. citizens among victims. That’s because international victims living here are ""hidden within immigrant communities,"" Smolenski said, and less likely to be noticed by police like ones participating in the task forces cited by the Justice Department. Smolenski guided us to Shared Hope International, a U.S. group that combats sex trafficking. By phone, administrator Jocelyn Bell told us the 83 percent figure is the only known indicator of citizenship--and an incomplete one. ""Unfortunately,"" Bell said by phone, the national ""research just isn’t there/hasn’t been funded."" So, she said, ""we just aren’t sure"" what which victims nationally are citizens. By email, Brandewie pointed out the senator relied on a government report that hasn’t been contradicted by other research. Our ruling Cornyn said more ""than 80 percent of sex trafficking victims in America are U.S. citizens."" That’s consistent with the only available figure we spotted. But you can get to 75 percent from the same study and, perhaps more significantly, a statistician involved in the work advises against saying the 83-percent figure, based on information from 18 law enforcement task forces, reflects the share of victims who are citizens across the country.

Rand Paul says Earned Income Tax Credit has 25 percent fraud rate that costs up to $30 billion
","In what could be a prelude to the Republican presidential debate season, a handful of potential GOP contenders shared a stage at a recent conservative confab hosted by the deep-pocketed Koch brothers. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas cordially sparred on a host of issues at the Freedom Partners retreat on Jan. 25. One area of division was about whether to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. The program is designed to incentivize low-income individuals to work by giving them a tax refund (technically a refundable tax credit) on money that is earned. For the very poor, the refund increases the more money they make, which encourages more work. Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit is one area where there’s some agreement between President Barack Obama and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the GOP’s go-to member for fiscal issues. But Rand Paul said Washington needed to pump the brakes on those proposals. ""When you look at the earned income tax credit, it has about a 25 percent fraud rate,"" Paul said. ""We're looking at $20 billion to $30 billion. And this is from estimates from the (Government Accountability Office), from the government themselves."" We decided to check to see if Paul’s numbers add up. There are definitely problems with the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the Earned Income Tax Credit, but they’re not all issues of fraud, as Paul claimed. In multiple reports, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has dinged the IRS for failing to take steps to prevent improper payments. Since 2002, the IRS has been required to report estimates of improper payments to Congress. In that time, ""the IRS has made little improvement in reducing improper Earned Income Tax Credit payments,"" the inspector general wrote in 2013. The Earned Income Tax Credit is the only IRS program that is considered a high-risk for improper payments, the inspector general said in 2014. At the root of the problem is the complex nature of the tax credit: It is available to only low-income individuals, and it fluctuates based on earnings, number of children and other factors. The churn into and out of the program is high — about one-third of all recipients are first-timers, or their eligibility changes year-to-year due to swings in their income. This creates confusion among both recipients and administrators. The IRS said it is difficult to balance reducing improper benefits with encouraging people who qualify to use the credit. How prevalent are these improper payments? According to the inspector general, 22 to 26 percent of all payments are improper. And how much does that cost taxpayers? The entire program totaled $63 billion in 2013, meaning improper payments ranged from $13.3 billion to $15.6 billion. So Paul’s percentage was right, but he overstated the actual annual cost. Paul’s statement, his spokesman Brian Darling said, also included another tax credit highlighted by the auditor’s 2014 report, the Additional Income Tax Credit, which similarly provides refunds for some working families with children. The inspector general found improper payments between $5.9 billion and $7 billion in 2013. Combined, improper payments from the two programs would likely top $20 billion. Not all improper payments, however, are ""fraud,"" as Paul put it. There are six issues that have led to improper payments, one of which is fraud. But none of them ""can be considered the primary driver of the (Earned Income Tax Credit) improper payments,"" the report said. Improper payments had two root causes: authentication and verification. For example, an authentication problem would be if a parent claims a child that doesn’t live with the parent most of the time. A verification problem would be if a person claims to have a lower income than they have. About 70 percent of improper payments are due to authentication problems. ""The biggest source of error has to do with family status,"" said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center and former director of research at the IRS. ""The size of the EITC has to do with how many kids you have, and the definition of ‘child’ means they’re living with you half the time. And in many low-income homes, kids go back and forth between one parent or another, and it’s not obvious who should be claiming the child, or they’re claiming the child they shouldn’t be."" Of course, there are also ways to make mistakes filing income taxes under both scenarios. The IRS doesn’t keep track of how many improper payments are due to fraud and how many are due to human error. Paul’s spokesman said the distinction is negligible. ""At a minimum it is a fraud on the taxpayer, because they are the source for improper payments,"" Darling said. Why have there habitually been issues stopping these improper payments? Unlike other federal assistance like food stamps, which require an in-person application process to weed out potential fraud, the tax credit is handled entirely by the tax system. Another issue is the typical benefit per family is small. The average payout is about $3,000. The IRS might prioritize more costly fraud instead of targeting small-time scofflaws, Toder said. Attempts have been made in the past to increase the number of auditors to target fraud among these populations, Toder added. Other policy changes have attempted to fix the error rate, to little success. Our ruling Paul said the earned income tax credit has a 25 percent ""fraud rate"" at a cost to taxpayers of $20 billion to $30 billion. There is a history of improper payments with the Earned Income Tax Credit that has not been resolved, for various reasons, since the IRS began reporting it in 2002. It’s listed as the only IRS program deemed to have a high risk of improper payments. But Paul’s characterization of the problem as ""fraud"" is way too specific. Not every improper payment constitutes fraud, and the exact percentage of fraud is not known. Also, the amount of improper payments is less than Paul said -- between $13.3 billion and $15.6 billion. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the claim Half True.","[('ABC News, ""Transcript: Freedom Partners Forum: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio In Conversation with ABC’s Jonathan Karl,"" Jan. 26, 2015', 'https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-freedom-partners-forum-ted-cruz-rand-paul/story?id=28491534&singlePage=true'), ('Email interview with Brian Darling, spokesman for Sen.

Does Wisconsin, which used photo ID once in 2012, require it for voting as Scott Walker says?
","Here’s a claim Gov. Scott Walker made on the campaign trail, in Iowa, that he probably would not have made in Wisconsin: ""We require in our state, by law, a photo I.D. to vote."" That made us, as regular Wisconsin voters, say: Really? Walker’s speech First, let’s flesh out the claim. Walker made it during his Jan. 24, 2015 speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit, a gathering of Republicans in Des Moines that featured several potential presidential candidates. The governor highlighted what he called the ""common-sense conservative agenda that we’ve enacted in our state,"" trumpeting ""pro-life legislation,"" defunding Planned Parenthood, tort reform and legalizing the concealed carry of handguns. Then he added: ""And we believe it’s important to protect the integrity -- the integrity -- of each and every vote cast. So we require in our state, by law, a photo I.D. to vote."" In one sense, Walker was careful in saying that ""by law,"" Wisconsin requires photo I.D. But he was also misleading. As a result of ongoing legal battles, the law has been used only once, in a low-turnout primary nearly three years ago. The state of the law Here’s a recent history of photo I.D. in Wisconsin, based on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports and information from the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections. May 25, 2011: Walker signs Act 23, which makes various changes in voting regulations. Its main requirement is that residents present a document, including photo identification, in order to vote. The document could be, among other things, a driver’s license, passport, state I.D. or a college I.D.. Feb. 21, 2012: The voter I.D. law is used for a primary election. The only state offices that were on the ballot were six circuit court judgeships, one each in six counties. March 2012: In separate cases, two state judges in Dane County enjoin the law on state constitutional grounds. In other words, the law can’t be used. April 29, 2014: The law suffers another setback, this time in federal court, when U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman in Milwaukee strikes it down. Adelman rules the law violates the federal Voting Rights Act and says it ""will prevent more legitimate votes from being cast than fraudulent votes."" Aug. 1, 2014: The law gets a boost from the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which upholds it in the two Dane County cases. But the law remains blocked because of the federal litigation. Sept. 12, 2014:  Back in federal court, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago reinstates the law, ordering it be used for the Nov. 4, 2014, elections. (The appeals court also rules, on Oct. 6, 2014, that the law is constitutional.) Oct. 9, 2014: The appeals court ruling is put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court, out of concerns that there was not enough time to implement it before the Nov. 4, 2014 elections. Jan. 7, 2015: The U.S. Supreme Court is asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to strike down the law. The high court has not yet announced whether it will take the case. Quite a winding road -- leaving us where? Waiting. According to Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel of the Government Accountability Board: The U.S. Supreme Court could decide to hear the case and issue a final ruling. Or it could refuse to hear the case, which would mean the federal appeals court ruling upholding the law would stand. Our rating Touting a number of conservative actions he has taken as governor, Walker said Wisconsin requires, ""by law, a photo I.D. to vote."" The 2011 voter I.D. law that Walker signed is on the books, although it has been used only once, in a February 2012 primary. Since then, the law has been blocked amid court challenges. And it can’t be enforced until there is a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Marco Rubio now against immigration reform, pathway to citizenship
","As U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., considers a bid for president, Democrats are attacking him on his signature issue: immigration. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida had this to say about her fellow Floridian: ""Marco Rubio needs to first figure out which way the wind is blowing when it comes to committing on his position on any given issue,"" said the Democratic National Committee chair. ""He was for immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship before he was against it. It is really unfortunate that he has chosen the most politically expedient path on issues that matter the most to people here in Florida."" Has Rubio back-tracked? While Rubio has changed his opinion on how the legislation should be passed, we also found that he hasn’t changed his views on the underlying policy issues. Rubio and the Senate bill Rubio and seven other senators unveiled bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate in April 2013. The law required beefed-up border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status. Specifically, the bill would have allowed people to seek ""registered provisional immigrant status"" if they met certain criteria. After 10 years, they could seek a green card. Under pre-existing law, those with green cards can later apply for citizenship. Within months the bill had died, and Rubio said he would support a different approach: a series of bills to change immigration laws. 'American Dreams' book Rubio’s most specific recent comments on immigration are in his book American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone, released in January. (His spokesman pointed us to it when we asked.) Rubio wrote that a comprehensive bill ""is simply not realistic,"" but that a series of bills could still get to the same end. (Remember, the Senate bill also called for security measures first and a work-based system.) He outlined three steps for handling illegal immigrants already here: They would have to register, and those who have committed serious crimes or haven’t been here long enough would have to leave. Those who qualify would then pay an application fee and fine, undergo a background check and learn English in order to apply for a temporary visa. They would not qualify for government programs including health care, welfare or food stamps. After at least a decade at this status, ""they would be allowed to apply for permanent residency if they so choose. Many who qualify for this status will choose to remain in it indefinitely. But those who choose to seek permanent residency would have to do it the way anyone else would, not through a special pathway."" Rubio’s book doesn’t specifically explain how a permanent resident would then become a citizen. However existing law allows permanent residents -- commonly referred to as green card holders -- to apply for citizenship a few years later. Rubio ""is on record repeatedly saying it would be a bad idea to change existing law in that respect,"" his spokesman Alex Conant said. As recently as December 2014, Rubio said it was a bad idea to bar people from citizenship permanently: ""We might prohibit people who came here illegally and got green cards under this process from ever becoming citizens. And if that’s what we have to do to get this thing passed, I would be open to it. But I don’t think that’s a wise thing to do."" He made similar comments to CNN in January 2015. But it’s not like Rubio doesn’t finesse his message for different audiences. The DNC pointed to an interview that Rubio gave to conservative radio talk show host Simon Conway in June 2014. ""The part that’s difficult is, is what do you do with millions of people in this country who are here illegally? What do you do about it? And I think that the couple of things we’re not going to do -- we’re not going to award citizenship to people or give them a benefit they wouldn’t otherwise have. And we’re also not going to round up and deport 12 million people. So the problem with finding a solution between those two different positions is people are not willing to even talk about it until they believe the laws are going to be enforced."" Changing tacts We asked a few experts on immigration policy if Rubio is now ""against"" immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship. ""There is no substantial policy difference,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Sen. Rubio's current position on handling the illegal immigrant population is very similar to his opinion in 2013. The only difference is that now Sen. Rubio wants several piecemeal bills rather than one comprehensive bill -- a stylistic rather than a substantive change.""   However, Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, which advocates for a path to citizenship, says Rubio’s new approach is no tiny tweak. ""From the perspective of those of us working on immigration reform from day one, the idea of piecemeal approach is another excuse not to get to the piece that makes Republicans uncomfortable, which is legalization or a path to citizenship,"" he said. ""I don’t think retreat to piecemeal process is a small concession, I see it as a huge problem."" If Wasserman Schultz’s ""point is his new position makes a path to citizenship virtually impossible, I would agree with that statement,"" Sharry said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that Rubio ""was for immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship before he was against it."" The 2013 Senate bill which Rubio co-sponsored to overhaul our immigration system included a pathway to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants, albeit one with significant hurdles. After that died, Rubio said he still favored immigration reform, but that it’s only chance was through piecemeal bills. In his book, Rubio outlined specific steps for illegal immigrants to obtain legal status, and after many years eventually pursue citizenship.   There is a kernel of truth to Wasserman Schultz’s claim, though, because some immigration advocates say Rubio’s piecemeal approach greatly reduces the chance that Congress would ever get to the point of addressing residency and citizenship. We rate this claim Mostly False.","[('Sun-Sentinel, ""Wasserman Schultz slams Rubio, says Republicans afraid to stand up to bigots in their own party,"" Jan. 23, 2015', 'http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-wasserman-schultz-rubio-presidential-20150123-story.html'), ('Sen.

John Boehner says Obamacare 'puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create'
","As a new, entirely Republican-controlled Congress kicked into gear this month, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sat for an interview on CBS' 60 Minutes. The pair addressed many topics, including one of the biggest sources of friction between Republicans and President Barack Obama: the Affordable Care Act, the major health-care overhaul sometimes called Obamacare. ""All the regulations that are coming out of Washington make it more difficult for employers to hire more people,"" Boehner said in the interview. ""Chief amongst those, I would argue, is Obamacare, which basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create."" Boehner’s concern that there would be ""a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create"" stems from a provision in the law known as the employer mandate, which levies a penalty on employers if they fail to offer their workers health insurance. The provision -- twice delayed by the Obama administration -- applies to workers who are on the job for at least 30 hours per week. The penalty is calculated on a formula that takes into account the number of uninsured workers. (A Republican proposal to raise that hours-per-week threshold has inspired some debate, as we noted in an earlier fact-check.) We don’t doubt that the law will impose an added financial burden on some employers. But Boehner’s description was too sweeping. Here are some of the reasons why: Not every company will be affected by the employer mandate When the penalty finally took effect this month, it did so for companies with at least 100 workers. Companies with between 50 and 99 workers will have another year until the penalty hits them. (We should note that the penalty applies only if a worker qualifies for an insurance subsidy from the government.) What this means is that the rule is never supposed to apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 workers. So when Boehner said Obamacare ""basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create,"" it’s a significant exaggeration by the numbers. How much of an exaggeration? Let’s start with larger businesses. According to a widely tracked survey of employers conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 94 percent of firms with 100 or more workers already offer health insurance to their employees. That means 6 percent of those big companies will need to start offering health coverage. The U.S. Census Bureau says there are 101,642 firms with at least 100 employees, so that means roughly 6,000 big firms will have to change their behavior because of the employer mandate. Meanwhile, the Kaiser study found that for firms with 50 to 99 workers, 90 percent already offer health insurance. Census data doesn’t use the same size ranges; the census counts 494,170 firms with between 20 and 99 workers. That still means that fewer than 50,000 firms would need to offer coverage. As an example, if 200,000 businesses have between 50 and 99 workers, then 20,000 will need to start offering coverage due to the law. If you combine these two figures, that means perhaps 26,000 private-sector firms will have to start offering health coverage or else pay penalties this year or next year. That’s hardly a trivial number -- but it’s important to remember that this is not a large proportion of all American employers. The Census Bureau found 5,726,160 employers nationally, so less than one percent of all companies will have to start offering coverage due to the law. Boehner spokesman Michael Steel emphasized to PolitiFact that the speaker didn’t ""say ‘all’ employers.""  Where Boehner voices legitimate concerns All this said, independent experts told us that Boehner could have raised some valid concerns about the employer mandate if he’d offered a less sweeping claim. • While businesses with fewer than 50 workers are exempt from the individual mandate, they may feel an impact nonetheless. If these companies offer insurance, the law institutes a range of pro-consumer regulations that could increase health insurance premiums. ""This is not the same thing as a tax for every job created, but some firms may view it negatively,"" said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at RAND Corp. Eibner added that such regulations could cut both ways -- the new rules could potentially lower premiums for certain firms, such as those with older workers. • As we noted in our previous fact-check, the law’s employer mandate is likely to drive some companies to cut the hours of some workers so they can get them under the 30-hour-per-week floor that triggers the health-insurance requirement. While we found that critics of the law had exaggerated the number of workers who have already suffered that fate, we found it plausible that such work-hour cuts could happen to several hundred thousand workers. Of course, it’s worth remembering that the costs from the law don’t stop with the employer -- whenever new taxes or regulations are imposed, companies typically pass them on, including to their workers. ""Most economists believe that firms ultimately pass the costs of benefits onto their workers in the form of reduced wages or other compensation,"" Eibner said. ""If benefits become more generous, workers’ wages won’t rise as quickly.  In this sense, the economic burden of these provisions is more likely to fall on workers than firms, especially over time as wages adjust. Some workers may be willing to accept that trade-off because they value having access to health insurance."" Our ruling Boehner said the health care law ""basically puts a penalty or a tax on employers for every new job they create."" The law does impose penalties and regulations that could increase costs for some companies, though the impact depends heavily on the individual employer’s situation (and could actually result in lower costs for some companies). However, the law will force only a tiny fraction of employers -- less than 1 percent of companies by our estimate -- to start offering coverage when they did not do so before. That’s something that wouldn’t be clear to someone who heard Boehner’s comment. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.","[('John Boehner, interview on CBS’ 60 Minutes, Jan. 25, 2015', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boehner-mcconnell-60-minutes-scott-pelley/'), ('Census Bureau, ""Number of Firms, Number of Establishments, Employment, and Annual Payroll by Enterprise Employment Size for the United States and States, Totals: \xa02012,"" accessed Jan. 29, 2015', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""Percentage of firms offering health benefits to at least some of their workers by firm size, 2014,"" accessed Jan. 29, 2015', 'http://www2.census.gov/econ/susb/data/2012/us_state_totals_2012.xls'), ('PolitiFact, ""CEO of Carl\'s Jr. says \'Obamacare has caused millions of full-time jobs to become part-time,\' "" Jan. 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Craig Palosky, spokesman for the Kaiser Family Foundation, Jan. 28, 2015', 'http://files.kff.org/attachment/ehbs-2014-abstract-chartpack'), ('Email interview with Gail Wilensky, head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W.

Does sex trafficking increase around the Super Bowl?
","For the past few years, campaigns against human sex trafficking have swelled in the days before the Super Bowl, largely because of the persistence of a claim that it’s the largest sex trafficking event in the country. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has been pushing anti-human trafficking legislation through Congress, repeated this at a Jan. 27 news conference. ""While most Americans are going to be getting prepared for the Seahawks and the Patriots to tee off in the Super Bowl,"" Cornyn said, ""the dirty little secret is that the Super Bowl actually (has) one of the highest levels of human sex trafficking activity of any event in the country."" Cornyn’s staff clarified that he was not saying human trafficking surges nationally on Super Bowl Sunday. He meant that it surges in the region where the Super Bowl takes place and in the days surrounding the event. (This year, it’s Feb. 1 in Phoenix.) But as it turns out, there is very little empirical evidence that speaks to this oft-repeated claim -- even though there is some recent academic research on the topic. While there are news reports and anecdotal examples of sting operations in Super Bowl host cities, comparisons to the rest of the year are rare, making it hard to know whether there’s a Super Bowl spike.   The latest evidence We spoke with Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, a social work professor at Arizona State University who is leading the latest academic research on sex trafficking around the Super Bowl. Her research intends to discover whether or not there is an increase in sex-trafficking events surrounding the Super Bowl and to further understand sex trafficking trends. (Sex trafficking is -- as defined by the Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000 --  a circumstance ""in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age."") Roe-Sepowitz’s 2014 research used online escort ads to compare supply and demand for trafficking victims in New York City -- where the 2014 Super Bowl took place -- and used Phoenix as a control. During this weekend’s Super Bowl, they are looking at the same two cities and will publish a report in the coming weeks. Last year, they reviewed online commercial sex ads in the New York and Phoenix metropolitan areas in the days leading up to and following the game. Out of nearly 1,000 ads in New York, 84 percent indicated possible sex trafficking. Among more than 1,300 ads in Phoenix, 80 percent indicated possible sex trafficking. Roe-Sepowitz said that so far, the research does not show correlation between the Super Bowl and higher levels of sex trafficking activity. They found some evidence of ""victim movement and marketing trends that tend to correspond with the build up towards the Super Bowl"" -- traffickers responding to the influx of thousands of men with money to spend. But they did not find that the level of activity was necessarily higher than other weeks out of the year. On the other hand, increased public attention on trafficking around the Super Bowl might mean that the frequency is lower than it would be otherwise. In all, this research does not conclusively prove one way or another that the Super Bowl is the largest event for sex-trafficking in the country. Other debunkings Some advocacy groups have tried to debunk the rumor, too. Around the time of the 2014 Super Bowl, leaders from the Polaris Project -- an advocacy organization -- wrote a column in the Huffington Post, in which they acknowledged that the evidence for a spike in trafficking around the Super Bowl is slim. And the idea detracts from the fact that trafficking occurs year-round. The Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women, an advocacy group, published an extensive report on sex trafficking and the major sports events, including the Super Bowl, in 2011. ""The hype around large sporting events and increases in trafficking for prostitution is often based on misinformation, poor data and a tendency to sensationalize,"" the report says. ""On various occasions, politicians have uncritically repeated this claim, despite the fact that numerous researchers, anti-trafficking experts, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have stated that there is no evidence of a link between large sporting events and trafficking for prostitution."" Cornyn’s staff sent us links to several news articles that they said indicated a spike in human trafficking around the Super Bowl. For example, the New York Attorney General’s office had evidence that a prostitution ring offered special discounted ""party packs"" around the Super Bowl -- but those arrested were not charged with human trafficking (as opposed to prostitution). Another article that Cornyn’s staff sent quotes Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who has worked with Cornyn on sex-trafficking legislation, saying: ""During the Dallas Super Bowl in 2011 there was a 300 percent increase in the Internet ads regarding sex trafficking.""  Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker checked this claim and gave it their worst rating in terms of accuracy -- four Pinocchios. Klobuchar was (incorrectly) citing an informal study out of the Texas-based Traffick911. That study found a 172 percent spike in Internet ads for female escorts in the three weeks leading up to the Dallas Super Bowl. But that study does not specify that these posts indicated sex trafficking, rather than prostitution, and there’s no comparison to prior Super Bowls or trends in escort service posts at other times of the year in Dallas. Cornyn’s staff also sent articles that included estimates of trafficking victims in areas around the Super Bowl host city in past years -- such as for those trafficked in the Miami area for the Super Bowl there in 2010. But there’s no way of knowing with certainty whether this is a spike, because we don’t have figures from the rest of the year to compare.   Our ruling Cornyn said that the Super Bowl has ""one of the highest levels of human sex trafficking activity of any event in the country."" There’s very little evidence to support this persistent claim. It’s certainly possible that a Super Bowl host city might attract more sex trafficking during the event than it would at other points in the year given the rapid arrival of many thousands of visitors with money to spend. But there’s no empirical evidence to prove it.   We rate his claim Mostly False.","[('CQ Transcripts, ""Senate Republican Leaders and Sen.

Fact-checking Bill Belichick's claim about 'Deflategate'
","The New England Patriots might wish this entire business of under-inflated footballs would vanish in a puff of smoke, but it’s a boon for physics teachers who have found themselves suddenly relevant in the world of sports. Patriots coach Bill Belichick, a self-declared non-scientist, held a pre-Super Bowl news conference where he attempted to explain why a football inflated indoors would lose pressure after being used outside.  ""When the footballs are delivered to the officials' locker room, the officials were asked to inflate them to 12.5 pounds per square inch. What exactly they did, I don’t know,"" Belichick said. ""When the footballs go out on to the field into game conditions ...  That’s where the measurements would be different than what they are, possibly different, than what they are in a controlled environment."" Belichick said when Patriot staffers tested this, they found that the balls ""were down approximately one-and-a-half pounds per square inch."" There are too many unknowns to resolve Deflategate, as this flap is called. But we couldn't help but give Belichick's main assertion the PunditFact treatment. The question in this case is what physics tells us about Belichick’s point. Could conditions outside (basically temperature and humidity) bring down the pressure of a football by about 1.5 pounds per square inch? A quick recap The Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl on Jan. 18, 2015, by defeating the Indianapolis Colts 45-7. But by the next day, the most interesting number wasn’t the point spread, but the inflation pressure of the Patriots’ footballs. Under NFL rules, each team provides 12 balls, and about two hours before the game, an official verifies that they are inflated to the regulation pressure range of 12.5 to 13.5 pounds per square inch. At half-time, the NFL re-checked the Patriots’ footballs -- reportedly at the request of the Colts but there’s a bit of conflicting information on this -- and found 11 of the 12 were under inflated. By how much? That’s unclear. Some reports say by 2 pounds per square inch. Others say while one ball might have measured that low, the rest were only about 1 pound under. One other essential variable: The temperature on game day was around 50 degrees. No one knows the exact inside temperature. Most people assume it was about 70 degrees. Doing the math After Belichick spoke, ABC News turned to Bill Nye, the popular explainer of all things scientific, to assess the coach’s claim. ABC played up Nye's verdict that Belichick's words ""didn’t make any sense,"" but from the video, it sounds as though Nye was talking about Belichick's claim that rubbing the footballs would change the pressure, not the impact of temperature. CBS Sports relayed a tweet from another science luminary, physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson who also expressed skepticism. ""For the Patriots to blame a change in temperature for 15 percent lower-pressures, requires balls to be inflated with 125-degree air,"" Tyson wrote. CBS reported that ""Every 10 degree drop in temperature (F) results in about .2 PSI loss in a football."" According to CBS, that meant the weather would account for just a 0.4 pound of pressure loss, and tied that conclusion, loosely, to an Ohio State University physicist. We’ll get back to that CBS story (and its flaws) in a bit. On the other side of the ledger, USA Today interviewed Bowdoin College physics professor Dale Syphers who declared that a drop from room temperature in the 70s down to 40 degrees would reduce the pressure in a football by 1.3 pounds per square inch. The Daily Beast turned to the chair of the Physics Department at Boston College who said that with a 30 degree drop in temperature -- 75 down to 45 degrees -- you would expect the ball pressure to fall by by 1.54 pounds per square inch. Finally, the world of physics is divided between the theoretical physicists and the experimentalists. The physicists cited in the news worked with formulas. HeadSmart Labs, a private firm in Pittsburgh, tested actual footballs. It found that footballs inflated at 75 degrees, then cooled to 50 degrees lost 1.1 pounds of pressure. The lab took one more step. Since it was raining on game day, the staff dampened the balls. This led to a drop of an additional 0.7 pounds of pressure for a total of at least 1.8 pounds per square inch. The physics teachers come off the bench Enter Robert Hilborn of the American Association of Physics Teachers. The Harvard-trained physicist showed in detail how a law of physics, the ideal gas law, applied to the Patriots’ footballs. When a gas cools, it contracts. The ideal gas law helps us put numbers to that relationship between pressure and temperature. Math alert: We’re going to show you pretty much everything, so you can do it yourself at home. ""As almost every chemistry and physics student knows, the ideal gas law tells us that Pf = Pi (Tf/Ti),"" Hilborn wrote. The final pressure Pf equals the initial pressure Pi times the final temperature divided by the initial temperature Tf/Ti. Plugging in the numbers is simple, so long as you keep two things in mind. First, the pressure isn’t the pressure you see on your pressure gauge. It’s that amount plus the pressure of the atmosphere that’s all around you. It might feel counterintuitive, but when a football comes off the assembly line, before it's ever pumped up, it actually has an internal pressure that you wouldn't notice because it's the same as the pressure we always ignore. That's the pressure that comes from all those miles of air in our atmosphere pushing down on us. That pressure averages around 14.7 pounds per square inch. When you pump air into the football, you are adding pressure on top of the 14.7 that are already there. In Hilborn's math, you'll see he's added in the atmospheric pressure. The other key step is to measure the temperature in Celsius and count from absolute zero. That’s the Kelvin scale. Hilborn used a starting temperature of 70 degrees and a final temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit and a starting pressure of 12.5 pounds per square inch. ""Those numbers give us 27.2 psi for Pi, 294 K for Ti, and 283 K for Tf resulting in Pf = 26.2 psi for the total pressure and a corresponding gauge pressure of 11.5 psi, about 1 psi below the NFL lower limit."" In short, taking the balls outside would bring the pressure down 1 pound per square inch. Hilborn then accounted for the rain that day. Cooling the moist air inside the footballs would shed another 0.2 pounds per square inch. ""Combining the air temperature change effect with that of water vapor gives us a total of 1.2 psi, not too far from the figure of 1.4 psi given in one of the early NFL statements,"" Hilborn wrote. Hilborn’s results are pure math, and they are largely in line with the test results from the lab in Pittsburgh. The results in other news reports We were troubled by the CBS item that came up with a much lower number of 0.4 pounds per square inch due to a lower outdoor temperature. But when we called Prof. Michael Lisa, the Ohio State University physicist quoted in the CBS article, Lisa said, ""CBS got it wrong."" Lisa sent us this chart that you can download showing that for each 10 degrees drop in temperature, pressure drops 0.5 pounds. (The chart’s different lines show that the higher the starting pressure, the greater the impact of falling temperature.)  We found that news reports that undercut the Patriots’ explanation used a high number for the loss of pressure. CBS said the footballs lost 2 pounds of pressure. Ditto for a Toronto Sun article. If it turns out that there really was a loss that large, then those arguments hold up. For the moment, we are simply assessing whether the physics back up what Belichick said and he used the 1.5 pound figure. Lisa also affirmed Hilborn’s analysis. ""That AAPT guy did a nice job,"" Lisa said. Nevertheless, Hilborn himself said no one should rush to judgment. ""A conservative conclusion is that temperature changes alone can account for much of the under-inflation,"" Hilborn wrote. ""But until more accurate information is available about the preparation of and measurement of the footballs’ air pressure, we should not assert that conclusion with a great deal of certainty."" The NFL is investigating and at some point, all the numbers might be known. Or not. Hilborn told PunditFact that the accuracy of the pressure gauges is unclear. One number that will be of interest is the starting pressure for the Colts’ footballs. It's possible they may have deflated as well, but stayed within the legal limits. Our ruling Belichick said that moving the footballs from indoors to outdoors could explain the loss of about 1.5 pounds per square inch of pressure. Experimental and mathematical results are in that ballpark. Lab tests said air temperature alone could bring down the pressure by 1.1 pounds. The ideal gas law predicted a 1 pound loss. The rain that day would explain at least another 0.2 pound shift and possibly as much as 0.7. We lack firm numbers on the actual pressure drop in the Patriots footballs, as well as precise information on the starting and ending temperatures. Within the limits of what the physics alone can tell us at this point, the math gets us pretty close to what Belichick said. With allowances for the uncertain data, we rate the claim Mostly True.","[('New England Patriots, Belichick news conference, Jan. 24, 2015', 'http://www.patriots.com/media-center/videos/Belichick-124-Followed-every-rule-to-the-letter/d607eb23-2f67-4da5-aedc-b8bfba8d4c11'), ('NBC Sports, Belichick news conference transcript, Jan. 24, 2015', 'No link'), ('Boston Globe, Scientists find Belichick’s explanation plausible, Jan. 26, 2015', 'http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/01/25/transcript-of-bill-belichicks-january-24-press-conference/'), ('Toronto Sun, Deflategate: physicist discredits natural pressure-drop theories, Jan. 24, 2015', 'No link'), ('ABC News, Bill Nye debunks Bill Belichick’s response to Deflategate, Jan. 25, 2015', 'https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/01/26/scientists-agree-that-football-will-lose-air-pressure-when-moved-cooler-place/2KfFPHn9dARXXCwMgBMSkO/story.html'), (""CBS Sports, Neil deGrasse Tyson: Science from Belichick, Patriots doesn't add up, Jan. 26, 2015"", 'No link'), ('CBS Sports, Did weather play a role in Patriots-Colts Deflategate?, Jan. 21, 2015', 'http://www.torontosun.com/2015/01/24/deflategate-physicist-discredits-natural-pressure-drop-theories'), ('Newsday, NFL investigating Patriots for possible deflation of footballs, Jan. 20, 2015', 'No link'), ('ESPN, 11 of 12 Pats footballs underinflated, Jan. 21, 2015', 'https://www.people.com/article/bill-nye-bill-belichick-deflategate-response'), ('American Association of Physics Teachers, Deflategate, Jan. 28, 2015', 'No link'), ('Grantland, The Beginner’s Guide to DEFLATEGATE, Jan. 21, 2015', 'http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24997479/neil-degrasse-tyson-science-from-belichick-patriots-doesnt-add-up'), ('Comcast Sportsnet, PFT: Patriots footballs may have been closer to 11.5 PSI, Jan. 25, 2015', 'No link'), ('Physics.org, Football physics and the science of Deflategate, Jan. 23, 2015', 'http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24982438/did-weather-play-a-role-in-patriots-colts-deflategate'), ('HeadSmart Labs, The Science Behind ""Deflate-Gate"", Jan. 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Daily Beast, Ask A Scientist: Deflategate Is Trumped Up Nonsense, Jan. 24, 2015', 'https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/super-bowl/nfl-opens-patriots-deflated-football-probe-after-afc-championship-win-1.9821346'), (""USA Today, Professor says physics can explain 'Deflategate', Jan. 26, 2015"", 'No link'), ('NBC Sports, NFL bears plenty of blame for #DeflateGate, Jan. 25, 2015', 'http://espn.go.com/boston/story/_/id/12202450/nfl-says-new-england-patriots-had-inflated-footballs-afc-championship-game'), ('New York Times, N.F.L.

Insured people pay 'about $2,000' for uninsured hospital stays, Florida chamber says
","The Florida Chamber of Commerce is weighing in on the state’s rising cost of health care, decrying the Affordable Care Act’s plans to expand Medicaid, but acknowledging uninsured residents cost big bucks. A chamber task force on Jan. 13, 2015, released a seven-point plan entitled ""Smarter Healthcare Coverage in Florida,"" ahead of a potential fight among state lawmakers about how to cover the uninsured; Florida’s annual legislative session starts March 3. The group made it pretty clear they don’t endorse President Barack Obama’s health care law, calling it ""a bureaucratic malaise that is taxing Americans and making our country less competitive"" by shifting costs to businesses and taxpayers, and forcing up insurance premiums. They do acknowledge that Florida having the second-highest number of uninsured residents is a problem that needs fixing. ""Floridians pay an additional $1.4 billion in hidden health care taxes to cover health care received by the uninsured,"" the report read. ""Insured Floridians pay about $2,000 for every hospital stay to cover the cost of the uninsured."" Making insured residents pay an extra $2,000 per hospital stay piqued our interest, because that’s a hefty add-on to already high medical bills. We wondered whether it was a true expense, or if the chamber was just padding its own invoice. Footing the bill The chamber’s report said 3 million Floridians don’t have health insurance. The group told us it used Kaiser Family Foundation data that showed there were about 3.6 million. An estimate using Census data said about 3.8 million of Florida’s 19 million residents were uninsured in 2013. That same report ranked Florida second in the nation in uninsured residents. We’ve explored this topic before, and found Florida was third in its percentage of uninsured, behind Texas and Nevada. Calculating how much those uninsured Floridians cost other patients is not the easiest leap to make. We asked several state, medical and insurance agencies whether the number was accurate or not, and no one had a statistic measured in such a way. The chamber told us they collected data from ""an urban hospital"" and tracked that unspecified facility’s cost-to-charge ratio. That’s a measure of how much care actually costs a hospital to provide versus how much they would charge a patient, and can vary from hospital to hospital. The chamber then divided the uninsured procedures’ costs by the total number of admissions through managed-care insurance plans. After adjusting for accounting discrepancies and other factors, the chamber determined the cost was about $2,300 per patient. To account for cost differences between the kinds of patients other hospitals would admit and the type of care they receive, they estimated a lower end of the range at $1,700, or about 75 percent of the first estimate. The chamber acknowledged setting this low end was a ""somewhat arbitrary determination."" The description of ""about $2,000"" was meant to be an average of this range, chamber spokeswoman Edie Ousley told PolitiFact Florida. ""There will be, of course, individual hospitals (that) cost shift and some cost-shifting less per insured patient,"" Ousley said. ""The intent of the calculation was to take real data from a representative hospital and try to provide an order of magnitude of the cost shift of the uninsured."" The chamber said in its plan there were $1.4 billion in unpaid hospital expenses in 2012, a number that jibes with a Florida Hospital Association report that said in 2012, state hospitals spent $1.4 billion in ""charity care"" (the same as it was in 2011). To put that in perspective, the Agency for Health Care Administration reported more than $119 billion in charges for all hospital admissions in 2012. The average stay was about five days and cost more than $44,500. Charity care is defined as ""free or discounted health services provided to people who meet hospitals’ criteria for financial assistance."" It doesn’t include bad debt, uncollected charges or differences in treatment costs versus what a government program pays. FHA President Bruce Rueben has said he hoped ""there will be inroads"" to lowering that number in future reports, when people newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are taken into account. The federal insurance exchange didn’t open until Oct. 1, 2013, with policies starting in 2014, so data on how that affects charity care aren’t available. In any event, patients with insurance do end up paying for people who are not covered. Linda Quick, president of the South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association, said she had heard the Chamber’s number used before, but wasn’t aware of how it had been calculated. Nonetheless, it’s an estimate that is rooted in a real problem, she said. ""I think the underlying premise, those who do pay, pay for those who can't/don't is true,"" she told PolitiFact Florida via email, ""although the ‘cost shifting’ had become more burdensome before the Affordable Care Act and the availability of affordable coverage."" If Florida fully implemented the health care law, it would reduce the ranks of the uninsured. The pro-expansion Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy estimates about 1 million people would be covered under the Medicaid expansion by 2020, while the Kaiser Family Foundation said about 1.3 million people now qualify under the Affordable Care Act for subsidies to help them pay for private insurance. The Kaiser study said some 764,000 Floridians would fall into a coverage gap created when they earn too much to get Medicaid coverage, but not enough to get those subsidies. The rest either must buy their own insurance, are children covered by another program or are ineligible because of their immigration status. Our ruling The Florida Chamber of Commerce said, ""Insured Floridians pay about $2,000 for every hospital stay to cover the cost of the uninsured."" That number is based on an estimate the chamber developed in-house, calculating an average based on an unspecified ""urban hospital"" using the most recent data. There’s no way to tell just how accurate that estimate is, since it makes plenty of assumptions on actual costs. It also doesn’t take into account how much the Affordable Care Act will change the data, since the requirement for the uninsured to have policies didn’t kick in until 2014. Experts we talked to said there are problems with the chamber’s number, but it’s a somewhat reasonable illustration to a real problem in Florida: People who are insured end up paying for those who aren’t. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.","[('Florida Chamber of Commerce, ""A Smarter Healthcare Coverage Plan,"" Jan. 13, 2015', 'http://www.flchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/FL-Chamber-Plan-for-Smarter-Healthcare-Coverage.pdf'), ('Miami Herald, ""Florida Is No. 2 In Nation For Rate Of Uninsured,"" Aug. 30, 2013', 'No link'), ('Florida Hospital Association, ""Facts & Stats,"" accessed Jan. 23, 2015', 'http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/florida-uninsured/'), ('Florida Chamber of Commerce, ""Florida Chamber releases ‘A Smarter Healthcare Coverage Plan,’"" Jan. 13, 2015', 'No link'), ('Florida Center for Fiscal & Economic Policy, ""Rejecting Medicaid Expansion Not an Option for Florida,"" July 2012', 'http://www.fha.org/facts.html'), ('Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, ""Florida Health Care Expenditures in 2012,"" March 2014', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, ""How Will the Uninsured in Florida Fare Under the Affordable Care Act?,"" Jan. 6, 2014', 'http://www.flchamber.com/article/florida-chamber-releases-smarter-healthcare-coverage-plan/'), ('Health Care for Florida Now, ""Benefits Of The Affordable Care Act,"" accessed Jan. 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Florida Health Alliance, ""Medicaid Expansion and the Affordable Care Act in Florida,"" Dec. 10, 2012', 'http://www.fcfep.org/attachments/20120705--Rejecting%20Medicaid%20Expansion%20Not%20an%20Option%20for%20Florida.pdf'), ('Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, ""2012 Florida Hospital Financial Data,"" Sept. 13, 2013', 'No link'), ('Naples Daily News, ""Florida Hospital Association reports increase in hospital charity care,"" Nov. 25, 2014', 'https://floridahealthfinderstore.blob.core.windows.net/documents/researchers/documents/FCHIPA%20BRIEF%20-%20Health%20Care%20Expenditures%20in%202012%20-%20FINAL.pdf'), ('Florida Hospital Association, ""Florida Hospitals’ 2014 Community Benefit Report,"" November 2014', 'No link'), ('Interview with Edie Ousley, Florida Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, Jan. 23, 27, 2015', 'http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/state-profiles-uninsured-under-aca-florida/'), ('Interview with Linda Quick, South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association president, Jan. 23, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview with Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, Jan. 23, 2015', 'http://www.healthcareforflorida.org/benefits'), ('Interview with Shelisha Coleman, Agency for Health Care Administration press secretary, Jan. 27, 2012', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/28/florida-chamber-commerce/insured-people-pay-about-2000-uninsured-hospital-s/

Are there more welfare recipients in the U.S. than full-time workers?
","One of the turning points in the 2012 presidential campaign was Republican nominee Mitt Romney privately saying that 47 percent of the population -- supporters of President Barack Obama, he said -- were people who are ""dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it."" The 2012 election is long over, but this theme -- sometimes framed as ""makers"" vs. ""takers"" -- is an enduring topic in American politics. Recently, the widely read conservative website TownHall.com posted a column by Terry Jeffrey, editor of the conseravative news service CNSNews.com, in which he compared Americans ""on welfare"" to those who are ""full-time year-round workers."" Specifically, Jeffrey wrote, there were more people on welfare than working. He wrote: ""In 2013, according to the Census Bureau, there were 105,862,000 full-time year-round workers in the United States -- including 16,685,000 full-time government workers. These full-time workers were outnumbered by the 109,631,000 whom the Census Bureau says were getting benefits from means-tested federal programs -- e.g. welfare -- as of the fourth quarter of 2012. ""Every American family that pays its own way -- and takes care of its own children whether with one or two incomes -- must subsidize the 109,631,000 on welfare."" A reader asked us to take a closer look at Jeffrey’s column, so we did. We found that the numbers he cited are real, but his descriptions of those numbers, and thus his interpretation, were off base. (Jeffrey did not return an inquiry for this article.) The number 109,631,000 does, as Jeffrey wrote, refer to the Census Bureau’s figure for the number of Americans receiving benefits from means-tested federal programs. And the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ figure for full-time workers was pretty close to his stated 105,862,000 for 2013, although not all of these workers necessarily worked all year. But his comparison is a case of apples and oranges. We found three broad concerns about Jeffrey’s characterization, which we’ll take in order. The term 'welfare' is being used at its most expansive. The word ""welfare"" has different meanings for different people. Many think it refers to cash payouts to people who aren’t working; others think it includes anyone who receives government assistance of any type. Jeffrey has chosen to use the most expansive definition. The number Jeffrey cited includes the ""traditional"" type of welfare, such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, but also programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. In fact, the beneficiaries in the Census Bureau’s accounting who received TANF and other cash-based payments were dwarfed by those who received Medicaid, food stamps and the food program called Women, Infants and Children, or WIC -- the three most widely used categories in the agency’s accounting. Jeffrey isn’t wrong to frame it that way, but it’s worth noting that the definition he’s used broadens the universe of recipients. The number includes many children and senior citizens. Jeffrey doesn’t take into account that the Census Bureau arrived at its figure by counting ""anyone residing in a household in which one or more people received benefits from the program."" This means the agency would count an entire family of four as receiving means-tested benefits as long as one individual within the family received such benefits. On its own, this definition is defensible. If one person in a household qualifies for food stamps, then the food purchased with those funds will likely be shared among all family members. However, the problem arises when Jeffrey compares this number to the number of full-time workers. He’s not comparing the number of households with a means-tested beneficiary to the number of households with a full-time worker. That would have been an apples-to-apples comparison. Rather, he’s comparing the number of households with a means-tested beneficiary to the number of full-time workers. This matters because it juices the numbers, effectively increasing the number of people on the welfare side of the comparison. Children and senior citizens can be counted as receiving means-tested benefits, but children cannot legally work, and many senior citizens may be retired or physically unable to work due to age. The difference isn’t trivial. In 2013, more than half of Medicaid recipients -- 51 percent -- were children, and another 5 percent were over 65, according to the Census Bureau. This pattern skews the comparison Jeffrey is trying to make. The number of 'welfare' recipients actually includes many workers. Just because you’re receiving means-tested benefits doesn’t mean you’re not working. According to 2012 Census Bureau data, roughly 23 percent of households with at least one working adult received means-tested benefits. For Medicaid, 28 percent of recipients between the ages of 18 and 64, worked full time, according to the Census Bureau. (Another 15 percent of recipients in that age group worked part time.) Other means-tested benefits show considerable overlap with the population of working adults. Roughly 60 percent of food stamp recipients who were of working age and weren’t disabled were employed while receiving benefits, according to a Census Bureau sample calculated by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. This matters because working recipients of means-tested benefits would be counted on both sides of the comparison, casting doubt on the notion that there’s a strict divide between people who work and people who are on welfare. Our ruling Jeffrey said that in 2013, there were 109,631,000 Americans ""on welfare,"" outnumbering the ""105,862,000 full-time year-round workers in the United States."" While the claim is based on real numbers, it’s a fundamentally flawed, apples-and-oranges comparison. The number of ""welfare"" recipients -- unlike the number of workers -- is enlarged by the inclusion of children and senior citizens. The comparison also ignores that many ""welfare"" recipients actually work, so trying to separate the two categories creates a false dichotomy. We rate the claim False.","[('Terry Jeffrey, ""Obama\'s Tax on Stay-At-Home Moms,"" Jan. 21, 2015', 'http://townhall.com/columnists/terryjeffrey/2015/01/21/obamas-tax-on-stayathome-moms-n1945836/page/2'), ('U.S. Census Bureau,\xa0Table HI01.

Fox News pundit says health care law will cost $50,000 per enrollee
","You know you’re inside the Beltway when a report from the Congressional Budget Office triggers a fusillade of tweets and punditry from partisans spanning the political spectrum. The CBO’s latest prediction on the budget and the economy devotes an entire appendix to the human and fiscal impacts of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare. Fox News host and business analyst Stuart Varney helped viewers make sense of some of the hefty numbers from the CBO. Talking with America’s Newsroom host Bill Hemmer, Varney explained that even though the deficit is expected to reach its lowest point of the Obama presidency, it will soon rise again. ""The major reason for this is Obamacare,"" Varney said. ""New figures suggest that Obamacare will be much more expensive than we thought. It will cost $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years."" Varney’s claim about $50,000 per enrollee caught our eye because we’ve seen it all over the Internet and we wanted to see how accurate it might turn out to be. We reached out to Varney and did not hear back. But the original source, at least the earliest we could find, is an article in the British Daily Mail.  Here’s how that article begins: It will cost the federal government – taxpayers, that is – $50,000 for every person who gets health insurance under the Obamacare law, the Congressional Budget Office revealed on Monday. The number comes from figures buried in a 15-page section of the nonpartisan organization's new ten-year budget outlook. The best-case scenario described by the CBO would result in 'between 24 million and 27 million' fewer Americans being uninsured in 2025, compared to the year before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Pulling that off will cost Uncle Sam about $1.35 trillion – or $50,000 per head. The basic math is correct. Divide $1.35 trillion by 27 million people and you get $50,000. But health policy analyst Joe Antos at the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think-tank in Washington, told PunditFact that the number is meaningless. ""You can’t divide a 10-year spending number by the average number of people who are newly insured,"" Antos said. ""That’s not the way it works."" We heard the same comment from Christine Eibner, a RAND health care economist.""It is analytically problematic to compare a single-year estimate of the change in the uninsured population to a 10-year projection of the costs,"" Eibner said. Economist Jeffrey Clemens at the University of California-San Diego called the original calculations ""a bit of a mess."" Antos said the CBO would never do such an analysis itself because the ""two numbers don’t relate to each other."" One is a running total over a decade and the other is a snapshot of the number of people who gained insurance in a single year, over and above what the CBO would expect without the Affordable Care Act. ""Just because you can divide one number by another, it doesn't mean anything,"" Antos said. ""Good arithmetic doesn't count when it’s based on bad logic. Obamacare is expensive and inefficient, but this doesn’t prove that."" Donald Marron is director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute and former acting head of the CBO. Marron pointed out another issue with the calculation in the Daily Mail. The flows of people in and out of insurance coverage are complicated. While millions of people might sign up through the Affordable Care Act exchanges, millions are expected to fall away from getting coverage through their employers or on the individual market. The 27 million used by the newspaper article was a net figure. ""The number of people helped will be something like 40 million,"" Marron said. ""That includes the exchanges and Medicaid and CHIP (children’s health insurance). These are the people newly helped by the coverage."" Marron also noted that you would want a way to factor in the years that these people are helped, but regardless, spreading the costs across 40 million people would drive down the cost for each individual covered. Our ruling Varney said that it will cost taxpayers $50,000 per enrollee in Obamacare over the next 10 years. This seems to come directly from an article in the Daily Mail. None of the health care experts we reached, regardless of their economic philosophies or thoughts about the health care law, found any merit in the math that produced this figure. It’s most glaring defect is that it compares a 10-year cumulative total to a single-year snapshot of the number of people who gained insurance. Any analysis that accounted for the years of coverage people gained would yield a dollar figure considerably less than the $50,000 cited by Varney. We rate the claim False.","[('Fox News, America’s Newsroom, Jan. 27, 2015', 'http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/americas-newsroom/index.html'), ('Congressional Budget Office, Updated Estimates of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Jan. 26, 2015', 'No link'), ('Daily Mail, Obamacare program costs $50,000 in taxpayer money for every American who gets health insurance, says bombshell budget report, Jan. 26, 2015', 'https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/49892-breakout-AppendixB.pdf'), ('Interview, Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives, Urban Institute, Jan. 27, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview, Joe Antos, scholar in health care and retirement policy, American Enterprise Institute, Jan. 27, 2015', 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2927348/Obamacare-program-costs-50-000-American-gets-health-insurance-says-bombshell-budget-report.html'), ('Email interview, Christine Eibner, senior economist, RAND Corp., Jan. 27, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2015/jan/28/stuart-varney/will-aca-cost-50000-enrollee/

Pharma’s take on the pelosi drug-pricing bill: Fair warning or fearmongering?
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s flagship proposal to curb prescription drug prices, the ""Lower Drug Costs Now Act"" ― H.R. 3 ― could come up for a vote in the chamber this month. The measure would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for a limited number of drugs, cap what seniors pay out-of-pocket at $2,000 and force companies that have raised prices beyond inflation since 2016 to either reverse the price or rebate the amount of the increase to the federal government. And drug manufacturers are in full attack mode. Take a recent Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America advertising message embedded in the popular, inside-the-Beltway ""Politico Playbook PM"" newsletter. ""Speaker Pelosi's drug pricing plan would siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years,"" read the ad. ""CBO's preliminary estimate found this bill ‘would result in lower spending on research and development and thus reduce the introduction of new drugs.’"" The trade group’s statement represents a core drug-industry argument, deployed whenever lawmakers propose reining in drug prices: Efforts to limit what drug companies can charge means they won’t have the means or incentive to develop lifesaving medications. The argument also appears in ads like this one ― from America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies ― that highlight patients who say they depend on new medications to keep chronic conditions at bay. But many experts contest the link between drug prices and pharmaceutical R&D. So PhRMA’s citation of the Congressional Budget Office ― an influential nonpartisan government agency ― caught our attention. We decided to look deeper. What the CBO says A PhRMA spokeswoman pointed us to a preliminary CBO analysis of H.R. 3. Published Oct. 11, the letter doesn’t analyze the Pelosi bill but attempts to explain in broad strokes what kind of economic impact it might have. The ""$1 trillion"" over 10 years statistic is the CBO’s upper estimate (the range begins at $500 billion) of what the industry might lose in revenue if this bill were enacted. But the agency leaves wiggle room, noting that this is a ""preliminary"" figure and that the agency hasn’t finished analyzing the full bill yet. Once it does, the $1 trillion could change. ""They’re trying to provide some sense of the relative impact on drug development, but I don’t think we have enough data to provide this,"" said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. ""It’s not a fact. It’s a preliminary estimate that is on very shaky ground."" That leads to the next issue: If pharmaceutical revenues dip, would fewer innovative drugs become available? Technically, kind of. But there’s a lot of important context that PhRMA’s assertion overlooks. The CBO estimates that, over the next decade, between eight and 15 fewer drugs would come to market. But the big picture matters: Every year, the Food and Drug Administration approves 30 new drugs, on average. That’s 300 new drugs over 10 years. So if you assume 15 fewer drugs out of 300 projected approvals, that’s a loss of 5%. Certainly that is, as PhRMA argued, a reduction. But none of the experts we spoke with saw it as a blow to innovation. ""The lower prices envisioned by [Pelosi’s] bill would barely slow new drug discovery at all,"" argued Dr. Peter Bach, who directs the Drug Pricing Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in an op-ed for Bloomberg. It’s not clear from the CBO analysis what kind of clinical value these forgone drugs would have ― whether they would represent meaningful breakthroughs or marginal improvements to medications that already exist. We asked PhRMA. The organization’s position is that the lost revenue could discourage drugmakers from researching new treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, lung cancer and sickle cell disease. But the group didn’t offer much evidence explaining how or why this would happen, or acknowledging that it would involve stepping away from potentially lucrative markets. And experts dispute the idea ― Dusetzina called the industry line ""a scare tactic."" In fact, she said, ""there is a good reason to believe that the drugs you would lose are those that have the smallest benefit and highest price tag."" This gets at another point: A substantial portion of drug research and development isn’t actually done by drugmakers. The riskiest portions often are conducted in government-funded labs, noted Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor at Harvard Medical School who studies pharmaceutical policy. Drug companies get involved much later, making it even less certain that a loss in pharmaceutical revenue would meaningfully discourage breakthrough drug innovation. And any loss of new drugs would likely be at least somewhat offset by Americans’ increased ability to afford newly cheaper drugs. As the CBO report put it: ""The overall effect on the health of families in the United States that would stem from increased use of prescription drugs but decreased availability of new drugs is unclear."" So, in short: Nonpartisan analysis suggests that H.R. 3 could result in fewer drugs coming to market. But it’s a very preliminary estimate, and even then, it suggests only a small dip. The value of the drugs that don’t emerge is unclear, too. All this context matters a lot. ""Hundreds of billions in savings to taxpayers, businesses and patients would mean a real but very small decline in the rate at which new treatments are discovered,"" Bach wrote. Other arguments PhRMA also pointed us to a Dec. 3 report put out by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. It found a much higher impact ― arguing that H.R.3 would result in ""as many as 100 fewer drugs"" entering the American market in the next 10 years. This White House report comes after President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to work with Congress to lower drug prices. The CEA number rests on a series of assumptions. First, it estimates that a new drug costs $2 billion to develop. It also assumes that drug companies typically spend at least a fifth of their revenue on research and development. Therefore, if companies’ revenue goes down by $1 trillion, then the math comes out to losing 100 drugs. But experts called this analysis suspect at best. For one thing, Bach told us, the $2 billion figure isn’t substantiated. For another, the CEA assumes that ""every penny of company R&D spending goes to inventing new drugs."" That, he added, is ""utter nonsense."" Multiple experts noted that the CEA assumes pharmaceutical companies would cut their R&D to perfectly match the proportion of revenue they currently spend. There’s no reason to assume that’s true. Drug companies also spend a good deal on marketing, administration and dividends to shareholders. Dusetzina also noted that the analysis doesn’t consider the increased revenue drug companies might experience from more people being able to afford drugs and therefore buy them. And it assumes the drugs that never make it to the marketplace would be of high value ― without evidence to support that. ""This is not a serious analysis of the question of trade-offs of this policy and innovation. This is fearmongering,"" Dusetzina said.  Our ruling In its advertisement, PhRMA cites a CBO analysis of the Pelosi-backed drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3. The ad suggests that the bill would ""siphon $1 trillion or more from biopharmaceutical innovators over the next 10 years"" and ""reduce the introduction of new drugs."" This claim misses lots of important context. The CBO’s analysis is preliminary, and it could change. The $1 trillion in forgone revenue is the upper limit of what that preliminary analysis predicts. And even if you assume drug companies would lose this much in revenue, the number of drugs that wouldn't make it to market would constitute a small fraction of what pharmaceutical companies typically produce, said experts.

No evidence Ukraine president helped Hillary Clinton, as GOP senator claimed
","As the House impeachment hearings move forward, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., argued that Ukraine tried to undermine Donald Trump in the 2016 election, so Trump had good reason to be wary of Ukraine and delay nearly $400 million in military aid. There’s no question that some Ukraine officials publicly objected to comments then-candidate Trump made about Russia annexing Crimea, about 10,000 square miles of what had been Ukrainian territory. Trump cast the Russian land grab essentially as a done deal.  But Kennedy said the Ukrainian response went beyond a few officials. He said the Ukrainian anti-Trump effort came from the very top. ""Russia was very aggressive, and they're much more sophisticated,"" Kennedy told NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd Dec. 1. ""But the fact that Russia was so aggressive does not exclude the fact that (former) President Poroshenko actively worked for Secretary Clinton."" Todd pushed back, noting the only person pushing that theory is Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Wait a minute, Senator Kennedy, you now have the president of Ukraine saying he actively worked for the Democratic nominee for president,"" Todd said. ""I mean, now come on."" Kennedy invited Todd to read news reports, especially articles from The Economist magazine. ""Do you believe The Economist magazine is a reputable journal?"" Kennedy said. ""It's been around, I think, since 1843."" Kennedy’s office sent us a list of eight articles to support Kennedy’s claim. None of them back him up. Given Kennedy’s focus on the work of The Economist, it’s noteworthy that little in The Economist’s coverage matches Kennedy’s words. An Oct. 12 article about the U.S.-Ukraine relationship and corruption in Ukraine said, ""President (Poroshenko), who had favoured Hillary Clinton in the American elections of 2016, was keen to patch things up with Mr. Trump."" The rest of the article does the Republicans no favors, laying out the political work of Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort in Ukraine, and corruption under the previous president. ""We are a bit puzzled by Sen. Kennedy citing us to the effect that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 elections,"" the Economist’s U.S. editor John Prideaux told us.  Prideaux said Poroshenko and others trusted Clinton to be tougher on Russia than Trump. In the campaign, Trump often talked about building closer ties to Russia, and warned at rallies that undoing Russia’s hold on Crimea could trigger World War III. ""Mr. Poroshenko did not make his feelings secret in Ukraine,"" Prideaux said. ""But nor did he direct any government agencies to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, which is what Mr. Putin did."" Kennedy mentioned The Economist three times in his interview, but he also listed other news organizations. ""It's been well documented in the Financial Times, in Politico, in The Economist, in the Washington Examiner, even on CBS, that the prime minister of Ukraine, the interior minister, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, the head of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption League, all meddled in the election on social media and otherwise,"" he said. None of those stories put Poroshenko at the heart of a plan to interfere in the U.S. election.  They do paint a picture of leaders fearful of Russia and of Trump’s comments that took a more conciliatory stance on Russian aggression. The Financial Times focused on Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko, who revealed over $12 million in secret payments to Manafort from Ukraine’s pro-Russia party. The Mueller special counsel investigation did not cite those records, but Manafort is now in prison for hiding his foreign income. Leshchenko told the Financial Times that in addition to exposing corruption, it was important to show that Trump was a ""pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world.’"" But Financial Times editor Edward Luce said there was no overlap between Kennedy’s sweeping claims and the newspaper’s coverage. ""I’ve been racking my brain, as have my colleagues, as to which Financial Times reporting Senator Kennedy’s referring to,"" Luce said Dec. 2 on MSNBC. In January 2017, Politico covered some of the same ground, but focused more on the work of a Democratic political contractor who tried to dig up dirt on Trump and his advisers. Republicans frequently mention that article. We vetted it and found that the GOP has used its findings selectively. RELATED: The Politico story at the center of a Ukraine conspiracy The article specifically said there was little evidence of a top-down effort in Ukraine. The Washington Examiner published many opinion and analysis pieces that put Ukrainians’ actions in a dark light, but its straight reporting pieces tracked with the accounts in other publications. Kennedy’s office also cited Daily Beast and New York Times reports of a 2018 court ruling that the disclosure of payments to Manafort represented ""meddling"" in the American election. But that ignores that the ruling was later overturned. Kennedy said that former Ukraine President Poroshenko actively worked on behalf of Clinton. The publications he cited don’t back that up, nor does any of the other available evidence. Poroshenko, and many other Ukrainian leaders, opposed Trump’s policies on Russia and its annexation of Crimea, and preferred Clinton’s tougher stance toward their giant neighbor to the east. They were openly critical of Trump. No article cast Poroshenko as a key player in those responses, nor do three of the news organizations he cited see those responses as election meddling.  We rate this claim False.","[('NBC News, Meet the Press, Dec. 1, 2019', 'https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-december-1-2019-n1093781'), ('The Economist, From Paul Manafort to Donald Trump’s fateful phonecall, Oct. 12, 2019', 'No link'), ('The Economist, Rudy Giuliani’s Ukrainian adventure, Sept. 21, 2019', 'https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/10/12/from-paul-manafort-to-donald-trumps-fateful-phonecall'), ('Politico, Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire, Jan. 11, 2017', 'No link'), ('Financial Times, Ukraine’s leaders campaign against ‘pro-Putin’ Trump, Aug. 28, 2016', 'https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/09/21/rudy-giulianis-ukrainian-adventure'), (""The Hill,\xa0 Ukraine's ambassador: Trump's comments send wrong message to world, Aug. 4, 2016"", 'No link'), ('Daily Beast, Ukrainian Officials Meddled in 2016 Election by Leaking Secret Manafort Ledger, Court Says, Dec. 12, 2018', 'https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ukraine-sabotage-trump-backfire-233446'), ('Washington Examiner, ANALYSIS: What if Trump was right about Ukraine?, Nov. 19, 2019\xa0\xa0', 'No link'), ('New York Times, Ukraine Court Rules Manafort Disclosure Caused ‘Meddling’ in U.S. Election, Dec. 12, 2018', 'https://www.ft.com/content/c98078d0-6ae7-11e6-a0b1-d87a9fea034f'), (""CBS News, Did Ukraine try to interfere in the 2016 election on Clinton's behalf?, July 13, 2017"", 'No link'), (""CNN, Trump says Putin is 'not going to go into Ukraine,' despite Crimea, Aug. 1, 2016"", 'https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/290411-ukraines-ambassador-trumps-comments-send-wrong-message-to'), ('ABC News, ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos"", July 31, 2016', 'No link'), ('MSNBC, ""Morning Joe"", Dec. 2, 2019', 'https://www.thedailybeast.com/ukrainian-officials-meddled-in-2016-election-by-leaking-secret-manafort-ledger-court-says'), ('Fox News Sunday, Sen.

No, photo does not show 1937 opening of Golden Gate Bridge or a near collapse

Does China burn seven to eight times as much coal as the U.S.?
","When former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he would spend $500 million on a Beyond Carbon initiative, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice joined energy industry representatives at a press conference to denounce the effort. The project Justice criticized aspires to retire all coal use by 2030 while securing an economic future for fossil fuel-producing communities.  In an op-ed announcing the effort, Bloomberg — who has since entered the Democratic presidential primary race — touted an existing partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Sierra Club that has ""shut down 289 coal-fired power plants since 2011."" The new initiative would build on this effort and also ""work to stop the construction of new gas plants,"" Bloomberg wrote. ""By the time they are built, they will be out of date because renewable energy will be cheaper."" Justice, a Republican whose state is a leading producer of coal and other carbon-based energy, said the effort could be ""catastrophic"" to West Virginia. (Justice himself also inherited a coal mining business and continues to own several mines.) At one point in the press conference, Justice was asked about the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. He responded by questioning the value of the United States cutting back if China is using carbon-based fuels on full blast. ""How does it make sense that in China, they’re burning seven to eight times the amount of coal that we’re burning in the United States?"" Justice asked. Is his comparison accurate? Justice’s ratio is not far from the reported data, though it’s worth noting that the reason for the discrepancy has a lot to do with the fact that China has a much larger population. (His office did not respond to inquiries for this article.) There’s little doubt that, as a whole, coal consumption by China is several times larger than it is in the United States. According to the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy, China’s coal consumption was 1.91 billion tons of oil equivalent in 2018. In the same year, the United States consumed 317 million tons. That means China consumed about six times as much coal as the United States did. Another data source, the Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2019 published by Enerdata, an energy intelligence and consulting firm, found a nearly identical difference — China was about six times larger than the U.S. in consumption of coal and lignite (a low-efficiency type of coal). Justice didn’t mention it, but another country, India, also consumes more coal than the United States does — 452 million tons of oil equivalent, according to the BP review. We’ll note that the difference in coal consumption between China and the United States is partially explained by the two countries’ difference in population — China has about 4.3 times higher in population than the United States. However, adjusting for population is less significant in this case than it often is, given Justice’s point.  Justice is arguing that greenhouse gases do not stay within national borders; they spread everywhere in the atmosphere. So any decreases in carbon emissions made in the United States will be a relatively small factor compared to China in the global context — regardless of which country has a bigger population. Indeed, according to the BP data, China accounted for just over half of the world’s coal consumption in 2018. In addition, the same data shows that China’s coal consumption increased by 1.8% between 2007 and 2017, whereas U.S. coal consumption declined by 4.9%. Unlike the United States, which has a lot of economically competitive natural gas under development, China doesn’t, said Anna Mikulska, a nonresident fellow in energy studies at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""China has to go against the economic calculus to retire at least some of the coal if it wants to lower emission levels,"" she said. ""This is why we see China still consuming so much."" Mikulska added that the current trade friction with China ""does not help, as China turns more to domestic or regional resources due to energy security concerns. One of them is coal."" That said, the Paris-based International Energy Agency, has projected that China’s coal consumption will indeed decline over the next two decades. ""This new direction will have consequences that are no less significant for China and the world than its earlier period of energy-intensive development."" Justice said that China today is ""burning seven to eight times the amount of coal that we’re burning in the United States."" The actual number is a little bit less than that — China consumes roughly six times the amount of coal as the United States does. But that’s pretty close.

NC Democrat mostly right about Trump's proposed cuts to SNAP
","Over Thanksgiving week, a North Carolina Democrat drew attention to a Trump Administration proposal that would cut the number of people who receive public funding for food. U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing the Charlotte area, tweeted on Nov. 26 about the administration’s proposal for cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. ""The President wants to cut 3 MILLION people from #SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans,"" Adams tweeted. ""This is unacceptable. SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger and I stand with @TheBlackCaucus to protect America’s most vulnerable: our children. #1MillionKids."" Is it true that the Trump administration is proposing to cut 3 million people from the SNAP program? Does that proposal include children, seniors and veterans?"" There are multiple proposed changes to the SNAP program, The SNAP program provides ""nutritional assistance"" to people who are low-income or disabled.  Adams referred to proposed changes to ""categorical eligibility."" And, as it turns out, the Adams’ claim is mostly on-point. 3 million The proposed change to ""categorical eligibility"" rules would affect 3.1 million people currently receiving those benefits, according to the USDA’s own estimates. SNAP currently allows states to grant categorical eligibility to people who are already on other social programs. The USDA believes some those people wouldn’t qualify otherwise.  ""As a result, some households can qualify when they would not under regular programs rules,"" the department wrote in a fact sheet. The Trump administration sees this change as closing a loophole allowing some to abuse a program that’s intended to be a ""temporary safety net,"" NPR reported. Who’s affected? We reached out to the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service department for insight on how many SNAP participants might be affected by the proposed change. An estimated 673,000 households with seniors and 597,000 households with children are projected to lose benefits, the USDA’s communications office told us in an email. As for military veterans, the number is a little less clear. We reached out to the USDA and other groups that track SNAP beneficiaries, but struggled to find a specific number of veterans that might be affected.  Veterans not tracked ""USDA does not have data to determine the specific impacts of the rule on households with veterans, as veteran status does not impact eligibility and therefore is not captured in the caseload data used to analyze the rule,"" the USDA told us. But it’s possible veterans would be affected.  About 40 million people participate in the SNAP program. About 1.4 million veterans live in participating SNAP households, according to a 2018 study by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center analyzed data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and estimated SNAP is currently assisting 55,000 veterans in North Carolina. Rebecca Vallas, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, believes it’s ""more than fair to conclude"" veterans would be affected. She believes Adams is on ""strong footing."" Our ruling Adams said President Trump ""wants to cut 3 million people from SNAP, including children, seniors and veterans."" It’s true that his administration’s proposal would affect 3 million people, including children and seniors. Veterans also receive SNAP benefits, but we don’t know how many veterans would be directly affected. Given that uncertainty, we believe Adams’  statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. So we rate it Mostly True.","[('A tweet by U.S. Rep.

Talking to reporters outside a Divide New York caucus meeting in Lackawanna, DiPietro said that while the average state offers 12 to 14 welfare benefits, New York offers about 35 different benefits, every one that the federal government allows.  ""Do we need to give every single welfare benefit that the federal government has in their control, when the average is that there are 35 different types of benefits?"" DiPietro said, according to WBFO. ""The average in the country is about 12 to 14. Why are we giving every one? We're one of the only states that does that."" New York has a reputation for providing a safety net that is more generous than other states, but is it as generous as DiPietro claims?  We approached DiPietro to learn his source of this claim. Over a week and a half, we called his office twice, emailed him four times and tried to reach him on his cellphone. He did not return our messages.  Since we don’t know where his information comes from, we reached out to experts to find out if they had heard this claim before. Experts across ideological lines agree New York has a generous safety net, but no one we spoke with could trace the source of DiPietro’s claim.  The Fiscal Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, referred us to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services list of 41 federal programs that use poverty guidelines to determine whether a person is eligible or not. But a review of that list did not offer any support for DiPietro's claim. Some programs such as the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid can be more generous in different states, but New York does not offer more programs relative to other states. Of the 41 federal programs: There are different ways to define and count ""welfare"" programs. A 2013 report from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, counted 126 separate federal anti-poverty programs, either means-tested assistance or those with an explicit purpose in fighting poverty. In 2012 congressional testimony, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said it counted 79 federal means-tested welfare programs.   Regardless of how think tanks count the programs, there’s no doubt New York is generous compared with other states. In Cato’s analysis, New York ranked seventh among states for the total value of welfare benefits. It also found that New York ranks third most-generous in the value of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, the primary cash benefit for the poor. But TANF, which is distributed through block grant to all states, has not changed since 1996. States have flexibility in how they use the funds and can use it for programs other than cash assistance, such as child welfare or preschool. The annual funding level of $16.5 billion was set in 1996 and has not changed. Inflation has reduced the program's real value by 40 percent since then, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank.  Angela Rachidi, a research fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank that favors free enterprise, said DiPietro’s claim is possibly true. But she’s not sure where he got his numbers from. It is true the federal government authorizes programs and gives states flexibility in how to deliver them, said Rachidi, who worked in human resources administration in New York City’s Department of Social Services. ""The general perception is true that New York is a very generous state,"" she said.  Some experts suggested DiPietro might be talking about Medicaid. Without a response from DiPietro, we can’t be sure.  Medicaid, the health care program for people who have low incomes or disabilities, is designed differently in every state. There are 15 mandatory benefits, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, as well as optional benefits that vary by state, such as hospice, eyeglasses and podiatry services. States can decide how generous each benefit will be, like whether to require a co-pay or set a limit on services.  The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes health policy, surveyed all 50 states in 2018 about the Medicaid benefits they offer. The foundation asked about 47 different benefits, 14 of which are mandatory. Of the remaining 33 benefits, New York offers all of them. New York also offers services that were not part of KFF's survey, such as fertility services and lactation services. To see how New York compared with other states, we looked at the 33 optional benefits included in the survey. We found that, on average, the 44 states that participated in the survey offered 26 optional benefits. Alabama and Virginia had the fewest, with 15 optional benefits. New Jersey and Minnesota offered 32.        New York did not respond to the KFF survey, but we researched Medicaid benefit information from the state Department of Health and the state's official Medicaid plan.   New York’s Medicaid spending has always been high, if not the highest, among other states. In 2015, per capita spending on Medicaid was highest in New York, and 76 percent above the national average, according to an analysis from the Empire Center, a conservative think tank.      No one disputes New York has a generous safety net. But DiPietro makes it sound like most states don't offer even half of the optional welfare programs or services that New York does. A basic tenet of PolitiFact is that the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. DiPietro didn't respond to requests for information to support his claim. We wanted to know the source of his claim, but he declined to talk to us. This is an important issue to New Yorkers, and also one that can be prone to exaggeration by those with strong feelings on welfare. So we checked with experts who study welfare and Medicaid benefits. They could not locate the source of his specific claim. In our research, we found a nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation study that compared Medicaid benefits across the country. It found 44 states offered an average of 26 optional benefits. That's considerably more than the ""12 to 14"" optional welfare benefits that DiPietro claims the average state provides. What's more, the two states that offered the fewest optional benefits - 15 - still offered more than what DiPietro claimed to be the average number among other states.  Our analysis of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families also did not support his claim.  We rate his claim False. ","[('WBFO, ""Regionalized government will cut taxes & costs, increase autonomy, says Divide NY caucus,"" October 30, 2019.

No, that is not a photo of Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester on Sid Miller's Facebook page
","In a post shared to his Facebook page, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller highlighted the actions of National Guard Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester, the first female soldier to receive the Silver Star Medal since World War II. Hester received the award in 2005 for her role in ""thwarting an Iraqi insurgent ambush,"" where she and a ""handful of other Guard soldiers fought off more than 30 insurgents armed with assault rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades after the force attacked a supply convoy southeast of Baghdad,"" according to The New York Times. The citation for her award stated that she killed three people in the ""anti-Iraqi Forces"" ambush. Miller’s post includes text copied from an article about Hester published by Military Times. It also includes a photo of a woman in a military uniform with mud splattered across one side of her face. Text across the top of the image includes the name Leigh Ann Hester and a description of her actions. It reads: ""Ambushed in Salman Pak, Iraq. Killed 3 enemy combatants in close-quarter battle. Awarded a Silver Star."" The only problem? The woman in the photograph Miller shared is not Hester. Todd Smith, a spokesman for Miller, said several veterans who follow Miller on Facebook asked him to share the image with text to his followers. ""The information was accurate, but it appears the photo was of a different person,"" Smith said. ""We wouldn’t have had any way to know that. We were just trying to honor a brave, courageous member of our armed forces who did something extraordinary. That’s why we posted it."" Hester was profiled by multiple news outlets after receiving the Silver Star and there are dozens of accompanying photographs of her that are accessible online. An action figure was modeled in her image, and a wax figure of her is on display at the U.S. Army Women’s Museum in Virginia. The woman in the photograph Miller shared has vastly different facial features than Hester, and her hair is a deep brunette, while Hester’s looks closer to blonde. A Google Reverse Image Search shows that the photo Miller used in his post came from a 2013 GQ magazine series about women who serve in the military. The lead photo in the digital version of the story is the same one that appears in Miller’s Facebook post. The caption in the GQ article identifies the woman as Lt. Tina Turner. The article features different women who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, and the first story highlighted in the piece is about Hester, who described the circumstances surrounding her Silver Star award. Smith pointed to the fact that the GQ article including the image also discussed Hester and her experiences. ""Someone could certainly make the same mistake,"" he said. A different GQ profile from the same 2013 project — called ""Women of the 101st Airborne Division"" — includes remarks from Turner and other female soldiers stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. At the time the article was published, the soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan as part of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division. The photo was part of a series called ""Military Women"" shot by photographer Danielle Levitt. The series featured female soldiers completing a training exercise, which included crawling through mud. In another photo in the series, Turner’s name is visible on her uniform. This is not the first time Turner’s photo has been used online with inaccurate information about her. In a post on her personal Facebook page from January, Turner said the image of her used in the GQ feature ""pops up on the internet from time to time."" Turner shared a link to a different doctored version of the photo which included the caption: ""I turned down a modeling contract to join the Army."" ""The comments that ensued on this post were disappointing, to say the least,"" Turner wrote in her Facebook post, which highlighted negative comments left by others on the image. ""This isn’t the first time this picture has been shared, which means this isn’t the first time I’ve seen comments like this so it doesn’t really phase me anymore. It just disappoints me more than anything."" Turner did not return a message sent to her on Facebook. Our Ruling Miller shared an image to his Facebook page that he said was of a Silver Star recipient: Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester. But the image he shared was actually a photo of Lt. Tina Turner, who served in the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division. We rate this image False. Correction (Dec. 5, 2019): An earlier version of this story included the wrong date that the claim was made on Facebook. It was made on Nov. 29, 2019. This change does not affect the ruling. ","[('Facebook post, Sid Miller, Nov. 29, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/MillerForTexas/photos/a.1430872243801609/2695834167305404/?type=3&theater'), ('Military Times, This sergeant became the first woman in the US Army to earn a Silver Star for combat valor, June 14, 2019', 'No link'), ('GQ, Natural Born Killers, April 23, 2013', 'https://www.militarytimes.com/off-duty/military-culture/2019/06/14/this-sergeant-became-the-first-woman-in-the-us-army-to-earn-a-silver-star-for-combat-valor/?fbclid=IwAR2mDkipoOG-Dt2fN_rVHaSORTYSw4uMfQGdJelYcBPk7cB-W1p0FscnazY'), ('DS Reps, Military Women, Danielle Levitt, accessed Dec. 2, 2019', 'No link'), ('NPR, Silver Star Recipient A Reluctant Hero, Feb. 22, 2011', 'https://www.gq.com/story/united-states-military-women-gq-may-2013'), ('The Tennessean, Franklin Silver Star recipient talks women in military, Aug. 29, 2015', 'No link'), ('The New York Times, Female M.P.

Evers misstates schools bill as he vetoes it
","Tucked into the back end of a news release highlighting 13 bills Gov. Tony Evers signed into law, a single line noted Evers also vetoed an obscure Republican-sponsored schools bill. A veto is not that surprising, given that the governor and Republican-led Legislature have been at loggerheads over just about everything since Evers took office. And the bill and veto failed to garner any media attention. Evers, who spent almost a decade as state schools superintendent, objected to how the bill addressed student records in his Nov. 21, 2019, veto message. ""Under this bill, the name of a pupil’s parents or guardians would be added to the list of categories that a public school must designate as directory data,"" Evers wrote. ""I am vetoing this bill in its entirety because I object to implementing a mandate that will negatively impact the privacy of parents of students in Wisconsin."" In other words, he’s arguing the bill would require public release of parent names. There’s just one problem: The bill didn’t do that. The bill in question originated with state Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam. According to Born’s staff, while attending a task force meeting with school administrators in Dodge County, the lawmaker learned of a 2018 situation where police were called to a student’s home for a potentially suicidal parent. Police contacted the school trying to ensure the student wouldn’t be dropped off by a bus during the incident, but district officials said they weren’t allowed to release information on which student was related to the parent in question. Under current state law, districts can designate specific ""directory data"" that is releasable to the public. These are the categories: a pupil's name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height (for those on a sports team), dates of attendance, photographs, degrees and awards received and the name of the school most recently attended. That list doesn’t include the name of the students’ parent or guardian. So Born proposed a bill, later passed by the Republican Assembly and Senate, that added ""the name of the pupil’s parents or guardians"" to the preceding list. The bill did not affect the way directory data is used or released — just what is included in the data set. Put this next part in the wonky-but-significant category. State statute does not require any of the directory data be released, giving two groups power to limit it. The school district decides which of those categories it will designate as directory data for that district. Parents and guardians then have up to two weeks after the district decision to decide if they want information about their student to be publicly available, or if they must approve any release in advance.  A Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction handbook on student records references this as well, saying, ""The district may choose some, none or all of the data as directory data."" Nothing matches the mandate claimed by Evers in his veto message. The lead sponsors of the bill blasted Evers in a news release after the veto came down. ""His lack of understanding of the legislation is quite apparent, and it makes us question whether or not he’s even reading the bills that his staff puts in front of him,"" Born said. What makes Evers’ veto message especially unusual is that it starts out by describing the parental opt-out accurately: ""Under current law, directory data may be disclosed to any person if the public school notifies parents or guardians of the information designated as directory data, provides information on how to opt out of disclosures, and provides sufficient time to use the opt-out procedure."" But the next two sentences then refer to the bill as mandating this information be released. ""The Governor must have forgotten about that between his opening paragraph explaining the ability to do so and his conclusion where he used it as an excuse to veto it,"" state Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon and the lead Senate sponsor, said in the news release. Eleven days after the veto and callouts from Republican legislators, Evers’ office on Dec. 2, 2019, shared an ""errata"" with PolitiFact Wisconsin that retracted the two references to a mandate. It was dated Nov. 29, 2019, but as of Dec. 3, 2019, had not yet been published among the press releases on Evers’ website that announced the original veto or with the official legislative bill history. Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said Evers’ legal team looked into the matter and issued the errata as a result of the inquiry by PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""We used an errata here for the same reason that the courts do: to correct an error so that there isn’t any confusion regarding the meaning or intent of the document,"" Baldauff said in an email. ""It is a process frequently used to correct legal documents after publication. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals, in particular, frequently issues erratas."" Baldauff declined to detail how the mistake occurred but said Evers and his staff read the law, and ""the intent of his veto is not changed by the errata."" While vetoing a pupil records law, Evers said the law would have mandated that schools release the names of students’ parents or guardians. He stated that the mandate was his main reason for vetoing the measure. But there is no mandate — something Evers’ office eventually admitted 11 days later. State statute is clear that the district can choose which student information is released, and even after that parents or guardians can choose to opt out of releasing any student information. It’s an admittedly obscure, in-the-weeds kind of law, but it takes on a larger significance since the governor — or a staffer working on his behalf —  either fundamentally misunderstood how the law works or intentionally misstated it to support his veto. We rate Evers’ claim False.","[('Tony Evers, veto message for AB 53, Nov. 21, 2019', 'https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2019/11/21/file_attachments/1329833/Evers_AB53%20Veto%20Message.pdf'), ('Tony Evers, errata for veto message for AB 53, Nov. 29, 2019', 'No link'), ('Tony Evers press release, Gov.

New York crime did drop when 2020 hopeful Michael Bloomberg was mayor, but he claims too much credit
","A week before announcing his bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made news by apologizing for his support of stop-and-frisk policing, which led to the disproportionate stopping of black and Latino people across the city. But Bloomberg also boasted in his speech at the Christian Cultural Center, a black megachurch in Brooklyn, N.Y., about his record on crime and criminal justice. ""In fact, no other city in America did what we did,"" the billionaire former Republican and former independent claimed. ""We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%."" Bloomberg also made the murder and incarceration claims on his campaign website, and he repeated them on Twitter on the day he announced. Statistics back Bloomberg, but he goes too far in claiming credit. In 1981, long before he became the latest presidential candidate in a crowded Democratic field, Bloomberg co-founded Bloomberg LP, a financial information and media company. He is now the eighth-wealthiest American, with a net worth of $54 billion, according to Forbes. Bloomberg succeeded Rudy Giuliani as mayor in 2002 and served until 2013. He was succeeded by the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, who briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination before dropping out in September. In 2013, near the end of his tenure, Bloomberg claimed that New York was the nation’s safest big city. Our rating, looking at violent crimes plus property crimes, was Mostly True.  Now let’s dig into each of the four parts of his current claim. Bloomberg’s campaign cited data showing there were 649 murders in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, and 335 in 2013, his final year in office. That’s a reduction of roughly half. But murders started declining a decade before Bloomberg took office and continued downward after he left.  Murders dropped ""precipitously"" during the 1990s — from roughly 2,200 at the start of the decade, noted Ames Grawert of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. ""Was the slope any steeper during Bloomberg than in the preceding decade? Not at all,"" said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of law and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. In 2013, the total number of shots fired by officers — 248 — and total shooting incidents — 81 — were the lowest since the New York Police Department began keeping such records in 1971, according to the department’s 2013 annual firearms discharge report, which Bloomberg’s campaign cited. Police shot and killed eight people and injured 17 others that year, the report says. But here, too, Bloomberg appears to be going too far by taking credit: The trend downward started before Bloomberg took office. And while shooting incidents hit the record low of 81 in 2013, they had risen to 105 a year earlier, during his tenure. ""The fact that reductions have continued under de Blasio shows that the declines are being driven by factors other than the municipal genius of mayoral-led policing and prosecutorial strategies,"" said Eugene O’Donnell, a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.  In 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, New York City had 703 jailed or imprisoned inmates for every 100,000 residents, according to the mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice. In 2013, it was 429  — a drop of 39%. The same chart shows, however, that the decline began years before Bloomberg took office and has continued for years afterward, the figure was 910 in 1996 before dropping to the 703 in 2001, a decline of 23% in five years. And there’s another issue. ""The criminal prosecution/punishment decisions are not those of the mayor or his administration,"" said Franklin Zimring, a University of California, Berkeley, School of Law faculty director of criminal justice studies and author of the 2012 book, ""The City That Became Safe: New York’s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control."" Bloomberg’s campaign says no other city has achieved the three reductions Bloomberg touted. There is truth to that. ""New York City is in a class by itself in the country on public safety — serious crime has dropped for decades,"" O’Donnell told us. But comparisons are dicey. The FBI is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Among other things, the FBI points out that no two cities are alike and the rates at which crimes are reported vary among cities. Bloomberg said, ""No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%."" He’s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers. But Bloomberg can’t claim all the credit, in that the declines began before he took office and continued afterward; and experts including the FBI warn against using statistics to make city-to-city comparisons. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.","[('YouTube, Michael Bloomberg speech (2:40), Nov. 17, 2019', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_wj8hTM15I'), ('PolitiFact, ""Michael Bloomberg says New York is safest big city in United States,"" Aug. 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('Email, Michael Bloomberg campaign spokesman Stu Loeser, Nov. 26, 2019', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/26/michael-bloomberg/michael-bloomberg-says-new-york-safest-big-city-us/'), ('New York Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, ""Jail and Prison Inmates per 100,000 Residents,"" accessed Nov. 26, 2019', 'No link'), ('New York Police Department, ""New York City Police Department Annual Firearms Discharge Report, 2013,"" 2014', 'https://criminaljustice.cityofnewyork.us/individual_charts/jail-and-prison-inmates-per-100000-residents/'), ('Email, James Jacobs, director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University Law School, Nov. 25, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email, Franklin Zimring, University of California, Berkeley, School of Law faculty director of criminal justice studies and author of The City That Became Safe: New York’s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control (2012), Nov. 25, 2019', 'http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/nypd_annual_firearms_discharge_report_2013.pdf'), ('Email, John Jay College of Criminal Justice Research and Evaluation Center director Jeffrey Butts, Nov. 25, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email, John Jay College of Criminal Justice lecturer Eugene O’Donnell, Nov. 25, 2019', 'https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.overview&personid=20016'), ('Email, Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law at Columbia Law School and professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at Columbia University, Nov. 26, 2019', 'No link'), ('\nNew York City Mayor’s Office, ""Mayor Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly Announce 2013 Saw the Fewest Murders and Fewest Shootings in Recorded City History at NYPD Graduation Ceremony,"" Dec. 27, 2013', 'https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/franklin-zimring/')]",/factchecks/2019/dec/02/michael-bloomberg/new-york-crime-did-drop-when-2020-hopeful-michael-/

NC Republican says redistricting is a partisan process - not a fair one.
","When it comes to drawing election maps, the courts have often found North Carolina guilty of breaking the rules. So when the time came to approve new Congressional maps earlier this month, legislators had a lot to say about those rules. Video of one speech, in particular, got lots of attention.  State Sen. Jerry Tillman, an Archdale Republican, can be seen in a 54-second video chastising Democrats for having a ""lack of knowledge about what the Constitution says"" about redistricting. ""It doesn’t say anything about being fair,"" Tillman says. The Constitution gives redistricting responsibility to the states, a process Tillman then described this way:  ""It says that in redistricting matters, it is the province of the states and it then becomes the province of the prevailing party,"" he continued. ""If it belongs to the prevailing party, do you think it should be anything other than partisan? It’s set up to be partisan."" Is it true that the U.S. Constitution doesn’t say anything about being fair? And is Tillman right that the redistricting system is ""set up to be partisan?"" The video was posted on social media by state Sen. Jeff Jackson, who has 86,000 followers on Facebook and 52,000 Twitter followers. The video was viewed about 100,000 times in total, Jackson told PolitiFact. Given the video’s exposure, we felt it necessary to clarify some of Tillman’s statements with him. Redistricting can be complicated, so it’s important to distinguish what the U.S. Constitution says from what North Carolina’s Constitution says. Tillman didn’t respond to an email or a phone call about his comments, so he didn’t clarify his statements to us. With that in mind, we felt the need to clarify what the U.S. and N.C. constitutions say about drawing election maps. We’ll take this in two parts. First: does the U.S. Constitution say anything about the redistricting process being ""fair?""  This is a loaded question that’s led to court cases and legal challenges across the country. At the risk of going too far into the weeds, we’ll touch on some ways federal laws attempt to ensure fairness -- as well as some ideas that have been sought but not adopted. So what is ""fair?"" Although the word does not appear in the Constitution, some scholars say it is a basic concept in many constitutional principles. Partisan gerrymandering One idea of fairness: drawing districts that would give each major political party equal odds of winning.  But the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention fairness in terms of political parties and the U.S. Supreme Court recently punted on an important case from North Carolina that tested this concept. Plaintiffs argued North Carolina’s Congressional maps give Republicans an extreme partisan advantage. The court, however, found that the ""partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts."" ""So there’s nothing that would prevent them from drawing partisan redistricting maps,"" said Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation. In other words, ""the Court said that a jurisdiction can engage in some partisan gerrymandering consistent with the US Constitution, as long as it doesn’t go too far,"" said Justin Levitt, associate dean for research at Loyola Marymount University law school and founder of allaboutredistricting.org. But, he added, the Supreme Court said ""federal courts have no power to determine what ‘too far’ is."" Racial gerrymandering How about other ways to define ""fair?"" The 14th Amendment to the Constitution authorized the government to punish states that abridged citizens’ right to vote by proportionally reducing their representation in Congress, as explained on the U.S. Senate’s website. The 15th Amendment prohibited states from disenfranchising voters ""on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,"" the site says. On this front, North Carolina lawmakers have gotten in trouble multiple times. Several of North Carolina’s Democrat-drawn Congressional maps in the 1990s and 2000s were ruled unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, PolitiFact explained in July. And as recently as 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed a ruling that GOP-drawn congressional maps from 2011 were racial gerrymanders. Aside from that, the Constitution also addresses district populations. The National Conference of State Legislatures explains it this way: ""For congressional redistricting, the Apportionment Clause of Article I, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution requires that all districts be as nearly equal in population as practicable."" So, in some ways, the Constitution does aim for fairness, Levitt said. Is partisanship endorsed? Now let’s look at Tillman’s claim that the redistricting process ""is set up to be partisan."" In North Carolina, that’s true.  ""But there’s nothing in the (U.S.) Constitution about the prevailing party taking control,"" Levitt said. ""Some may read that as the natural consequence of giving it to the states, but it’s certainly not an express grant in the Constitution to be partisan."" The Constitution gives states the responsibility of crafting election procedures. But the text of the U.S. Constitution doesn’t say anything about district maps in particular. In North Carolina, the state Constitution allows the legislature’s dominant political party to have control over the process. And legislators are allowed to use partisan data in the redistricting process. But the U.S. Constitution allows states a freedom to construct their own rules. And some other states have gone to great lengths to make it non-partisan. ""Just because the federal Constitution is silent doesn’t mean the states can’t create rules for their own districts,"" said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice. Arizona, for instance, entrusts an independent redistricting commission to draw its Congressional maps. California prohibits map makers from considering partisan data. Florida prohibits map makers from considering incumbent residences. (North Carolina, meanwhile, attempts to avoid pairing incumbents.) Some states set up an independent commission for making maps. Some prohibit map-makers from favoring a party or an incumbent.  Our ruling Tillman said the Constitution ""doesn’t say anything about being fair,"" and later added: ""it’s set up to be partisan."" On fairness, the Constitution aims to guarantee equal weight to each voter. But it doesn’t guarantee that the nation’s political parties will have the same odds of winning a Congressional seat.  On the set-up of the redistricting process, Tillman is right that North Carolina’s system yields itself to partisan maps. But he’s wrong to suggest that the U.S. Constitution encourages that system across the country. States have the freedom to enact their own redistricting rules, and some have attempted to tackle ""fairness"" from a lot more angles than North Carolina. These claims are partially accurate but omit important details that would give the public a better understanding of the redistricting system. We rate them Half True.","[('Tweet by state Senator Jeff Jackson, a Democrat from Charlotte.', 'https://twitter.com/JeffJacksonNC/status/1196439138486108162?s=20'), ('A PDF of the U.S. Constitution posted on the U.S. Senate website.', 'No link'), ('Telephone interview with Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice.', 'https://www.senate.gov/civics/resources/pdf/US_Constitution-Senate_Publication_103-21.pdf'), ('Telephone interview with Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation.', 'No link'), ('Email correspondence with Justin Levitt, associate dean for research at Loyola Marymount University law school and founder of allaboutredistricting.org.', 'https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Constitution/NCConstitution.html'), ('A copy of the North Carolina Constitution posted on the legislature’s website.', 'No link'), ('Explanations of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments posted on the U.S. Senate website.', 'https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/CivilWarAmendments.htm'), ('Story by NBC News, ""Supreme Court allows gerrymandering in North Carolina, Maryland, setting back reform efforts,"" posted June 27, 2019.', 'No link'), ('Story by PolitiFact, ""The legal fight over NC gerrymandering isn’t over.

In Wisconsin, failed gun background checks rarely lead to charges
","Wisconsin’s top elected leaders have filled a lot of airtime and newsprint disagreeing on whether to expand background checks for gun buyers. But what about the people who already fail background checks? The Wisconsin Department of Justice conducts background checks on every person attempting to buy a handgun from a gun dealer in the state. Not everyone passes. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos raised that issue while objecting to Gov. Tony Evers’ push for a red flag law in Wisconsin. He said the state should focus on ""enforcing the laws that are already on the books"" rather than pursuing legislation the parties don’t agree on. His claim: ""Let’s remember that in 2018 we had I think it was 132,000 background checks. About 1,000 of those failed,"" Vos, R-Rochester, said in a Nov. 10, 2019, appearance on WISN-TV’s UpFront program. ""For the 1,000 that failed, almost none of them were prosecuted for trying to do a background check and illegally buy a weapon."" This fact check takes us beyond the numbers into prosecutorial discretion, the ignorance defense and more. Let’s get started. Evers is pushing to extend background checks to sales between private parties, also known as  universal background checks. Wisconsin is one of 29 states that currently don’t get involved in private sales. For purchases from licensed dealers, Wisconsin splits the background check responsibilities based on the type of gun. The FBI handles checks on long gun sales, while the Wisconsin Department of Justice does checks for handgun purchases. RELATED: Do red flag laws allow gun seizure without a judge’s OK? RELATED: Sen. Scott Fitzgerald misfires with claim on gun background checks and Second Amendment RELATED: Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order? Anyone seeking to buy a handgun must fill out a DOJ form that asks a series of questions about disqualifying past conduct. They must say, for example, if they’ve been convicted of a felony, found not guilty of a felony in Wisconsin by reason of mental disease, been convicted of a juvenile offense that would be a felony if they were an adult, or are under a court order or injunction that would ban them from possessing a gun. The number of people failing background checks once DOJ processes that form roughly matches Vos’ claim. In fiscal year 2019 (July 2018 to June 2019), the DOJ processed 133,452 background checks, and 1,306 of those were denied, said DOJ spokeswoman Gillian Drummond. That’s consistent with fiscal 2018, when the DOJ processed 135,265 background checks and denied 1,202 of them, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. State statute says the DOJ ""may"" report these denials to local authorities for investigation. But Drummond said DOJ treats that as a requirement and ""alerts local law enforcement for potential investigations."" So Vos is right on the numbers, but what happens when failed background checks are passed on to local police for investigation? The core of Vos’ claim — that ""almost none"" of those denials are prosecuted — is trickier. For starters, the Justice Department doesn’t track which of their tips lead to prosecution. Beyond that, not every failed background check is a crime. The person has to know they’re banned from owning a gun. ""The attempt to purchase a firearm by a person not allowed under state or federal law to have a firearm is only illegal if the individual knows they are disqualified from the purchase,"" Drummond said. ""For example, if a person has a misdemeanor in another state, which is a felony under Wisconsin law, the person would be disqualified but may not know that prior to attempted purchase. Or a person who has admitted to a law enforcement officer that they’ve used an illegal substance is also disqualified even if they were not arrested."" So it is a valid defense in this case to plead ignorance. Let’s move on to what we do know about prosecuting these cases. Vos’ evidence for the claim, as passed on by his office, is built around charges for a crime specific to the background check form. Wisconsin statute 175.35(3)(b)(1) makes it a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months in jail to provide false information on the background check form.  Those charges are indeed rare. A PolitiFact Wisconsin analysis of Wisconsin court records shows only 23 people were charged with giving false information on the gun purchase form from 2007 to 2018. In other words, we had about two per year over the last decade while DOJ rejects about 1,000 background checks per year. But that’s not the only charge that could result from trying to buy a gun illegally, prosecutors say. Michael Graveley, the Kenosha County district attorney, said a felon who handles even an unloaded gun is guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. So prosecutors could ignore the misdemeanor related to the background check form and charge the more serious felony related to gun possession. That was the case in 2016 when Chad A. Fletcher, 44, of Kenosha, applied to purchase a gun through the Kenosha Gander Mountain. He failed his background check through DOJ, but local police investigating the DOJ tip also found video footage of him handling the gun in the store. Fletcher was initially charged with possession of a firearm by a felon but not the background check offense. However, he reached a plea deal that later reduced the felony to a misdemeanor charge of providing false information on a background check. In short, prosecutors aren’t required to file that charge just because it applies — and they don’t always. ""There might be times it applies and prosecutors don’t issue it because they want something else,"" said Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski. That something else in a background check case would typically be the felon in possession of a firearm charge. But that charge doesn’t shed much light on our question since the vast majority are related to circumstances outside the background check process. For the record, there were 10,000 such charges over the last decade. We can’t detail how many of those are connected to background checks without pulling records on each case. But the prosecutors we spoke to from several high-population counties weren’t aware of any significant volume of charges resulting from background checks. We should also note that a nationwide 2018 study found it wouldn’t be unusual for background checks in Wisconsin to rarely spur criminal charges. The analysis found only 12 prosecutions in fiscal 2017 in the 29 states where federal officials handle background checks. In 13 states that handle their own checks, 10 do not investigate or prosecute firearm denials at all. Vos said ""almost none"" of the 1,000 or so people failing a background check each in year in Wisconsin are prosecuted. It’s a lot more complicated claim than it might seem. Indeed, on average only about two people per year are charged specifically with the crime of providing false information on a background check. Prosecutors say violators can also be charged with the more serious crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm — or attempting to do so. But anecdotally we found no evidence that this happens frequently. And, of course, failing a background check is only a crime if the applicant knew they were banned from having a gun. Add it all together and we get a statement that appears to be accurate, but it needs some additional information and clarification. That’s what we call Mostly True.","[('WISN-TV, ""\'UPFRONT\' recap: Assembly Speaker says governor is playing politics with special session,"" Nov. 10, 2019', 'https://www.wisn.com/article/upfront-recap-assembly-speaker-says-governor-is-playing-politics-with-special-session/29731550'), ('Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Concealed Weapons Licensure and Handgun Purchaser Background Checks (page 27), January 2019', 'No link'), ('USA TODAY, Very few who may have lied trying to buy guns are investigated or charged, study finds, Sept. 6, 2018', 'https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lfb/informational_papers/january_2019/0096_concealed_weapons_licensure_and_handgun_purchaser_background_checks_informational_paper_96.pdf'), ('Email exchange with Kit Beyer, spokeswoman for Robin Vos, Nov. 14, 2019', 'No link'), ('Email exchange with Gillian Drummond, Wisconsin Department of Justice spokeswoman, Nov. 18-21, 2019', 'https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/06/gun-laws-report-finds-few-rejected-during-background-checks-charged/1213216002/'), ('Wisconsin Legislative Council, email to Robin Vos’s office, Oct. 15, 2019', 'No link'), ('Wisconsin Department of Justice, Firearm Dealer Notification (Handgun Transfers), revised April 2018', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6561068-DOJ-background-check-form-for-handguns.html'), ('Interview and email exchange with Michael Graveley, Kenosha County district attorney, Nov. 18-20, 2019', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2019/nov/26/robin-vos/wisconsin-failed-gun-background-checks-rarely-lead/
"['Health Care', 'Health Check', 'Joe Biden']","
Did Joe Biden overstate Democratic voters’ opposition to ‘Medicare for All’?
","When the subject of ""Medicare for All"" came up during the Democratic debate last week, former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that the majority of his party does not favor it.    ""The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All,"" he said, adding, ""It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House.""   This seemed to be a very strong statement, and we weren’t sure that voters’ positions on this issue were as clear-cut as Biden made them out to be, so we asked his campaign where he got the information.  Public opinion  The Biden campaign initially directed us to news coverage of a January 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, which noted that the majority of Americans generally oppose  Medicare for All if they hear arguments that frame the program as requiring Americans to pay more taxes or leading to delays in testing and treatment. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)  On the flip side, though, when -- in the same poll -- Medicare for All was described as guaranteeing health insurance as a right for all Americans, or that it would eliminate health insurance premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs, the majority favored the national health plan.  That poll, now nearly a year old, found that when simply asked, 56% said they did favor having ""a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all, where all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan.""  Those percentages, though, reflected the views of  all Americans, not just Democrats. The same poll broke down respondents’ answers by political party and showed that 81% of Democrats favored creating a national health plan.  The KFF Health Tracking Poll, done monthly, indicates Democrats’ support for Medicare for All has weakened, but not entirely. Its most recent version, published in November, revealed large majorities of Democrats support a public option (88%) and Medicare for All (77%). KFF's January 2019 tracking poll has 85% of Democrats favoring a Medicare buy-in. ""The majority of Democrats do support Medicare for All, but Medicare for All is not as popular as public option or a Medicare buy-in,"" said Ashley Kirzinger, who is the associate director for public opinion and survey research at KFF.  Other polls show similar results: support for Medicare for All among Democrats but stronger support for the incremental approaches Biden backs.  A September NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for instance, found 67% of Democrats said they supported adopting Medicare for All. The public option fared better, with 75% of Democrats supporting the proposal.  ""The data … does show majority support among Democratic voters (whether that reaches a ""vast majority"" depends upon your interpretation), but higher support for a public option,""Jeff Horwitt, senior vice president with Hart Research Associates wrote in an email. Hart Research Associates conducted the NBC/WSJ poll.  The Biden campaign also directed us to a September KFF Health Tracking Poll that showed that 55% of Democrats prefer a candidate who would build on the existing Affordable Care Act, while 40% of Democrats prefer a candidate who would replace the ACA with Medicare for All.  And one more from the Biden campaign -- a CNN article citing a July CNN and SSRS poll that found almost half (48%) of all respondents who lean Democratic said the national program should not replace private insurance, while 31% said that it should.  That same CNN/SSRS poll, though, had 85% of respondents who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents responding ""yes"" when asked if the government should provide a national health insurance program for all Americans, even if it would require higher taxes. The numbers from these various polls seem to communicate a range of opinions among Democrats about Medicare for All.  Robert Blendon of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said he thinks Biden’s statement rings true based on a poll he helped conduct, in partnership with the Commonwealth Fund and The New York Times.  Rather than asking survey respondents if they favored Medicare for All, the survey asked them to choose among Medicare for All, improving the existing ACA or replacing the ACA with state health plans.  For registered Democrats, the results were close between two of the proposals: 46% preferred Medicare for All and 45% preferred improving the existing ACA. Only 7% preferred replacing the ACA with state health plans. In this survey, Medicare for All was not preferred by a majority of Democrats.  But Blendon noted that survey respondents often will say yes to a ""one-off question"" about whether they support something and that answer can change once they have to choose among options, such as in his organization’s survey.  ""The answer is that Democrats are divided on whether or not they want to build on the ACA or whether they want to do Medicare for All,"" he said.   Congressional support and another context  Horwitt also made the point that it wasn’t clear in Biden’s statement which group of people he was referencing.  ""I recall hearing the statement in real-time, but in looking now at just the statement from Biden below, it is unclear to me if he is talking about elected Democrats or Democratic voters when he references the ""vast majority,"" Horwitt wrote via email.  While the Biden campaign did direct us to public opinion polls, they also pointed out that the Senate and House Medicare for All bills are ""only sponsored by a fraction of the members of the respective Democratic caucuses that would be needed to secure passage.""    The Senate Medicare for All bill, introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, has 14 co-sponsors, while the House’s Medicare for All bill, introduced by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, has 118 co-sponsors. (There are currently 233 Democrats in the House and 45 Democrats plus two independents in the Senate.)  Our ruling  During the recent presidential primary debates, Biden said: ""The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All."" Based on a cursory review of polls, this statement appears off-base. After all, most polls find that when Democrats are simply asked if they support Medicare for All, they answer ""yes.""  However, when those same polls dig deeper into this support by asking about the favorability of other Democratic-favored health policies -- Medicare for All, the public option or expansions of the Affordable Care Act -- or if such a Medicare for All program should replace private insurance, this support becomes weaker. The polls do seem to suggest support among Democrats for the moderate reforms Biden backs. Still, the evidence is lacking to support Biden’s claim that a ""vast majority"" of Democrats oppose Medicare for All.   For these reasons, we rate this statement Mostly False. ","[('Email exchange with Joe Biden for President campaign staff, Nov. 25, 2019.', 'https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-january-2019/'), ('KFF, ""Health Tracking Poll -- January 2019: The Public on Next Steps for the ACA and Proposals to Expand Coverage,"" Jan. 23, 2019.\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'No link'), ('KFF, ""Health Tracking Poll -- November 2019: Health Care in the 2020 Election, Medicare-for-all, and the State of the ACA,"" Nov. 20, 2019.\xa0', 'https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-november-2019/'), ('Telephone interview with Ashley Kirzinger, associate director for public opinion and survey research, KFF, Nov. 25, 2019.\xa0\xa0', 'No link'), ('Hart Research Associates, ""NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey: September 2019,"" Oct. 1, 2019.\xa0', 'https://hartresearch.com/key-takeaways-from-september-2019-nbc-wsj-survey/'), ('Email interview with Jeff Horwitt, senior vice president, Hart Research Associates, Nov. 25, 2019.\xa0', 'No link'), ('KFF, ""Health Tracking Poll -- September 2019: Health Care Policy in Congress and on the Campaign Trail,"" Sept. 12, 2019.\xa0', 'https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2019/'), ('CNN, ""Black Democrats Prefer the Public Option to ‘Medicare for All’,"" July 27, 2019.\xa0\xa0', 'No link'), ('SSRS, ""CNN Politics Democrats and Health Care June 2019 Poll,"" July 1, 2019.\xa0', 'https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/27/politics/medicare-for-all-vs-public-option-black-democrats/index.html'), ('Telephone interview with Robert Blendon, Richard L.

Don’t fall for the story of the mall Santa beating up a child molester
","A Facebook post recycled an old story about a shopping mall Santa who learns that a child molester is near and, with the help of some friends, beats him up. A case of vigilante justice, or a hoax? The latter. A Nov. 7 post with a screenshot of what looks vaguely like a news article reported that ""Kid tells mall Santa a secret; seconds later, him (sic) and his friends are beating the cr*p out of a child molester."" Two images are side by side. One shows police arresting a man in a Santa Claus costume. The other is a pixelated image of man’s face. ""A Wisconsin mall Santa decided to handle one of the naughty list members early this year, when a young girl told him her Christmas wish was for her step dad to stop molesting her,"" the article said. ""He and four of his elves attacked the guy, who was waiting nearby, and pummeled him unconscious."" The story’s byline –– ""Thug Muncher"" –– gives the first hint that this might not be legit. The words of a purported eyewitness also seem over the top. The witness described the Santa on top of the man, ""screaming, ‘Ho,ho,ho mother****er!’"" Digging a little deeper, the photo of the police arresting Santa dates from 2013, when protesters, including a guy in a Santa suit, rallied for higher wages outside a California Walmart. What’s more, the story of this righteously indignant Santa first appeared in December 2016 on a click-bait website called Thug Life. That version placed the episode in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee police told the Associated Press soon after that they had no record of the event. The website Snopes traced the second photo, the one of the man, to a 2012 mugshot. No need to regift this bit of fake news. We rate it Pants on Fire!","[('Facebook, Santa beats up child molester, Nov. 7, 2019', 'https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3180884558653254&set=a.321090387966033&type=3&theater'), ('Huffington Post, Walmart Wage Protest Leads To Arrest Of Man Dressed Like Santa, Nov. 29, 2013', 'No link'), (""Chicago Tribune, A suburban Milwaukee mall Santa did not beat up child molester with help of elves.

No, TV station did not report school shooting ‘3 weeks in advance’
","A Facebook post falsely claims that a TV station in Los Angeles aired a story about the Nov. 14 Santa Clarita high school shooting three weeks before it happened. ""That awkward moment when they air the story 3 weeks in advance. Woopsie, nothing to see here,"" said a caption for a Nov. 15 post that’s been shared at least 228 times. The caption is for an image of what looks like a screenshot of online news search results. One of those results is a snippet, circled in red, purportedly dated Oct. 23, 2019 by ABC 7 in Los Angeles: ""A 16-year-old boy shot five fellow students, at least two fatally, Thursday morning at Saugus High School in Santa …"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Two teenagers were killed by a gunman at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, Calif. on Nov. 14. Authorities said that the suspect, also a teenager and student at the school, shot himself in the head and later died at the hospital. We searched ABC 7’s website, Nexis news archives, Google and the broadcast media monitoring website TVEyes. We found no evidence that on Oct. 23 ABC 7 aired or published a story about a high school shooting in Santa Clarita. We reached out to ABC 7 for comment but have not heard back. ABC 7’s first published news reports about the school shooting were on Nov. 14, the day the incident, archives show. ABC 7’s page listing all news about Santa Clarita does not have any Oct. 23 reports about the shooting, as the Facebook post falsely claimed.  The story snippet that the Facebook post highlights does appear to have been written by ABC 7 staff — it features the same first sentence of a story bylined by ABC 7’s staff. But ABC 7 actually published the story on Nov. 14, not three weeks before the shooting happened. A Facebook post claimed that ABC 7 reported the Santa Clarita high school shooting ""3 weeks in advance."" We found no evidence of that. All reporting about that shooting began Nov. 14, not earlier. This appears to be another example of a so-called ""false flag"" theory fueled through social media that often follows mass shootings. Such theories seek to promote the notion that these mass horrors never happened and are the invention of a media conspiracy. They have no basis in truth.
