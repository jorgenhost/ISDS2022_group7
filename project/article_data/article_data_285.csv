President Barack Obama campaign video says auto companies 'repaid their loans'
","
A new Barack Obama campaign video narrated by Tom Hanks portrays the president’s bailout of General Motors and Chrysler as courageous and successful — with loans repaid by car companies.

""Because of the tough choices the president made, the stage was set for a resurgent U.S. auto industry,"" Hanks says in the 17-minute highlights reel of Obama’s presidency, titled The Road We’ve Traveled.

""With business booming, (GM and Chrysler) repaid their loans,"" he later concludes.

It’s a claim we’ve heard before from the CEOs of GM and Chrysler in 2010 and 2011. At the time, we rated their claims Half True.

But it’s been months since we’ve looked at this question, so we thought we’d ask again. 
We’re not checking the overall merit of the government’s efforts to support the car companies, which relies on opinion. Instead, we’re checking some of the facts marshaled by filmmakers. In another item, we checked whether auto bailout money had run out by the time Obama took office. We rated that Mostly True. And here we’ll check whether GM and Chrysler ""repaid their loans"" from U.S. taxpayers. 

The bailouts

We reached out to the car companies, consulted a detailed accounting of Bush and Obama administration rescues kept by the Pulitzer-winning ProPublica, consulted the U.S. Treasury and reviewed other reports and fact-checks on this topic.

The story begins in late 2008, when the U.S. economy was crashing. By early December, GM and Chrysler told the government they couldn’t get the credit they needed to survive, threatening more than 1 million jobs, according to a report from the Congressional Oversight Panel.

President George W. Bush’s administration provided the auto companies with short-term funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program — remember TARP? — support that was continued under Obama with additional loans that financed the companies’ bankruptcy reorganizations.

The 2009 report predicted, ""Although taxpayers may recover some portion of their investment in Chrysler and GM, it is unlikely they will recover the entire amount."" In September 2011, the Treasury reported that it expected the auto bailouts to ""cost the taxpayer just under $24 billion.""

How does this square with the statement that the companies have ""repaid their loans""?

Some government money was offered as loans — but much more was used to purchase stock. Meanwhile, during restructuring, GM and Chrysler were divided into ""old"" and ""new"" companies. And the car companies' consumer finance arms also received aid in the effort to avoid shutdowns.

Our tally of ProPublica’s work on General Motors, GMAC, Chrysler and Chrysler Financial Services shows that of $80 billion spent by taxpayers on the entire bailout, we’re still waiting on nearly $40 billion, a number confirmed by the Treasury Department. At some point, selling taxpayers’ stock in GM and GMAC may earn back a chunk of the rest. But all of it? The story’s not over yet. 
What part of that was loans? Let's look at each automaker.

Chrysler

The government’s bailout of ""Chrysler"" actually involved government infusions totaling more than $12 billion to three companies. One was the automaker prior to its bankruptcy reorganization, the old Chrysler. One was the reorganized company, Chrysler Group. And the third was the company that provided consumer auto loans, Chrysler Financial Services.

Just two of the three have satisfied their government obligations. But the film's ""repaid"" rhetoric reflects solely the Chrysler Group — the new Chrysler. What’s the larger story?

• Since Chrysler Group LLC was formed in June 2009, it has repaid its U.S. loans of $5.1 billion ""in full, with interest, six years early,"" according to a fact-sheet from Katie Merx, financial communications manager for the reorganized company.  (The Treasury also says so.) Another chunk of money bought the government a small ownership stake in the new company, but that’s already been bought by Fiat. So, the Chrysler Group, the entity that arose out of the bankruptcy, has repaid its loans and has shed government ownership.

• Chrysler Financial Services, now TD Auto Finance, has paid off its loan of $1.5 billion — and taxpayers made $22 million on the deal, according to the Treasury Department and ProPublica.

• But the amount taxpayers loaned to Chrysler before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 — the entity now dubbed ""Old Carco"" — was chalked up as a loss by the federal government. That’s a $1.3 billion loan that will never be repaid. (The old company is still grinding through liquidation, but the government doesn’t expect to collect any more.)

So, new Chrysler has ""repaid its loans,"" as has Chrysler Financial Services. But old Chrysler was lent $1.3 billion that won’t be repaid. Even so, taxpayers have fared better than most folks thought — a government official suggested in 2009 that $7 billion might be lost.

Instead, most taxpayer money has been restored, and the new company says it has added more than 9,000 jobs.

General Motors

GM’s story is even more dramatic.

Its $67 billion bailout also involved three companies, the old GM, the GM that emerged out of bankruptcy reorganization and auto financing arm GMAC, which is now Ally Financial.

• The new company received $6.7 billion in secured loans. In April 2010, GM repaid them with interest — and touted it had ""repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule."" But billions of dollars more had been converted to a 61 percent stake in the new company, said James Cain, financial news manager for GM. That stake is now down to 32 percent of the company’s common stock. The question is how much that stock will earn taxpayers to offset $27 billion not yet recouped from old and new GM. A third of GM’s entire stock value as of March 19, 2012, was just $13 billion. (Check its current market capitalization.)

• The former GMAC still has substantial government ownership – more than 70 percent of its common stock is held by taxpayers, according to the Treasury Department — but no loans. According to ProPublica, there’s more than $11 billion left on the GMAC ledger. So it’s not yet clear how taxpayers will fare.

• Old GM got nearly $1 billion in loans, and the Treasury Department has so far squeezed $136 million out of the company as it is liquidated in bankruptcy court. But it’s not clear how much taxpayers will ultimately recoup.

GM has certainly used the reboot to roar back into the marketplace. Its sales, along with those of its Chinese affiliates, were No. 1 in the world in 2011. (Aided the fact that its main competitor, Toyota, grappled with an earthquake, tsunami and floods.) But we’re not measuring the bailout’s success — merely the question of loan repayment.

As with Chrysler, new GM has repaid its ""loans,"" while old GM may fail to repay $850 million. Unlike Chrysler, the government still owns a third of GM and more than 70 percent of the former GMAC — stock that taxpayers can hope will one day earn enough to make them whole. 
Our ruling

So the Obama campaign is echoing a claim from GM and Chrysler that the auto companies ""repaid their loans."" But for both companies, that’s some careful framing that doesn’t tell the whole story. Loans represent about 20 percent of the bailout. Meanwhile, the statement is only fully true of the new automakers. A look at the entire bailout shows loans to the old car companies that may never be repaid, plus outstanding stock investments in GM and the former GMAC. 
The new companies, which got about 85 percent of the loans, have repaid them all. 
In our lengthy discussions about this claim, we considered everything from Mostly True to Mostly False. We’re not weighing Obama’s courage or the bailout’s success. We can say the claim the current companies ""repaid their loans"" is accurate but leaves out important details and context. On the larger bailout, it’s too early to say how taxpayers will make out. This statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/21/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-campaign-video-says-auto-co/
"['Oregon', 'Jobs', 'Oregon Lottery']","
Did it really take Oregon Lottery money to ""land"" the NOAA operations center in Newport?
","
One way the Oregon Lottery pitches itself is by talking about all the money it brings to economic development projects around the state: a brewery in Astoria, a new home for nonprofit Mercy Flights, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration facility in Newport.

From the Lottery’s website: ""Newport gave its all when competing with several other sites to bring the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to town. However, it took $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery® funds for the Port of Newport to eventually land the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific … ""

That raised the eyebrow of a sharp-eyed reader, and ours, too. The facility was a huge deal for Newport and for Oregon, allowing us to best the Puget Sound for a coveted federal facility that means jobs and bragging rights. (We took it away from Seattle.)

But is it fair for the Lottery to claim unbridled credit for this wonderful new economic activity?

The state’s main economic development arm, Business Oregon, seems to think so. Its website says the Port of Newport was able to make the winning pitch ""largely because of $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds, appropriated by the state Legislature, which allowed it to offer a 20-year lease for only $2.4 million per year."" Specifically, Lottery revenue bonds were sold to help finance construction of the new Pacific Coast operations center and base; $19.5 million of the total bond sale was earmarked for the Port of Newport.

A news report in The Oregonian at the time confirmed that Newport officials called state Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, to help score lottery funds for the deal:

""Six months later, they laugh at the memory because, as crazy as it seemed, Johnson and the rest of the caucus bought into the port's dream, and despite the worst economy imaginable, secured $19.5 million in lottery funds to help build a new facility for NOAA, should it agree to come. And agree it did, as the port learned Tuesday.""

Newport was one of four bidders with the other three in Washington, specifically Seattle, Port Angeles and Bellingham. NOAA awarded the Port of Newport the lease because it had the ""highest technically-rated and lowest-priced offer.""

We called Johnson and asked for her take on the Lottery statement. Her response? ""It’s accurate on one level, but it is not very nuanced,"" she said.

She credits a whole bunch of factors for the winning bid, including the members of the legislative ""coastal caucus"" who put aside differences to push for Newport; legislative leaders who made the money a priority; the Lincoln County delegation, which refused to quit lobbying; and the people in Astoria, who gave up their NOAA bid so the federal delegation could get behind one Oregon bid.

""Absent that $19.5 million I don’t think Newport would have shown as well as it did,"" Johnson said, but she added, it’s not as if the Lottery woke up one morning and decided, ""Sheesh, we can make a difference.""

Certainly officials in Washington said they could not compete with the financing offered by Oregon. The Seattle Times reported in December 2009 that the lease in Bellingham would have cost NOAA $4 million a year and the lease at Lake Union cost nearly $6 million, compared to $2.4 million a year at Newport.

But let’s not forget that Newport beat the other sites on technical factors, too.

Chuck Baumann, spokesman for the Oregon Lottery, acknowledges lots of factors were at play, but that lottery money was critical for a low-cost lease. ""We’re certainly not saying we made the decision,"" he said. ""But it’s also important for us to tell folks where lottery dollars go.""

The money was critical. NOAA itself says Newport had the lowest cost bid, and that was in large part due to the Lottery. But Johnson is correct that many other factors played a role and for the Lottery to suggest that its money was the final piece is incomplete.

The statement is partially accurate -- Lottery money made the lease competitive -- but it leaves out important details. Astoria dropped out; Newport’s bid was better on technical fronts than the others; legislative leaders pulled together to set aside the dollars and bonding authority. We rule the statement Half True.

Ted Cruz says health reform’s price tag has doubled
","
U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, tweeted a claim that’s been racing through Republican circles in response to updated cost projections of the national health reform law.

""Did you know ObamaCare will cost nearly twice as much as initially expected - $1.8 TRILLION?"" Cruz tweeted March 19, 2012.

Other politicians have been making similar claims since the Congressional Budget Office released a new report March 13, 2012, about the law’s expected costs. Fox News also ran a story saying the health law will cost twice as much as originally estimated.

A close read of the report indicates that cost projections have increased -- but have not nearly doubled. 
The health care law, passed in 2010, helps individuals obtain health coverage by expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies for moderate-income Americans to purchase insurance.

In 2010, the CBO analyzed cost projections, which go up over time as more provisions of the law are implemented. In that report, the gross cost to the government for coverage was projected at $938 billion. That figure -- again, the gross cost -- didn’t take into account revenue offsets, such as new taxes on the wealthy and penalties paid by individuals and employers who don’t opt into insurance. Those payments bring down the law’s net cost.

The CBO’s latest report updates those figures, but it looks at different years. The new gross estimate is $1.762 trillion -- the figure cited in Cruz’s tweet. But it looks at costs over 11 years -- 2012-2022 -- whereas the earlier report’s figure was for 10 years. And it’s important to note that the timespan of 2012 through 2022 covers nine years when the law is fully implemented (and thus its costs are greater).

So, when we compare the years encompassed in both reports (2012 through 2019), here’s how that apples-to-apples comparison shakes out.

In the CBO’s first estimate, the gross figure is $931 billion.

In the new estimate, the figure is $1.01 trillion.

That’s an increase of 8.6 percent -- far short of Cruz's claim that it is ""nearly twice as much.""

Ezra Klein pointed out in the Washington Post’s Wonkblog that the cost went up ""because the recession has made people poorer, and so the health-care law is going to have to spend more to help them get health insurance.""

Finally, when comparing net figures from the CBO -- which certainly provide a more true-to-life picture of the law’s cost than gross numbers -- the projection for those eight years is actually less. The CBO estimated it at $784 billion in 2010 and revised that to $768 billion in 2012. 
Cruz's spokesman responded to our inquiry by suggesting that the CBO's original cost projection was misleadingly low because it covered years before the law was fully implemented. 
""Even the new CBO score includes two years before the law goes into full effect, so the eventual CBO score for the first 10 years of full implementation will be far higher than the new $1.76 trillion cost-of-coverage in the latest CBO score,"" spokesman James Bernsen wrote. 
But that also ignores the revenue that will be coming in from taxes and penalties, which drive the overall cost down.

Cruz’s tweet saying that the cost of health reform has nearly doubled does not reflect an accurate comparison of dollars or years. When the CBO’s early projections are held up to new projections accurately, the gross cost increase is 8.6 percent. Cruz was a long way off. We rate his claim False. 
Editor's note: 
When our story first published, we hadn't heard back from Cruz's campaign. A short time later, we received an email from his spokesman and we updated the story to include his response.",/factchecks/2012/mar/21/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-health-reforms-price-tag-has-doubled/

Funding eliminated for Milwaukee County sheriff's role in presidential security, sheriff says
","
With Wisconsin’s presidential primary less than two weeks away, the matter of the candidates’ security has become an issue in the state’s largest county, where two of the top elected officials are taking potshots at each other.

Conservative Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who has called Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele a soft-on-crime liberal, took aim at Abele on Feb. 19, 2012, four days after President Barack Obama visited Milwaukee.

In an interview with Milwaukee’s WTMJ-TV (Channel 4), Clarke claimed that Abele used the 2012 county budget to kill Sheriff’s Office funding for providing security for presidential and presidential candidate visits.

""The county executive, Chris Abele -- and he again substitutes his judgment for mine,"" Clarke said, pausing in mid-sentence.

""I asked for an increase for this year because it is a presidential campaign year. Wisconsin is a swing state; we're going to have a lot of presidential visits, campaign visits. We need additional money this year. Not only did they not give me additional money for this activity, they completely eliminated it.""

Was such funding really completely eliminated?

Asked for evidence to support Clarke’s claim, sheriff’s spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin cited the county budget’s elimination of the sheriff’s community relations division.

""Because mounted patrol, dignitary protection, neighborhood watch and public demonstrations are not core services and can be provided by municipalities, this division is eliminated,"" saving nearly $450,000, Abele’s budget says.

""Dignitary protection"" is the part of that allocation that covers sheriff’s security for presidential and presidential candidate visits.

So, literally, Abele did eliminate funding earmarked in the budget for such security, as Clarke claimed.

McLaughlin said because of the budget cut, the Sheriff’s Office did not cover freeway ramps during Obama’s visit -- a task that normally accounts for the largest portion of the manpower assigned to dignitary protection. That was done instead by the State Patrol.

But does that mean no money is available from other parts of the budget for this task? No.

For instance, the Sheriff's Office participated in planning for the president's visit and contributed help with SWAT and K-9 teams at the airport and with some officers participating in the presidential motorcade, McLaughlin said.

Two days after Obama’s visit, in the wake of criticism that Clarke was playing politics with the issue, the sheriff issued a statement suggesting that the elimination of the $450,000 line item wasn’t the only hindrance in providing dignitary protection. He said he could not simply ""move money around"" to provide the usual presidential visit security because his overall budget, which is about $152 million, had been cut by $12 million.

We asked Abele’s deputy chief of staff, John Zapfel, about Clarke’s claim in the TV interview.

He said Clarke ""could have chosen to use his staff for protection (of Obama) rather than attending the Association of SWAT conference and vendor show.""

Zapfel’s reference was to a three-day Wisconsin Association of SWAT Personnel conference held in suburban Milwaukee; the final day was the same day as Obama’s visit. Zapfel cited a report by Milwaukee’s WISN-TV (Channel 12) that ""more than 15 and as many as 25"" SWAT team members were at the conference during Obama’s visit.

Clarke’s response to that report was a statement saying presidents are well protected by the Secret Service and that ""local law enforcement provides a support role.""

Interestingly, the WISN-TV story was done by reporter Brendan Conway, who two weeks later announced he was becoming Abele’s spokesman. In his new role, Conway also responded to our request for information on Clarke’s claim.

Conway said Clarke has the flexibility to reallocate money in his budget if he wanted to provide the same level security as in the past for presidential campaign visits. To underline his point, he noted that during the 2012 budget process, Clarke in October 2011 said he would refuse to make most of the changes that Abele called for in his budget, such as eliminating a boot camp-style inmate program and using deputies to patrol parks and the Milwaukee lakefront.

Indeed, Clarke, as an independently elected official, isn't required to allocate the money as specified by the overall county budget. He can shift funds internally as he deems necessary, even if that strays from budget language. County supervisors have readily acknowledged the sheriff's power trumps the county board and executive's budget authority.

Our rating

Clarke said Abele ""eliminated"" sheriff’s funding for providing security for presidential and presidential campaign visits.

So-called ""dignitary protection"" was among the services included in a nearly $450,000 line item that Abele deleted from Clarke’s budget. Moreover, Clarke’s total budget was trimmed, limiting his overall ability to provide various services.

But despite the line-item cut, Clarke did provide some security services for Obama’s visit. And he has the authority, as an independently elected official, to reallocate funds allocated to him by Abele and the County Board.

Clarke’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/21/david-clarke-jr/funding-eliminated-milwaukee-county-sheriffs-role-/

Bill Pascrell claims 90 percent of U.S. workers are employed by companies with under 100 employees
","
Small businesses are such an integral part of the U.S. economy that, at least according to one congressman, nearly all American workers have jobs at companies with fewer than 100 employees.

U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) pointed to that statistic during a Feb. 23 debate against U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman at Passaic County Community College in Paterson. The two Democrats will face off on June 5 for their party’s nomination to represent the newly redrawn 9th Congressional District.

The Pascrell campaign on March 3 posted video clips of the debate on the campaign’s YouTube channel, including one in which the congressman discussed his commitment to helping small businesses.

""And what I am saying to you is that I have an obligation and a responsibility as a congressman to find ways to help small business,"" Pascrell told the crowd. ""Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that.""

PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Pascrell’s claim is way off, because such companies employed about 35 percent of U.S. workers in 2009, according to business statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau.

This is the second time in less than two months that we’ve debunked one of Pascrell’s statistics on small businesses. In February, we gave him a False for claiming 62 percent of small businesses closed during the past five years because of health care bills. 
Let's explain his latest misstatement about workers at companies with fewer than 100 employees.

In 2009, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed 40,128,249 workers, according to the census bureau. That’s about 35 percent of the 114,509,626 workers included in the census data.

Those statistics exclude certain industries and most government employees, but are considered the ""standard reference source for small business statistics,"" according to the census bureau.

Pascrell campaign spokesman Sean Darcy acknowledged that the congressman ""misspoke"" and said he meant to say ""businesses with fewer than 500 employees represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms.""

That statistic is accurate. According to the census bureau, of the 5,767,306 employer firms in 2009, 5,749,797 had fewer than 500 employees. 
Those businesses with fewer than 500 employees employed about half of the nation’s workforce included in the census data. 
Before we get to our ruling, it’s worth noting that the Pascrell campaign later made the video private on its YouTube channel. So, if you go looking for it now, it’s not there.

Darcy told us the video was originally marked public by mistake. He provided this explanation in an e-mail:

""We have a number of videos on that youtube channel marked private. We use it as a vehicle for the campaign to all view content without having to be in the same location. It is a common practice.

""We have a huge amount of public content on-line on our pascrell for congress facebook page and our pascrell web pages and have been using these sites as a vehicle to get the campaign's message out. Not sure how you came across the one video that was on there in error but, essentially, you found a staff mistake.""

Our ruling

In a Feb. 23 debate with Congressman Steve Rothman, Pascrell claimed: ""Ninety percent of the people who work in this country work for companies under 100 people, maybe even less than that.""

But according to the U.S. Census Bureau, businesses with fewer than 100 employees employed about 35 percent of American workers in 2009. A spokesman for Pascrell acknowledged that the congressman misspoke.

"['Abortion', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
McDonnell says Virginia will join 23 states with ultrasound requirements before abortions
","
During a rapid-fire exchange on Meet the Press earlier this month, Gov. Bob McDonnell rejected host David Gregory’s contention that the legislation puts Virginia in a socially conservative corner.

""This bill allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure,"" said McDonnell, a Republican.

""It’s actually only about seven that have these kind of procedures,"" Gregory interrupted.

""No, but there’s 23 that require a woman to have an opportunity to see an ultrasound,"" McDonnell replied.

We wondered if the governor’s number is correct.

Debate over Virginia’s law this winter became a national story when it became clear that the measure would require use of an invasive, transvaginal ultrasound -- even against a woman’s will.

At McDonnell’s urging, the Republican-led General Assembly eventually passed a toned-down measure mandating that women, at least 24 hours before an abortion, undergo a common abdominal ultrasound in which an imaging wand is rubbed across the stomach. The patient must be offered an opportunity to view the image and hear the fetal heartbeat. Victims of rape and incest are exempt from the law if the molestation or assault was reported to legal authorities.

Taylor Thornley, a spokeswoman for McDonnell, said the governor got his statistics about other states from separate studies by two groups that seldom agree: The Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization that supports women’s access to birth control and abortions; and the National Right to Life Committee, which opposes abortion. Neither group’s research includes Virginia’s law, which will become effective July 1.

The National Right to Life Committee lists 23 states that have an ""ultrasound option"" and gives a brief description of each law.

Guttmacher lists 21 states with ultrasound laws, including seven that mandate the test be performed before an abortion. Unlike the National Right to Life Committee, Guttmacher does not count North Carolina and Oklahoma, where the mandatory ultrasound laws have been stayed pending court challenges.

Guttmacher shows the wide range of laws: 

North Carolina and Oklahoma would fit into that final category if not for the court challenges. In the meantime, those states and Wisconsin require that women be given information on how to access ultrasounds. (Utah requires both that the woman be offered an ultrasound and that if the procedure is performed to prepare for the abortion, the woman is offered an opportunity to view the image.)

So the state requirements range from giving women information on accessing ultrasounds to requiring abortion providers to give ultrasounds and display and describe the image.

Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the institute, said once Virginia’s law goes into effect in July, it will be listed as requiring an ultrasound before an abortion and that the provider must offer to show the woman the image.

Our ruling

McDonnell, in a carefully worded statement, said the bill he recently signed ""allows Virginia to join about 23 other states that have an ultrasound procedure"" before allowing abortions. It is technically correct that 23 states have passed legislation that at least requires women be offered information on how to get ultrasounds before abortions.

But the governor, in implying Virginia has adopted a mainstream law on ultrasounds, omitted a contradicting fact: Virginia will join only nine states that have passed mandatory ultrasound bills. And the enforcement of the laws in two of those states has been delayed by legal challenges.  

While McDonnell is accurate in saying 23 states have laws that deal with ultrasounds, his claim  creates a misleading impression by not acknowledging only nine states require the procedure.
We rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/21/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-23-states-have-ultrasound-requireme/

RNC ad blames Obama for $1,300 spike in family health care premiums
","
Republicans are expecting to use health care as a wedge issue in the 2012 elections -- an approach made clear in a web ad released by the Republican National Committee on March 19, 2012. 
""Barack Obama promised to cut health care costs,"" the ad says. After airing a clip of Obama saying, ""We will bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family,"" the ad continues: ""But it didn't happen. Six in 10 americans are seeing their premiums rise. The average cost of a family policy is up $1,300. And a key part of Obama's health care takeover will cost $100 billion more than promised. Higher costs for patients, higher costs for taxpayers. Another broken promise for Obama."" 
Elsewhere, we’ve given Obama a rating of Stalled for his promise to lower family premiums by $2,500. So the RNC has a point that Obama over-promised on family premiums. 
But is the RNC on safe ground when it blames Obama for ""the average cost of a family policy"" rising by $1,300? 
The ad references a widely respected study produced annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent group that studies health care, and the Health Research and Educational Trust. It’s a sample based on surveys of benefits administrators working for about 2,000 employers that offer health care plans. 
The 2011 edition of this survey found that the average cost of all private plans was $15,073, which was up from the $13,770 found in 2010 -- a difference of $1,303, almost exactly what the ad said. 
So the RNC’s number is legitimate. But we think it’s worth adding some context. 
First, the figure in question refers to the entire cost of the health coverage -- that is, both the portion paid by the employee and by the employer. And as it happens, most of the $1,300 increase between 2010 and 2011 was picked up by the employer -- not the employee. 
Employees and their families saw their cost of health care increase by a much smaller amount -- $132. Employers, by contrast, had to foot a $1,171 increase. The ad is technically correct when it uses the $1,300 figure, and additional employer health care costs don’t simply disappear; they can directly reduce the amount of money available for employee pay, meaning that employees may indirectly bear that burden. ""Workers sooner or later pay pretty much all of the cost of the insurance that employers ‘provide,’ "" said Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the Brookings Institution. 
Still, when watching the ad, it’s easy for a viewer to assume that the average family is shelling out $1,300 more -- but that’s not the case. It’s only about one-tenth of that, at least directly. 
Second, the link between Obama’s policies and health care premium increases is more nuanced than the ad makes it, because most of the health care law hasn’t taken effect yet. Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said that he is uncertain about how the law will affect health costs in the long run, but he added that it’s premature to draw a straight-line link between the law and rising premiums. 
""Blaming the health care law for rising premiums or faulting it for failing to lower them is misleading,"" Oberlander said. 
One private-sector study of health insurance premiums, by the firm Aon Hewitt found that overall, the new law ""is anticipated to increase costs by an average of 1.5 percent in 2011,"" which the firm said was in line with other studies. The increase was greater than that for individually purchased plans and smaller for large employer plans. 
This average increase of 1.5 percent is well below the overall increase in premiums found in the Kaiser/HRET study, which suggests that factors other than the law were driving the overall increase. 
One piece of evidence to support this view can be found in the Kaiser/HRET report itself. Since 1999, both the employee’s and the employer’s health care premium costs have each risen at an average of 13 percent to 14 percent a year. So these increases have been going on for a long time, primarily because of technological advances and rising physician and pharmaceutical costs. 
Such longer term trends are more important benchmarks anyway, experts say. ""What happens over a year or two typically means little,"" said Aaron of Brookings. ""What happens over longer period does matter."" 
Our ruling 
The RNC ad uses a legitimate figure, though its meaning can’t be fully understood without additional context. Families aren’t shelling out $1,300 more for health coverage this year; they are paying $132 more, with their employers picking up the rest, a financial burden that may, or may not, be passed on indirectly to the employee. 
Meanwhile, uncertainty remains about why premiums have risen in the past year. Given that some provisions of Obama’s health care law are already in effect, such as the requirement that health plans include children to age 26, the law has probably had some impact. However, premiums were already on an upward track well before the law was passed.

Tax Foundation map shows Tennessee has low beer excise taxes
","
Editor’s note: On Friday we published an item that ruled as False a claim the Tax Foundation made with a map that shows Tennessee ranking among the lowest in the nation in beer excise taxes. That item incorrectly characterized the map, which was labeled ""State Beer Excise Tax Rates,"" as displaying overall tax rates on beer. We have changed the ruling statement to the more narrow definition of ""beer excise taxes"" and adjusted our ruling.
----

A map published by The Tax Foundation makes it look like Tennesseans can get a cold one without paying too much in taxes.

On the March 5 map, titled ""State Beer Excise Tax Rates (Dollars Per Gallon),"" Tennessee is ranked No. 39, at $0.14 per gallon, well behind the top three states of Alaska ($1.07), Alabama ($1.05) and Georgia ($1.01).

This led to media reports saying that Tennessee has some of the lowest beer taxes in the nation, including one blog post that led with: ""Tennessee may be in the Bible Belt, but its taxes on beer . . . are among the lowest in the country.""""

But Linus Hall, brewmaster for one of Tennessee’s most successful craft breweries, Yazoo Brewing, pushed back on Twitter: ""Do your homework! TN has 17% wholesale tax on top of excise tax, giving us the highest beer taxes in the country!""

Indeed, for years the Tennessee Malt Beverage Association, which represents beer wholesalers, has contended that the taxes Tennesseans pay for beer are among of the highest in the nation, so we decided to look into the claim.

The Tax Foundation map lists Tennessee’s flat per-barrel excise tax paid directly to the state, which has for many years stayed constant at $4.29 per barrel. Since there are 31 gallons in a barrel, that translates to about 14 cents per gallon, which is pretty low compared with flat per-barrel rates levied by other states. A color-coded map key puts Tennessee in the ""Low Beer Tax"" category.

An ""excise tax"" is ""an indirect tax charged on the sale of a particular good,"" according to the website Investopedia. It is considered indirect ""because the government does not directly apply the tax. An intermediary, either the producer or merchant, is charged and then must pay the tax to the government.""

The industry’s national lobbying arm, the Beer Institute, calculates Tennessee’s beer excise tax rate by also including the 17-percent wholesale beer tax referenced by Yazoo’s brewmaster (the Institute does the same thing for Kentucky’s 11-percent wholesale beer tax). That tax, mandated by the state but applied and collected at the local level, pushes Tennessee’s beer tax to $35.61 per barrel, the highest in the nation by the Institute’s rankings (Kentucky moves from 45th in the Foundation rankings to seventh in the Beer Institute’s).

Put another way -- in 2010, a total of $16.6 million in beer tax revenue was collected by the state for its flat $4.29 per-barrel tax, but $122 million in beer tax revenue was collected by local governments for the 17-percent wholesale beer tax mandated by the state. For the consumer, these beer taxes are unavoidable, although as any beer-loving resident of a border county can tell you, beer is often cheaper in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia (even if the Tax Foundation map suggests otherwise).

We found inconsistencies in the Tax Foundation's map. A footnote says, ""Local rates are excluded unless they are statewide and uniform. Alabama and Georgia include statewide local rates."" But we found that standard was not applied to Tennessee, which has a 17-percent wholesale tax on beer that is statewide, uniform and mandatory. Including the revenue it produces would push the state to No. 1 on the Tax Foundation’s rankings, just as it is ranked by the Beer Institute.

An email challenging our False ruling from Tax Foundation vice president for legal and state projects, Joseph Henchman, said a more appropriate ruling would be ""True But Not Comprehensive."" Richard Morrison, manager of communications for Tax Foundation, wrote in an email: ""Yes, multiple taxes affect the ultimate price of beer in Tennessee – and if we had wanted to do an in-depth study on how the final retail price if beer is affected by all of those taxes, we would have. But that’s not what we did, and it’s not what we said we did.""

Still, there is that footnote on the map that indicates the Tax Foundation included local tax rates in making Alabama and Georgia Nos. 2 and 3 in its rankings and it also says the ranking includes it applies ""sales taxes specific to alcoholic beverages"" in Maryland, Minnesota and D.C. So we find the map is inconsistent and misleading.

Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation, said the organization got its excise tax figures from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), which represents the liquor industry and had the most recent data available, September 2011. He said it can ""get a little hairy"" trying to factor in all the various state and local taxes on beer, but in an email Monday said the Tax Foundation’s map attempts to include what he called ""statutory"" tax rates and not ""effective"" rates. He also said local alcohol-specific sales taxes were included in calculating the excise tax rate for beer in Arkansas.

""A statutory rate is the legally imposed rate, whereas the effective rate is what is actually paid when the smoke clears."" He explained later in the email: ""The map does not purport to be anything more than it is: a statutory excise tax rate map on beer at the point of sale.""

Drenkard said the Tax Foundation ultimately determined that the Tennessee wholesale tax on beer, despite being uniform and statewide, fell into the ""effective"" tax rate category and not the ""statutory"" one: ""Tennessee has a ‘wholesale’ tax levied on the wholesale price, but collected at the retail level. Is this properly considered a wholesale tax, or a retail tax? We think this is simply a judgment call.""

Rich Foge, a lobbyist for Tennessee’s Malt Beverage Assocation, and Jason Baird, Foge’s counterpart in Kentucky, both were surprised rankings of beer excise rates would exclude the high wholesale beer tax rates in both states. Lester Jones, the Beer Institute’s economist, makes his rankings of beer excise tax rates include things like city-specific beer and alcohol taxes, and says Tennessee and Kentucky’s wholesale beer taxes -- mandated statewide but paid at the local level -- should definitely be included.

""If you are going to include local taxes for Georgia and Alabama and other states and not include ours, then that map is false,"" Foge said. He added that it concerned him that DISCUS, which lobbies for liquor, was used as the Tax Foundation’s source on beer taxes. ""Those are our competitors,"" Foge said. Drenkard said DISCUS figures were used because they were more recent than the Beer Institute’s tables showing breakdowns effective excise beer taxes for 2009 and 2010.

Hall, the Yazoo brewmaster, said that by including some local tax rates and not others, he felt the Tax Foundation had created a ""misleading"" map. ""Anybody who wasn’t familiar would look at that map and get the opposite impression of what the truth is,"" Hall said.

Foge contends that even the Beer Institute’s calculation of Tennessee’s highest-in-the-nation $35.61 per barrel in beer taxes doesn’t tell the whole taxing story. That’s because when you buy a six-pack at the supermarket, you also pay sales tax on the purchase – an average of 9.25 percent statewide (state sales tax is 7 percent and local governments can tack on up to another 2.7 percent). See this PolitiFact item for our ruling on Tennessee’s high sales and grocery taxes being among the nation’s highest.

The wholesale tax is paid by beer wholesalers based on the value of the beer at wholesale level (including their profit markup), which varies from brand to brand. But when the 17 percent is added, that becomes part of the price at the retail level. Thus, Foge notes, the sales tax is in fact ""a tax on taxes.""

Since the wholesale tax is based on value, it increases as prices increase for beer – as they have over the years. Thus, the wholesale beer tax the state mandates be paid at the local level rises as beer prices go up while the flat ""per barrel"" beer tax paid directly to the state remains stable.

Hall, the brewmaster, said Tennessee’s taxes on beer mean Yazoo makes a higher profit off beer sold in other states, even factoring in shipping costs. Foge said that’s a big reason why many Tennesseans in the beer business find it ""infuriating"" when reports fail to include the wholesale beer tax when calculating Tennessee’s overall beer excise taxes.

Our ruling

The Tax Foundation published beer excise tax figures that included local taxes for other states, but excluded Tennessee and Kentucky’s wholesale beer taxes. While the map is accurate that Tennessee has a flat per-barrel beer excise tax of $0.14 per gallon, excluding the statewide wholesale beer tax creates a misleading impression that Tennessee’s beer taxes are among the lowest in the nation.

"['Ohio', 'Trade', 'Josh Mandel']","
Josh Mandel says Sherrod Brown is responsible for Ohio jobs moving to China
","
This is about Josh Mandel. But with your indulgence, we must tell you about Sherrod Brown first.

Brown is one of the U.S. Senate’s most ardent critics of this country’s foreign trade policies. An Ohio Democrat, he says he supports the ideal of free trade, but adds that poorly drafted trade agreements and weak enforcement of trade rules have let China and other foreign countries step all over American businesses and workers.

His backup? China’s lax labor, safety and environmental standards. It’s minuscule wages that make it attractive for manufacturers seeking cheap labor. It’s currency manipulation that keeps its export prices artificially low. All of these make it harder for American companies with a domestic workforce to compete, Brown says, yet make China attractive to companies that want to cut labor costs, especially for low-skilled hourly workers.    

Trade is Brown’s signature issue. He has voted against trade deal after trade deal -- with South Korea, Panama, Colombia, Central America, Mexico and Canada and, most importantly here, China. So anyone who follows Brown had to appreciate a recent political jab by Brown’s Republican opponent in this year’s Senate election, namely, Mandel. Mandel, currently Ohio’s state treasurer, said in a news release on March 1, when he announced he was actively campaigning for the Senate:

""Make no mistake -- Sherrod Brown is one of the main D.C. politicians responsible for Ohio jobs moving to China.""

Had Mandel just co-opted Brown’s best-known issue?

This would make for quite an interception and, in the game of politics, it deserved kudos. But we wondered: Can Mandel back up his claim?

We asked, and campaign spokesman Travis Considine sent several points in an email:

* The federal stimulus bill in 2009, on which Brown cast a crucial, down-to-the-wire vote, led to tens of millions in taxpayer money being spent on wind turbine parts made in China. The purpose of the bill was to provide jobs in the United States, not China, Considine said.

* Excessive federal regulations that Brown supports ""destroy American jobs and drive businesses overseas.""

* This country’s complex tax code and its high corporate tax rate ""puts America at a competitive disadvantage and drives jobs overseas.""

* ""Unchecked federal borrowing and spending (supported by Brown) dissuades job-creating investment in America.""

Considine also added Brown’s votes against the Keystone XL pipeline; the amount of U.S. debt held by China and its 1,807 percent increase since Brown entered Congress as a House freshman in 1993, and the total number of pages in the Federal Register, which lists regulations.

That’s a lot to consider, but these can be dealt with quickly.

The proposed 1,700-mile-long Keystone pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast has not been built. If the Obama administration or congressional Democrats block it because of environmental concerns, Canada says it might send oil from its oil sands to China rather than to the United States. The oil could help China meet its energy needs. But it has not yet happened. The pipeline won’t go through Ohio anyway, so any connection to Ohioans losing jobs to China is speculative and tangential.

The stimulus bill, formally called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is credited by many economists with pumping enough money into the United States economy to keep the recession from spiralling out of control. There are doubters, though, and there were missteps. ABC News and American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop reported in early 2010 that of $2 billion in stimulus money for building renewable energy projects such as a giant wind-energy farm, 80 percent went to foreign companies, including Chinese.

Mandel’s spokesman cited this specific news story to support Mandel’s claim that Brown is responsible for moving jobs to China, since Brown cast a key vote on the stimulus.

The story would have been accurate but for one thing: The wind project with the Chinese connection never got completed. Since companies could only collect money after completion and the program expired last year, it is safe to say that the amount that went to China was ""zero,"" Russ Choma, the reporter who performed the digging at the Investigative Reporting Workshop, told us.

This stimulus-and-the-Chinese claim has had tentacles in other political races, and Mandel is not alone in citing it. PolitiFact Georgia (in a similar claim about a Georgia lawmaker) and the national PolitiFact operation (in a claim by Sarah Palin) ruled in 2010 that the stimulus-goes-to-China statements were ""False,"" largely for the reason we mentioned. But Choma’s reporting since then, and the program’s termination, has only strengthened the conclusion.

That said, the original ABC News story and the mere prospect of the stimulus providing Chinese jobs prompted outrage from lawmakers -- including Brown. Brown has pushed consistently for ""Buy America"" provisions in spending and government-procurement bills. He tried to get one in the stimulus bill, in fact, but other lawmakers would only accept a weaker version, some saying they feared other countries would protest it was protectionist.

So the specific parts of Mandel’s supporting evidence is weak. But what of his other points, on excessive regulation, the federal tax code, and unchecked borrowing and spending?

Those are sweeping, part of a general complaint by many Republicans about Democrats, and plenty of people share that view. But in none of his examples does Mandel single out Brown’s votes or actions as specifically leading to jobs leaving Ohio for China.

In fairness to Mandel, Brown has in fact pushed for greater regulation of consumer products, but most of his complaints were over products made in, of all places, China. He has sought stricter workplace-safety enforcement and in some cases stricter environmental rules. But there are no known cases of Ohio companies announcing that because Brown voted to beef up the Consumer Product Safety Commission or poultry-plant inspections,  the work of $7.70-an-hour workers would be shifted to China for 77 cents or so an hour -- or $1.50 to $2.50 an hour, as is the case for iPad makers.

PolitiFact Ohio looked at a number of government and private studies on this subject but none went directly to Mandel’s claim. A 2011 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, however, sums it up well: ""U.S. firms that use China as the final point of assembly for their products, or use Chinese-made inputs for production in the United States, are able to lower costs and become more globally competitive... On the other hand, many analysts argue that growing economic ties with China have exposed U.S. manufacturing firms to greater, and what is often perceived to be ‘unfair’ competition from low-cost Chinese firms. They argue that this has induced many U.S. production facilities to relocate to China, resulting in the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs.""

In other words, nothing sparks a move to China like competition from China.

When making a time-for-change-in-Washington argument, Mandel shares a common gripe. But when saying Brown is one of the main Washington politicians responsible for Ohio jobs going to China, he relies on facts that fall apart and is left with generic rhetoric.

Mandel deserves a nod for his chops in trying to co-opt Brown’s signature issue. But to steal a competitor’s theme, you’ve got to be right. We find Mandel’s claim was overly broad; dead wrong in the case of his most concrete backup examples and, overall, just not accurate. It was bold. It was audacious. But put under a microscope, it turned out to be ridiculous, which is a requirement for heating up the Truth-O-Meter.

Health insurance coverage loss claim in need of overhaul

","
We all know how rough the economy has been in Georgia in recent years.

Personal bankruptcies in the state are among the highest in the nation. Job growth is near the bottom. Georgia has more bank failures than any state.

But a state senator from Cobb County offered up a statistic earlier this month that added a different dimension to the economic troubles.

""Every 1 percent increase in the cost of health insurance today causes about 30,000 Georgians to be uninsured,"" said Sen. Judson Hill, a Republican from Marietta.

Hill said this during a Georgia Senate debate of a bill he wanted passed. Senate Bill 471 is aimed at authorizing the state’s Insurance Department to work with other states to create a more competitive health insurance market that will result in lower costs for customers. The Republican-led Senate passed the bill by a 2-1 ratio. The Georgia House of Representatives has not yet voted on the bill.

Hill told us that the state loses millions of dollars a year when it has to pay for medical costs of uninsured Georgians who use emergency rooms as their first source of primary medical care.

""[The state is] saving a lot of money by helping the uninsured get health insurance,"" the senator said.

Still, PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Hill was right about this claim. Do 30,000 Georgians lose their health insurance when there is a 1 percent increase in cost?

Hill said the numbers came from a study he read several years ago. Hill offered some more details through a Senate spokeswoman. The senator pointed to a few national statistics on how many Americans lose their health insurance and estimated what the numbers would be in Georgia.

Health insurance cost experts believe there is a correlation between rising insurance costs and more people losing their insurance. Rising health insurance premiums are generally a result of increased quantity and quality of medical services, some researchers have found. The numbers of how many lose their insurance when costs rise 1 percent varies from the studies we’ve seen and Hill sent us. Some of these estimates are based on data that’s in some cases more than a decade old.

In 2005, a Harvard University professor, a University of Michigan professor and a researcher from the National Bureau of Economic Research produced a study that examined the increase in health insurance costs and the decrease of those insured in the 1990s.

""Our estimates suggest that a 1 percent premium increase results in a net increase in uninsured of 164,000 people. This compares with an estimate by the Lewin Group of 300,000 individuals losing employment-based coverage because of a 1 percent premium increase,"" the study found.

We did not hear back from any of the researchers. The Lewin Group, through a spokesman, declined to comment.

Georgia has 3.15 percent of the nation’s population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Using the study’s estimate, that would mean 5,166 Georgians would lose their health insurance, a far cry from Hill’s statement. Using the Lewin Group’s estimate, the number of Georgians losing their insurance would be 9,450, which is slightly closer to the senator’s statement.

Hill argued the numbers are higher.

""The upper side of that number is approximately 500,000; Georgia represents about 3-4 percent of that number because Georgia has a high number of insured lives,"" Hill wrote in an email.

The highest national estimate Hill sent us was 400,000. The senator mentioned the Lewin Group study, a Congressional Budget Office study that put the number at 200,000 people who lose health insurance for every 1 percent increase in cost and another group that estimated between 200,000 and 400,000 people lose their insurance.

Hill told us in a telephone interview that he had heard estimates of 28,000 Georgians who lose their insurance each time costs rise by a percentage point. He rounded the estimate to 30,000 in his comments to the Senate but conceded the estimate may be lower.

""My real purpose is to do everything we can to make sure health insurance is more affordable,"" the senator said.

In 2010, nearly one in five Georgians lacked health insurance, according to an annual report by Georgia State University researchers, who compile an annual study on the topic based on U.S. census data. In 2008, the year the Great Recession’s footprints could be seen throughout Georgia, 18 percent of Georgians were uninsured, the GSU researchers found.

Georgia State associate professor Bill Custer talked about the recession’s impact with PolitiFact Georgia. He said there’s been a rapid increase in the number of Georgians uninsured because incomes have fallen.

""It’s difficult to give a magnitude on that relationship,"" Custer said when asked whether Hill’s numbers are correct. ""If someone put a gun to my head, I’d say he’s pretty close. But thankfully, no one has done that.""

Even if we use the highest national estimate of the number of people who lose their insurance if costs increase by 1 percent, 500,000, the number of Georgians who would lose their insurance would be 15,000. That’s based on 3 percent of Americans living in Georgia. Considering the recession’s impact in Georgia and that a larger percentage of Georgians were uninsured between 2008 and 2010, maybe the total is higher.

Custer, the Georgia State expert, believes Hill is close with his estimate. We’re a little more skeptical about the senator’s math. Our rating: Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/mar/20/judson-hill/health-insurance-coverage-loss-claim-need-overhaul/
"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Brendan Doherty']","
Rhode Island congressional candidate Brendan Doherty says that there was $60 billion in Medicare fraud in 2010
","
Brendan Doherty, the retired superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police turned Republican congressional candidate, recently sat down for his first long television interview since jumping into the race against incumbent Democrat David Cicilline last year.

In an appearance on Channel 12 (WPRI) ""Newsmakers"" on March 11, Doherty answered questions on everything from the Bush tax cuts to Iran’s nuclear program.

Early in the show, co-host Tim White asked Doherty how he would tackle the nation’s budget deficit if he were elected.

""What specifically would you cut?"" White asked. ""And please do not say waste and fraud, which is something everyone always brings up but is really a drop in the fiscal bucket.""

Doherty then proceeded to talk about, well, waste and fraud.

""We’ve had a tremendous amount of waste in the federal government,"" Doherty said. ""We have people that are gaming the system … We have $60 billion in 2010 in Medicare fraud.""

That sounded to us like a huge amount. If Doherty’s claim is true, it would support his contention that taxpayers could actually save a lot of money if waste and fraud are reined in.

Other fact-checkers have looked at Medicare fraud estimates. Politifact National gave Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn a Half True ruling after he claimed that the country spent $80 billion a year on fraudulent Medicare payments.

While we waited to hear back from Doherty’s campaign, we did some research.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) -- the investigative arm of Congress -- has since 1990 labeled Medicare a ""high-risk program,"" because of the ample opportunities for error and abuse in the system that covers 47 million elderly and disabled Americans.

The GAO issued a report a year ago that gave a total figure for ""improper payments"" for 2010 of $48 billion. That was the equivalent of 9.4 percent of the $509 billion in total spending that year for Medicare.

The GAO pulled the figure from the Fiscal Year 2010 financial report for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicare and came up with an estimate for improper payments based on a random sampling of 82,000 Medicare claims. The GAO report did not include questionable payments made under Medicare’s Part D prescription drug program, for which no estimate was provided by HHS -- so the total amount of improper payments is likely higher.

The report defines an improper payment as ""any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount [including overpayments and underpayments] under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements.""

Typical types of fraud that fall under the umbrella of improper payments include billing for services that were not provided or were not medically necessary, over-billing for services, paying kickbacks and stealing providers’ or patients’ identities.

It’s important to note that the $48-billion figure cited by the GAO is for all ""improper payments,"" not just the fraud that Doherty is targeting.

The GAO report did not isolate the amount of money spent specifically on fraudulent Medicare payments because the Department of Health has no method to detect or measure fraud.

But officials do believe that the level of fraud is high.

In May 6, 2009 testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Daniel Levin, HHS inspector general, estimated that ""more than $60 billion each year"" is lost to health care fraud, citing a figure from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA), a group that includes members from private insurance companies, law enforcement and government agencies.

Many media outlets and critics of government health care programs have used that $60 billion figure when describing the extent of Medicare fraud. Doherty’s campaign referred us to several news stories that cite the number, including pieces by 60 Minutes and USA Today that both quoted Attorney General Eric Holder.

But those stories used an incorrect description of the number because it covers the entire U.S. health care industry, including public and private providers, not just Medicare -- a big distinction.

We watched the 60 Minutes piece cited by Doherty’s campaign. Like other media reports, it does not give an attribution for the $60-billion figure. The USA Today piece with the $60 billion figure cites a speech at a national conference by Holder as its source of the information. In a transcript we found of the speech, however, Holder made it clear he was referring to fraud for the entire health care industry -- not just the Medicare fraud Doherty was talking about.

The NHCAA generally estimates that fraud accounts for 3 percent of all health care spending. So in 2010, when the country spent $2.3 trillion on health care, the cost of fraud was estimated to be $69 billion, according to the association. It did not come up with a specific figure for Medicare, but if we use its 3 percent estimate, then Medicare fraud would have amounted to about $15 billion in 2010 -- a quarter of Doherty’s figure.

The NHCAA also cites an estimate from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that fraud amounts to between 3 and 10 percent of total spending on health care annually. If Medicare fraud were as high as 10 percent, it would have totaled about $51 billion in 2010 -- still less than Doherty’s estimate.

Others have come up with higher estimates for health care fraud, but none have isolated a number for Medicare. They include Malcolm Sparrow, a former fraud investigator and detective chief inspector with the British police service who is now a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He is the author of ""License to Steal,"" a book on health care fraud, and has testified before Congress on Medicare fraud, waste and related issues.

Sparrow believes the amount of health care fraud is much higher than the 3 percent, or $69 billion, estimate by the NHCAA, but in an email to us he emphasized that there are no ""valid estimates"" for Medicare fraud.

Our ruling

Brendan Doherty said there was $60 billion in Medicare fraud in 2010.

The truth is, nobody really knows how much money is spent on fraudulent Medicare claims. Even the government agency that regulates Medicare has not -- and apparently cannot -- come up with a firm figure.

While experts say the amount of fraud in the entire health care system could range from $69 billion to hundreds of billions of dollars, only the GAO study isolated improper payments for Medicare specifically. Its $48-billion estimate, which also includes wasteful spending, is $12 billion -- or 20 percent -- less than Doherty’s number for fraud alone.

Doherty’s campaign didn’t pull the $60 billion number from thin air. Staffers found multiple reports using that figure from credible media outlets. But those media outlets used it inaccurately.

It’s understandable why Doherty believed those reports -- especially for a number that’s pretty squishy -- but if stamping out waste and fraud is indeed one of the core issues of his candidacy, he at least should have gotten his information from a first-hand source.

We rate Doherty’s statement Half True.

Is intimate partner violence the second leading cause of death for women under 50?
","
During the 2012 legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that requires the state's school districts to put policies in place combating teen dating violence. The legislation passed with a pretty wide margin.

During the debate, statistics were thrown out left and right in support of the new policy. One in particular caught our attention.

While speaking in favor of House Bill 4077, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, said ""teen dating violence is where it all starts, and where it ends is with the fact that the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. (for) women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner. No. 2 cause of death. Only exceeded by automobile accidents.""

There's no disputing that intimate partner violence, as it's commonly referred to in support circles, is a major problem nationally and worldwide. But could it really be the second leading cause of death for women under the age of 50?

Monroe didn't have any support for his claim when we reached him at home. He mentioned that he'd heard the statistic some eight years ago at a conference in San Diego. Since then, he said, he'd read it in several articles.

Without a lead, we had to start from scratch. Our first step was to check in with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has a specific division that looks into injury and violence prevention. As it happens, injury is the leading cause of death for Americans between ages 1 and 44.

Gail Hayes, a spokeswoman for the Injury Center, showed us how to drill down into the data on hand.

We looked for the leading causes of death for women between the ages of 1 and 50 from 1999 to 2009. This is what we found, in descending order: Malignant neoplasms (cancer), unintentional injury (largely motor vehicle accidents and poisoning), heart disease, suicide, stroke and then -- at sixth place -- homicide, which would include intimate partner violence.

Unfortunately, you can't dig down any deeper into the homicide category to get a good idea of just how many of those are perpetrated by intimate partners. Even if we could have gone further, the rankings didn't seem to support Monroe. Once you remove biological causes of death -- cancer, heart attack and stroke -- homicide comes in at third place, after unintentional injuries and suicide.

Hayes was kind enough to check in with some of the Injury Center scientists to see if they'd heard the statistic that Monroe cited. The best she could come up with was the fact that just over 41 percent of female homicides aged 1-50 were ""intimate-partner related."" But, she said, that data applied to only 16 states and couldn't be reliably nationalized.

The CDC had some recent reports on the issues of intimate partner violence, but none of them referenced Monroe's statistic.

Our next step was a call to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. We spoke with Angela Hale who also said she hadn't heard of the statistic that we were trying to verify.

We did find a similar statistic referenced in the abstract for a paper published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. Ultimately, that lead never panned out. The closest we could find was a another report from 1991 that stated ""violence was the second most common cause of injury overall and the most common cause of injury of women aged 15-44.""

But violence didn't necessarily mean intimate partner violence. In fact, the only thing the article says about such violence is that 62 percent of the violent incidents involved husbands or boyfriends.

Ultimately, we ended where we started: With no source to back up the claim.

In the end, the onus is on the speaker to offer a source for what he said. Monroe didn't have one -- and after days of searching, we couldn't find one. There is no doubt that intimate partner violence is a serious issue, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence that it ranks as the No. 2 cause of the death for women under 50. The highest it might rank -- and even this is a stretch -- is sixth place, according to CDC data.

We rate this claim False.

Film promoting Barack Obama claims new law ensures Americans will 'no longer will see their coverage dropped or capped when illness strikes'
","
You may remember hearing the horror stories of people who saw their medical coverage revoked once they became seriously ill.

For instance, during congressional testimony in 2009, a nurse from Texas told of losing her coverage after being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer because she had failed to disclose in her insurance application that she had once visited a dermatologist for acne, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Such stories provide the background for a claim in The Road We’ve Traveled, a 17-minute film from President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign. The film touts Obama’s achievements in health care, saying that the Affordable Care Act has substantially expanded coverage for millions of Americans.

The film claims that as a result of Obama’s policies, ""Americans no longer will see their coverage dropped or capped when illness strikes."" We decided to check to see whether that was correct.

In the widely publicized (and criticized) practice, health insurers used sometimes innocent or inadvertent mistakes by applicants to retroactively rescind their coverage. Furthering public outrage were revelations that these was not merely rogue practices but, at least at certain companies, pervasive policies. According to congressional testimony, employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses, the Los Angeles Times reported.

This issue was confronted head-on in the 2010 health care law passed by the Democratic Congress and signed by Obama, according to a summary of the health care law published by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The law has already begun to prohibit individual and group health plans from placing ""lifetime limits on the dollar value of coverage"" and prohibit insurers from ""rescinding coverage except in cases of fraud."" Beginning in January 2014, the law is scheduled to prohibit individual and group health plans from placing annual limits on the dollar value of coverage. (Prior to that date, plans may impose annual limits on coverage only according to limits set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.)

Whereas the old practices allowed companies to comb policies for inadvertent omissions and minor breaches of the fine print, the new law sets a higher threshold -- fraud -- that would be harder, though not impossible, for companies to prove.

On the surface, then, the ad would appear to be accurate. However, we think there’s a bit of context that’s worth noting.

The law doesn’t explicitly stop companies from imposing limits on the number of visits to doctors, physical therapists and the like. This may be dealt with once an ""essential health benefits package"" is created by 2014 -- a package that would serve as the minimum list of services available with plans purchased on the health care ""exchanges"" that are to be set up by the health care law.

But since the elements of this package have not yet been determined, we don't know whether the package will ultimately include a ban on limiting physician visits. This lack of certainty weakens the film’s claim that Americans will ""no longer will see their coverage … capped when illness strikes.""

Second, it’s worth noting that the number of people who experienced revocations of their insurance was quite small. Typically this only happened to people with individually purchased insurance policies, and even within that group, the rates were small.

We looked at the study that served as the statistical basis for the congressional hearings we cited earlier. It was produced by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the group of state-based officials who regulate insurance.

The group found that in the five-year period from 2004 to 2008, the annual number of rescinded policies averaged 5,449 per year, ranging from a high of 7,004 in 2005 to a low of 4,818 in 2007.

To put this in perspective, 28.5 million people in 2008 had individually purchased insurance -- the only kind for which people had to worry about getting their insurance revoked -- while 202.6 million had private insurance of any type, according to the Census Bureau. So, fewer than two of every 10,000 people who held individually purchased policies in 2008 saw their insurance revoked that year, or about two of every 100,000 people who had private insurance of any kind.

Our ruling

The film is largely accurate that Obama’s health care law makes it all but impossible for health insurers to revoke their beneficiaries’ policies for anything short of willful fraudulence. But the law hasn’t yet entirely closed the door on limiting beneficiaries medical services. And it’s worth noting that, their media profile notwithstanding, there weren’t a large number of people who experienced revocations every year. Their number was far smaller than, say, those hurt by pre-existing condition rules, or those left uninsured after graduating from college -- the other two claims the film makes about Obama’s health care law. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/mar/19/barack-obama/film-promoting-barack-obama-claims-new-law-ensures/

No evidence for claim that Maricopa County ‘purged machine records before audit’
","The Republican-led hunt for election fraud in Arizona is over. But while the partisan ballot review failed to prove that the 2020 election was stolen, it inspired torrents of online misinformation. One rumor said Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, eliminated files before the firm hired by the state’s Senate Republicans began its review in April. ""Maricopa County official purged machine records before audit started,"" said one headline that was shared in an Instagram post and flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The same claim was made by the leaders of the review, who presented their findings Sept. 24. A slideshow from Ben Cotton, founder of the firm CyFir, claimed that an unnamed Maricopa County official ""purged the general election results"" in February from its election management system, EMS, just before a forensic audit commissioned by the county. ""Some individual went into an application, and they chose specifically to run something that would clear all records in the system that was used to generate the official results, the day before an audit started,"" said Doug Logan, CEO of the Cyber Ninjas firm that led the review. The Maricopa County Elections Department and elections experts disputed the claim about ""purged machine records,"" calling it ""misleading."" They said the November election data was archived and backed up elsewhere — not ""purged"" — as is standard practice before a forensic audit of ballot tabulation equipment like the one Maricopa County had in February.  The claim is also undercut by the fact that the forensic audit was completed in February, and the Cyber Ninjas’ review was completed in September, with neither changing the original outcome. ""We have data archival procedures for our elections and have archived the 2020 November general election data on backup drives,"" said Megan Gilbertson, communications director for the Maricopa County Elections Department. ""It’s also important to point out that we provided the Senate with the Windows event logs, network logs and other data from the tabulation equipment in January 2020. We cannot keep everything on the EMS server because, like all equipment, it has storage limits. We also had a statutorily mandated election to prepare for in March."" The EMS database was backed up daily, Gilbertson said, and while the files remain secured, the state Senate never subpoenaed them. The county said the same in tweets fact-checking claims from the Cyber Ninjas, who had never audited an election before. ""Nothing was purged,"" it said in one tweet. ""Cyber Ninjas don’t understand the business of elections. We can't keep everything on the EMS server because it has storage limits.""  We have data archival procedures for our elections and @MaricopaVote archived everything related to the November election on backup drives. So everything still exists. EXPLANATION: The Election Management System (EMS) database does not store election information forever. In a statement, Cyber Ninjas spokesperson Rod Thomson argued that ""it was not a storage issue,"" and that while the county may have archived its data elsewhere, ""they did purge that information from the machines"" before the forensic audit. ""That they now claim it was archived does not explain why they waited until literally the day before the equipment was to be handed over to the Senate for the audit, to purge the information,"" Thomson said. ""That timing seems obviously suspicious."" Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser to the elections program at Democracy Fund, said the storage issues the county cited are real.  ""In a large jurisdiction such as Maricopa County, with millions of voters and thousands of ballot styles, the system would quickly be overwhelmed and bogged down,"" said Patrick, who served until 2014 as the federal compliance officer for the Maricopa County Elections Department. ""It’s clear that records are not kept on local machines forever,"" added Matthew Weil, director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Elections Project. There’s also nothing suspicious about Maricopa County archiving its data before a forensic audit like the one it held in February, Patrick said. The ballot tabulation machines were cleared of their official results so that the audit could properly test that they were counting votes accurately. ""Before you want to have anyone run an audit or run additional test ballots through a piece of equipment, you want to archive live results so that you don’t have things get commingled or mixed up,"" Patrick said. ""By removing it and archiving it, that’s the only way to 100% protect it in that snapshot in time before there’s any other activity on the system."" Patrick added: ""It happened the day before (the forensic audit) because it was the official record and they needed to remove the official transactions from that system prior to having the audit."" ""We were readying the EMS server so our certified auditors could test the equipment for accuracy,"" Gilbertson told PolitiFact. Maricopa County tweeted that this was ""standard practice."" Overall, Patrick said the claim that machine records were ""purged"" shows a misunderstanding of the way that elections are run. The records weren’t deleted. ""The individuals who did this exercise in Arizona do not understand the terminology of elections or the procedures and policies or elections,"" Patrick said. ""They misrepresent what they see because they don’t understand what they’re looking at."" An Instagram post says ""Maricopa County official purged machine records before audit started."" The Maricopa County Elections Department said it archived and backed up all November election data, and that nothing was deleted.

An ad's charge that drug price haggling would 'swipe $500 billion from Medicare' is incorrect
","The advertisement opens with a doctor sitting across from his patient and holding a prescription drug pill bottle. ""You want to continue with this medication?"" the doctor asks while an older patient nods. The doctor then explains that he can no longer provide the medicine to her because insurance companies and Washington bureaucrats ""are working together to swipe $500 billion from Medicare to pay for (House Speaker Nancy) Pelosi and (Senate Majority Leader Chuck) Schumer’s out-of-control spending spree."" ""They’re calling it Medicare negotiation, but really, it’s just a way to cut your benefits and no longer pay for lifesaving medicines,"" the doctor says. Medicare negotiation refers to the federal government bargaining directly with pharmaceutical companies on the price of prescription drugs. Currently, Medicare is prohibited from using its vast buying power to contain prices. But supporters of Medicare drug price negotiations see the Democratic-backed budget reconciliation bill now being discussed in Congress as a means to reverse the policy. This ad, seen on television and online, is part of a multiplatform campaign by the 60 Plus American Association of Senior Citizens, a conservative group that lobbies on senior issues and brands itself as the ""right alternative to AARP."" It’s one example of a collection of ads that have popped up in the past month about Medicare drug price negotiations. Since drug pricing is a hot topic and a critical piece of the broad, politically charged debate in Congress, we thought it was important to dig into the ad’s messages. First, the ad claims that Medicare drug price negotiation will take ""$500 billion from Medicare."" All five of the Medicare and drug pricing experts we consulted said that was a misleading way to frame this policy. The reference to $500 billion most likely comes from a Congressional Budget Office estimate of a provision in H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. It’s an estimate of how much the government would save over 10 years if drug price negotiations were enacted. That is, the government would be paying pharmaceutical companies $500 billion less for prescription drugs. And, in that bill, $300 billion to $400 billion of the savings would be used to expand benefits to include dental, hearing and vision coverage, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF. Right now, Medicare doesn’t provide that coverage to seniors. If this policy were to make it into the pending budget reconciliation, some of the savings would also likely address other Democratic health care priorities, such as permanently closing the Medicaid coverage gap and improving Affordable Care Act coverage and subsidies. So the ad’s charged language — that Pelosi and Schumer are proposing to ""swipe"" this money from Medicare — is incorrect.  That $500 billion in savings would be slated for reinvestment in the program. And some experts said the changes to drug pricing could also translate into lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs for seniors. The point of negotiations is ""to spend less on the drugs we’re already buying and put the money back into the health system,"" said Rachel Sachs, a law professor and expert on drug policy at Washington University in St. Louis. But what about the ad’s other main point — that Medicare negotiation will result in seniors no longer being able to get their medications? Since 60 Plus did not return requests for comment, it’s hard to know exactly what it is asserting will come between seniors and their medication. It’s possible the ad is implying that drugmakers may walk away from the negotiating table if they don’t like the prices the government promotes. But experts said it’s likely a financial penalty would be in place to motivate the companies to work with the government. H.R. 3 proposed an escalating excise tax. The U.S. has the world’s largest prescription drug market, so it seems unlikely companies would stop selling drugs here completely, said Stacie Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University. And the number of drugs subject to negotiation would probably be a small subset of all drugs on the market, based on the negotiation method that was proposed in H.R. 3. In real life, the scenario shown in the ad is unlikely to happen, said Joseph Antos, senior fellow in health care policy at the American Enterprise Institute. It’s possible that a particular drug would be taken off the market, said Antos. ""But it’s much more plausible to say this is the kind of policy that would lead to some new drugs not coming out to the market."" That’s an argument often raised by the pharmaceutical industry. Evidence suggests there’s a grain of truth in the assessment that lower industry profits results in less research and development, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow in health care policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But it’s only a grain. For the most part, he says, the drug industry overstates the effect of lost profits. ""A lot of these drugs are what’s known as ‘me-too’ medicines, which means the drugmakers are making small innovations on existing drugs,"" said Van de Water. ""The loss to Medicare beneficiaries of those types of drugs would be relatively small."" In a separate analysis, the CBO examined to what extent negotiated drug prices could squeeze the pharmaceutical industry’s R&D capacity. The agency, using a 30-year window, estimated that 59 drugs wouldn’t come to market. That’s against a baseline of about 900 drugs being released per year, said Sachs, which means it would stymie only a tiny fraction of otherwise expected drugs. Still, some experts say the CBO report can’t precisely predict the future and a loss in profits would have a larger effect on smaller, start-up pharmaceutical companies. ""At the small operations, a scientist thinks they have an insight into some biological process and they attract venture capitalists to develop a drug,"" said Antos. ""But drug development is a complicated business, and the drug might not make it to market. With less funds for that type of research, that is the part of the drug business most directly affected by the drug pricing policy."" The political stakes surrounding the Medicare drug price negotiations are high. Currently, the idea is seen as a way to help pay for the Democratic-backed health initiatives being discussed as part of the reconciliation bill. And a recent poll from KFF shows that almost 90% of the public supports the government’s ability to negotiate for lower drug prices. But allowing Medicare to bargain on drugs is controversial, even among Democrats, some of which say they don’t want to stifle drug companies’ innovation, especially if it’s a big industry in the area of the country they represent. Meanwhile, PhRMA, the powerful pharmaceutical industry trade group, announced Sept. 15 it would be launching a seven-figure ad campaign against the drug pricing proposals, according to The Hill. The 60 Plus Association ran an advertisement that claimed Medicare drug price negotiations were ""swiping"" $500 billion from Medicare and going to be used as a way to ""cut benefits and no longer pay for lifesaving medicines."" While the number $500 billion has factual basis, the rest of this claim is misleading. If Congress approves Democrats’ plan to let Medicare negotiate drug prices, the government would be paying less to pharmaceutical companies for the same drugs. And most of the savings would be funneled directly back to Medicare to provide vision, dental and hearing benefits to seniors.  So the money would come out of drug companies’ revenues, not out of Medicare.  The reduced revenue for pharmaceutical companies could affect what drugs become available, but experts said the effect on Medicare recipients would likely be very small.

Taxing churches would not add enough revenue to lower rates for individuals
","A viral image suggests that if churches were required to pay taxes, individuals would be in tax heaven, but the claim actually doesn’t have a prayer. The image, with a picture of a gleaming church, states:  ""Something to ponder. The yearly cost of religious tax exemptions: $71,000,000,000. IF THE CHURCH PAID TAXES, EVERYONE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY 3% TAXES. TAX THE CHURCHES."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The numbers don’t add up. ""Even if we bent logic to treat churches as for-profit entities, and assumed an ordinary rate of profit for them, the tiny amount of additional revenue this would generate wouldn't budge individuals' effective tax rate at all,"" said Jared Walczak at the Tax Foundation, who has written about similar claims. The federal tax exemption for churches dates back more than a century. Corporations or associations organized for religious, charitable, or educational purposes were defined as exempt from tax in the original 1913 law establishing the income tax.  Churches are automatically considered tax exempt if they meet the requirements of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which applies to charitable organizations. That section specifies ""exempt purposes,"" such as relief for the poor, advancement of religion, and advancement of education or science. Many states and localities also exempt these organizations from property and sales taxes related to fulfilling their missions. But tax-exempt organizations are still subject to some taxes. For example, the exemption doesn’t apply to the payroll taxes that cover the costs of Medicare and Social Security for their paid employees. Tax-exempt organizations that have paid employees are required to pay their share of these payroll taxes and withhold their employees’ share, too. Tax-exempt organizations may also have to pay corporate taxes on income from business ventures that are unrelated to the main reason for which they are tax-exempt.  So the proposal to ""tax the churches"" would be in addition to these taxes, the categories that are still exempt. The viral image suggests that the tax revenues lost through such exemptions is $71 billion. If that were the case, collecting those taxes would add about 2% to the government’s total annual tax revenue, which is about $3.8 trillion. But the real cost of the federal income tax exemptions for churches and other exempt religious organizations is far less: $2.4 billion, according to Walczak, who bases his calculation on the benchmark of a 7.7% profit margin across all industries. If it were collected, it would add 0.06% to federal revenue, not nearly enough to allow tax rates for everyone else to be slashed to 3%. ""The income tax revenue that could be generated is too minimal to change anyone's tax rates."" Walzak also argues that the image ""uses this intentionally impossible assumption that a nonprofit earns income. The only appropriate amount of net income tax from a nonprofit is $0."" In the aggregate, U.S. taxpayers pay 13.28% of their adjusted gross income in federal income taxes, Walczak told PolitiFact.  Even if the $71 billion figure in the image were to include all taxes that churches are now exempt from — including state, property and sales taxes — it would be inaccurate, Walczak said.  Bottom line, he said, ""even if governments went all-in on the taxation of churches, tossing out all the ordinary rules of taxation, they could only generate a few billion dollars, a drop in the bucket in a system with $3.8 trillion in federal tax collections and about $1.8 trillion in state and local tax collections.""

Cawthorn misrepresents data on youth suicides
","EDITOR’S NOTE: If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (En Español: 1-888-628-9454; Deaf and Hard of Hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741. U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn recently trekked hundreds of miles outside his mountainous western North Carolina congressional district to speak to a school board in Johnston County, a bedroom community southeast of Raleigh. The board was considering whether to require students to wear masks in school. And Cawthorn argued that masks would further traumatize children who were already suffering from the effects of the pandemic.  To support his argument, the Republican pointed to suicide data in the U.S. Speaking to reporters outside before the board’s Sept. 14 meeting, Cawthorn said: ""You can see what the World Health Organization was saying, you know, putting masks on children does have some mental problem — it increases depression. You know, we saw death and suicide rates are up 255% in one study that a hospital did in America because they’re starting to see that people are really feeling disconnected from that social interaction."" Inside the meeting, Cawthorn offered a similar claim. But this time his focus was on suicide attempts, not deaths. ""Suicide attempts from children and teens stunted in their social interactions skyrocketed 250% in 2020 in one study a hospital did in the United States,"" he told the school board. First things first: the World Health Organization told PolitiFact NC that it has ""not published anything there (on its website) about a connection between children wearing masks and depression, to date."" Now, what about that stat Cawthorn referenced? Cawthorn’s vague comments could give the impression that suicides or attempts have increased more than 250% across America. But that’s not true. While some findings suggest concerning numbers of suicide attempts by young people, the increases are nowhere near as high as the congressman's statements suggest. Cawthorn spokesman Luke Ball told PolitiFact NC that the congressman was referring to numbers included in an NPR story from February, titled: ""Child psychiatrists warn that the pandemic may be driving up kids' suicide risk."" Ball noted this paragraph from an NPR’s story: ""At Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, the number of children and teens hospitalized after suicide attempts went up from 67 in 2019 to 108 in 2020. And October 2020 saw a 250% increase in these numbers over the previous October, says Hillary Blake, a pediatric psychologist at the hospital."" A few things stand out here. First, in both quotes about suicide, Cawthorn referenced a ""study."" However, the hospital in NPR’s story didn’t conduct a study across the U.S. or even across its own state. The hospital merely reported its own data. Second, the hospital reported suicide attempts — not suicide rates, as Cawthorn suggested when speaking to reporters. Cawthorn also cherry-picked an alarming number comparing two months and ignored the other year-to-year numbers in the story that showed a smaller increase in suicide attempts. PolitiFact NC reached out to Riley Hospital about its suicide attempt data for young people. Courtney Taylor, a spokeswoman for the hospital, told PolitiFact NC that they saw ""a 51% increase in admissions for suicide attempts in the 12 months prior to March 2020 (90 admissions) as compared to March 2020 through March 2021 (136 admissions)."" Taylor said the hospital limits what information it shares with the public, due to privacy concerns. She concluded her email with this statement: ""Wearing a face mask does not increase suicidal ideation. Masks are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19."" Experts told PolitiFact that the pandemic has definitely taken a toll on the mental health of adults and school-aged children. However, they said it’s wrong for Cawthorn to suggest that suicides or suicide attempts nationally rose as much as 250%. The overall number of youth suicide attempts in the U.S. did rise in 2020 — though not as much as Cawthorn suggested. Among minors aged 12 to 17, the CDC in June announced a 22% increase in suspected suicide attempts from the summer of 2019 to the summer of 2020. The CDC examined data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which monitors 71% of emergency departments in 49 states.  Attempts by young people have risen in North Carolina as well. The health department tracks emergency department visits for self-inflicted injuries. A recent report shows that kids in the 10-to-18 age group accounted for roughly 30% of self-inflicted injury emergency department visits between May 2020 and April 2021, despite making up only 13% of the population. While self-inflicted injury ER visits have stabilized for every other age group, rates for young people in April 2021 were 61% higher than they were in May 2020. Preliminary data show that the number of young North Carolinians who died by suicide rose from 54 in 2019 to 66 in 2020, the health department says. What about overall numbers?  The CDC says the total number of deaths by suicide for all ages actually decreased 5% between 2019 and 2020, from 47,511 to 44,834. In North Carolina, the health department says the overall number of deaths by suicide increased from 1,368 in 2019 to 1,385 in 2020. Now, back to Cawthorn’s claim. Experts say it’s fair for anyone to point out that the pandemic has affected children’s mental health. However, they discourage people from jumping to conclusions about the data. Hospital reports alone can’t capture the full extent of mental health crises among children, said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University’s School of Medicine. ""If you think of all the kids who have been exposed to all kinds of stress and disruption, a very tiny proportion actually show up in emergency departments with mental health complaints,"" he said. On the other hand, the increase in hospitalizations among young people may be because they were stuck at home with their parents more. ""By spending more time at home together with young persons, adults might have become more aware of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and thus been more likely to take their children to the (emergency department),"" CDC researchers theorized in their report. ""It’s really the first time in the United States and in much of the world where there’s been an immediate focus on taking care of your mental health,"" said Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president for research at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Experts took issue with Cawthorn’s suggestion that there’s a link between school mask requirements and student suicide attempts.  As PolitiFact previously reported, researchers wrote in a September 2020 paper for the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health that there are ""minimal physiological impacts on wearing a mask."" Overall, though, experts told PolitiFact NC they’re not aware of any research suggesting mask policies have anything to do with whether a child attempts suicide. Depression is such a complicated condition that it’s often tough to identify a single reason or motivation for why someone might try to harm themselves. That’s why Cawthorn’s comments are misleading and ""irresponsible,"" Swanson said.  Dr. Marvin Swartz, Swanson’s colleague at Duke’s School of Medicine, said the pandemic has placed many different strains on children and their families.  ""It is clear that rates of distress and suicidal ideation are increasing for children. It is impossible to attribute this to masking,"" Swartz said. Harkavy-Friedman agreed, saying it will be difficult for any researcher to isolate peoples’ motivations ""because COVID is so ubiquitous."" ""What I want to say about the number (Cawthorn quoted) is, like everything else, we just don’t know right now,"" she said. ""Let’s not worry as much about the number as the people."" Cawthorn said ""death and suicide rates are up 255% in one study that a hospital did in America because they’re starting to see that people are really feeling disconnected from that social interaction."" Cawthorn’s office says he meant to refer to one Indiana hospital’s report showing that teens were hospitalized for suicide attempts 250% in October 2020 than in the previous October. While data collected by that hospital, North Carolina’s health department and the CDC do signal a rise in hospitalizations among young people, there is no indication that suicide attempts or deaths have increased at the rate Cawthorn suggested.

It is the position of the Atlanta NAACP and the executive committee."" Rose said his chapter has not specifically stated that it wants the carving sandblasted off the mountain, but that he believes it could be removed or covered or that it would eventually erode away if maintenance on it were stopped. He said the national NAACP opposes Confederate symbols in public places, but has not stated a position specifically on the carving. In 2018, the DeKalb County, Ga., chapter of the NAACP condemned the carving in a statement but did not call for its removal, citing cost and opposition from the public and Georgia lawmakers. But the groups said it advocates changes at the park, including removing all references to the park as a memorial to the Confederacy. The national NAACP and the DeKalb chapter did not respond to our calls and emails. In May 2021, the board overseeing the park voted to relocate Confederate flags from a busy walking trail and create a museum exhibit that acknowledges the site’s connection to the Ku Klux Klan, which held a cross-burning on the mountain in 1915.

Fact-checking whether Verizon promotes defunding police and the notion that US is racist
","A TikTok video makes a two-part attack on the telecommunications company Verizon, hitting on the polarizing issues of defunding the police and racism. The poster of the video wrote: ""You go woke you go broke! Just cancelled my Verizon account!"" Below that text is a headline copied from a Fox Business article that read:  ""Verizon promotes defunding the police and idea that America is fundamentally racist: report."" The article is based on a blog post by Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist who opposes critical race theory.  TikTok identified videos with this message as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) A similar claim was made on another website and that headline was shared on Facebook.  Verizon sponsors a ""Race & Social Justice Action"" program for employees that includes sessions with guest speakers. Verizon says that the aim of the program is to discuss racism and promote change, and that the company does not support defunding the police. A description of the program on Verizon’s website says: ""The thoughts and beliefs expressed by the speakers are their own and do not necessarily reflect the view of Verizon."" In one session, a speaker advocated for a form of police defunding, and in another session a speaker spoke about the continuing effects of racism in America, dating back to slavery. The defund the police movement gained prominence in the days after George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, 2020, triggering protests across the country against police violence. Some protesters called for eliminating police departments entirely, while others wanted to revisit the functions of police departments and reroute some of their funding toward other services.  Rufo cited comments by Adrian Burrell at a Verizon session on criminal justice reform in July 2020. Burrell describes himself as a storyteller who examines race. The other speakers were an advocate for youth justice and sentencing reform and an appellate criminal defense attorney. Rufo’s blog post accurately quotes Burrell calling for more police resources to be diverted to community groups. Here is a fuller account of what Burrell said, according to a recording of the session: ""I just think that at this point, I feel like the system is broken and I feel like over-policing doesn’t work. And I feel like those same resources that are aimed towards hiring police and having people come in contact with people with racist biases and all these different things, they need to be aimed at just bringing more resources to the community at a root level, and then you just won’t need so many police. And if you want to call that ‘abolishing the police,’ or if you want to call that ‘defunding the police,’ so be it. But I think really, we just need the resources to be aimed more at benefiting the community, not at hiring more police and giving them militarized equipment."" Rufo also cited a Verizon program in August 2020 in which the speaker was Khalil Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at Harvard. Rufo’s blog post said Muhammad argued that America is fundamentally racist; that the Founding Fathers built a slave economy; and that it produced the economic incentives that prevail today, with corporations ""exploiting poor people in low-income communities"" in a similar way to the slaveowners.  Here is a fuller account of what Muhammad said on those points, according to a recording of the session: Muhammad recalled Floyd’s murder and contrasted it and other killings of Black people with tragic accidental deaths. He said: ""What we have here are systems of racism that were built intentionally a long time ago that have been the focus of reform and attention time and time again."" Muhammad said, ""There’s no founding American wealth without the experience of enslaved Africans as the wealth generators for this nation. ... Any business person should ask themselves, ‘Where did the capital come from to generate the value of America in the very beginning?’"" The Founding Fathers, he said, ""had a very difficult time extracting themselves from the economic incentives that this early version of global capitalism produced for them. If we told that story, then we’d have an easier way of understanding why business people today have a hard time changing business practices, even when they know that they are exploiting poor people in low-income communities."" Muhammad spoke at another Verizon session on dismantling systemic racism in February 2021. Verizon responded to Rufo’s blog post with a statement saying any suggestion that Verizon supports defunding the police ""is completely false and absolutely absurd."" The Verizon sessions included speakers ""representing many different perspectives, including both the civil rights community and law enforcement,"" the statement said. ""Our goal was to host open, and sometimes difficult, conversations about race and the issues facing the United States. Guest speakers were free to express their personal opinions, but none of those opinions necessarily reflected the views of Verizon nor were endorsed by us. Verizon is committed to racial equality and equity. We also firmly believe that fair and effective law enforcement is essential to a free society. There is no incompatibility between these views."" We asked Verizon for materials showing that the sessions included people with different perspectives, including law enforcement. A spokesperson referred us to the company’s statement. A TikTok video claimed: ""Verizon promotes defunding the police and (the) idea that America is fundamentally racist."" Verizon presented a program on race to employees that included one speaker who spoke in favor of some level of defunding the police, and a speaker who discussed what he said are the ongoing effects of racism in America dating back to slavery. Verizon said the program provides for conversations about race, and the speakers’ views do not necessarily reflect its own. The company denied that it promotes defunding the police.

No, doctors won’t lose their licenses for saying ‘anything bad’ about COVID-19 vaccines
","As the spread of the delta variant continues, the pressure to vaccinate more Americans is on, and as efforts to increase vaccination rates have ramped up, so has the backlash online.   Some social media users have taken to spreading conspiratorial claims about doctors having their hands tied where COVID-19 vaccines are concerned.  ""I was at my doctor’s appointment the other day — my doctor, who is unvaccinated and doesn’t believe in the vaccination,"" claimed one woman in a video on TikTok. ""He goes on to tell me that he received a letter — along with every other medical professional in the country — stating that they have to push the vaccine on every single one of their patients."" The video continues: ""It also said that they cannot give their patients informed consent, which is basically the process of a health care provider educating their patient on the possible risks, benefits or alternatives of said medication or procedure. So if he doesn’t push this vaccine on every single one of his patients and if he says anything bad about the vaccine, he is at risk of losing his medical license. How messed up is that s---?"" TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) The TikTok video seems to reference a warning to medical professionals from the Federation of State Medical Boards’ Board of Directors.   The federation is a nonprofit organization that ""supports America’s state medical boards in licensing, disciplining and regulating physicians and other healthcare professionals,"" according to its website.  The federation’s board issued a July 29 statement that reads in part: ""Physicians who generate and spread COVID-19 vaccine misinformation or disinformation are risking disciplinary action by state medical boards, including the suspension or revocation of their medical license."" ""Due to their specialized knowledge and training, licensed physicians possess a high degree of public trust and therefore have a powerful platform in society, whether they recognize it or not. They also have an ethical and professional responsibility to practice medicine in the best interests of their patients and must share information that is factual, scientifically grounded and consensus-driven for the betterment of public health."" The statement concludes by saying that spreading vaccine misinformation ""threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession,"" and ""puts all patients at risk."" In August, a Federation spokesperson said that the organization hadn’t yet defined ""misinformation"" or ""disinformation,"" but noted that an ethics committee was studying the issue and would offer more guidance in the future. ""We currently view misinformation as sharing or distributing verifiably false information,"" the spokesperson told Becker’s Hospital Review. ""We define disinformation as sharing or distributing information that the distributor knows is false."" The federation’s warning to doctors was issued ""in response to a dramatic increase in the dissemination of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and disinformation by physicians and other health care professionals on social media platforms, online and in the media,"" according to the Federation’s news release. It did not say that doctors must encourage patients to get vaccinated against COVID-19. In addition, the statement did not say anything about barring physicians from informing patients of the potential risks or side effects of the vaccines.  COVID-19 vaccine misinformation has been spread by health workers including doctors — often, without professional consequences. On multiple occasions, PolitiFact has debunked misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines that was shared by doctors, including Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and Dr. Joseph Mercola.  A TikTok video claimed doctors received a letter stating that if they ""say anything bad about the vaccine,"" they are at risk of losing their medical license. The claim is in reference to a statement the Federation of State Medical Boards’ Board of Directors sent to physicians on July 29. The warning did not say that doctors are required to promote the vaccine, and it did not prohibit medical professionals from talking with patients about possible side effects.  The statement warned doctors that those who spread vaccine misinformation could face professional consequences — including having their medical license revoked.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/sep/27/tiktok-posts/no-doctors-wont-lose-their-licenses-saying-anythin/

No evidence Maricopa County audit found 17,000 “duplicate” votes
","After five months, Florida-based firm Cyber Ninjas released results from its GOP-backed audit of ballots in Maricopa County, Ariz., and found no significant differences from the official vote count.  Nevertheless, in a presentation before the Arizona State Senate, officials involved with the audit put forth a wide range of unproven allegations about the election. Some of these allegations gave rise to claims on social media, which were presented without context as evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against Donald Trump.  ""The Arizona forensic audit found over 17,000 duplicates of votes,"" reads a Facebook post. ""The election must be decertified & people should be prosecuted."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim is wrong, even based on the audit’s own standards. The Maricopa County report didn’t find over 17,000 duplicate votes in the county’s files. Instead, it found 17,000 ""duplicate"" ballot envelope images, which are created during a routine election process called signature curing. Duplicate ballot envelope images don’t prove the existence of voter fraud in Maricopa County, said election experts and administrators.  The presence of these images ""is no proof of a Trump win,"" said Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and a Republican.  Here’s why the county had these duplicate images on file: Sometimes election workers receive a ballot envelope with a signature that raises questions. For example, it could have a blank signature line, or a signature that doesn’t closely resemble the one the county has on file. In this case, election workers are required by law to take a photo of this original, unopened envelope and then contact the voter who cast it to get a new signature. If the voter provides a valid signature, the county takes another image of the envelope. Only one vote is counted.  The presence of ""duplicate"" ballot envelope images in the county’s database does not prove that illegitimate votes were recorded during the 2020 presidential election, but that election workers were reaching out to voters with inconsistent signatures, said Megan Gilbertson, spokesperson for Maricopa elections.  ""The (presence of these duplicated envelopes) is normal and appropriate, and it’s a sign that our team is doing their job"" she said.  Some social media users have pointed to the fact that a number of duplicate images were created after the election as evidence of voter fraud. However, Arizona state law gives Maricopa County staff five business days after an election to contact voters with inconsistent signatures. As a result, said Gilbertson, there was a spike in duplicate envelopes after the election as workers contacted people who had cast their ballots on or shortly before Election Day.  ""We dedicated people to continue to call those voters ...  to try to cure their signatures,"" Gilbertson said.  Facebook posts claim that ""the Arizona forensic audit found over 17,000 duplicates of votes."" This is factually inaccurate. The highly contested audit found 17,000 images of ""duplicate"" ballot envelopes. Duplicate ballot envelopes are created when election officials contact voters with inconsistent or blank signatures to cure their signatures.  We rate the claim False.  ",/factchecks/2021/sep/27/facebook-posts/no-evidence-maricopa-county-audit-found-17000-dupl/

Rick Scott blames Democrats for expanding the debt. But it was a bipartisan feat
","The U.S. is again facing a reckoning on the size of the national debt, which is approaching its legal limit. Without an increase in the debt ceiling, the country will not be able to borrow money to cover its bills. That would affect Social Security recipients, veterans and the people, banks and foreign nations that hold U.S. Treasury bonds. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott said it should be up to Democrats to solve this problem on their own. ""We won’t vote to bail them out and cut them more blank checks to bury us in debt,"" Scott wrote Sept. 23 in the Orlando Sentinel. ""Democrats are responsible for the massive spending and debt growth, they alone need to take responsibility for raising the debt limit."" Are Democrats alone responsible for the growth in the debt? No. It has been a decades-long, bipartisan effort. The national debt is the accumulated total of all the money the government has borrowed over the decades to cover its deficits and fund its operations, but hasn’t yet paid back. With a temporary suspension of the debt ceiling having expired on Aug. 1, the U.S. is now subject to a $28.4 trillion cap on its debt load, unless Congress finds a way to agree on a new increase or suspension. The day President Joe Biden took office, the national debt stood at $27.7 trillion. Eight months later, it is approaching that $28.4 trillion limit. But Scott’s finger-pointing ignores how the debt got as big as it is. Thanks to spending for wars, crises and mandatory government programs, along with a series of tax cuts, the debt continued expanding throughout the post-World War II period, regardless of which party controlled the White House or Congress. In nominal dollars, since World War II, just over 60% of the growth in the debt took place under Republican presidents, and about 40% under Democratic presidents. Biden championed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act to help the country control and recover from the pandemic. Most of that spending takes place over two years, but it has already added to the running tally of the national debt. The bill passed without a single Republican vote. So that’s on the Democrats. Now, the Democrats are seeking to pass a measure that could spend trillions more on infrastructure and social programs. How much it would ultimately contribute to the debt depends on the tax increases in the final package. But since none of it has been enacted yet, it hasn’t added a penny to the debt. Scott didn’t mention the recent Republican record on adding to the debt, so we looked it up. What we found is that from the day President Donald Trump took office to his last day, the national debt grew $7.8 trillion. About half of that — $3.6 trillion — came from dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. That spending was backed by both Republicans and Democrats. It included the $2.1 trillion CARES Act, and another dose of relief of about $950 billion in late December 2020. Democrats and Republicans also approved spending bills that increased defense and social program spending. But a good chunk of the debt increase came from initiatives backed solely by Trump and the then-GOP-controlled Congress. The 2017 Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which slashed personal and corporate taxes, was supposed to spur enough economic growth to make up for lower tax rates. But after two years — even before the pandemic pummeled the economy — government revenues were down by about half a trillion dollars from what they would have been without the tax cuts. Not a single Democratic voted for that law, and among Republicans, only a dozen House members voted against it. All told, before the pandemic struck, the debt had increased $3.3 trillion on Trump’s watch. To be sure, no president has been totally responsible for the debt that accumulated during his administration. Congress writes the spending and tax bills that a president signs, and control of Congress has shifted back and forth between the parties for the past three decades. Plus, each president’s debt record reflects laws and spending plans passed before he took office. Major commitments, such as Social Security payments, shape the country’s fiscal picture regardless of who sits in the Oval Office. Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that promotes deficit reduction, said both parties own the current debt. ""It has been produced by Democrats and Republicans, on both a partisan and bipartisan basis,"" Goldwein said. We reached out to Scott’s office and didn’t hear back. Scott said that ""Democrats are responsible for the massive spending and debt growth."" The bottom line is both Democrats and Republicans are responsible for growth of the national debt. The debt grew by $7.8 trillion during the Trump years, in part because of bipartisan votes on COVID-19 relief and other spending, but also because of measures like the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which was backed only by Republicans.

Yes, the GOP-controlled Legislature has ‘refused to act on at least 150’ Evers’ appointees
","The political uproar over the state Natural Resources Board chairman who has refused to vacate his seat after his term expired in May has generated headlines as well as legal action. Frederick Prehn was appointed to the board in May 2015 by former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. Prehn’s refusal to step down -- coupled with the GOP-controlled Senate refusing to consider a replacement -- has effectively blocked an appointee of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers from assuming the seat. It is against this backdrop that Democratic lawmakers have railed against GOP inaction on Evers’ appointees.  ""We have a GOP-controlled legislature that is so power-hungry they are allowing the head of the Natural Resources Board to serve months after his term expired, and are refusing to vote on seating his replacement,"" state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, tweeted on Sept. 10, 2021. ""In  fact, they've refused to act on at least 150 Evers appointees."" Senate Republicans plan to take action Sept. 28, 2021 on two of Evers' cabinet appointees who have been waiting for a confirmation vote for nearly three years. The two, Department of Transportation Secretary Craig Thompson and Dawn Crim, who leads the Department of Safety and Professional Services, are part of a slate of 39 appointments Senate leaders plan to put to a vote on Tuesday when the Legislature convenes both houses.   The Natural Resources Board dustup has been well documented, with the latest development coming Sept. 17, 2021 when a Dane County judge dismissed an attempt by Attorney General Josh Kaul to remove Prehn from the Natural Resources Board.  But what about the second part of Larson’s statement? We’re well past the half-way mark of Evers’ term. Has the GOP-controlled Legislature has refused to act on at least 150 appointees? When asked for backup, Larson’s staff sent PolitiFact Wisconsin a list of appointments that had yet to be confirmed as of August 19, 2021. At that time, the list was 157 names long. Britt Cudaback, the governor’s communications director, provided the same list, and noted that many are high profile or cabinet-level positions. A selection includes: Joaquin Altoro, Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority executive director Dawn Crim, Department of Safety and Professional Services secretary  Missy Hughes, Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation secretary and CEO  Amy Pechacek, Department of Workforce Development secretary  Randy Romanski, Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection secretary  Craig Thompson, Wisconsin Department of Transportation secretary  Karen Timberlake, Department of Health Services secretary  Hector Colón, UW System Board of Regents  John Tate II, Parole Commission chair  Of course, the list also includes Sandra Dee Naas, the pick by Evers for the Natural Resources Board. The rest of the no-action list include appointees to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, Public Service Commission and a host of other boards, bodies and positions.  We checked with the non-partisan Legislative Reference Bureau, which as of Sept. 10, 2021, showed 163 appointments awaiting confirmation -- more even than Larson cited. The bureau told us it does not track statistics that would allow a comparison of the state of Evers’ appointees to other first-term governors. To be sure, in many cases the Evers appointees are functioning in their roles. For instance, department heads are in place and have the word ""acting"" or ""interim"" as part of their titles.  And Republicans have acted on many Evers 2021 appointments. The list of Evers’ 2021 appointees contains about 250 names. Republicans in the Senate have held off on confirming some Evers' appointments, in some cases creating political leverage because once cabinet secretaries are confirmed they cannot be removed by the Legislature.  Democratic State Sens. Tim Carpenter and Lena Taylor of Milwaukee and Janis Ringhand of Evansville have introduced a measure that would set deadlines for the Senate to act on nominations. A memo from the lawmakers, dated Sept. 8, 2021, notes: ""Of the appointments made by Governor Evers since January of 2019, more than 150 are still awaiting senate confirmation. Of those, 104 of them have waited longer than 100 days without confirmation. Several have not received confirmation since January 25th, 2019 — 957 days later.""  It calls the lack of action ""a dereliction"" of duties, and argues 100 days is ""more than enough time"" to consider and vote on appointments.  An analysis from Legislative Reference Bureau said current Senate rules require that nominations be referred to ""the standing committee that the (Senate) president considers the most appropriate committee to pass upon the qualifications of the candidate"" and that the committee ""must report its findings and recommendations to the Senate in writing.""  But no deadlines are specified. The proposal from the Democrats says an appointment must be referred to committee within 10 days, the committee must act within another 50 days, and the Senate must consider the matter within 40 days after that. Larson’s office said if the Senate doesn’t act, nothing will happen. Since it’s unclear in statute if the Legislature has any authority over Senate rules, the change Carpenter and others are proposing is simply a change in Senate rules, not state statute. So, the majority party, even if the rule change was passed, would still have control over what happens if Senate rules are violated.  Larson said the GOP-controlled Legislature has ""refused to act on at least 150"" appointees from Evers. He provided a list with 157 names. The Legislative Reference Bureau said a more updated tally put the number at 163.

The Trudeaus got their COVID-19 shots, despite claims to the contrary
","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie took their first doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on April 23 at a Rexall pharmacy on live television. Trudeau rolled up his sleeve, reached over to his wife and asked, ""Will you hold my hand?"" The pharmacist injected the dose through the skin of his left arm, at the site of his upper-arm tattoo. As she administers the shot, cameras can be heard clicking in the background. But a woman claiming to be a registered nurse said the Trudeaus’ shots were fake.  In a video shared across Facebook and on Rumble, the woman offered several reasons that the Trudeaus’ shots were ""obviously fake,"" including that the worker administering the shots used only one hand. ""Nobody does that. You don’t give IM injections that way,"" she said, using shorthand for intramuscular. She also suggested that perhaps the needle used was ""a retractable needle."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  While healthcare workers are trained to use two hands when delivering injections, use of one hand does not indicate a vaccine was faked. Additionally, retractable needles are used to help protect patients and health care workers from injury but they are still effective in delivering vaccines. ""The video with the Trudeaus is not a demonstration of the technique we use to train pharmacy personnel for immunizations, but it also does not necessarily disprove that the Trudeaus were vaccinated,"" a spokesperson for the American Pharmacists Association told PolitiFact.  PolitiFact also reached out to the Canadian Pharmacists Association, the Canada Nurses Association and the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario. We’ll update the article if we hear back. Typically, an intramuscular injection like the COVID-19 vaccine is administered with two hands — one hand is used to find the deltoid muscle while the other hand injects the shot into the muscle. The Canadian government’s Canadian Immunization Practices guidelines states that the skin on the arm ""should be stretched flat (between thumb and forefinger) at the time of administration.""  Despite the worker only using one hand, a close-up photo of the prime minister’s injection taken by photojournalist Blair Gable for Reuters shows that the needle went into the deltoid area of his arm. The woman narrating the video offered a news report from NBC 6 South Florida as evidence that medical workers give the COVID-19 vaccine with two hands rather than one. But that newscast was actually highlighting examples of the wrong way to give a vaccine. Many of the medical workers shown in the report were pinching and raising the skin while injecting the needles. During that report, neurologist Dr. Thomas Pitts told NBC 6 that this could lead the vaccine to go into a layer of fat and lose its effectiveness instead of being injected into the deltoid muscle. The narrator also said that the healthcare worker didn’t aspirate the injections for the Trudeaus, which means to pull back on the syringe plunger after inserting the needle into the arm to make sure the needle hasn’t punctured a blood vessel. According to the Immunization Action Coalition, which creates educational materials about vaccines for healthcare workers and the public in order to increase vaccine rates, aspirating is not necessary during an intramuscular injection.  Finally, the woman said the final tell was the Trudeaus’ bad acting. In particular, the woman said Trudeau didn’t hold his wife’s hand while he was getting his shot.  However, videos and photos show that this is false. When he tried to return the favor, Sophie Trudeau batted his hand away. She didn’t wait for a bandage after getting her vaccination, like the video points out — but that still doesn’t mean that she didn’t get vaccinated. Justin Trudeau returned to the same pharmacy on July 2 to get his second shot, this time the Moderna vaccine. The pharmacist used the same technique as before with only one hand.  PolitiFact reached out several times to the Canadian prime minister’s office, but did not receive a response for comment.    A video recorded by a woman describing herself as a registered nurse claims that Justin and Sophie Trudeau faked their COVID-19 vaccinations.  Although the technique used to give their vaccines is not common in the U.S., that doesn’t prove that the shots were fake. A close-up photo of Justin Trudeau’s vaccination shows the needle going into his arm.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/sep/24/facebook-posts/trudeaus-got-their-covid-19-shots/

Video clips take Biden’s 1994 ‘If Haiti just quietly sunk’ remark out of context
","As thousands of Haitian migrants massed at the Mexican border, trying to enter the United States through Del Rio, Texas, President Joe Biden took heat over his administration’s response. Video clips from a 1994 interview that are now circulating on social media portray Biden as not even caring about Haiti. The clips, from an interview with TV host Charlie Rose, were included in a Sept. 23 Instagram post that is labeled ""1994."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden was a senator from Delaware in 1994 and a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he later chaired. The clips from the interview seemed to suggest that Biden was callous, or even racist, in his views toward Haiti.  The clips are not altered, but they leave out much of the context of Biden’s remarks, which concerned the prospect of military intervention in Haiti. The video posted on Instagram pieces together three short snippets of the interview. As Biden speaks, his words also appear on the screen.  ""If Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot in terms of our interests,"" Biden, then a U.S. senator from Delaware, says in the first clip.  In the second clip, he says: ""A leading editor of a paper in the Delaware Valley wrote — asked their reporters to come down and talk to me and said, ‘Why is Biden so concerned about Bosnia and not about Haiti? Is it because Blacks are involved in Haiti? Blacks are what’s at stake in Haiti and in Bosnia they are European whites?’"" The third clip mostly repeats the first, as Biden says again: ""If Haiti — a God-awful thing to say — just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot in terms of our interests.""  The reference to Bosnia is a clue that the clips leave out the context of Biden’s remarks.  In September 1991, a military coup overthrew the government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the first popularly elected president in Haitian history. Three years later, responding to atrocities by the military regime, President Bill Clinton ordered an invasion of Haiti that successfully restored the Aristide government. Rose’s interview with Biden and then-U.S. Rep. Mike Castle took place seven days before the invasion. He opened by asking Biden: ""Is the United States going to invade Haiti, and is that a wise move?"" Biden replied: ""I don't know, and I think it's probably not wise."" Later, Rose asked whether Clinton would be weakened ""in the eyes of the world"" if Congress did not give Clinton the authority to invade Haiti. That’s when Biden replied with the remarks that are included in the Instagram post. He said: ""Charlie, it doesn't matter much anymore. The truth of the matter is, no one doubts our power. … The president of the United States could be turned down tomorrow on almost anything, and no nation in the world is going to say, ‘Aha, the United States is weak.’ No one is going to fool around with the 800-pound gorilla. ...  ""It used to be though if, when you had a situation where you had two competing superpowers, and we fail to enter into a circumstance where there was a third world country — where there was a competition for control of that country and a competition for them being in one camp or the other, then, it had consequences that were real.  ""Quite frankly, if we decided tomorrow to go into anywhere or not go into anywhere, it's not going to change the calculus of NATO; it's not going to change the calculus of the Russians; it's not going to change the calculus of the Chinese; and they're the things that matter to us.  ""The distinction between Bosnia and Haiti, for example: If  some of us are right on Bosnia, that this ethnic cleansing has the potential to rear its ugly head in Ukraine, in Belarus in the former Soviet Union, where they have major arsenals of nuclear weapons, where they have long histories of national wars, where ethnicity dominates, that is of phenomenal potential consequence to the United States. ""If Haiti — a God-awful thing to say — if Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn't matter a whole lot in terms of our interest."" Later in the interview, there was this exchange, in which Biden referred to Black people in Haiti and the political dynamics behind decisions to deploy U.S. troops abroad: Rose: ""But are you saying then that the president — the only reason that the president might be thinking about invading Haiti is because of politics?"" Biden: ""No. … Here, you have a different dynamic, a dynamic we're accustomed to over 200 years. You have a large group, a large constituency in the United States of America looks and says, ‘Now wait a minute. Y'all went into Grenada for 40, 100, 70, not 500 medical students. And here there are thousands of Blacks being persecuted, killed, death squads, and you're not doing anything.' Clearly, Haiti is no more or less in the interest of the United States than Grenada.  ""A leading editor of a paper in the Delaware Valley, asked their reporters to come down and talk to me and said, ‘Why is Biden so concerned about Bosnia, and not about Haiti? Is it because Blacks are involved in Haiti, Blacks are what are at stake in Haiti, and in Bosnia they are Europeans, whites?’  ""There is that notion abroad, in the Congress, in the country. It's not substantially different than when Lech Walesa came along and all the Poles in the state of Delaware and the United States of America focused, or when Israel is in trouble and the American Jewish community and those who believe strongly in Israel focus. Or — you can list, throughout our history, circumstances where our multi-ethnic community looks to things happening in a constituency that they are from, represent, or feel, having a stake in. …  But, there's a different political dynamic here, and that is that there is a large constituency in America that is saying, 'Hey wait a minute. Is the reason you're not paying attention over there because those folks are Black folks?’'' Rose: ""Right."" Biden: ""I think Somalia worked that way, don't you, Michael, I mean in terms of how people respond?"" Castle: ""I think so."" Video clips in an Instagram post said that Biden said: ""If Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot in terms of our interests."" The clip with that quote is used twice in the post, suggesting a callousness on Biden’s part toward Haiti.  The full context of his remarks shows Biden was discussing the rationale for a potential U.S. military intervention and arguing that there were greater U.S. interests elsewhere in the world, including in Bosnia. The post takes Biden’s remarks out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2021/sep/24/instagram-posts/video-clips-take-bidens-1994-if-haiti-just-quietly/
"['City Budget', 'New York', 'India Walton']","
Budget fluctuated for some city services, but no evidence of defunding
","Buffalo mayoral candidate India Walton said that under Mayor Byron Brown, the city has closed pools and defunded community centers as well as services for older and younger residents.  ""We’ve been defunding community centers, our pools were closed this summer, we’ve been defunding senior and youth services,"" Walton said at a debate with Brown on Sept. 9. We wondered if the city had, in fact, defunded community services since Brown took office in 2006 and closed pools this past summer.  We approached Walton’s campaign, which said that the city’s spending on critical services in the latest budget had not returned to prior levels.  The campaign analyzed budgets during Brown’s tenure and based its findings on budget figures that had been adjusted for inflation, according to campaign spokesman Jesse Myerson. In other words, did the funding in each area keep pace with inflation during Brown’s tenure?  For youth services, the Walton campaign’s analysis shows a 20 percent decrease in funding between 2017-18, the fiscal year when funding was highest - and 2021-22.  But from Brown’s first budget in 2006-07 to 2021-22, inflation-adjusted funding for youth services increased by 122 percent. The funding did not steadily increase throughout Brown’s tenure. As Walton’s campaign points out, the highest funding year was in 2017-18, and it has decreased by $678,492 since then.  For senior services, the Walton campaign says that funding decreased by 16 percent between the highest year total and now, when budget figures are adjusted for inflation.  But using the inflation-adjusted data from the Walton campaign, spending on senior services increased by 21 percent between Brown’s first budget and his 2021-22 budget. Spending in this category fluctuated over time, and the year with the highest appropriations in this category was in 2020-21.  For community centers, funding is difficult to discern for various reasons, Myerson said. But Myerson said some funding flows through the city’s parks and recreation facilities and activities budget, and in 2021-22, appropriations in this category are 6 percent less than they were in 2017-18, when funding was highest.  The parks and recreation budget remains higher in 2021-22 than in 2010-11, after the city took back control of city parks from Erie County.  The Brown administration said that since Brown took office, funding for community centers, pools, rinks, splash pads and senior and youth service programming has increased by millions of dollars.  Funding has not decreased in the city budget for two indoor pools and six youth-focused community centers, said Donna Estrich, commissioner of administration, finance, policy and urban affairs. Covid-19 closed facilities last year - not lack of funding.  The city did cut funding for outdoor pools, Estrich said, because the city anticipated that regular operations would not be feasible, both because of Covid-19 safety concerns and a national lifeguard shortage. The city reopened its indoor pools at varying capacities beginning in May, but has had trouble staffing them, despite a pay rate of $15 an hour, she said.  In July, well before their Sept. 9 debate, Brown proposed spending $20 million in American Rescue Plan stimulus funds for the renovation of four community centers. The Common Council approved the stimulus plan Aug. 26.  Walton said Brown defunded certain city services: community centers, youth and senior programs, and that he shut down pools. Her comments could give the impression that Brown has methodically cut funding in these areas to levels not seen since before he was in office, or that he has cut funding in one area to spend it on another. There have been some budget fluctuations over Brown’s tenure, including years when funding decreased, but even adjusted for inflation, spending in these categories is higher in the 2021-22 budget than when he took office.  It is true the city's outdoor pools were closed this past summer.  We rate this claim Mostly False, because while it contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.   ",/factchecks/2021/sep/24/india-walton/budget-fluctuations-some-city-services-no-evidence/

Yes, Republicans curbed Evers’ plan to raise taxes by $1 billion and inserted the tax-cut provision
","Although Wisconsin Republicans passed a two-year budget that included $2 billion in tax cuts, they were quick to pounce on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers when he signed the measure in July. The centerpiece of the $87.3 billion two-year spending plan was a reduction of the state’s third tax bracket to 5.3%, affecting about half of Wisconsin residents. At the time Evers signed the budget, he said it delivered on his campaign promise of a tax cut for middle-class families.  But GOP lawmakers weren’t happy with that characterization — because they’d written the tax cut-centered budget themselves, after throwing out Evers’ proposed version in the spring.  Ever’s proposed budget would have furthered several Democratic agenda items that Republicans have resisted, such as expanding Medicaid, legalizing marijuana, raising the minimum wage and repealing Act 10.  It also would have resulted in a net increase of $1 billion in taxes over two years, increasing taxes on businesses and the wealthy while providing tax breaks to the lower and middle classes.  State Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, wanted to remind Wisconsinites of that when she tweeted an Aug. 25, 2021 article from the libertarian think tank Illinois Policy. That piece pointed out that while other Midwestern states had used higher state revenues to deliver tax cuts, Illinois had not.  ""Just like Illinois’ governor, Wisconsin Governor Evers wanted to raise your taxes by $1 billion in a pandemic,"" Darling tweeted Aug. 31, 2021. ""Republicans stopped him and delivered the largest tax CUT in state history.""  Is Darling’s characterization of how it all happened right?  Let’s take a look at each segment of the claim.  As noted above, Darling is correct that Evers’s budget had included a net tax increase of $1 billion (albeit many would have received an individual cut).  The ""in a pandemic"" portion of the claim is crystal-clear: When Evers announced his budget, on Feb. 16, 2021, an average of 724 Wisconsinites per day were testing positive for COVID-19, according to data from the state health department. (That number is three times as high today, with an average of 2,110 new cases per day as of Sept. 17.) PolitiFact Wisconsin rated True a claim in April from a Republican state representative who said Evers’ budget would raise taxes by more than $1 billion.  A March 24, 2021 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau noted the governor’s budget changes would increase net taxes by nearly $465 million during fiscal year 2021-22 and nearly $556 million during fiscal year 2022-23.  And Republicans did, in fact, toss out his budget and write their own.  As for the last part of the claim, was this the largest tax cut in state history?  Darling spokesperson Bob Delaporte sent numbers from Legislative Fiscal Bureau tax and fee memos dating back to 1995, before which he said state budgets would not have had enough revenue to deliver more than a $2 billion tax cut.  Bob Lang, director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed that there has never been a legislative act that reduced revenues in dollar terms as much as the most recent budget had.  So Darling’s last point is on target, too.  But there’s one significant asterisk to the budget action, and the subsequent maneuvering for credit and blame: State officials found out in June — in the midst of the budget process — that Wisconsin would take in $4.4 billion more in additional tax collections than expected.  At the time it was announced, Lang said it was an unprecedented increase.  The state was able to take in so much more money because wages and consumer spending had been much higher than anticipated. Republicans immediately argued the money should be delivered back to residents in the form of a tax cut.  But without the windfall, the historic tax cut could have only come if there were massive cuts in spending. And had Evers had the unexpected billions available when he crafted his budget in January, he may not have sought to raise taxes in the first place.  Our ruling  Darling claimed that Wisconsin Republicans stopped Evers from raising taxes by $1 billion and instead gave residents the largest tax cut in the state’s history.  Evers did plan to raise taxes by $1 billion, although his plan would have included tax cuts for lower-income Wisconsinites. And Republicans did include the largest tax cut in history in their version of the budget that passed in July.  But that tax cut was made possible in large part by an unexpected $4.4 billion that came up in the middle of the process — money Evers didn’t have available to him when he wrote his budget.   A rating of Mostly True indicates that the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That fits here.     ",/factchecks/2021/sep/24/alberta-darling/yes-republicans-curbed-evers-plan-raise-taxes-1-bi/

There's no such thing as a “Liability Warning Acknowledgement Form” for COVID-19 vaccine mandates
","A Facebook post claims employees who get vaccinated against COVID-19 because of a workplace mandate can sue their employers if they experience an adverse reaction that prevents them from doing their job. The post is an image of text featuring a hypothetical discussion between a worker and their boss. Before getting a COVID-19 vaccination, the worker asks their boss to sign a ""Liability Warning Acknowledgement Form."" ""It’s a statement that says that if the shot you are forcing on us in order for me to earn a living does any harm to me, in any way, I or my family will sue you and the company,"" the worker says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Labor law experts told PolitiFact they have never heard of such a form, and couldn’t imagine any supervisor signing one if asked by an employee.  Employees can sue their employers — and have — over COVID-19 vaccine mandates. For example, several United Airline employees filed a class action lawsuit against the company claiming they were being discriminated against after requesting vaccination exemptions. But experts said they don’t know of any states where a ""liability warning acknowledgement form"" exists or, if it did, would be recognized in any legal capacity. ""Ordinarily, an employee injured in the scope of employment cannot sue the employer on any tort claim ,"" said Catherine Fisk, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. Tort refers to a legal filing outlining a person's perceived injury or harm by the party being sued. ""The only remedy is under the state workers’ compensation system,"" Fisk said. Workers’ compensation laws ensure employees get paid if they’re injured on the job, or that in work-related deaths, their families receive benefits. Before states started passing such laws in 1911, workers’ main recourse was to sue their employers, who usually won in court. If injured by the vaccine, an employee would have to make a workers’ compensation claim, and their workplace’s insurer would determine if the claim had merit and should be approved.  Although people have made reports to the federal government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System claiming instances of adverse reactions following a COVID-19 vaccine, researchers have yet to find definitive evidence that the vaccine causes serious injury. Fisk said it’s possible that states could decide to permit a form like the one described in the Facebook post, but doing so could open a can of worms and create an environment ripe for frivolous lawsuits.   ""Otherwise, employees could resist any distasteful aspect of a job by insisting the employer agree to be sued if the employee suffers any injury while performing it,"" Fisk said. Both Fisk and Boston University law professor Michael Harper said they have not heard of any cases where an employee has sued their company after reporting an adverse reaction following a COVID-19 vaccination. A Facebook post claims that a worker can compel their boss to sign a ""Liability Warning Acknowledgement Form"" that allows them to sue their company if they report an adverse reaction after getting the COVID-19 vaccine that prevents them from working.

Why Haitians are crossing into the U.S. in Texas, and not somewhere closer
","Thousands of Haitian migrants fleeing poverty have arrived in the border town of Del Rio, Texas, as they try to cross illegally into the United States. The images and news reports of migrants gathered under a border bridge are the latest immigration challenge facing the Biden administration. The reports have also prompted some social media users to raise questions about how Haitians ended up crossing into Texas, rather than Florida, which is much closer to Haiti. ""Am I the only one that wonders how 14,000 Haitians traveled 2,000 miles to end up under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas?"" stated one Facebook post showing a straight red line from Haiti, across the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to Texas. ""I doubt that they walked."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The short answer is that the Haitians did not come directly from Haiti to Texas. These migrants were traveling from South America, where they had lived in recent years. ""That’s why they have ended up in Texas, not Florida. They are coming from South American countries, through Central America and Mexico, and ultimately to the U.S.-Mexico border,"" said Jessica Bolter, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ""They walk this route, as well as take buses and sometimes other forms of land transportation."" Haiti has endured a series of tumultuous events in just the past few months, including a presidential assassination, tropical storms and an earthquake.  But the current migrations seen in Texas trace back to 2010, when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck the nation and destroyed large parts of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Estimates vary, but the earthquake is reported to have killed more than 200,000 people and displaced more than 1.3 million.  Many Haitians then traveled to South American countries, particularly Chile and Brazil, in search of jobs and a better life. The Brazilian government made humanitarian visas available to Haitians, and there was significant demand for construction workers leading up to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Once those jobs started to dry up, many Haitians moved on to Chile, Bolter said.  The Associated Press reported that about 150,000 Haitians went to Chile from 2014 to 2018 and found work as street vendors, janitors and construction workers.  However, since 2018, the Chilean government has made it more difficult for Haitians to get work visas. ""The cost of living in Chile is high, so it can be particularly difficult to get by with a poorly paying job,"" Bolter said. ""Many Haitians experience racial discrimination in jobs and housing in Chile as well. Haitians who stayed in Brazil have continued to struggle economically, and have also faced racial discrimination, as well as crime and insecurity.""  The COVID-19 pandemic made conditions worse for Haitian migrants.  When President Joe Biden took office, Bolter said, many migrants believed that it would be easier to get into the U.S. than under Trump, and were emboldened to travel north.  ""A lot of them came to Mexico with the hope of being able to live in Mexico,"" Jacqueline Charles, the Miami Herald’s Caribbean correspondent, told NPR’s ""All Things Considered."" ""But they've had a very difficult time getting work permits, finding jobs, even finding a place to live. And so this is a community that, you know, operates through word of mouth. So people started saying, hey, Ciudad Acuña is open. This port is open.""  Ciudad Acuña is the Mexican city across the Rio Grande from Del Rio, Texas. But it wasn’t true that the port of entry was open to Haitians. Biden renewed Temporary Protected Status for Haitians in the U.S. earlier this year. That status — which the Trump administration had revoked for Haitians in 2017 — allows migrants to stay in the U.S. when conditions in their home country prevent them from returning safely. But the Biden policy applies only to Haitians who were living in the U.S. as of July 29, not to those crossing the border now. Illegal border crossings by Haitian migrants are at a historic high, Bolter said. From October 2020 through August 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered Haitian migrants crossing the border illegally almost 28,000 times along the southwest border; 24,000 of those encounters took place in Texas.  While the federal government has not yet released data for September, news reports cited as many as 15,000 migrants waiting in Del Rio. The Department of Homeland Security told PolitiFact that from Sept. 19 to 21, officials sent 1,083 Haitians from Del Rio to Port-au-Prince. Most are being expelled under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Title 42 authority — a Trump policy designed to curb COVID-19 spread — the agency said Sept. 18 ""The Biden administration has reiterated that our borders are not open, and people should not make the dangerous journey,"" DHS said. ""Individuals and families are subject to border restrictions, including expulsion."" Biden has faced criticism from lawmakers in both parties for his administration’s actions on Haitians crossing the border illegally. Republicans say Biden has failed to secure the border while some Democrats have criticized the administration for continuing to use Title 42 to expel Haitians and the tactics used by some Border Patrol agents. Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas said he directed an immediate investigation of the actions by Border Patrol agents on horseback who were captured in photographs and on video blocking migrants from crossing the river.  A Facebook post suggests that Haitian migrants took an implausible route across the Gulf of Mexico to arrive at the Texas-Mexico border. The Haitians who are arriving in Texas did not take a direct route from Haiti. They are people who left their country following the 2010 earthquake and went to South America to find jobs in Brazil and Chile. When opportunities dried up in those countries and conditions worsened, they began traveling north through Latin America toward Mexico. We rate this statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2021/sep/23/facebook-posts/why-haitians-are-crossing-us-texas-and-not-somewhe/
